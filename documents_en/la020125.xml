<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for parallels in life can be tedious. Just the same, to
ignore them can be perilous.</LD>
<LD>   Not so long ago, we had abundant warnings about terrorism. You
could have listened to experts and known the name of our enemy, his
whereabouts and motives. You could have connected the dots from
earlier attacks and seen that more was coming. But, hey, we were busy
back then. Hardly anyone talked about the subject and fewer still
prepared.</LD>
<LD>   If you recall, we were consumed back then by more important
matters, such as the libido of one president and the campaign for
another. Now we're left mourning the dead, cleaning up the rubble and
kicking ourselves.</LD>
<TE>   The subject now on my mind suggests an eerie parallel. The
warnings are in front of our faces. We know our enemy's name. We can
connect the dots. What had been thought of, ho-hum, as a far-off
possibility is, unexpectedly, knocking at our door. Once again, we
are faced with when, not if.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, as soon as I describe this subject, I'm going to
lose a good share of this morning's readers. Because, hey, everyone's
busy. There's a war on. Consumers need cheering up. We've got more
elections around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, we are being advised that we won't be able
to clean up the rubble. Our military might and economic clout will do
us little good against this threat.</TE>
<TE>   If you take the word of our leading experts, and why not,
something awful is in the wind. And not enough people are talking
about it. Congress isn't lifting a hand to get us prepared. The
president has shrugged his shoulders. Yet our leading experts tell us
that a child starting grade school today may emerge from high school
in a world far bleaker than any created by terrorism. Middle-aged
Americans planning for their retirements may find their golden years
transformed by something more disturbing than numbers on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   You see, most of us were taught in school that nature takes her
sweet time here on planet Earth. Things happen gradually. We have
handy phrases like, "the pace of a glacier." So for most of 20 years,
we have regarded global climate change as evolutionary--just a few
degrees of temperature alteration spread over decades. Our political
discussions have proceeded at about the same pace.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, scientists have connected the dots that tell us
different. They've been studying cores from ancient ice sheets, the
annual record of our climate as laid down year by year.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent scientific evidence shows that major and widespread
climate changes have occurred with startling speed," concluded a
report last month by the National Research Council, an arm of the
National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if climate change were a light switch instead of a dimmer
dial," said Richard Alley, a Penn State University climate expert and
lead author of the report.</TE>
<TE>   In the Northern Hemisphere, half of the temperature change from
the last Ice Age to today occurred in just a decade. Add to that the
effects of atmospheric change from the industriousness of 6 billion
people, a potential trigger.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the headlines tell us to pay heed. A sampler of late:
Scientists Warn State to Get Ready for Drought; Fear Growing Over a
Sharp Climate Shift; Studies Point to Human Role in Global Warming;
Scientists Now Fear Abrupt Global Warming Changes.</TE>
<TE>   Here's one more: Warmer World Will Starve Many.</TE>
<TE>   Singularly, these stories are shocking. Cumulatively, well, reach
for the biggest, scariest word you can. This is the time to use it.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, climate change has been discussed chiefly as if it
were religion. You were a believer or you weren't. Science tells us
better. The history recorded in ice tells us the risks of passing
this problem to the future.</TE>
<TE>   Early societies endured climate change in prehistorical eras, that
much we know. But Sept. 11 reminded us that our modern lifelines are
extended and fragile. We can cushion the blow if we set out to,
perhaps. Or we can wait for the headlines: Bread Now $20 a Loaf;
Congress Opens Hearings.</TE>

<HD>Lindh: a Young Man Caught in Evil's Net</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL MORANTZ</AU>
<BD> Paul Morantz is a lawyer in Pacific Palisades who has
specialized in cult and brainwashing cases for 20 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a famous story by Stephen Vincent Benet, a young man is lured into
a pact with the devil, only to regret it later. It is left to the
great lawyer Daniel Webster to deliver a stirring speech that wins
sympathy from a jury of spirits, thus saving the young man's soul.</LD>
<LD>   And now we are faced with the image of a young American, John
Walker Lindh, willingly collaborating with the hated Taliban,
espousing beliefs alien to American culture and ideals.</LD>
<LD>   Are we to condemn this young man or extend him our sympathy? Is he
demon or victim?</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, anyone succumbing like this must, we assume, be weak,
evil, addled or all three. This lack of sympathy is rooted in the
belief that we cannot be "brainwashed" unless we want to be.</TE>
<TE>   The term "brainwashing" was invented by American journalist Edward
Hunter after a Chinese informant during the Korean War called the
process hsi nao, or "cleansing the mind." People subjected to it
function on their own and make their own choices. But choices are
based on beliefs. Change beliefs and you change choices.</TE>
<TE>   Americans got their first shocking glimpse of the process in 1953,
when military prisoners returning from the Korean War denounced our
country and spouted Communist doctrine; more than 20 of them had not
wanted to return. How could some of the country's finest military men
reject our culture and way of life? Something inexplicable had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, who studied the dynamics of brainwashing,
concluded that the key was to get someone to open up in a group where
his past life could be critiqued by others who were further along the
same conversion process. Lifton prophetically predicted that the
process causes such polarization as to lead to weeding out spies and
enemies and to "holy wars." The most vulnerable, often, were
teenagers and young adults whose identities were still taking shape,
who were still idealistic and emotionally polarized and who were
dissatisfied with large societies. All of which describe Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   History is full of examples of various kinds of brainwashing, from
the Inquisition to the Salem witch hunts to McCarthyism, the Manson
family, the People's Temple and the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Interestingly, Lifton found that brainwashing systems worked only as
long as victims remained subject to the environmental influence. Once
removed, a person usually self-deprogrammed within 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   One case in which a cult soldier received sympathy involved the
self-help drug rehabilitation program Synanon. Synanon grew out of
founder Charles E. Dederich's alcoholism. Dederich became a fanatical
believer in Alcoholics Anonymous. The insights he believed he gained
during a 1956 UCLA experiment on the effects of LSD on alcoholics
transformed his AA sermons into intricate psychological and
philosophical analyses. He developed his own following and started a
storefront club in seedy Ocean Park.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the process fascinated the media and politicians. One
congressman called Synanon the "miracle on the beach." Synanon grew
in wealth and political influence. But after Dederich moved his
operations to Northern California, he began subjecting followers to
48-hour "training sessions" designed to make the participants break
emotionally and see Synanon and Dederich as their savior.</TE>
<TE>   As the group grew more insular, it grew more violent. Dederich
converted his best men into "imperial marines" at an Al Qaeda-like
training camp, eventually dispatching them on coast-to-coast
"missions" against perceived enemies.</TE>
<TE>   That war brought them to my doorstep. In 1978, after I had
instituted litigation against Synanon, two of Dederich's followers
placed a rattlesnake in my mailbox. Only 11 vials of antivenin saved
my life. The police raided Dederich's commune, arrested the men and
retrieved a tape recording of Dederich bragging about past attacks
and plans for future ones. One of the men arrested, just 20 years
old, had been placed in Synanon at age 11 by his band-touring father.
At 18, he had volunteered for a vasectomy after Dederich decided
children interfered with Synanon's goals. I had no doubt this boy
would never have been convicted of a crime if he hadn't been placed
there. At my urging, he was sentenced to just one year in jail and
forbidden from associating with anyone from Synanon after he was
released. He went on to live a normal life.</TE>
<TE>   There are many stories of cults and mass deaths. David Koresh's
followers were persuaded to perish by fire, along with their
children, rather than surrender during the Waco shootout in 1993.
Heaven's Gate founder Marshall Applewhite persuaded followers to
submit to castration and ultimately to drink poison cocktails to
"shed their containers" and rendezvous with a UFO. The Aum Supreme
Truth sect in Japan in 1995 released sarin nerve gas in Tokyo's
subway, killing 12 and injuring thousands. And of course there is the
murder and mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, resulting in more than
900 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to death tolls, no one can match Hitler or Stalin,
who hooked the downtrodden with promises of greatness. We are all, to
some degree, vulnerable to committing horrible acts if we become
convinced of a justification. In a 1988 case involving the Rev. Sun
Myung Moon's Unification Church, in which I was appellate counsel,
the California Supreme Court recognized that thought reform,
brainwashing or coercive persuasion constituted outrageous conduct
and said that victims could sue for both compensatory and punitive
damages.</TE>
<TE>   So, should we show sympathy for Lindh? While it seems, from his
own words, that he aligned himself with Osama bin Laden, there is no
evidence that he attacked any American, although, in his presumed
state of mind, he may have done so in defense of his new Taliban
"family."</TE>
<TE>   But it is also likely that, like the lost victims of other
demagogues, he would never have gotten in harm's way had he not been
manipulated by evil people.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Is Not Just a Numbers Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY V. SVORNY</AU>
<BD>Shirley V. Svorny teaches economics at California
State University at Northridge, and is a contributing author of
"American Health Care: Government, Market Processes and the Public
Interest" (Independent Institute, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Searching for something on which to base his reelection campaign,
Gov. Gray Davis has chosen to pose as a champion of health care, with
a proposal to mandate increased nurse-patient ratios across the
state.</LD>
<LD>   Although his plan will win votes, it won't improve health care.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' plan presumes that hospitals are not concerned with caring
for their patients and saving lives; that they are not working to get
the best outcomes, given what people are willing to pay for health
care. A mandate that forces hospitals to use more nurses will result
in worse care, as hospitals cut back on other important needs.</LD>
<TE>   Health care is inherently risky. The concern that the nurses and
their union representatives express about the chances of bad outcomes
under current conditions is warranted. Mandating nurse-patient ratios
may seem an obvious solution, but it could have unintended
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   As health care costs rise in the state as a result of mandated
nurse-patient ratios, some employers could decide that it is not
worth it to offer health benefits to their employees. The number of
people who go without health insurance would increase.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, patients would be better served if hospitals spent more money
on nursing and other health care providers, updated technology and
supplies. Increasing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates would
go a long way toward improving care in this country. But don't tell
hospitals how to use the money, how many nurses to hire or how many
sponges to use.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that government can tell hospital administrators how many
nurses per patient they should have makes about as much sense as
telling auto manufacturers how much steel should go in their cars.
The right amount depends on the value of steel in production and its
relative price. Both things change over time, and mandated production
methods limit flexibility, preclude efficient production and result
in fewer desired outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Under Davis' plan, hospital administrators would be constrained.
It calls for one nurse to every five patients recovering from surgery
or serious illness. Emergency room nurses would be limited to one
trauma patient, nurses in pediatric wards to four patients and
obstetrics nurses to two women in labor.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps buying new equipment would be a better use of hospital
funds to enhance patient safety, but mandated nurse-patient ratios
would force hospital administrators to put money in nurses, first and
foremost.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever government tries to dictate outcomes, the results are bad
news.</TE>
<TE>   If California moves forward with nurse-patient ratios, it will
repeat the mistake it made in education, when it mandated class-size
reduction in grades kindergarten through third. Class-size reduction
had the same objective: to improve outcomes. Yet the reduction has
led to a teacher shortage, forcing districts to hire warm bodies with
little to no experience in the classroom. These teachers tend to work
in the least desirable, most difficult-to-teach classes, in schools
shunned by teachers with seniority. Some inner-city schools have 40%
of their teachers on emergency credentials. Class-size reduction is
great for the rich, bad for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing nurse-patient ratios would have a similar result.
Hospitals in affluent areas would hire more nurses, drawing the best
nurses from other, less desirable work environments. Staffing in
county hospitals always has been troublesome. With mandated
nurse-patient ratios, conditions would deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis has his way, you will see more nurses in hospitals. You
may even feel you are getting better care. But what you don't buy in
the way of services may kill you.</TE>

<HD>Escaping the Past</HD>
<DH>Present-day China makes it to the screen in 'Bicycle.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last decade the most celebrated Chinese films, such as "Raise
the Red Lantern" and "Farewell My Concubine," have taken place
largely in the past--in the Old China.</LD>
<LD>   The 35-year-old filmmaker Wang Xiaoshuai understands why noted
directors Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige set their films then. Though
they are only a decade older than he is, he says they have the
perspective of a previous generation.</LD>
<LD>   "They had a different experience of life, they lived through the
Cultural Revolution," Wang says. "They felt obliged to reflect on
that period and perhaps search for answers by looking through
traditional culture."</LD>
<TE>   Wang, whose "Beijing Bicycle" opens today, doesn't feel that
burden. Instead, he says, "What I feel lacking are films that face
modern-day reality with a critical eye. The world of today interests
me, and I like discovering a new sound."</TE>
<TE>   "Beijing Bicycle," being released by Sony Pictures Classics,
rather unsentimentally shows a city undergoing rapid economic
development and the resulting clash between country and city,
tradition and modernity.</TE>
<TE>   In this congested new Beijing, individuals are often pitted
against one another to earn a living, to attain social status, to win
love--and sometimes the worst of their nature surfaces. It's not a
pretty picture, although Wang sees the humor in the contradictions
and the foibles of people's predicaments.</TE>
<TE>   The director, who co-wrote the screenplay, started by asking
himself some basic questions. "So many country folk come to the big
city to find work--how do they get by?" says Wang, who made a quick
trip to Los Angeles recently. A short, slightly pudgy man, he speaks
in Mandarin in a brisk manner. "And like others, would they also
encounter the temptations of youth?"</TE>
<TE>   The hero of his film is a simple country lad, Guei (Cui Lin), who
is newly arrived in Beijing. Guei lands a dream job as a delivery
boy, a job that comes with a handsome new mountain bike. This vehicle
not only provides a means of transportation and employment, it also
signifies his elevated status in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But the bike is soon stolen. Guei loses his job and nearly his
mind, then stubbornly launches a day-and-night search for it.
Miraculously, he tracks it down in the hands of a slick city boy,
Jian (Li Bin), who claims he bought it second hand. For Jian, the
bicycle provides status as well--the ability to join his friends in
after-school wheely stunts and to show off to a would-be
girlfriend--so he's not letting it go easily.</TE>
<TE>   Modern-Day Urban Themes</TE>
<TE>   Materialism in a world where goods are suddenly available is a key
theme in "Beijing Bicycle," as is the rebellion of youth. At one
point hot-tempered Jian has a shouting match with his father about
the elder's inability to keep promises.</TE>
<TE>   Guei is undergoing his own transformation, too, Wang points out.
"The country boy isn't able to articulate these kinds of thoughts,
but he's also tough," he says. "When he's told not to come back to
the company, he comes back anyway. He's in a kind of rebellion
against the absolute obedience that was demanded in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Wang himself is clearly not one who follows the rules. Born in
Shanghai, he grew up in Guizhou, the poorest province in China,
because his mother's factory was relocated there. (His father was a
director in the local opera troupe.) Later he moved to Beijing, so he
knows firsthand what it is like to go from country to city, to be an
outsider.</TE>
<TE>   After a stint in art school, he attended the Beijing Film Academy,
the chief training ground for filmmakers in China, in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Assigned to the Fujian Film Studio in the south, he begrudgingly
worked there two years-- "It was a very backward place," he says with
a sniff--before making his way back to Beijing, jobless but
determined to make his own films.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where my friends are, that's what I'm familiar with," he
explains. "And after all, Beijing is the cultural center of the
nation."</TE>
<TE>   Living out of suitcases, he eventually put together his first two
features, semi-docudramas featuring his artist friends, "The Days"
and "Frozen." In 1995 he finally made a film with the Beijing Film
Studio, "So Close to Paradise," about two country buddies who try to
make it in the big city, this time, Wuhan. One of them has become a
small-time hood, and the film touches on the burgeoning presence of
gangsters, gambling and prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   No Release in His Own Country</TE>
<TE>   As a result, "So Close" spent three years in the government's
censorship mill, finally getting the stamp of approval after a number
of cuts were made. To this day Wang is uncertain whether the film
ever saw commercial release--his first two films did not.</TE>
<TE>   There are certainly plenty of filmmakers in China making
contemporary comedies and dramas, but most of these are commercial
fluff unlikely to provide fare for art-house cinemas, where most
foreign-language films are shown. Then there is the handful of
independent filmmakers unattached to official film studios who make
films on their own, often with foreign funding.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang Yuan is perhaps the best known of these independent "bad
boys" known for "Mama," a docudrama about a mother nursing an
autistic child, and "East Palace West Palace," about an encounter
between a gay man and a policeman. . These have been widely shown
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if not for foreign distributors and film festivals, Wang
would hardly be able to sustain his career. "Beijing Bicycle" was
made outside China's studio system. Produced by a Taiwan-based
company, Arc Light Films, it is part the company's "Tale of Three
Cities" project. The plan is to make a series of six films about
contemporary life in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, says company
founder Peggy Chiao.</TE>
<TE>   Two of them--"Beijing Bicycle" and "Betelnut Beauty"--were
unveiled in Berlin last February, and another, "Blue Gate Crossing,"
is in the can. By Western standards, each film is
low-budgeted--around $1 million--and they have assembled funding
through loans and a French co-producer.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the films share the theme of how Chinese society is
changing, especially among the younger generation without the
historical burden of the past generation," Chiao explains, speaking
of the group of filmmakers known as the Fifth Generation, the first
to graduate from the Beijing Film Academy after the Cultural
Revolution. Its ranks include Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou and Tian
Zhuangzhuang.</TE>
<TE>   Films by its members include Zhang Yimou's "Ju Dou" (1990) or
"Raise the Red Lantern" and Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine,"
which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1993. They were set in a China
before World War II and before Communism partly to avoid censorship,
and when these filmmakers ventured closer to current events--such as
Chen's depiction of the persecution of actors during the Cultural
Revolution in "Farewell My Concubine"--they face recriminations from
government authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zhang has made films about contemporary life, "The Story
of Qiu Ju" (1992) and "Keep Cool" (1997), these are lesser known.
Chen has made only one film set in postwar China, "The Big Parade,"
and it is rarely seen, although he has just completed a film set in
modern-day London ("Killing Me Softly").</TE>
<TE>   Worker Migration to the Big City</TE>
<TE>   Wang wants to make film about contemporary life, and for him, the
streaming of the Chinese population from countryside to the city was
an inevitable subject.</TE>
<TE>   The migration from Chinese countryside to the city is still
considerable, Wang says. "If you just look on the streets, it's
filled with outsiders," Wang says. . It's not entirely negative.
"Beijing needs labor, and country labor is cheap. For the country
folk, it's already better than the lives they led back home, so they
stay on."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, this kind of growth has created vastly disparate
standards of living. "Economic development has been so unbalanced,"
Wang says, "so some people are having harsh lives, others better
ones."</TE>
<TE>   "Beijing Bicycle" has won Wang his greatest accolade thus far: the
Silver Bear for second place at the 2001 Berlin Film Festival, as
well as an award for "best newcomers" for its two young stars, Cui
Lin and Li Bin.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the film has not been shown in China, as it, too, has been
bogged down in censorship. "We submitted it two months [in advance of
the Berlin Film Festival], but we didn't hear anything from them, so
we just proceeded to Berlin." No news yet, but he admits he isn't
actively pressing the case.</TE>
<TE>   He regrets that his films don't get shown in his own country. "We
don't make our films for Westerners," he says, "but they welcome
them, so we often show them abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he has a bicycle, he says that everyone in China does. In
the past, he explains, a bicycle was one of the "Big Four" must-haves
of a Chinese family--along with a watch, a sewing machine and a
radio.</TE>
<TE>   Does he still use it? "Oh, no, I have a car now," he says, adding
that the car is now a must-have in China. Then he adds with a wedge
of irony, "We've joined the car-owning class--that's a term in China
now, the car-owning class."</TE>

<HD>When Characters and Camera Are Flawed</HD>
<DH>In 'Storytelling,' filmmaker Todd Solondz returns to
suburbia for a virtuosic look at the limits of humanity and fiction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "Storytelling," Todd Solondz continues his acidly funny
exploration of the darker side of life in the suburbs of New Jersey
that began with "Welcome to the Dollhouse" (1996) and "Happiness"
(1998). This time he also probes the ambiguous, paradoxical nature of
filmmaking in its relationship to fictional and documental narrative.
Solondz contemplates the awesome capacities of the motion picture
camera, which can exploit and distort the reality that it can record
or simulate with precision. Beyond this, Solondz suggests that the
limitless possibilities of the camera inevitably connect fatefully
with the very human limitations of the filmmaker, including himself.</LD>
<LD>   As for how all this speculative subtext applies to Solondz and
"Storytelling," let it be said that while playing all his cards face
up he conflates the fictional and the documental with a bravura that
enriches his film's meanings and endows it with a level of humanity
that sustains his caustic view of human behavior. None of this
intellectualizing is necessary to the simple enjoyment of
"Storytelling"--provided the viewer has a taste for the pitch-black
humor that emerges when Solondz's camera becomes a veritable
blowtorch aimed at humanity's myriad failings.</LD>
<LD>   "Storytelling" is divided into two parts: a curtain-raiser set
circa 1985 and called "Fiction," and "Nonfiction," set in the
present.</LD>
<TE>   "Fiction" takes its title from a college course conducted by a Mr.
Scott (Robert Wisdom), an imposing African American who has won a
Pulitzer Prize for his book "A Sunday Lynching."</TE>
<TE>   He is a man of seething rage, which he controls with the same
rigor with which he judges his students' work. In the class are
Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick), who's afflicted with cerebral palsy and who
is enmeshed in a rocky affair with Vi (Selma Blair), who had hoped
that Marcus' condition would set him apart from most of the jerks
she's dated. The interplay among these three, and a third student,
Catherine (Aleksa Palladino), whose assessments of her fellow
students' work is as withering as those of their professor, becomes
scabrously funny. This vignette is a cautionary tale of the perils of
overly autobiographical fiction, and of naivete, sexual and
otherwise. It is also a commentary on how racism can cut both ways.</TE>
<TE>   In what may be the film's key remark, the taciturn Mr. Scott tells
his class that all writing is fiction. It's an observation that
applies to Part 2, "Nonfiction," in the sense that it might have been
helpful, to say the least, if fledgling documentarian Toby Oxman
(Paul Giamatti) had pondered the possibility that at some level all
filmmaking is fictional, no matter how strenuously the documentary
maker strives for objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   Toby is a nerdy guy in his 30s who in high school had fantasies of
movie stardom, followed by dreams of becoming a novelist. Now this
Manhattan shoe store salesman has decided that becoming a documentary
filmmaker may be more within his reach.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with banal preconceptions and a video cameraman (Mike
Schank), Toby descends on his old high school with a vague idea of
concentrating on the challenge of getting into college. He ends up
focusing on Scooby Livingston (Mark Webber), a disaffected senior who
knows only that he doesn't want to go to college but does want to
become famous, perhaps as a talk show host like his idol, Conan
O'Brien. Dinnertime at the Livingstone home, a spacious, modern
structure, is a terrifically tense business.</TE>
<TE>   Scooby is a sullen vegetarian eternally at odds with his father,
Marty (John Goodman), a chronically irate bully. His vapid mother,
Fern (Julie Hagerty), is forever trying to smooth things over; his
younger jock brother, Brady (Noah Fleiss), has to cope with his older
brother's negative, possibly gay, image at school; and his youngest
brother, Mikey (Jonathan Osser), an obnoxiously smug and precocious
fifth-grader, hungers for his parents' love.</TE>
<TE>   It is the luckless fate of Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, peerless as
always), an El Salvador immigrant, to be the Livingstons'
conscientious live-in housekeeper. Steve Railsback is the high school
principal whose lack of interest in Toby's project is total, and
Franka Potente is Toby's unimpressed editor.</TE>
<TE>   There is much that is funny, much that is terrible and much that
becomes terribly funny about this wealthy household, its heart and
soul shriveling in its privileged insularity. This sequence and
therefore the film build to a climactic sequence that in playing
against expectations attests to the boldness and skill of Solondz and
his ace cinematographer, Frederick Elmes, an indie cinema maestro
whose credits reach all the way back to David Lynch's bizarre debut
feature, "Eraserhead."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "Storytelling" is a virtuoso work in every aspect in which
Solondz shakes a fist at the inescapability of human limitations
colliding with the perversity of fate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual content, language and some drug
use. Times guidelines: The film is strictly for sophisticated adult
audiences.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Gallery Bets on a Calder Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA SNEDEKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Alexander Calder's family never dreamed that one day his mobiles,
stabiles and wire sculptures would be displayed on the Las Vegas
Strip, but they aren't disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's great that the exhibit's next to a craps table and
down the hall from a wedding chapel," said Alexander Rower, Calder's
grandson and director of the Calder Foundation. "Art can be
intimidating. Calder's work belongs to everybody, not just art
historians."</LD>
<LD>   The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art will open Calder's "The Art of
Invention" to the public today after postponing the show in October
because of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   One reason the foundation and Calder's family members agreed to
lend some personal pieces to the exhibition--the "Rat" usually sits
on Rower's mother's coffee table--was a belief that an art gallery in
a Las Vegas resort would attract a different audience, Rower said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really democratic audience," he said. "I want people to
see the works."</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces that are rarely seen publicly are the 1948 "Roxbury
Fish," a hanging mobile made with wire, string, glass and ceramic
fragments, and the 1950 "Panama," a hanging mobile with a 17-foot
span that was commissioned for a hotel lobby in Panama, Rower said.
Both will be exhibited for the first time in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit will be on display daily through July 24 under the
direction of PaperBall, which now manages Bellagio's gallery.
PaperBall is a division of PaceWildenstein, a New York-based modern
and contemporary art gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Organized with the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation of New
York, the retrospective features Calder's work from 1926 to 1976, and
includes toys, jewelry and household objects.</TE>
<TE>   Considered one of the great American sculptors of the 20th
century, Calder began his career joining lengths of wire, instead of
carving marble. By the 1930s, Calder had invented a new art form: the
"mobile," which typically consists of a number of loosely connected
pieces that move in response to air movement.</TE>
<TE>   An inventor since childhood, the Philadelphia-born Calder made
more than 19,000 objects during his 60-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The show also marks the unveiling of the Bellagio's renovated
2,600-square-foot gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had a sculptor in the past, and this is the first
time the gallery has done a show devoted to one artist," said Andrea
Bundonis, PaperBall president.</TE>

<HD>After Reshaping Talk Station, He's Moving On</HD>
<DH>KFI program director David Hall took the familiar format
beyond the headlines to a more mixed style of show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk radio listeners may know him only as a character on the Phil
Hendrie show--maybe a real person, maybe not--who provides a regular
foil for the outrageous host. But few probably know how much David
Hall has shaped what they're hearing.</LD>
<LD>   After 11 years as program director at KFI-AM (640) in Los Angeles,
Hall is moving up the ladder of the station's parent company, Clear
Channel Communications, shifting next month to oversee some of the
company's nationally syndicated talk and sports programming. But the
past decade has been one in which both Hall and events have changed
talk radio here and around the country.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very different now, compared to what it was 10 years ago,"
Hall said. "We kind of redefined what talk radio is all about. It
seemed talk radio should be a mix of what's very entertaining and
very informative. We also made a pretty big change in thinking what
information should be."</LD>
<TE>   When he started, Hall, 37, said his image of a talk radio host was
a middle-aged guy peering over half-glasses at a stack of newspapers.
He sought to change that, and instead of just the headlines, he
wanted topics on shows to include universal truths and experiences
that would resonate with listeners.</TE>
<TE>   So Bill Handel's KFI morning show tries to give commuters a full
dose of information and insight on the hot topic du jour: Rodney
King, O.J. Simpson, the latest earthquake, the Raiders, Monica
Lewinsky, terrorism, Enron.</TE>
<TE>   By changing the presentation, Hall was looking to reach an
audience different from the stereotypical talk radio listener.</TE>
<TE>   "I always pictured guys in jumpsuits and comfortable shoes
listening in their garages," he said. "We're not like that. We're
younger and more female. That's a pretty concerted effort we've had
over the past decade to be different."</TE>
<TE>   The effort seems to have worked. When Hall arrived at KFI as news
director in 1989, the station's ratings barely registered--about 0.7%
of the listening audience. According to the most recent Arbitron
ratings of listeners age 12 and older, during the fourth quarter of
2001, KFI was the fourth-most-listened to station in the area, with a
4.2% audience share. "David has been so tremendously successful at
KFI, I'll just try not to screw it up," said Hall's replacement,
Robin Bertolucci, who  oversees a trio of talk and sports stations in
Denver. "He's invented and created a lot of the personality at the
station. He really built KFI. He turned that whole paradigm on its
head, filling a void the other stations didn't know existed."</TE>
<TE>   "People have tried to get me to say bad things about him, but I
don't have anything bad to say," said Erik Braverman, who programs
KFI's archrival in the talk business, KABC-AM (790). "When he got the
job of program director he inherited some great talent. But it lacked
focus and direction, and David brought that.... Even with all that
[on-air] talent, he's the heart and soul of the station."</TE>
<TE>   Hall says his thoughts about diversifying talk radio with a
combination of perspective and news were borne out after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. In other markets, listeners sought out all-news
stations, he noted, while ratings in Los Angeles showed KFI and KABC
at fourth and 12th in the market, respectively, beating out AM
all-news outlets KNX (1070) and KFWB (980), which were 16th and 20th.</TE>
<TE>   "After the World Trade Center, people didn't care about other
people's opinions, they wanted information; 9/11 shows that talk
radio is pretty well-rounded, and giving people what they want, when
they want it," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   A key for KFI has clearly been nationally syndicated conservative
host Rush Limbaugh. In the talk era before Limbaugh, Hall said,
"everyone tried to be reasonable, tried hard not to ruffle feathers.
Rush started ruffling feathers and got huge ratings for it. A lot of
people who had been in talk radio for a long time thought it was a
flash in the pan."</TE>
<TE>   Hall has known Limbaugh since they worked together in the late
1980s at KFBK in Sacramento, where Limbaugh got his start. KFI was
one of the first big-market stations to carry Limbaugh's show, and
Hendrie, John &amp; Ken and Dr. Laura Schlessinger all became syndicated
after laying foundations at the Los Angeles station. Among his
earliest changes, Hall moved Schlessinger from a late-night weekend
shift to midday weekdays, and worked to differentiate her from the
pack of on-air therapists.</TE>
<TE>   Hall also brought Hendrie from Miami, where he went after an
earlier stint at KFI. In return, Hendrie added "David G. Hall" to the
cast of characters he voices during his frenetic, four-hour show,
portraying Hall as a scratchy-voiced "vice president of syndication"
forever complaining about the style of the show, encouraging Hendrie
to cater to spurious advertisers and making impolitic comments about
women or ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil Hendrie, he's just a trip," Bertolucci said. "I don't want
to be the next David Hall character."</TE>
<TE>   Not every move was a home run, including the acrimonious departure
of Tom Leykis in 1992 after a contract dispute. Hall also programs
Clear Channel's other Los Angeles-area AM properties, sports station
KXTA (1150) and talk station KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Despite his relative youth, Hall has already logged a
quarter-century in the radio business. "I knew I wanted to be in
radio from about the time I was 9," he said. At the age of 12, he
lied about his age and secured an internship at the local Top 40
station in his hometown of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Hall soon learned just about every job at the station, working the
control boards when deejays left to meet groupies, and answering
request lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I was, this seventh-grader from Catholic school, and every
day after school I was talking on the phone with 16-year-old girls,"
he said. "It's still the best job I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   After getting his chance on air ("All I wanted for years was to be
a big deejay; I finally got the chance, and I was just awful," he
said), Hall became a news reporter at Sacramento station KFBK,
winning awards for his coverage from Mexico, Nicaragua and elsewhere.
He was named news director there before leaving in 1989 to take the
same job at KFI. Two years later he was promoted to program director,
when the then-struggling station just started carrying Limbaugh.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no ratings," Hall said. "We had nothing to lose."</TE>

<HD>Peggy Lee Did Do Right by Her Material</HD>
<DH>The late singer always managed to find her way to the
heart of a song despite her many personal trials and tribulations.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to believe it's been more than 15 years since I visited
Peggy Lee in her hilly Bel-Air estate. Searching for an update on a
legendary artist whose widespread public visibility was beginning to
diminish, I spent an intriguing afternoon with a woman who, then in
her mid-60s, was plagued by heart problems (she had double bypass
surgery in 1985) and a variety of serious health concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Yet her skin seemed as milky clear as it did in the clips from the
film "Pete Kelly's Blues" and, earlier, in the black-and-white videos
of her performances with the Benny Goodman band. She looked more
slender than she had in years, showing no signs of the physical
problems that had plagued her for most of her adult life.</LD>
<LD>   Above all, Lee's voice still resonated with the throaty sensuality
that made her recordings so instantly recognizable.</LD>
<TE>   Despite her open willingness to speak freely about almost any area
of her complex life story, however, there was a diva-like reserve
about Lee, an invisible but palpable aura clearly defining and
protecting the inner fires that kept her star power burning. It
wasn't a "Sunset Boulevard" experience by any means, but there was
never any doubt that I was in the presence of someone with a clear
understanding of her magnitude in the entertainment firmament.</TE>
<TE>   I'd seen Lee several times before that, reviewing her at
Manhattan's Cafe Rouge for the New York Times in the '70s and later,
in the mid-'90s, at the Hollywood Bowl for the Los Angeles Times. But
I did not experience her--other than via her recordings--during the
years with Goodman or the '50s successes with "Black Coffee," "Fever"
and "Lover." Still, given the reference points I had, I left that
mid-'80s conversation with the distinct feeling that Lee still
possessed all the fundamental physical capacity to continue singing
at her usual high creative level.</TE>
<TE>   But I also was vexed by something far less apparent. A sense that
some drive, some inner urge was missing. A sense that the many
illnesses, some chronic, some the result of frightening accidents
(she experienced a near-fatal fall in 1976 in New York and another in
Las Vegas in the '80s); the failure of her Broadway musical, "Peg,"
in 1983 after only 18 performances; her four failed marriages; had
all combined to create a cumulative weight difficult for anyone to
carry. And an especially troublesome burden to sustain while trying
to find new inspiration in the hit songs that her public wanted to
hear, over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the ambivalence of my reaction to Lee was
affirmed over the next few years. Performances in the late '80s and
beyond--even when she was obliged to take the stage in a
wheelchair--revealed that much of the Lee magic remained intact. But
her health problems increased into the '90s, including a debilitating
stroke in 1998. She died Monday night at her home in Bel-Air. She was
81.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, the mid-'80s seemed to be her turning point, the
time when the balance between her capacity to perform at peak level
and the impairments of her physical problems began to shift toward
the latter. In the 40-plus years before the mid-'80s, however, Lee's
talent was always in the preeminent position, even during the many
physical and emotional distractions that plagued her life from the
very beginning.</TE>
<TE>   The Diana Krall Connection Is Apt</TE>
<TE>   Most of the obituaries have emphasized the sultry sensuality of
her voice. And there's no denying the irresistible appeal of her
sound. But too little attention was devoted to three other
significant aspects of her art: the quality of her phrasing; her
capacity to pinpoint the emotional center of a song; and her subtle
sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Krall has often been compared to Lee, with justification.
The usual correlation centers on the obvious--that both are knockout
blonds with the simmering capacity to entice listeners into the web
of their performances. Less mentioned has been the musicality they
share, especially in their phrasing. Lee was not the instrumentalist
that Krall is. But her intuitiveness, present not only in her
sensitive interpretations but also in the phrasing of her many hit
song lyrics, was the product of a similarly inventive imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Krall are also similar in the sense that both place the
verbal accuracy of their phrasing front and center, resisting, as so
many singers fail to do, the temptation to distort the meaning of
line in order to hold an attractive note.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the story at the heart of a song has not always been a
common attribute among jazz singers--even among some of the finest
jazz singers. And it took a while before Lee gathered sufficient life
experience to lead her fully into the depths of interpretation. But
once she did, the results were extraordinary. A few of the many
examples: the dark intensity of "Don't Smoke in Bed"; the soaring,
rhythmic passion of "Lover"; the world-weary ennui of "Is That All
There Is?"</TE>
<TE>   Regarding her sense of swing, some observers have been loath to
even categorize Lee as a jazz singer, preferring to describe her as
someone who performed in jazz settings, or who occasionally phrased
with jazz-like emphasis. Obviously, the great diversity of her
career, combined with her own creative eclecticism, led her through
virtually every aspect of popular music, from big bands to small
groups, from pop songs to jazz ballads, from television variety shows
to songwriting for films. Much of it didn't call for anything
relating to jazz. But when it did, Lee was ready.</TE>
<TE>   As early as the '40s, her rendering of "Why Don't You Do Right"
with the Benny Goodman band flowed with an easygoing, confident sense
of rhythm. On novelty tunes such as "Fever" and "Manana," Lee
transformed relatively simple lines and phrases into jaunty, upbeat
rhythmic excursions, and did so without losing either the sensuality
or the humor of the words.</TE>
<TE>   When she was working in jazz settings--occasional outings with big
bands, a concert recording with George Shearing--her brightly
swinging style, skimming easily across the surface of the rhythm, was
in full blossom.</TE>
<TE>   The most accurate comparison point for Lee, in fact, may be the
similarly diverse career of Frank Sinatra. Both started out in the
big-band era, emerged as solo stylists, did film work (Sinatra vastly
more than Lee) and were firmly linked--in style, substance and
manner--to the jazz world. Like Sinatra, Lee may never fully receive
the acknowledgement she deserves as a jazz artist. But, in both
cases, the evidence remains in their recordings, testimony to talent
that circled the entire pop music world without ever losing its
essential connection with its jazz roots.</TE>

<HD>Curtis Fuller's Once-Fleet Lines Missing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trombonist Curtis Fuller's long history in jazz reaches back to a
role as a charter member of the Benny Golson-Art Farmer Jazztet in
the late '50s. Since then he has appeared prominently with everyone
from Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie to Art Blakey and Stanley
Clarke. On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, Fuller turned up with
a quartet consisting of Doug Carn on Hammond B3 organ, David Harper
on tenor saxophone and Fritz Wise on drums. With few arrangements to
provide much of a structural foundation, the set was largely limited
to a line of familiar jazz standards: "Monk's Dream," "The Night Has
a Thousand Eyes," "Good Bait," "Star Eyes," "Yesterdays."</LD>
<LD>   Nothing wrong with any of those tunes, of course, all of which
provide solid harmonic potential for improvisation. The problem
rested in how that potential was fulfilled (and not fulfilled).</LD>
<LD>   Fuller, unfortunately, never quite managed to reveal the fleet and
flowing phrases that were so intrinsic to his playing in the early
years of his career. Occasionally beginning a solo with an
unexpectedly loud, blatting sound, his improvisational lines leaped
randomly, sometimes chaotically. At 67, Fuller has demonstrated
elsewhere that he is still a potent jazz artist, but little of that
potency was present in Wednesday's opening set.</LD>
<TE>   Harper, a fluid, articulate player, made the most of his solo
opportunities, despite the fact that his choruses generally tended to
emphasize technical virtuosity at the cost of melodic invention.
Carn's organ only rarely surfaced with the blues-based phrasing that
is essential to the B3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Curtis Fuller Quartet at Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver
City. Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<LD>Dueling Reds.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, ABC launches "Stephen King's Rose Red," a three-part
zombie by bankable fright writer King. Same night, Showtime begins a
risky two-part biography of Fidel Castro.</LD>
<LD>   One channel is delivering six inane hours (with commercials) about
ghosts no scarier than Casper, the other four brawny ones about a
formidable Communist tyrant--the longest-serving leader of any nation
today--who has thumbed his nose at 10 U.S. presidents and survived
the fall of the Soviet Union.</LD>
<TE>   Although escapism is no dirty word, is there a message here about
broadcast TV's low aspirations compared with pay cable?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Part 2 of "Fidel" will be followed on Showtime by
"Dreaming a New Cuba," Ariel Semmel's absorbing New York Times
Television documentary that monitors daily lives of Havana residents.
These include irreverent rappers, an elderly newspaper vendor, a gay
hairdresser, a physician who moonlights as a cafe singer, and a
17-year-old hooker whose father lives in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   All are affected to some extent by the 40-year-old U.S. trade
embargo of Cuba. Some are pleased with life under Castro, others not.
At one point, for example, a young man who boldly equates Castro with
Hitler is reprimanded by an aging gray-head who praises the Cuban
leader. Is the older man expressing his true feelings in front of the
camera, and do repercussions await the Castro critic in a Cuba whose
president equates dissent with betrayal?</TE>
<TE>   These films arrive when Cuba is again in the news, this time
because of a controversial makeshift prison at the island's
Guantanamo Bay naval base, where the U.S. is holding captured Taliban
and Al Qaeda fighters. And it wasn't long ago, either, that the Elian
Gonzalez case returned Castro to the spotlight for another media
close-up.</TE>
<TE>   The one from Showtime is highly watchable and unsparing, with
hardly any false emotion or cheap sentiment from director David
Attwood in an account that almost always allows history to speak
honestly for itself. The exceptions are a few composite minor
characters and instances of manufactured dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Showtime's stylish film on Manuel Antonio Noriega
depicted that Panamanian dictator as clownish and wicked. In
contrast, "Fidel" is nothing but sober when tracing Castro's career
path from mainstream activist to full-fledged revolutionary en route
to becoming a totalitarian ruler. In his future are perilous clashes
with the U.S., most notably the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban
missile crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Filmed in Mexico and drawn from books by Georgie Anne Geyer and
Robert E. Quirk, "Fidel" is meticulously balanced while, in effect,
presenting two related but separate Castros.</TE>
<TE>   The protagonist (Victor Huggo Martin) of Part 1 is heroic, an
idealistic young lawyer making personal sacrifices on behalf of
freeing the "Cubano people" from the smothering embrace of brutal
dictator Fulgencio Batista (Tony Plana) and his U.S. mentor to the
north.</TE>
<TE>   Ironies flow. At one point, Castro angrily tells his tiny band of
followers that Batista "is just the man the Yankees ... want to have
in charge." Yet this Yankee hater later quotes the Declaration of
Independence ("We hold these truths to be self-evident ... ") when
defending himself in court after his group is all but wiped out
attempting to occupy the heavily fortified Moncada barracks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, after spending less than two years in prison for that
armed insurrection, Castro is in the rugged Sierra Maestra with his
brother, Raul (Maurice Compte), and charismatic Argentine Ernesto Che
Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), assembling the peasant-supported ragtag
guerrilla force that will be Batista's undoing.</TE>
<TE>   After toppling Batista, however, the Castro of Part 2 is corrupted
by power. Now wearing the trappings of authority in addition to his
signature beard and pea-green fatigues, he is a crazed, villainous
demagogue, one who perverts the "true people's democracy" he and his
comrades fought to establish and stages Stalinist show trials to
relieve his raging paranoia. Nourishing a cult of personality,
meanwhile, the former Fidel is now officially worshiped as "beloved
Fidel."</TE>
<TE>   In the heady first days of his reign, Castro promises agrarian
reform and revolutionary programs in education and medical care. When
asked about election, he replies: "The revolution first." Or as Che
argues: "The first task of the revolution is to keep the revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Castro keeping his boot on his people's windpipe after unseating
Batista is, in a sense, an Orwellian classic revisited, the new
ruling pig of Cuba's "Animal Farm" imitating the oppressive farmer he
overthrew.</TE>
<TE>   That transition is a bit ragged and swift here, as if Castro were
struck post-Batista by a thunderbolt epiphany telling him to be
oppressive, when in fact, he was said to have closely studied the
European fascists and their tactics in his youth.</TE>
<TE>   One moment, too, he is anti-Communist as well as anti-American,
then seemingly the next secretly planning a "Marxist-Leninist
society" for Cuba, the intervening layers of development becoming a
blur.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Stephen Tolkin's screenplay join the debate over whether
Castro was a committed Marxist before victoriously rolling into
Havana in early 1959 or turned to Communism only after being spurned
by the Eisenhower White House, whose support of Batista typified this
nation's dark record of backing ruthless Latin dictators with strong
business ties to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The romances in Castro's life here are especially fascinating,
from his marriage of five years to aristocratic Mirta Diaz-Balart
(Patricia Velasquez) to his affairs with moneyed Naty Revuelta
(Margarita d'Francisco) and longtime companion and fellow hero of the
revolution, Celia Sanchez (Cecilia Suarez). Next to Fidel, Sanchez is
the most intriguing figure on the screen, from the moment he
encounters her in the mountains to her death in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, a Mexican actor in his first English-language film,
doesn't quite attain the mystique or "perversely captivating
combination of seductiveness and violence" that veteran journalist
Geyer saw in Castro. But he's solid throughout, and does have size
and explosiveness. He hasn't much to live up to, for all that most
Americans know of Castro is the caricature--his appearance, marathon
speeches, rhetorical bombast and deep affection for baseball, cigars
and retaining power, even as his policies appear to fail prodigiously
while he blames Cuba's economic plight on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   If he remains largely an enigma when the end credits roll, it's a
reminder that viewers should not count on incisive truths from a
political drama, even one as well made as "Fidel."</TE>
<TE>   "Fidel" will be shown Sunday and Monday nights at 8 on Showtime.
The network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under
the age of 14).</TE>

<HD>Emerging Signs of the Music's Future</HD>
<DH>Label and venue cutbacks may be cause for concern, but one
bright note is SFJAZZ's impressive spring lineup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been an interesting, if somewhat enigmatic, week for jazz. Good
news and bad news arrived in tandem.</LD>
<LD>   On the upside, SFJAZZ announced an impressive series of events for
its spring season in San Francisco. In addition, an executive
turntable shift at the Verve Group placed Ron Goldstein in the
position of chief executive, with Tommy LiPuma continuing as group
chairman. The shift will presumably allow LiPuma--one of the most
successful producers in the history of jazz--to focus less on
administrative matters and instead emphasize generating the big
number albums he has produced with performers such as Diana Krall and
George Benson.</LD>
<LD>   On the downside, Carnegie Hall announced a significant reduction
in its jazz program--specifically, the termination of the Carnegie
Hall Jazz Orchestra at the close of the current season. Led by
trumpeter Jon Faddis and highly regarded in the jazz community for
its imaginative efforts with repertory and original programming, the
orchestra was a major player in the cultural community--not just of
New York City, but of the country.</LD>
<TE>   Turning back to the Verve Group, coincident with the assumption of
his new administrative position, Goldstein announced that the
company's roster would be trimmed by as many as 10 acts.</TE>
<TE>   What does all this mean? It means that jazz--like pop music and
classical music--is facing an uncertain future. Each genre has its
artistic and financial dilemmas with which to deal, but central to
all is the seeming lack of the sort of larger-than-life figures who
once drove the music forward. Pop music, decades past the halcyon
'60s and '70s, but more experienced with periods of uncertain
inspiration, simply adjusts by embracing the phenom of the moment and
selling what sells. Classical music, lacking the presence of a
Copland, Bartok, Gershwin or Bernstein, cranks out new
interpretations of the standard repertoire. Jazz is still struggling
to figure out how to deal with similarly unfamiliar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saxophonist Joshua Redman, artistic director of the SFJAZZ spring
season, takes an optimistic view of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time in jazz," he says, "when there was some sort of
clarity about what the next thing would be. Even in the '60s, when
there were so many currents and streams, there was still the
semblance of a linear progression of jazz history: This is what's
now, and this is where it's going. Icons like Charlie Parker and John
Coltrane represented the future, where jazz was going to evolve.</TE>
<TE>   "But now jazz isn't moving in linear fashion; it's expanding like
a sphere. There's no single next great style, there's no next great
innovation. But that's OK. Now it's about individual artists trying
to find their own originality through their own experiences, and
trying to combine all the influences around them into a meaningful
whole."</TE>
<TE>   Redman is approaching his artistic stewardship of the SFJAZZ
spring season with a similarly open-minded point of view. The season
runs from March 19 through June 14 with the key events as follows:</TE>
<TE>   * Jazz Women (March 19-24). Performances by Maria Schneider,
Ingrid Jensen, Cassandra Wilson, Jane Bunnett and Jane Ira Bloom.</TE>
<TE>   * Celebrating Sonny Rollins (April 7-15). Performances by Rollins,
Redman, David S. Ware, Bill Frisell, Joe Lovano, David Sanchez, Lew
Tabackin and Robert Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   * What's New Worldwide (May 4, June 1 and June 13). Performances
by the Omar Sosa Septet, Anthony Brown's Asian American Orchestra,
Richard Galliano and Enrico Rava.</TE>
<TE>   * Modern Masters (June 14). The Wynton Marsalis Septet.</TE>
<TE>   The program acknowledges Redman's description of the sphere-like
expansion of jazz via an eclectic assemblage of styles and genres
from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic concept," he says, "is that jazz is a worldwide music,
and there are exciting things happening all over the globe--all of it
worth hearing. Even more to the point, we're trying to acknowledge
the fact that the great jazz that's happening outside of America,
inside America, or anywhere in the world, is a combination of many
different cultural influences.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's what makes me so optimistic about jazz, with or
without icons. Jazz has become a porous music, receptive to
everything. And a lot of the most exciting artists are those who have
their ears open to every imaginable sort of sounds and who then work
to combine them in interesting, creative ways consistent with what
jazz is all about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein's solution to his immediate problems with jazz commerce
differ, understandably, from Redman's handling of the SFJAZZ program.
But, despite the seemingly dark aspects of cutting a record company's
roster, he too prefers to take an optimistic view of the jazz future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking to deplete our traditional jazz roster,"
Goldstein says. "That's not the point. I want fewer artists, with
more opportunity to concentrate upon those artists. It's that simple,
really."</TE>
<TE>   But it's obviously a tough juggling act. Goldstein mentions
Russell Malone and Roy Hargrove, world-class jazz artists with
well-known names who nonetheless have difficulty selling albums in
numbers reflective of their visibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Russell's last album, 'Heartstrings,' was a beautiful record," he
says, "but it just never seemed to find an audience. So what I'm
hoping to try next is a solo guitar record--almost like Bill Evans'
'Conversations With Myself'--and just promote Russell as the great
guitar player he is, and go from there.</TE>
<TE>   "With Roy, he's starting an album that isn't traditional jazz, but
it is jazz. He's calling in his friends--D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Q
Tip. They all know him, and they're crazy about him. Whether or not
they'll end up on the record is hard to predict, but it's all set up.
I said, 'Let's do it; let's go after this thing.' But here too we'll
just have to see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line appears to be that Verve is looking for a strategy
to create product that is "more interesting to the marketplace." The
company will probably be seeking younger talent with the potential
for growth, development and, especially, vocal talent. It is Krall's
success, after all, that has made it possible for the company to
stick with instrumental artists who are not recouping their
production costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Goldstein says. "I'm going to put an emphasis on
vocals. I can't help it. Because if you look at the jazz charts, it's
all vocalists, Ken Burns albums and maybe five instrumentalists. And
the whole point of this is to get more successful records so that we
can continue working with the instrumentalists. That's what we need
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The jazz at Carnegie Hall picture doesn't appear to be nearly as
well focused or encouraging. Nor, for that matter, does the jazz
perspective at a number of similarly powerful Los Angeles cultural
institutions. But if anything emerges from a broader view of this
upside/downside jazz week, it's that--despite future
uncertainties--there is still a great deal to work with in this
music. And, equally important, in places such as SFJAZZ and people
such as Redman and Goldstein, there is the real desire to find the
solutions required to sustain and support a vital American art form.</TE>

<HD>The Arts Experiment With Science</HD>
<DH>More and more, scientific themes are popping up in plays,
movies and other genres, reflecting social changes, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIA KELLER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Science in the arts used to mean those chunks of aurally pleasing but
preposterous dialogue from earnest characters in "Star Trek"
spinoffs: "Captain, try the zylorian two-ply quark crystals to
achieve maximum warp density!"</LD>
<LD>   Science in the arts meant long, complicated-sounding words uttered
for sheer effect or bug-eyed characters with excitable hair--a la
Albert Einstein--muttering theories.</LD>
<LD>   Science in the arts largely meant science-fiction: rocket ships,
monsters, alien invasions.</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, science, math and technology have emerged
as serious themes in creative endeavors, including the current film
"A Beautiful Mind," such recent plays as "Proof," "Copenhagen,"
"Arcadia" and "Q.E.D.," the fiction of writers Richard Powers and
Andrea Barrett, and the visual artwork of Eduardo Kac.</TE>
<TE>   From the goofy robot in "Lost in Space" to the thoughtful
speculations about artificial intelligence in the film "A.I.," the
distance traveled by science in the arts is a matter of light-years.</TE>
<TE>   What does it say about our culture that we routinely incorporate
science and technology in our imaginative mock-ups of reality? Is
science--which, after all, requires intelligence and hard work if its
deeper mysteries are to be comprehended--trivialized by its
widespread utility as a narrative tool?</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot hope to understand contemporary life without a hard
look at the ways that science and technology have overhauled every
aspect of material existence," said Powers, whose novels include
"Plowing the Dark," "Gain" and "The Gold Bug Variations," which
employ science.</TE>
<TE>   "Science and its technological descendants are the premier
intellectual, economic and social endeavors of our time," added
Powers, who teaches at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   Those endeavors can serve as ideal metaphors for human problems.
In David Auburn's play "Proof," which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001,
the solving of a thorny mathematical theorem helps a daughter come to
terms with her late father's intellectual legacy. His mental illness,
she tells a friend, was manifested in "beautiful mathematics, the
most elegant proofs, perfect proofs, proofs like music."</TE>
<TE>   The play "Q.E.D." by Peter Parnell is about the life of the
late--and sometimes loopy--physicist Richard Feynman. "Copenhagen,"
by Michael Frayn, is about the building of the atomic bomb. Tom
Stoppard's "Arcadia" turns on aspects of fractal geometry.</TE>
<TE>   Those productions use math and science not only as plot devices,
but also as rationales for the existence of the works themselves. As
poet Muriel Rukeyser once wrote, "The world is made of stories, not
of atoms." But lately, it seems to be made of stories about atoms.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors may be at work when science themes appear in both
popular and more rarefied art forms. Prodded by technology, the pace
of change in society has accelerated tremendously, leaving a residue
of anxiety like an oil stain beneath a departed race car.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific discoveries have always fascinated and terrified,
attracted and repelled. In the past, science may have seemed like the
exclusive province of a few antisocial geniuses dabbling in arcane
mysteries, but today we know that we're all affected by what
scientists do.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the sense about science now that so much can change with
just a little discovery," said John Darnton, author of the
science-themed novels "Neanderthal" and "The Experiment," which deal
with evolution and cloning, respectively. His next, tentatively
titled "Brainchild," deals with stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   "As a society, we sense that we're on the threshold of some very
profound changes," added Darnton, cultural editor of the New York
Times. "DNA, cloning, genetic engineering are going to be changing
the way we live in deep ways. We're trying to come to grips with them
by raising the issues."</TE>
<TE>   A Modern-Day 'Sword of Damocles'</TE>
<TE>   Scientific knowledge has always seemed like a mixed blessing for
humankind, opening our eyes to things that, occasionally, we may feel
we were better off not seeing in the first place. The great
scientific breakthrough of the 20th century, Darnton pointed out,
still casts a mushroom-shaped shadow on the world: the splitting of
the atom, leading to the atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "Science had constructed the sword of Damocles over all of us," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between science in the 1930s and '40s, when atomic
technology was being developed and deployed, and science today is
accessibility. "The atom bomb was done in secret," Darnton said. "We
never had what passes for a national dialogue on its moral
implications."</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, science and technology are on the front pages of
newspapers and in the lead stories of national newscasts. We talk
about science over our morning coffee; we argue about the
implications of technology at the dinner table. That makes science
themes part of popular culture in a new way.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of open discussion of scientific and technological
issues began at least a quarter of a century ago, when prominent
thinkers such as Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J., and Harvard University professor Stephen Jay Gould
began communicating with lay audiences, said Alan Lightman, a
physicist and novelist who teaches at MIT. "Prior to that time,
writing for the public was not considered worth a scientist's time.
It was lesser."</TE>
<TE>   Those nonfiction essays about such topics as physics, evolution
and biology created, in turn, a better-informed public more
interested in scientific themes, Lightman believes. "It stimulated
people in the arts. It made a lot of ideas more accessible."</TE>
<TE>   Access to scientific discoveries by nonscientists has even more
directly influenced art. Kac, an internationally known visual artist
based in Oak Park, Ill., caused a stir two years ago with what he
called "transgenic art": a rabbit injected with genes featuring the
same fluorescent qualities as jellyfish. The point of the glowing
rabbit, Kac said, was to start conversations about biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason science works well for contemporary artists is
that, from a narrative standpoint, it is unbeatably dramatic. The
trial-and-error nature of the process by which scientific and
mathematical discoveries occur--the quest motif, set in a lab rather
than in a medieval forest--makes those discoveries wonderful subjects
for stories. There is generally an arduous journey studded with
setbacks and perhaps long periods of corrosive self-doubt, followed
by triumph--the "Eureka!" moment.</TE>
<TE>   Such an epiphany is chronicled in "A Beautiful Mind," the film
based on a biography of Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash.
Nash's schizophrenia constituted a tremendous obstacle to his work on
game theory. When Nash's publications finally are recognized by the
world, the sense of triumph is akin to that of a "Rocky" movie:
Challenges have been bravely met, a championship of sorts has been
won.</TE>
<TE>   The moviemakers gloss over the actual tenets of Nash's theories,
which the average viewer might find dauntingly complicated, as well
as other aspects of his story. Yet Lightman is not unduly troubled by
the watered-down versions of math and science that appear in art.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothers me if it's blatantly incorrect," Lightman said. "But
... the major thing is to be evocative and provocative."</TE>
<TE>   Julia Keller is cultural critic for the Chicago Tribune, a Tribune
company.</TE>

<HD>This 'Monte Cristo' Comes Off as Half-Baked Dumas</HD>
<DH>Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce go at it in the latest redo of
the classic novel, but the script and direction are tougher foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you don't include (and there is no reason you should) 1948's "The
Countess of Monte Cristo," starring celebrated skater Sonja Henie, at
least five filmed versions of Alexandre Dumas' "The Count of Monte
Cristo" predate the current one. Too bad they didn't leave well
enough alone.</LD>
<LD>   It's obvious, of course, why they didn't. Dumas' enormous novel,
so big it's often read in abridged form, has a
revenge-with-a-capital-R plot that's overwhelming. Not so
overwhelming, however, that director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter
Jay Wolpert didn't think, with typical Hollywood boldness, that they
couldn't improve on it with a bit of tinkering.</LD>
<LD>   Best remembered for sparring with actor Kevin Costner over the
shape of two films he directed, "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" and
"Waterworld," Reynolds knows about picturesque visuals and spirited
swordplay. An island off Malta doubles nicely as the dread Chateau
d'If. "Monte Cristo's" co-stars Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce put in at
least three hours a day of fencing training every day for a month,
and it shows.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, as those who remember the ill-fated South Seas epic
"Rapa Nui" can testify, Reynolds has the most minimal sense of what
dialogue should sound like or how to illustrate emotion in any but
the most obvious, turning-over-furniture-means-I'm-angry way.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Wolpert, according to the press notes, not surprisingly has
"spent much of his professional life as a producer-creator and
developer of television game, reality and talk shows." His dialogue
is of the leaden and obvious "Why, in God's name, why?" variety, the
kind of writing that has Napoleon Bonaparte seriously say, "When
you've walked as many battlefields as I have, you can feel death."</TE>
<TE>   When Wolpert's thudding dialogue is combined with Reynolds'
tendency to direct things in the most bald-faced way, the results are
not good.</TE>
<TE>   While not quite "Rapa Nui, the French Years," "Monte Cristo,"
uncertain whenever a character doesn't have a sword in his hand, is
unable to grip us as much as it should.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Napoleon, it's a chance meeting with him on Elba that
gets our hero, young sailor Edmond Dantes (Caviezel), into a world of
trouble after he innocently agrees to deliver a letter for the great
man.</TE>
<TE>   Edmond is such a guileless and completely trusting innocent that
someone actually says, "God knows how you are going to survive in
this world." He has no idea that his best friend and shipmate, the
aristocratic Fernand Mondego (Pearce), is jealous of him and smolders
with resentment at Edmond's upcoming marriage to the nubile Mercedes
(Dagmara Dominczyk).</TE>
<TE>   With the connivance of spineless magistrate Villefort (James
Frain), Edmond is plucked from his happy life and deposited in the
Chateau d'If prison.</TE>
<TE>   He protests his innocence, and although the dark warden Dorleac
(Michael Wincott) agrees with him ("This is where they put the ones
they're ashamed of"), the man is too busy whipping everybody in sight
to really care.</TE>
<TE>   After spending so many years scratching "God will give me justice"
on his cell walls that he comes to resemble Tom Hanks in "Cast Away,"
Edmond gets lucky and stumbles across the Abbe Faria (Richard
Harris), a fellow prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Looking like a combination of Rip van Winkle and health faddist
Gypsy Boots, the Abbe has been inside so long he's given names to all
the stones in his cell. He teaches Edmond everything he knows, from
reading to swordplay, and tops off this university of tough love by
telling the young man the location of a limitless fortune that will
make him richer than anyone's dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Escaping the chateau after 13 years of very hard time and in the
company of a trusty servant (Luis Guzman) he acquires in a knife
fight, Edmond reinvents himself as the fabulously wealthy count. He
moves to Paris to take his secret revenge on all who wronged him,
including poor Mercedes, who married Fernand when she thought Edmond
was dead.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making Edmond and Fernand best friends, something
Dumas never thought of, "Monte Cristo" takes other liberties with the
story, modernizing it with ironic wisecracks and coming up with an
ending that has more in common with "The Bold and the Beautiful" than
anything the author intended.</TE>
<TE>   More perplexing than the film's conclusion is how unable it is to
take advantage of the talents of its co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   Although he tries hard, Caviezel is better suited to playing the
kind of poetic deserter he was in "The Thin Red Line" than someone
who burns with a cold and pitiless flame.</TE>
<TE>   And the gifted Pearce, who probably would have been more
appropriate as Edmond, is defeated by the one-dimensionality of the
project. Revenge may be sweet, but this is one "Monte Cristo" that
leaves a sour taste.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for adventure violence/swordplay and some
sensuality. Times guidelines: It's all fairly genteel.</TE>

<HD>'Drum Song' in a New Light</HD>
<DH>Cast members of the revived musical in L.A. watch the 1961
film and compare their very different version.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after the conclusion of the Mark Taper Forum's successful
three-month engagement of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's musical "Flower
Drum Song," four cast members from the sold-out revival arrived at
the Leo S. Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
Jennifer Paz, who played Mei-Li, Jodi Long (Madame Liang), Jose Llana
(Ta) and Sandra Allen (Linda) were a bit sleepy-eyed from the
closing-night festivities but eager to watch the 1961 film.</LD>
<LD>   The cast members, who all hope to continue with the show if it
goes to Broadway, laughed and sang along during the screening.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, LACMA will screen the only remaining original
Technicolor print of "Flower Drum Song," which featured Nancy Kwan.</LD>
<TE>   Over lunch after the screening, the four discussed the film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: Did any of you see the movie to prepare for the play?</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Allen: That was one of the parts of my research--to see the
movie before we started the rehearsal process and to know what I was
getting into and taking on the role of Nancy Kwan.... I wanted to see
what she had done and then talk to David Henry Hwang [who rewrote the
show] to see what direction he was thinking about.</TE>
<TE>   Jodi Long: I had seen it but didn't want to refresh my memory....
For me it was great to see the opening shots of San Francisco then. I
was there when I was a kid in the early '60s, so it was really
wonderful to have that kind of feel of that period.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It is surprising how different the story lines are in the
original compared with the Taper production.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Llana: Even though it's such a different story, the heart is
very much the same in both plays. I think what David brings out more
in our version is the inner conflict [between the generations]. I
think in the original it's much more about just a story line, but I
think David takes it deeper about self-realization and who you are.</TE>
<TE>   Allen: And facing your demons and basically facing who you are and
really how you are growing up and how you are assimilating.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Paz: I think David really did a good job of maintaining
the spirit of Mei-Li. She is so very strong, but she had such charm
in this movie. She was so funny. I really enjoyed her. Everything she
said was so innocent. You never felt bad for her at all. I really
enjoyed the love story.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you ever felt that the original musical or this movie was
demeaning to Asians?</TE>
<TE>   Paz: I saw it several times growing up and ... I thought it was
very entertaining. It was the first time I had seen Asians acting
like Americans. Then seeing it again when I was in high school, I was
offended ... the fact it was coming from a Caucasian writer, it was
offensive in that way. But it was something I sort of really enjoyed
still.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have any favorite moments in the film?</TE>
<TE>   Allen: I love how Nancy Kwan dances the "Grant Avenue" [number]. I
had spoken to her because I was interested in just how long the
movie-making process was. She said ["Grant Avenue"] was a two-day
shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Paz: I loved Mei-Li's costumes! Umeki is such a minimalist
actress. I love her stillness. I love her scene with Ta when he
sings, "You Are Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think Hollywood today would make a film version of
"Flower Drum Song"?</TE>
<TE>   Paz: I think musicals are coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Llana: I think it would be more toward the angle of an independent
film. Compare the film industry now to what there was 40 years ago.
There was no such thing as an independent feature, and now if you
have a small budget and a gusty director and a gutsy producer, you
can make any movie if you want.</TE>
<TE>   Long: If it's a good story, it doesn't matter. I think that's the
testament to the success of our show. Not only did we have the
Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein music, we had a good story that touched a
chord.... If we go on to Broadway and have another hit, I don't see
why this couldn't be made into a movie. I just think it's always
about the story.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Flower Drum Song" screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Leo S.
Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire

<HD>Nancy Kwan Looks Back on an All-Asian 'Groundbreaking' Film</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Nancy Kwan recalls that the 1961 film version of the Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein musical "Flower Drum Song" was such a big hit with
audiences, "I used to go to Chinese restaurants and get Chinese for
free all the time! It was very well-received. We were very proud
because it was an all-Asian cast and it made money."</LD>
<LD>   Kwan, a vivacious 62, played Linda Low, a beautiful and ambitious
performer in a Chinatown nightclub in San Francisco. Although her
singing was dubbed, Kwan had several memorable dance numbers
including "I Enjoy Being a Girl" and "Grant Avenue."</LD>
<LD>   "Flower Drum Song" was Kwan's second film. The native of Hong Kong
had received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a drama
and received a Globe for best female newcomer for her first film,
1960's "The World of Susie Wong," with William Holden. Besides Kwan,
"Flower Drum Song" also starred Oscar-winner Miyoshi Umeki of
"Sayonara," James Shigeta and Jack Soo.</LD>
<TE>   "I was very happy about it because I am a dancer," she says. "I
went to school in England and I was with the Royal Ballet for quite a
few years."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Ross Hunter met Kwan at a party. "I was just in the right
place at the right time," she says. "He had seen 'Susie Wong" I guess
and he said I would be perfect" for Linda Low.</TE>
<TE>   "Flower Drum Song," she says, was a groundbreaking Hollywood film.
"It was the first time there was an all Asian cast in an mainstream
film," she says. One of her highlights was working with choreographer
Hermes Pan, who worked with Fred Astaire on the majority of the
legendary dancer's films. "We had six weeks of rehearsals," she
recalls. "When you work with somebody like Hermes Pan--he was a
terrific man and great to work with. Fred Astaire used to come down
once in a while and watch us dance. All the dancers got a big thrill
out of it."</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, Kwan acknowledges, Asians felt the musical and
the movie presented stereotypical images of Asians. Chinese
Americans, Kwan says, were also upset that several actors in the film
including Shigeta and Umeki were Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   People said to her "'How can a Japanese be playing a Chinese?' You
can't win. They should be happy it was an all-Asian cast regardless
of Japanese and Chinese."</TE>

<HD>Finding Conceptual Pleasures in Monochromes</HD>
<DH>An exhibition of Morgan Fisher's alluring paintings
launches gallery season at a high level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES ART CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to pinpoint the cause of the immediate allure of Morgan
Fisher's monochrome paintings at China Art Objects Gallery, except
perhaps to say that they seem instantly like puzzles solved. Lots of
monochrome paintings start out seeming like inscrutable puzzles, but
these work backward to that point. If technology indeed demands the
most elegant solution to a specific problem, then Fisher is a
technological whiz.</LD>
<LD>   The show includes two types of paintings. Five works from a series
titled "The Italian Paintings" date from 1999. Two "Self-Portraits,"
one from 1994 and the other brand new, demonstrate nearly
imperceptible changes in the artist.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the self-portraits are also monochrome
paintings--specifically, white rectangles painted directly on the
gallery floor, one at the front door and the other at the door to the
back room. (Both are thus scuffed up with footprints, abnegating the
purity associated with abstract white paintings.) Using his height
and weight, Fisher calculated the surface area of his body's skin in
square inches. The length of each rectangle corresponds to his
height--6 feet 41/2 inches--while the width is determined by dividing
his height into the surface area. A 4-pound weight difference between
1994 and 2002 results in a visually undetectable difference in the
width of the two monochromes.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly, these are not paintings that mean to record an expressive
self, even though the pure abstractions are also representational in
a rather intimate way. Scuff marks from trampling feet even lend an
odd poignancy to these painted bodies, which sprawl across the floor
as if the gallery were a Modernist crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Each rectangle is literally a figure on the ground. The
eradication of conventional figure-ground relationships--an apple on
a table, a tree in a field, a mark of colored paint on a blank
canvas--has been a consistent goal of painting for nearly a century.
Fisher's objectify the aim.</TE>
<TE>   "The Italian Paintings" push it further. Each is a plywood panel
20 inches high and 2 feet wide, and each is painted a medium gray.
The alkyd enamel is applied without any visible brushstrokes,
creating a seamless skin; the color, midway between black and white,
aims for a nonreferential nothingness. The paintings glancingly
recall Gerhard Richter's work, which also oscillates between
abstraction and representation, often in shades of gray.</TE>
<TE>   Rectilinear shapes have been cut into the panels, usually at the
corners. A gallery handout explains that the cuts' dimensions derive
from old travel-book guides to Italy, and the paintings' titles
include that reference. You don't need the information, though, to
sense what's up.</TE>
<TE>   About an inch deep, each panel emphasizes its presence as a
physical object affixed to the wall. The cutouts likewise assume a
paradoxical material heft. Are they the shaped figures seen against
the gray ground of the panels?</TE>
<TE>   Or are the panels themselves shaped figures seen against the white
ground of the gallery wall? Has the figure-ground conundrum been
heightened? Or erased? Why do these carefully crafted, monochrome,
nonrepresentational, medium-gray paintings seem virtually impossible
to have made without the ubiquity of photography as a modern mode of
perception? Fisher's rigorous, compelling exhibition is full of
visually grounded conceptual pleasures, while launching the new
gallery season at a very high level.</TE>

613-0384, through Feb. 1. Closed Sunday through Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Mimicking the Masters, and Other Foolishness</TE>
<TE>   There's a corniness to the paintings of Norwegian artist Odd
Nerdrum that has always been off-putting and cozily endearing. He
plainly wants to rival "the art of the museums" (as Paul Cezanne put
it), but more through mimicry of technical method than conceptual
reinvention--and, he wants it in an age when museum art no longer
means the booty of fallen European empires. His work, epic sagas of
mythic scope rendered with self-consciously Old Master-like
technique, also seems unafraid to court a certain hearty and
self-deprecating foolishness that comes with that grandiose
territory.</TE>
<TE>   At Forum Gallery, 16 paintings and one lithograph range in subject
matter from modestly scaled self-portraits to big pictures of
puzzling narrative conundrums. Figures are often life-size. The
self-portraits, which pointedly summon up Albrecht Durer and
Rembrandt, can make you wince--not because they're badly painted
(they're quite deft) but because the powerful precedents blow them
out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   Nerdrum, 56, is often called a Classical Realist, but his imagery
is also imaginary. (Not surprisingly, his first international
attention came in the 1980s, during the heyday of Neo-Expressionist
painting.) The costume dramas feature warriors, peasants, nudes,
prophets, innocent youths and grizzled elders. His figures occupy
desolate landscapes or stark interiors, painted in gray-brown glazes,
while the meager warmth of red-orange under-painting flickers against
golden brocades and ruddy leather.</TE>
<TE>   The figures are also almost always engaged in static pantomime. A
wistful young warrior pokes at the reclining torso of a sleeping,
nude hermaphrodite, whose weightless body floats on the picture's
surface like a decal. Three identical female nudes, alluding to the
three graces of classical antiquity, squat and defecate in a barren
field. Figurative repetition--a grid of seated lasses, a row of
erupting volcanoes, a chorus line of singers--applies a contrived
Minimalist overlay of geometric pictorial rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest picture here is "Transmission" (2000), mostly
because it pictures the frustrated activity of pantomime on which
Nerdrum's oeuvre relies. A pot-bellied elder wearing a fairy-king's
crown and a silly grin gesticulates at a young boy seated before him.
The boy's hands and arms flail, his eyes closed, a deathly skull at
his side.</TE>
<TE>   Lessons are being learned here, though not necessarily those the
teacher means to convey.</TE>
<TE>   Forum Gallery, 8069 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, (323) 655-1550,
through Feb. 23. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   'Self-Medicated' Is Anything but Sedate</TE>
<TE>   "Clock 7 Minutes 2 Seconds" (2001) is a sculpture by Tom Sachs of
a homemade hourglass, which he cobbled together from two vodka
bottles taped end-to-end at their pouring spouts. The bottom bottle
is filled with sand. The time identified in the title may refer to
how long it takes for the sand to pass through this jerry-built
clock--or perhaps how long it takes to guzzle a bottle of vodka (and
become inescapably incoherent).</TE>
<TE>   Either way, altered states of consciousness through time
materialize as an artistic aim. And because Sachs has chosen to
employ bottles of premium Russian vodka, the work obliquely sets
current social realities against yearnings for spiritual
transcendence familiar to Russian art--avant-garde, folk and
religious.</TE>
<TE>   The savvy sculpture is included in a wryly engaging group show at
Michael Kohn Gallery titled "Self-Medicated," which takes a witty
swipe at common presumptions about the ostensible healing powers of
art. Bruce Conner's delicate 1962 pencil drawing, "Mushroom," show's
a worm's-eye view of its mottled, potentially psychedelic (or
poisonous) subject, while Fred Tomaselli's abstract "Field" of actual
marijuana leaves encased in transparent resin offers another route to
nirvana (or prison).</TE>
<TE>   John Baldessari's "Tincture of 'A Person Who Wants Everything'"
(1996) is a medicine bottle that purports to hold what the title
says, while a pharmacist's label informs us that ingesting the fluid
promises (or threatens) to transform you into someone else. Edward
Ruscha's pale pink disk of Pepto-Bismol on an acrid field of smoggy
brown color pledges a cure for unnamed cultural nausea.</TE>
<TE>   Damien Hirst, the British artist who has made pharmaceuticals
something of a specialty in his bratty work, is here with several
screen prints that depict enlarged medicine labels from his own
fictional line--steak and kidney tablets, corned beef pills--along
with a sculpture composed of a hospital dispenser for syringes and
hypodermic needles.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Warhol's blunt 1979 charcoal contour drawing, "After the
Party," records a tabletop strewn with the empty residue of cocktail
glasses and wine bottles left in the wake of tipsy guests' departure;
the Pop drawing cleverly reverses the trajectory common to most
still-life images, which typically offer us a vision of abundance--or
at least the promise of some meager sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kohn Gallery, 8071 Beverly Blvd., (323) 658-8088, through
Feb. 23. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Floor Show of Designer Ingots</TE>
<TE>   At Ace Gallery, New York artist Carl Andre recapitulates the
standard Minimalist motifs he formulated in the mid-1960s. He acts
more as a producer of sculpture than a maker, forsaking such
traditional sculptural procedures as carving, casting or affixing
together, in favor of lining up identical, commercially made
industrial units in geometric arrangements on the floor. The
sculptures forsake verticality, too, emphasizing instead the
horizontal expanse on which a spectator walks.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the units are aluminum ingots--chunky, not-quite equilateral
wedges of visually inert matter with rough, scumbled surfaces. (The
ingots' silver-gray color recalls tooth fillings.)</TE>
<TE>   Thirty or more ingots are arranged in straight lines that bisect
galleries lengthwise or crosswise, or else follow the corner between
a wall and the floor. Lines are made from side-by-side pairs of
ingots, making long troughs or little saw-tooth "mountains" like the
letter M.</TE>
<TE>   The repetition that characterizes Andre's work has acquired an
unexpected veneer over the decades--namely, a signature look. This
shabby-chic show is surprisingly tasteful, even elegant.</TE>
<TE>   What was once a startling, radical subversion of entrenched
sculptural practice has become, 35 years on, an established designer
product.</TE>
<TE>   Ace Gallery, 5541 Wilshire Blvd., (323) 935-4411, through April
15. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<HD>Sum 41 Adds Bawdy Antics to Retro Rock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Audacious solos and inebriated, sexually charged stage antics are
associated more with '80s metal concerts than modern punk or pop
shows, but don't tell that to Sum 41. The Canadian rockers may sound
like Blink-182's bratty little brothers, but at the Hollywood
Palladium on Wednesday they were just as concerned with headbanger
hell-raising as they were with pumping up the pit.</LD>
<LD>   Though bawdy behavior is nothing new for bands of this ilk, Sum's
old-school influences give them some extra charisma. The members were
reared on flamboyant arena-rock, something they cop to in their radio
hit "Fat Lip" ("Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were
raised/Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised").</LD>
<LD>   The sold-out show offered plenty of other revved-up cuts from
their debut album, "All Killer No Filler," and though sloppy at times
it never lacked entertainment value. However juvenile things got, the
irreverent charm of guitarist Dave Baksh (who filled in gaps with
brief Megadeth and Metallica licks) and singer-guitarist Deryck
Whibley (who repeatedly announced his drunkenness and invited girls
to come up and carry on) made for an atmosphere that obviously
appealed to the young crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Punctuated by an appearance by former Motley Crue drummer Tommy
Lee and underscored by Sum's tongue-in-cheek hair-band anthem "Pain
for Pleasure," the mischievous nods to retro rock decadence were an
ironic complement to the group's buoyant harmonies, brash beats and
youthful vigor. All that was missing was some pyro and a
lighters-in-the-air power ballad.</TE>

<HD>2 New Players Upset the Sweeps</HD>
<DH>TV* With the Olympics and the Super Bowl in the ratings
contest, networks are readjusting. Viewers could be the winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The February rating sweeps don't officially start until next week,
but officials at CBS--hardly known for their lack of competitive
zeal--have already conceded that NBC will emerge victorious, while
Fox seems destined to achieve significant gains versus the 2001
survey period.</LD>
<LD>   These are hardly bold predictions, given that NBC will broadcast
the Winter Olympics and Fox will telecast Super Bowl XXXVI, which was
pushed into sweeps after the football season was amended by the
events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Yet what could be the most meaningless and least suspenseful
sweeps competition in memory could actually benefit viewers, breaking
up the usual logjam of high-profile programming and resulting in
fewer reruns through the remainder of the television season.</LD>
<TE>   An odd confluence of factors has played havoc with network
scheduling plans this season, as September's terrorist attacks and
related news coverage delayed numerous series premieres. Fallout from
the attacks also rewrote sports schedules, postponing both the
baseball playoffs by a week and the Super Bowl, traditionally the
year's most-watched event, until Feb. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with the Olympics, which take over NBC's prime-time
schedule for 17 consecutive days beginning Feb. 8, these shifts are
creating an Olympian-size ripple effect through prime time. And while
the other networks' strategies to counterpunch the Games will bring
about a less flamboyant February, they will also make available more
new episodes of favorite series for March and April, when broadcast
networks have traditionally tossed in reruns to stockpile fresh
installments for May, another of the three four-week sweeps (the
other major one comes in November) conducted each year.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, for example, will have nothing but original episodes of its
series "Providence," "Ed," "Third Watch" and "Law &amp; Order: Criminal
Intent" to run from the end of the Olympics straight through the May
sweeps, before summer reruns take over.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, having the Olympics is "like a gift," said Mitch
Metcalf, NBC's senior vice president of program planning and
scheduling, "because in a typical season, we're faced with that
horrible proposition of spreading 22 or 24 originals [of an average
series] over 35 weeks.... It improves the math, and the need to
stretch those episodes."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating that the Olympics will siphon away potential viewers,
the other networks are trying to put up some resistance without
squandering their own precious programming resources, in what one
executive referred to as a "rope-a-dope" strategy.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, for example, is squirreling away episodes of certain programs
as opposed to forcing them to compete with the Olympics, instead
scheduling a variety of movies and miniseries, including "The Rosa
Parks Story," a "Diagnosis Murder" movie and such feature films as
"The Fugitive," "Sabrina," "Primal Fear" and "Breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   ABC will stunt with extra reruns of comedies such as "My Wife and
Kids," starring Damon Wayans, which the network will run on five
consecutive nights the week of Feb. 18, along with other sitcoms. ABC
will also air "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and its sequel "Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom," versus the Games.</TE>
<TE>   New Episodes on Tap After Late Premieres</TE>
<TE>   Fox, meanwhile, intends to offer a higher concentration of new
episodes, in part because the network didn't premiere several series
until November due to its coverage of the baseball playoffs and World
Series. In addition, the Olympics historically fare worst among young
men, a core component of the Fox audience, suggesting that the
network may be best positioned to weather the storm.</TE>
<TE>   That said, even Fox officials aren't diminishing the impact of
Games held on U.S. soil amid a possible wave of patriotism.
"Certainly we make no bones about the fact that we anticipate the
Olympics will be a heavy-duty powerhouse hit to us," Fox
Entertainment Group President Gail Berman said earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, competitors are also conserving episodes during
February, meaning they will schedule fewer reruns themselves during
the spring. CBS also closes February with two significant ratings
draws after the Olympics, broadcasting the Grammy Awards and
launching the fourth edition of "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Network programmers have long lamented the tyranny of sweeps, a
ritual staged for the benefit of local television stations in more
than 200 U.S. markets, which rely on results from those periods to
set advertising rates. "The amount of energy that gets focused into
those 12 weeks is crazy," NBC's Metcalf noted.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking a viable alternative for measuring local ratings, however,
the networks are compelled to roll out major specials and key
episodes of top-rated series to lure viewers to their affiliates
during those months. Although more than 50 major cities--including
Los Angeles--are monitored daily by ratings service Nielsen Media
Research, local broadcasters still count on sweeps for vital
demographic data sought by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Olympics and Super Bowl are virtually guaranteed to
dominate 18 out of 28 days of the survey, coming to any true
competitive assessment of next month's sweeps will be difficult, if
not impossible. Ratings for local newscasts on NBC stations will
doubtless be inflated, at least in part at the expense of rival
affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a leap to pretend any sweeps is indicative of an average
week during the season, and this sweeps even more so," said Kelly
Kahl, CBS' executive vice president of program planning and
scheduling. "There are only [less than half] the nights that aren't
affected. I think you're challenged to draw any kind of meaningful
numbers out of that."</TE>
<TE>   As with past Winter Games, Nielsen will offer clients two sets of
results from the sweeps, including an "Olympic exclusion report"
providing averages for only those days that don't coincide with the
Olympics. With advertising revenues already down due to the sluggish
economy, competing stations acknowledge that the Olympics make what
has been an uphill struggle more severe.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Arnold Kleiner, general manager of KABC-TV, stressed that
his station isn't cutting back on spending or "throwing in the towel"
in February. As for making excuses about the Games skewing sweeps
averages in KNBC's favor, he said, "If I had the Olympics, I'd say,
'Tough, that's the way it is.'"</TE>

<HD>'Sisters' in the Face of Bias</HD>
<DH>The East West Players' melancholy drama feels  sluggish but
provokes emotions in the tale of a family's struggles after
internment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News of the attack on Pearl Harbor reaches members of a Japanese
American family in the midst of a lively, happy meal. Soon, they are
lined up, pinned with identification tags and transported to an
internment camp. When they return to their large farming operation in
Stockton in 1945, they find it a shambles. "I don't know who I am
anymore, where we fit in," says one sibling.</LD>
<LD>   So begins Philip Kan Gotanda's "Sisters Matsumoto," at East West
Players. A tale of dislocation and the end of a way of life, it bears
a strong resemblance to Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard." Ideas and
emotions subtly suffuse this talk-heavy drama, as the family finds
itself dispossessed of two countries--the one of its heritage and the
one it calls home.</LD>
<LD>   The play offers a lot to think about, especially at a time when
another attack has left other groups to face suspicion. In these
early days of the run, however, the message isn't coming across as
powerfully as it could. At Wednesday's opening, long pauses and
sluggishness diffused the bittersweet melancholy director Chay Yew
seemed to be trying to layer into the show.</LD>
<TE>   Things may yet coalesce. The author of such plays as "Yankee Dawg
You Die" and "The Wash" is fortunate to be interpreted here by Yew,
one of L.A.'s most dependably evocative directors, and a seasoned
cast that includes Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim on the WB's "Gilmore
Girls") and Sab Shimono (a key player in local presentations of the
Gotanda plays listed above).</TE>
<TE>   As the Matsumotos return to their farm, their activities are
silently observed by the ghost of their patriarch (Ken Takemoto), who
died in the Arkansas internment camp. His ability to help a Japanese
American community take root and prosper in Stockton--Gotanda's
hometown--is frequently acknowledged by his daughters (Kuroda,
Natsuko Ohama and Elaine Kao) and sons-in-law (Shimono and Nelson
Mashita). But the land has turned against them, as symbolized by the
bare, bent trees framing Victoria Petrovich's minimalist set and the
dying sunlight in Jose Lopez's lighting design. In town, the
Matsumotos are eyed warily, and at the country club where they once
were regulars, they encounter open distrust. A worse snub is yet to
come.</TE>
<TE>   As the oldest sister and new family leader, Kuroda is filled with
bitterness, which she tries to cover with brusque efficiency, while
Ohama, as the free-spirited middle sister, and Mashita, as her
jokester husband, attempt to get the family laughing again.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest sister (Kao) has been shaken by her fiance's death in
Italy while fighting with the Japanese American 442nd unit, yet she
remains quietly radiant. She is a seedling that may yet prosper in
the care of the childhood playmate who has become a struggling yet
confident young farmer (Ryun Yu) with new ideas about making things
grow.</TE>
<TE>   The Matsumotos have a few ideas of their own, and their
legacy--like that of so many other Japanese American families--is now
written in California's history.</TE>

<LD>   Saralegui, Mac Featured in Paley Festival</LD>
<LD>   A Spanish-language program will be saluted for the first time at
the 19th annual William S. Paley Television Festival at the Museum of
Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills, which announced the lineup for
the Feb. 26-March 12 event Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "Cristina," the Univision talk show hosted by Cristina Saralegui
that ended a 12-year run last month, will open the festival, which
features question-and-answer sessions between the creative team and
the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs to be featured in the festival: "Futurama," "The
Bernie Mac Show," "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," "Queer as Folk,"
"Undeclared," "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "St. Elsewhere," "Scrubs," "Six
Feet Under," "Alias" and "The King of Queens." There also will be
salutes to comedian Martin Short and the late humorist Fred Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets go on sale to museum members on Feb. 2 and to the general
public on Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   'Spin City's' Ruck Battling Kidney Failure</TE>
<TE>   After winning the best actor Golden Globe for the series "Spin
City," Charlie Sheen wound up his speech on Sunday with the words:
"Oh, and Alan Ruck, this one is for you."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to his co-star in the show, who has been
hospitalized in New York since Dec. 23, fighting a strep infection
that resulted in kidney failure. The 45-year-old actor has played the
mayor's chief of staff, Stuart Bondek, since the inception of the
series.</TE>
<TE>   ABC said the actor is expected to make a full recovery after a
lengthy rehabilitation period.</TE>
<TE>   TV Movie Planned on New York's Giuliani</TE>
<TE>   Five Mile River Films, a company that has produced TV movies on
Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus, is now planning one on former New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose leadership after the Sept. 11
attack elevated him to near-sainthood in some quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The company bought the screen rights to "Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of
the City," by Andrew Kirtzman, for an undisclosed price. Co-producers
Lorenzo Minoli and Russell Kagan expect to have the movie ready for
broadcast later this year and then plan to release it around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very famous in Europe," Minoli said of Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Gayheart Settles Wrongful-Death Suit</TE>
<TE>   Actress Rebecca Gayheart, whose car struck and killed a 9-year-old
boy last year, has settled a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the
boy's parents. Details of the out-of-court settlement were not
disclosed. The parents had sought medical, hospital, funeral and
other expenses, including loss of future earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Cruz and Silvia Martinez sued the former "Beverly Hills,
90210" actress in August, after her Jeep hit and killed their son,
Jorge Cruz Jr., in Hollywood on June 13. He died the next day from
severe head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Gayheart, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor
vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years' probation
and was ordered to produce a safe-driving video.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Holocaust Exhibit Provokes Controversy</TE>
<TE>   Two months before its March 17 opening at New York City's Jewish
Museum, "Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art" has generated
debate--and outrage--after the publication of its catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Among the works featured in the show are a depiction of a
concentration camp built from Lego blocks; a piece in which the
artist inserted a photo of himself (holding a can of Diet Coke) into
a picture of concentration camp survivors; and a work titled "Giftgas
Giftset," featuring canisters of gas stamped with Tiffany, Chanel and
Hermes labels.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Abraham Cooper of Los Angeles' Simon Wiesenthal Center
maintains that such works don't belong in a Jewish museum. "It's not
a censorship issue," he said. "Our job is to protect and stand by the
victims of the Holocaust. Let some other cultural organization put
this exhibit forward."</TE>
<TE>   Joan Rosenbaum, the museum's director, insists the works are
"anti-Nazi"--a view with which the show's curator, Norman Kleeblatt,
concurs. In the Lego piece, for example, the artist meant to show
that "the building blocks for societal good can be turned into the
building blocks for societal evil," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Clash Photo Chosen Best of Rock 'n' Roll</TE>
<TE>   A photo of Clash bassist Paul Simonon smashing his guitar on stage
was picked on Thursday as the most perfect rock 'n' roll photo of all
time.</TE>
<TE>   The famous 1979 shot, taken by Pennie Smith in New York, topped a
poll of music writers and 18 of the world's leading photographers
conducted by Q magazine. The Clash used it on the cover of the
"London Calling" album.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a classic picture because it captures the ultimate rock 'n'
roll moment--total loss of control," said Paul Noyer, editor of the Q
photo edition.</TE>
<TE>   Terry O'Neil's highly stylized 1974 picture of David Bowie came in
second, and Jim Marshall's 1966 picture of the Beatles in San
Francisco was third.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Director Arthur Hiller ("Love Story," "Plaza Suite") has been
voted the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.... The Oct. 20 Concert for New York City,
a benefit for victims of the Sept. 11 attack, is being released on
video and DVD on Tuesday. Proceeds will benefit the Robin Hood Relief
Fund.... Roger Deakins ("The Man Who Wasn't There"), Bruno Delbonnel
("Amelie"), Andrew Lesnie ("The Lord of the Rings"), Don McAlpine
("Moulin Rouge") and John Schwartzman ("Pearl Harbor") will vie for
the American Society of Cinematographers' feature film award, to be
given out at the group's annual award dinner Feb. 17 at the Century
Plaza.</TE>

<HD>TV Series Are Making a Killing on DVD</HD>
<DH>Video* Repackaged episodes and entire seasons of television
shows are a hit with fans and a bigger hit with studios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAOUL V. MOWATT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newly released on DVD, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is out to kill the
competition in sales. And so far, she's doing the same sort of job on
them that she has done for years on demons, monsters and the undead.</LD>
<LD>   Even before its debut, advance orders for the DVD, which contains
the first season of the popular TV drama, already had pushed it to
the top of Amazon.com's DVD sales list, beating out such movies as
"American Pie 2" and "Moulin Rouge."</LD>
<LD>   "Buffy," whose heroine battles both bloodsuckers and typical
teenage problems, is just the latest example of a rapidly expanding
media trend: studios repackaging television programs (from series
seasons to miniseries to made-for-TV movies) to capitalize on
often-rabid fan bases. This increasingly lucrative market combines
the digital clarity and compactness of a maturing technology (DVDs)
with the growing reach of television (especially cable) into niches
often thought reserved for the video release of movies.</LD>
<TE>   And these TV DVDs often offer the same features as movie DVDs:
outtakes, narratives by stars or directors, documentaries, all at a
relatively modest add-on cost to the producers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a way to extend the moneymaking opportunity for the TV
series," said Andrew Johnson, vice president of consumer research at
Gardner Dataquest. "It's just a natural."</TE>
<TE>   "There is obviously a great market for TV product on DVD in a way
that there never was for TV product on VHS," said Peter Staddon,
senior vice president of marketing at Fox Home Entertainment. "It
seems to be the right format to deliver this property. In DVD, you
can get the whole season in a neat little package that takes up two
inches of shelf room as opposed to two feet of shelf room for a VHS
collection."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that long ago that once a television show played, it
went out into the ether and the only way you could retrieve it was if
you were waiting up on Alpha Centauri and picked it up as it flew
by," said Robert Thompson, professor of popular culture at Syracuse
University and director of its Center on Popular Television.</TE>
<TE>   What DVD brings to the table is sharper pictures, better sound,
the ability to advance to specific sections of a program, and the
ability to include large amounts of programming in a smaller, more
durable package.</TE>
<TE>   That's what has boosted the phenomenal growth of DVD as a format
during the last five years. Consumers spent $4.6 billion buying all
types of DVDs in 2001, according to the DVD Entertainment Group. The
industry shipped about 364.4 million DVDs last year, compared with
182.4 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The studios generally won't release sales figures for TV-based
DVDs. But Steven Beeks, president of Artisan Home Entertainment, said
he thinks other studios are experiencing DVD successes similar to the
one he had with the first season of "Twin Peaks," the moody David
Lynch drama about solving a murder in a quirky town. In the three
years that it has been distributing videos of "Twin Peaks" episodes,
Artisan has sold between 30,000 and 40,000. In contrast, Beeks said,
in the few weeks since the series' first-season boxed set has been
out on DVD, Artisan has sold about 150,000.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a certain amount of sexiness attributed to the fact that
this is a new medium, and you can put a lot more on it," Beeks said.
"You can have access to every episode. The sound and picture quality
is much better. Add it all together, and it adds up to a much more
successful, much more desirable release."</TE>
<TE>   Burton Cromer, vice president of Home Video and BBC direct, said
DVD has quickly accounted for about 25% of lifetime sales of such
comedy titles as "Black Adder" and "Fawlty Towers," even though they
have been available for years on video.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole new group of people that didn't buy things on VHS
that buy them on DVD because it's the new toy and if you have a new
toy, you need new software," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So new software is what they're getting.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, fans have been able to select from seasons of TV
programs ranging from the sitcom "MASH" to the alien-conspiracy drama
"X-Files," the animated high jinks in "The Simpsons" to those in
"South Park." Prices range from $40 to more than $100, depending on
the length of a season.</TE>
<TE>   Additional seasons of some of those shows will come this year,
along with an array of newcomers. Paramount recently announced it
would boldly go into the new format with seasons of "Star Trek: The
Next Generation." The gritty prison drama "Oz" will be put on DVD.
The final episode of "Xena" will come out on disc, followed by
individual seasons.</TE>
<TE>   It's not purely coincidental that the fans of many of these series
match nicely with the demographics of DVD owners.</TE>
<TE>   Basic math says if you can entice even 10% of regular "Friends"
viewers into buying a season DVD, that's about 2.6 million you can
sell, said Doug Wadleigh, vice president of marketing/special
features for Warner Home Video.</TE>
<TE>   "These are die-hard fans who want to know more about the
characters, more about the sets. They want to know more about the
show that brings them so much joy every single week," Wadleigh said.
"And with the DVD format, we can now give the viewers more
value-added content on the DVD to enrich their viewing experience."</TE>
<TE>   Those include the same sorts of special features as on movie DVDs:
bloopers, interviews, additional unaired scenes, behind-the-scenes
footage.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the three "Buffy" discs have creator Joss Whedon
talking about how he came up with the idea for the perky,
smart-alecky heroine. They allow viewers to watch episodes dubbed or
subtitled in English, French or Spanish. And viewers can see the
original script for the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   And for studios, most of the material already exists in archives.
Getting additional commentaries and putting the material on disks
doesn't take that much effort compared to the potential upside.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, they've already paid for the product," said James
Rocchi, senior writer for Netflix, a Web site that reviews and rents
DVDs. "Anything they can make of it off DVD is either a chance to
make gravy on existing profits or to try to recoup existing losses."</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that fans of the shows have high standards, studio
representatives say they scour archives for footage and try to give
an experience that goes beyond the original TV experience.</TE>
<TE>   But it may still be awhile before some of the most popular TV
shows make it to DVD because of concerns about lessening profits from
syndication.</TE>
<TE>   "When a network produces a show and it looks at its revenue
streams over the life of the show, obviously one of the big factors
in it is the syndication deals," Staddon said. "In a lot of
instances, a show's producers or the networks will not want the show
to be put on DVD prior to it being sold into syndication."</TE>
<TE>   But Wadleigh and others say there's little research to suggest
friction between the two areas.</TE>
<TE>   Studio representatives say they have to avoid flooding the market
with products.</TE>
<TE>   But others think there will be no end to the titles that will come
out on disc.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there's someone out there getting excited about 'My Mother
the Car' on DVD," Rocchi said. "As long as there's a market out
there, people will produce it."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the same week in which a local merchant's goofy "Free Winona"
T-shirts (referencing actress Winona Ryder's recent arrest on
suspicion of shoplifting) garnered media attention, a more serious
campaign supported by a handful of L.A. bands received relatively
little notice. It was a sparse crowd that showed up Wednesday at the
El Rey Theatre in L.A. for a concert benefiting the Free the West
Memphis Three Support Fund.</LD>
<LD>   Highlighted by noisy drone-rockers the Autumns and the 11-piece
W.A.C.O. (for Wild Acoustic Chamber Orchestra), the concert, which
also featured the gothic thrash of Dick Army and distorted melodies
of Parlour, brought attention to and raised funds for an appeal by
Arkansas death row inmate Damien Echols. In 1994, he and two other
then-teenagers (who are serving life sentences) were convicted of
murdering three 8-year-old boys in West Memphis, Ark.</LD>
<LD>   HBO has produced two documentaries on the trio, and artists such
as Tom Waits and Eddie Vedder have spoken on their behalf. Supporters
contend that the young men, wrongfully accused of being Satanic cult
members, are innocent and were prosecuted because of their
"unconventional" appearance. Echols was the focus of Wednesday's
benefit because his situation is the most urgent.</LD>
<TE>   "Anyone who's been persecuted for dressing in black should
empathize," Autumns singer-guitarist Matthew Kelly said during his
group's set. Brooding and atmospheric, the songs evoked the quiet
misery of someone caught in a situation beyond his control, but there
were also moments of drifting peace and angular bits buzzing with
understated frustration.</TE>
<TE>   W.A.C.O., which adds flute, trombone, bassoon and cello to the
usual rock instrumentation, offered a short set blending classical,
jazz, pop and soundtrack-style music in a Brian Wilson-esque fashion,
i.e., at once wide-ranging and carefully structured.</TE>
<TE>   Although low-key, the music stayed engaging by veering from jaunty
to discordant to driving, and keyboardist-guitarist-singer Steve
Gregoropoulous' quavery, Neil Young-like vocals lent some songs an
appropriately wistful quality.</TE>

<HD>Story Woes Offset Anime Pair's Dramatic Visuals</HD>
<DH>'Metropolis' and 'Escaflowne' focus on heroines with hidden
powers, but the plots remain problematic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Metropolis" and "Escaflowne," two anime features opening today in
limited release, showcase the diversity of Japanese animation. Both
films offer dramatic visuals and a sense of scope rarely seen in
American animation--or live action. Both center on diffident heroines
who discover they possess enormous hidden powers, and both suffer
from story problems that may limit their audiences in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a 1949 manga (graphic novel) by anime pioneer Osamu
Tezuka, "Metropolis" (in Japanese with English subtitles) is a
sumptuously beautiful film that reflects the influence of the
original "Metropolis," "Blade Runner" and "Akira," but fails to match
its dazzling visuals with a coherent or compelling plot.</LD>
<LD>   Sinister Duke Red (voice by Taro Ishida) has just completed the
construction of Ziggurat, a glittering Art Deco tower from which he
intends to rule the world: His henchman Dr. Laughton (Junpei
Takeguchi) is perfecting a new robot that will control all the
machines on Earth. Detective Shunsaku Ban (Kousei Tomita) and his
nephew Kenichi (Kei Kobayashi) arrive in Metropolis to arrest
Laughton and are plunged into the city's underworld. Like Neo Tokyo
in "Akira," Metropolis is built on injustice. Robot labor supports
the city, and crowds of unemployed workers huddle in subterranean
slums.</LD>
<TE>   When Duke Red's deranged adopted son, Rock (Kohki Okada), attacks
Laughton's secret lab, Kenichi and the waif-like android Tima (Yuka
Imoto) flee through the slums and fall in love. A drawn-out series of
chases and gun battles ensues but generates little excitement or
suspense, despite the considerable violence. The characters don't
grow during these adventures, although Tima gradually becomes aware
of her latent powers.</TE>
<TE>   Director Rintaro's staging often makes the action difficult to
follow, and he clutters the screen with unnecessary details. Things
fall apart--literally and figuratively--when Ziggurat collapses to
Ray Charles singing "I Can't Stop Loving You."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the film is drop-dead gorgeous. The computer-generated
vistas of monumental statuary, soaring towers, interlocking gears and
gargantuan airships challenge even Fritz Lang's celebrated visuals.
But it's a strangely underpopulated world: Duke Red and the corrupt
President Boon (Masaru Ikeda) seem to be the only inhabitants of the
skyscrapers, and there's little sense of a privileged elite living on
the backs of the toiling robots.</TE>
<TE>   With their snub noses, huge eyes and oddly bulbous feet, Tezuka's
characters look too simple and too flat to fit into the
three-dimensional city: Seeing them there feels as incongruous as
spotting Hello Kitty on the set of "Blade Runner."</TE>
<TE>   If "Metropolis" suffers from a lack of plot and character
development, "Escaflowne" overwhelms the viewer with too much story.
The film is a reworking of the 26-part TV series "The Vision of
Escaflowne," which aired briefly in the programming slots known as
Fox Kids. The tangled story line has been simplified and some of its
weirder elements eliminated, but there are still too many conflicts,
prophecies and relationships to resolve satisfactorily in 96 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Escaflowne" infuses sword-and-sorcery and mecha (giant robot)
elements into the "magical girl" genre: An ordinary high school
student is called to save a situation (or an entire planet) using her
newly discovered powers. Hitomi Kanzaki (Kelly Sheridan) is a
withdrawn loner who wishes she could just vanish, leaving everything
behind. Her wish is granted when she's transported to the alternate
world of Gaia, which is wracked by a war between the dashing Van
(Kirby Morrow) of the White Dragon Clan and his evil brother, Folken
(Paul Dobson), leader of the Black Dragon Clan. The victor will
determine the fate of Gaia. Hitomi is greeted as the long-awaited
Wing Goddess, and discovers she has special powers over the
invincible dragon-armor suit, Escaflowne.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the opulent Deco-dystopia of "Metropolis," Gaia is
an odd mixture of medieval European and samurai cultures--with
high-tech touches. Van wears a kilt and leggings and dispatches his
enemies with a traditional Japanese sword, but he travels in a huge
airship. The final confrontation with Folken takes place in an
airborne castle the size of Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuki Akane directs the action sequences with panache. In the
spectacular opening sword fight, Van single-handedly dispatches a
cadre of enemy soldiers. American animated villains either fall to
their deaths or get knocked unconscious in comic takes; Van beheads
the enemy leader with a sword stroke Toshiro Mifune might envy.</TE>
<TE>   The characters in "Escaflowne" are more complex than the one-note
good guys and bad guys in "Metropolis," but are not always likable.
Hitomi whines, and American viewers are more likely to snicker than
sympathize when she compares her teenage angst to the wars Van has
survived.</TE>
<TE>   But "Metropolis" and "Escaflowne" remind audiences that animation
is a dynamic art form of enormous and largely untapped potential, one
that needn't be restricted to fairy tales and namby-pamby kiddie
fare.</TE>

<HD>Death-Penalty Drama 'Coyote' Roams Familiar Territory</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For its new production of Bruce Graham's "Coyote on a Fence,"
Burbank's Alliance Theatre adopts an unusual configuration. The
flexible performance space seats the audience on two narrow
ledges--each just one row--stripped down the walls of the theater
above an oblong pit. As a result, the action occurs below your feet.
Watching a play here is like lifting the top off a cage of laboratory
mice to see them trapped and scurrying below.</LD>
<LD>   This stark, no-exit set design is perfect for the West Coast
premiere of "Coyote," an exploration of the ethical ramifications of
capital punishment--set in prison, on death row.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's an "issue" play (Graham's "Minor Demons," about a
defense attorney torn over using a legal technicality to save an
accused rapist-murderer, made its L.A. premiere with Alliance
Repertory Company in 1994 ). It's also an issue play that doesn't
really cover much fresh moral or ethical turf. Still, Graham has
created characters of enough emotional complexity--and a story with
enough disturbing surprises--that this struggle with well-worn
questions remains compelling to watch.</LD>
<TE>   John Brennan (James Morrison) is a self-righteous, chess-playing
intellectual and also the editor of the Death Row Advocate, a house
newspaper given to running sanitized obituaries for the executed. His
new cellmate is Bobby Reyburn (Joe Mellis), a young white supremacist
of subnormal intelligence, convicted of murdering 37 black
congregants in an arson at a church. Outside observers of the
development of their uneasy partnership are jaded prison guard Shawna
DuChamps (Livia Trevino) and Sam Fried (Jesse Levy), a Pulitzer
Prize-winning New York Times reporter polishing his resume with a
story on Brennan's prison newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mellis glows as Bobby, whose affectionate, childlike sweetness
stands as heartbreaking contradiction to the racist cant that spews
from his mouth. The other actors are effective in their brooding
thoughtfulness but might do well to borrow a little of Mellis'
electric energy. Emotions run high--but could go higher.</TE>

<TE>   Teen Tales of Woe in 'Human Club'</TE>
<TE>   There's a sensitive coming-of-age story to be told in "The Less
Than Human Club," but it can't emerge until its attractive young
actors begin to treat this as a play instead of an audition for
Hollywood's next teen-angst drama. It's every actor for himself as
otherwise fine performances get embellished for the seeming benefit
of whatever casting directors might be checking out this V&amp;B
production at McCadden Place Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Emotionally true if rambling, Timothy Mason's memory play looks
back at 1967 and a group of high school juniors who don't fit into
the mainstream and have adopted the tongue-in-cheek name that gives
the play its title. Like most teens, though, they treat every spat,
every hopeless crush as a matter of life or death, yet are only
intermittently aware of actual life and death in the larger world
around them.</TE>
<TE>   As the story's narrator, Ian Bohen finds that fusion of excitement
and panic that comes with sexual awareness. In one of the truest
scenes, he sets out to prove something to himself--but confirms
something different--during a misfired kiss with the awkward but
uncommonly insightful girl (Amy Smart) he has invited to a dance.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Faris (of the "Scary Movie" comedies) brings an offhand
playfulness to the pretty, bookish girl who is smitten with Bohen's
character, and at a loss as to why he politely ignores her.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Cipes, Veronique Vicari, Branden Williams, Maritza Murray and
the single-named Catero all tap something essential, but director
Taylor Sheridan has been too indulgent with them, and too languid
with the pacing.</TE>

<TE>   A Compelling Look at Psychological Scars</TE>
<TE>   Terrylene doesn't speak, but she has a lot to say about the
sobering subject of childhood sexual abuse in her autobiographical
solo performance, "In the Now," at the Santa Monica Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   After depicting other characters' hardships in Deaf West's "A
Streetcar Named Desire" and the Fountain Theatre's "Sweet Nothing in
My Ear," the deaf actress focuses on her own struggle to overcome the
psychological scars left by a sociopathic stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   Not to take anything away from the importance of her message, but
the arc of Terrylene's story is an all-too-familiar one: repeated
molestation within the false sanctuary of the home, intimidation and
fear-induced silence and self-imposed denial on the part of others
who might have helped.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Terrylene's saga so uniquely compelling is the manner
of its telling--or rather, signing. Her eloquent performance is a
testament to the expressive, poetic power of sign language, in which
feelings float much closer to the surface than guarded words usually
permit. Terrylene's emotional life and the people who shaped it play
themselves out with no translation required in her hands and on her
face. But just in case you don't know sign language, director Mark W.
Travis deals with that by using a voice interpreter (Maureen Davis or
Elizabeth Greene) to fill in the factual details.</TE>
<TE>   Another evocative staging element is the original score performed
by composer Marilyn Donadt on hand-built percussive instruments
(somewhat reminiscent of composer-instrument inventor Harry Partch).
Without distracting from the narrative, Donadt subtly punctuates the
shifting moods and underscores the jagged edges in the most harrowing
sequences.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging society's general reluctance to openly confront this
troubling subject, Terrylene admits she further acquiesced to the
resistance within her insular, fiercely self-supporting deaf
community, which could not tolerate hard truths about one of its own.
Her long silence took its toll on her self-respect, however. Telling
her story is a courageous confession that completes her transition
from victim to survivor.</TE>

<TE>   Their Turn to Make It Big in New York</TE>
<TE>   Why do they do it?</TE>
<TE>   This is the most--indeed, the only--compelling question in
"Roommate Wanted" at the Century City Playhouse, a mini-musical
comedy produced, acted and written by Meredith Lavender and Jessica
Sullivan, about the tribulations of two young actresses trying to
make it in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Thrown together by the shortage of affordable housing in
Manhattan, Megan Miller (Lavender) and Jules Harris (Sullivan) are as
different as Des Moines and SoHo, where they share an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Jules is a brassy, savvy blond, recently jilted by her boyfriend,
who tends bar and flashes her mile-wide smile in toothpaste
commercials to pay the rent.</TE>
<TE>   Megan was smitten by the stage when she saw "Cats" at the age of 7
and is fresh from Iowa, with a suitcase full of old costumes worn in
amateur theatricals ("Back home I was such a hotshot," she says).
Alone in the apartment, she puts on something from "Peter Pan" or
"Fiddler on the Roof" whenever she feels homesick.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way to friendship and starring roles, bad things happen:
Megan's purse is snatched, and Jules runs into her ex with his new
girlfriend. Megan's mom wants her to come home; Jules buys an
expensive black sweater she can't afford. Still, such trials yield a
partial answer to the evening's overriding question. Why do they put
up with squalor, rejection and the big bleak indifferent city to work
in the theater? "It's in our hearts," Jules says.</TE>
<TE>   Bad things happen to the audience too, chiefly such leaden punch
lines as "It's just like a 'Friends' episode" (Megan) and "I am
living with a Hallmark card" (Jules). Although Sullivan's broad,
clean acting style is well suited to musical comedy and Lavender has
a pretty voice, they talk at, not to, each other. There's a kung fu
dance routine that's ungainly and too big for the stage; Jules
describes her misadventure on Fifth Avenue by dancing a bumptious
tango with a shopping bag. And as things wind down, both sing numbers
from the musicals they've finally been cast in, "Cats" and "Rent."</TE>
<TE>   Mounting a showcase production of this kind takes guts, not to
mention money in a town where a small theater like the Century City
Playhouse rents for thousands of dollars a week. Why did Lavender and
Sullivan do it? Doubtless, it's in their hearts. More important, the
goal is to show their stuff to the agents and casting directors they
can persuade to attend.</TE>
<TE>   One suspects they have stuff to show. Sullivan could play most
Barbra Streisand and Bernadette Peters roles; Lavender would make a
winsome Laurie in "Oklahoma." But they don't look good in "Roommate
Wanted," the sort of musical comedy dreamed up by a homesick girl
from Iowa in an old "Peter Pan" costume.</TE>

<HD>Gloomy 'Mothman' Attracts Little Heat</HD>
<DH>Richard Gere's new thriller, purportedly based on prophetic
events in a West Virginia town, could use some levity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>Don't pick up the phone!</LD>
<LD>   Don't pick up the phone!</LD>
<LD>   The last warning is for Richard Gere's latest character, a
Washington Post reporter who is about to receive a call from his dead
wife.</LD>
<TE>   The first warning is for Gere, a movie star who is about to
receive a call from his agent with an offer to play a Washington Post
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Because Gere ignored better judgment in at least one of these
instances, we have "The Mothman Prophecies," a new thriller that
purports to be based on true events but operates in that bombastic
plane of reality reserved for the apocalyptic horror movie.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Mark Pellington with a wide-eyed morbidity that won't
quit, "The Mothman Prophecies" is the kind of conservative creep-fest
that believes that the most effective chillers are humorless and
nocturnal.</TE>
<TE>   So it is in the dark of night that reporter John Klein (Gere)
shares his, and the movie's, final laugh as he and his wife, Mary
(Debra Messing), careen down a road and into an accident that will
prove to be the end of Mary. (We know that Mary is a dead duck from
first sighting, since the rules of the game dictate that the
generically beautiful spouse with nothing else going on in her life
must disappear to make room for the edgier, career-driven female
lead.)</TE>
<TE>   And it is in the dark of night that John drives toward Richmond on
assignment and breaks down inexplicably in Point Pleasant, a West
Virginia hamlet with absolutely nothing pleasant to recommend it.
There, he is threatened with a rifle by irate resident Gordon
Smallwood (Will Patton, sporting a beard that maintains the same
level of backwater unruliness throughout), who claims that John has
trespassed on his property three nights running.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the career-driven female lead in the person of Sgt. Connie
Parker (Laura Linney), the local cop who confides to John that all
sorts of other strange doings have recently gone down around
town--bizarre phone calls and sightings that seem somehow linked to
prophetic drawings that John's wife sketched in the hospital before
dying. Putting on his investigative reporter's hat, John chases down
an elusive authority on prophetic phenomena (Alan Bates) who plays
hard to get (as elusive authorities invariably do), since the secrets
he harbors are too horrible and incredible to contemplate.</TE>
<TE>   There is very little about the hoary conventions of "The Mothman
Prophecies" that couldn't be improved by a little levity, a little
more sunlight and some judicious cutting. The film takes place
between the Christmas holidays of a two-year span, but by the time
the chaotic finale rolls around, it feels like we've been sitting
there since the Three Wise Men first pulled into Bethlehem. Gere and
Linney emote with dead earnestness as if they're doing Eugene
O'Neill, but this is one very long night's journey into day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for terror, some sexuality and language. Times
guidelines: too grimly intense for younger children but OK for teens.</TE>

<HD>Showing Signs of a New Bloom</HD>
<DH>Covent Garden's ailing Royal Opera may be back on the
upswing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL>London</DL>
<LD>   Luciano Pavarotti appeared in the Royal Opera's tattered
39-year-old production of "Tosca" Monday night, in what is expected
to be the tenor's farewell appearance in opera here. The next night
brought to Covent Garden a brilliant new production of "Don
Giovanni," starring the increasingly popular Welsh baritone Bryn
Terfel, who just may become the next Pavarotti in his ability to win
over mass audiences and connoisseurs.</LD>
<LD>   From a company whose reputation has undergone a disturbing decline
over the past decade, the message was clear: Out with the old and in
with the new.</LD>
<LD>   The Royal Opera appears to be back on track. Indeed, the year-end
London critics' reports last month were, as one the few dissenters
put it, "an epidemic of enthusiasm."</LD>
<TE>   Although for years internal problems have plagued Covent Garden,
and the Royal Opera and Ballet companies that inhabit it, few
outsiders realized just how seriously dysfunctional the
administration was until a five-part television documentary, "The
House," riveted the British public in 1996, making a true-life soap
opera out of every misstep.</TE>
<TE>   After that, things only seemed to get worse. Administrators came
and went at an alarming rate, and often with the clumsiness of comic
opera characters. By the time the house closed in 1997 for major
renovations, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and performances in
makeshift interim venues during the construction just about brought
it down altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Its reopening in December 1999 was a near disaster. The hall was
again posh; the stage mechanisms were modernized, but backstage was
said to be chaotic. One of the opening's new productions, Ligeti's
"Le Grande Macabre," to have been conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, was
canceled at the last minute, because the stage hands couldn't manage
it and a new production of Verdi's "Falstaff" the same week.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing was encouraging. The Royal Opera music director Bernard
Haitink tried to resign and had to be cajoled back. The chorus
threatened to strike. An American executive director, Michael Kaiser,
was brought in to turn finances around. He accomplished that to a
certain extent but then left after a little more than a year to head
the Kennedy Center in Washington. His replacement, Tony Hall, was
plucked from the news division of the BBC and has no experience in
the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   So it came as almost a shock to read the overwhelming critical
praise of the house last month. But British critic Norman Lebrecht
says that he suspects little has improved in the two years since he
completed his provocative expose "Covent Garden: The Untold Story."
He credits "the reasonable run" at Royal Opera so far this
season--which included a much-admired "Parsifal" conducted by Simon
Rattle--to the artistic planning of Kaiser. Still, he warns that
everything at the house operates at maximum tolerance, ever on the
verge of falling apart. "I can't go into the place without fearing
that something is going to go wrong," he says.</TE>
<TE>   I attended "Tosca" with similar trepidation, but with more about
the 66-year-old Pavarotti, who has not been credible on the opera
stage for some time. His sold-out four appearances in the Puccini
opera (the final one was Monday) had fans camping out overnight for
the few dozen seats the house puts out for sale the day of the
performance. And Pavarotti endeared himself to Londoners by not
canceling, even though his mother died just before the opening night
(which had the tenor flying back and forth between London and Modena,
Italy).</TE>
<TE>   Pavarotti looked, walked and sounded far better than he has in
recent years. He still seduces with the famous Pavarotti bloom in the
parlando passages, but the thrill of the high notes is gone. The
tenor arias were approached so carefully that there was no sense of
character or spontaneity.</TE>
<TE>   It was a dead night for drama, despite an excitable Tosca (Carol
Vaness) and refined Scarpia (Sergei Leiferkus). The production,
originally created by Franco Zeffirelli for Maria Callas in 1963, is
as musty as the Underground. The orchestra, however, played with
astonishing beauty under Jesus Lopez-Cobos.</TE>
<TE>   If Tuesday's "Don Giovanni," directed by Francesca Zambello,
symbolizes the future of Royal Opera, then the company may, in fact,
be on the way to restoring its former glory. Some of Lebrecht's
worries about technical inadequacies were born out in glitches on
stage. And not all the critics were impressed by Maria Bjornson's
simple set, of a curved, revolving wall. But the set proved a
fascinating piece of instillation and folk art, with its raw brick
and large Spanish Madonna. The damnation scene was spectacular. And
the drama was vivid.</TE>
<TE>   Zambello intended no easy answers for characters with complex
inner lives. Terfel's Don was neither monster nor charmer, but a
sexual force of nature. He had a kind of magnetic animal vigor that
made him more amoral than immoral, confusing and animating all who
came in contact with him. Donna Elvira (Melanie Diener) found a
perverse sexual attraction in Giovanni's cruelty. Leporello (Alan
Held) was enslaved by the Don. Even the hatred of Donna Anna
(Adrianne Pieczonka, who sang in Los Angeles Opera's "Lohengrin" in
September) toward the Don was ambiguous and filled with sexual ardor.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Davis was the disappointingly bland conductor, but at least
his solid musicality offered the cast a level of support that allowed
them dramatic freedom. The orchestra once again played with
exceptional finesse and color, helped by the house's ideal acoustics,
which sound unchanged since renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights at Covent Garden are hardly enough to evaluate the
Royal Opera. But there is no question that the company has the
capacity for artistic excellence. What it needs most, besides a
stable administration, is a commanding, venturesome music director.
American-born conductor Anthony Pappano, who assumes the post in the
fall, is exactly that. As for a stable administration, we can only
wait and see.</TE>

<HD>Lives Full of Rage in the Brutal 'Beijing Bicycle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bicycles are as synonymous with Beijing as cabs are with Manhattan,
and when the hero of Wang Xiaoshuai's superb and harrowing "Beijing
Bicycle" joins the swarm of cyclists who crowd the city's streets, he
stands for countless young people who have made the journey from the
country to China's capital in search of a better life.</LD>
<LD>   Cui Lin's shy yet stubborn Guei considers himself lucky. He has a
place to live--with a friend in an old compound with small quarters
for working people. Even better, he has landed a job as a messenger
that provides him with a uniform and an impressive silver mountain
bike that will become his once he has earned 700 yuan, which is about
$85.</LD>
<LD>   A determined worker, Guei will earn this sum in little over a
month, yet by then he will have discovered how mean-spirited city
people can be. For instance, he's summoned to the gym in a luxury
hotel and is forced to shower before he can enter, only to discover
the hotel expects him to pay for it. Then just before the bike is to
become his--after which he will split the delivery fees instead of
having to give 80% to his employer--it is stolen. His boss will take
him back if he finds the bicycle.</LD>
<TE>   "Beijing Bicycle's" story now takes off in earnest. The bicycle
has fallen into the hands of a another young man, Jian (Li Bin), but
it is not immediately clear whether he bought or stole it. What is
clear is that he wanted it in the worst way, to impress his pals at
school and his new girlfriend Qin (Zhou Xun). His father has been
promising to get him a bike, but that money now must go toward his
younger half-sister's education. Had not chance and poverty placed
Guei and Jian in the same neighborhood, Guei probably would never
have seen his bicycle again.</TE>
<TE>   What emerges is a portrait of modern urban life at its most
brutal. Jian is in such a state of rage toward his father and so
eager to be a member of a group more prosperous than his family that
he is blinded to the fact that Guei needs his bicycle to earn a
living--and that his pals, for all their prep school ties and
blazers, are virtually a gang, each one a violent, thuggish brute.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, "Beijing Bicycle" brings to mind Vittorio De Sica's
neo-realist classic, "The Bicycle Thief," but it also recalls Akira
Kurosawa's early masterpiece, "Stray Dog," in which a young police
detective searches for his stolen gun throughout a war-ravaged Tokyo,
needing to find his weapon to regain his sense of manhood as
intensely as Jian needs the bike for social acceptance. Wang,
however, has a bleaker vision than De Sica or Kurosawa, moving beyond
the question of whether Jian will ultimately see his so-called
friends for what they really are. For Xiaoshuai, modern urban life in
China is destructive, the notion of a Communist classless society a
cruel joke in which the struggle for survival is ruthless, even more
so than in the big cities of the Western world.</TE>
<TE>   From start to finish, "Beijing Bicycle" moves adroitly with the
emotional impact of a steamroller. Xiaoshuai comes from the ranks of
China's underground cinema and has seen all of his work either
heavily censored or banned outright. With this masterful, flawless
film, he emerges in the front ranks of China's now numerous,
world-renowned filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for some violence and brief nudity. Times
guidelines: The film has several extended sequences of extreme
brutality.</TE>

<HD>A Filmic Yearbook of 'Senior Year'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to depicting teenagers, television tends to
oversimplify, making them out to be rebellious, driven by hormones
and obsessed with what's cool. But "Senior Year," a 13-part
documentary series on PBS, deftly avoids those stereotypes by
presenting a complex and intimate account of the lives of 15 students
at Fairfax High in 1999-2000.</LD>
<LD>   In just half an hour, tonight's installment (10 p.m., KCET) weaves
together issues of death, love, acceptance and physical attraction,
in an attention-grabbing, cinema verite style. There is no narration,
nor is there a need for any, because the filmmakers have done an
excellent job in letting the students tell their own stories.</LD>
<LD>   The show begins tonight with news that 18-year-old Yevgeniy Risis
has been hit by a car and killed. As one might expect, we see how his
acquaintances deal with their grief. More surprisingly, we also see
how some express remorse over mistreating this special-needs student.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, this is just one of the many candid moments that are
"Senior Year's" main strength. Jen, who says she's never had a
boyfriend for longer than one month, admits that she's always chasing
after people she can't have. On the other hand, Jean and his longtime
girlfriend, Maria, struggle with keeping their relationship going
through tough times. And Jet, a gay youth in the Junior ROTC, fears
that his big plans in life will be cut short if he meets someone and
ends up with AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   One drawback to tonight's episode, the fourth in the series, is
that some of the context is missing if you haven't seen the previous
three installments. For example, Jean and Maria talk about his
father's problems and how they affect their relationship in a very
general sense tonight; yet it's important to know that Jean's father
had just recently attempted suicide and, Jean says, has been blaming
his children for it.</TE>

<HD>Melodrama With a Message in 'Tricky'</HD>
<DH>The story of a Uruguayan woman spotlights a national
problem while showcasing the radiant Mariana Santangelo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beatriz Flores Silva's lively and entertaining "Tricky Life" opens
with its fiery heroine, Elisa (Mariana Santangelo), in a screaming
match with her mother as she flees the older woman's tiny shack and
heads in pouring rain to a phone booth with all her possessions,
including a beauty salon hair dryer and her two small sons in hand.</LD>
<LD>   She's calling her boss, who is also her married lover, to find
shelter for herself and her kids. Her mother, in parting shots, has a
point: Why doesn't her lover marry her? Why didn't he pick her up in
his car?</LD>
<LD>   Headstrong but astonishingly naive, Elisa, for all her beauty and
vivacity, has a bad record with men. Her sons have different fathers,
neither of whom married her, and it's clear that this new guy, who
runs a food stall in a huge Montevideo market, is not about to leave
his wife for her.</LD>
<TE>   When this sinks in at last, she explodes, publicly, and she and
her best friend, Loulou (Andrea Fantoni), decide there is no other
way to finance their dream of opening a beauty salon than to
prostitute themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They just might have succeeded if Loulou hadn't crossed paths in
the El Rey de Paris bar and bordello with Placido (Silvestre), a
40-ish man with handsome, lounge lizard looks and manner. He's as
shady as they come and has bad news written all over him, but Elisa
is a slow learner. She and Loulou are soon off to Barcelona with
Placido, who then will be able to exploit them in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Placido is a pimp, a white slaver and a forger who's into all
manner of criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa and Loulou walk the streets of Barcelona, with Elisa in love
with yet another loser to whom she inevitably poses her perennial
question, "Why can't you marry me?" If and when Elisa finally does
see the light, the question is: How is she to get out of Barcelona
and back to Uruguay without papers and money?</TE>
<TE>   "Tricky Life," Uruguay's first official Oscar entry, has been
freely adapted from Maria Urruzola's novel "The Serpent's Egg," which
in turn is based on a real event.</TE>
<TE>   The movie is, above all, a splendid showcase for stunning
Santangelo, who gives a powerhouse portrayal of a vivid, sexy woman
more hotheaded than truly stupid. Elisa's story calls attention to
the white slavery widespread across South America that ensnares young
women, transports them to Europe and exploits them.</TE>
<TE>   "Tricky Life" is a melodrama with a message, gloriously lurid and
atmospheric, seething with Latin passion and--clearly--deliberately
devoid of subtlety. The plight of women like Elisa has to be a lot
grittier in reality, but "Tricky Life" socks over its
consciousness-raising sentiments with such endearing vitality that in
Uruguay it not only was a box office hit, but has been credited with
reviving the Uruguayan film industry.</TE>

<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Son's Room" is heartbreaking and not. Winner of the Palme d'Or
at Cannes and a top contender for the best foreign language Oscar, it
is a measured, decorous, at times pat film that manages to be quietly
moving because it touches on something real.</LD>
<LD>   Nanni Moretti, known in Italy for puckish investigations of modern
life, such as "Caro Diario," that have led to comparisons to Woody
Allen, not only directed this quite different film, he also co-wrote,
co-produced and stars as well.</LD>
<LD>   Moretti plays Giovanni, a psychiatrist in the small Italian town
of Ancona, someone much more serious than his usual characters. He's
a contented paterfamilias, thoroughly involved with his wife, Paola
(Laura Morante), and their two teenage children, daughter Irene
(Jasmine Trinca), a basketball player, and son Andrea (Giuseppe
Sanfelice).</LD>
<TE>   Giovanni is introduced looking with fascination at dancing Hare
Krishnas outside a cafe after his morning run. Their ability to live
unencumbered in the moment turns out to be the opposite of the
careful, deliberate way the therapist goes about his life and work.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Giovanni's patients have amusing, exasperating problems
and the most boring dreams, while others, like a man who fears he
will turn into a child-molesting monster, have quite serious
dilemmas. To them all, Giovanni gives a variant of the calming advice
that will come back to haunt him: "We can't control our lives
completely. We do what we can. Just take a more relaxed approach to
life and the world."</TE>
<TE>   "The Son's Room" spends as much time with the therapist's family
as with his patients, especially with Andrea, the son Giovanni is
often frustrated with, for reasons ranging from the boy's not playing
competitively enough on the tennis court to being accused of stealing
a fossil at school. These are small-potato difficulties, but they
allow us to get to know Andrea, to feel comfortable with him around,
to immerse us in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Then, typically unexpectedly, the worst thing that can happen to a
family happens to Giovanni's: a tragedy takes place, and in its
somber, unhurried way, "The Son's Room" offers an affecting sense of
how that would be.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy, it turns out, lays waste to everything it touches,
and there's nothing that it doesn't touch. The family finds itself in
emotional free-fall, in a situation without rules or guidance, where
Giovanni can't begin to take his own good advice and his wife and
daughter find the pain so deep they have to retreat into themselves
if they are to survive at all.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moretti is better at being serious than his earlier work
would have you expect, he is still someone who acts at a remove, who
tiptoes at the edge of deep emotion. So it falls to Morante, (seen in
John Malkovich's "The Dancer Upstairs" at the Sundance Film Festival,
co-starring with Javier Bardem) to provide the feeling center of "The
Son's Room." Her despair as a mother, her uncertainty, her passion is
what gives this film its life. When she cries, it is always for real.</TE>
<TE>   What is not for real, unfortunately, and what undercuts so much of
this film's good work, is Nicola Piovani's tinkly, sentimental score.
It's music that's meant to be gently comforting, to force-feed
emotions that the film should trust itself to generate on its own. By
subversively reassuring us that, yes, there is hope, "The Son's Room"
reveals itself as not as serious, not as rigorous as it would like to
be. Music more glacial and less Italian but still moving, music by
someone like Arvo Part, would have given this film its due.</TE>
<TE>   Yet just when you despair most, just when a place of prominence is
given to Brian Eno's soft-rock "By This River," "The Son's Room"
regains its footing. A chance event raises the question of whether it
is possible for life to reassert and rekindle itself, for life to, in
effect, rescue life. It's here that the virtues of Moretti's
determination not to overstate or overdo things are most evident.
Even if "The Son's Room" did not totally trust itself before, it does
now, when it counts.</TE>

<LD>Prime-time coverage of the Raiders-Patriots playoff game provided CBS
its highest Saturday night rating since the 1994 Winter Olympics,
pacing the network to its 10th overall victory in the last 11 weeks,
based on viewing estimates issued by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC also generated strong tune-in for the Golden Globe Awards,
which saw its audience rise 4% compared with last year. Dueling quiz
shows "The Chamber" and "The Chair," meanwhile, each premiered to
respectable ratings, though both experienced significant declines for
their second telecasts after Fox and ABC raced to get them on the
air.</LD>
<LD>   CBS also launched the Supreme Court drama "First Monday," which
got off to a solid start in a Tuesday preview after the season's
most-watched episode of "JAG" and then fared reasonably well in its
regular Friday time slot.</LD>
<TE>   Notably, NBC's "Roots" 25th anniversary special drew weak ratings
and was beaten by "America's Funniest Home Videos" on ABC, which
passed on the program even though the miniseries originally played on
that network.</TE>
<TE>   CBS pulled in only so-so ratings with the Chuck Norris movie "The
President's Man: A Line in the Sand," which dealt with terrorist
themes.</TE>

<HD>'A Walk to Remember' Dawdles on the Path to Teen Romance</HD>
<DH>The story of first love, starring pop singer Mandy Moore,
has a solid cast but suffers from low energy and a shameless score.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Walk to Remember" is a sensitively told story of first love that
could have been more affecting with a little more grit and without so
mawkish a score. On the plus side are the winning portrayals of its
leads, Shane West and Mandy Moore, and a solid supporting cast headed
by Peter Coyote as Moore's minister father and Daryl Hannah as West's
understanding mother. This Warner Bros. release follows "Message in a
Bottle" as the second of the romantic novels of Nicholas Sparks to
reach the screen.</LD>
<LD>   The film opens with a tense sequence in which a group of Beaufort,
N.C., high school kids head for the local cement factory, where a
newcomer to the community is forced to dive into pool of water in the
dead of night to become a member of their clique.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, the diver surfaces breathing but unconscious, injured
by debris hidden beneath the surface of the murky pond. His erstwhile
new friends race for their cars. Only one youth, West's Landon
Carter, lingers to check on the condition of the injured diver. He
too tries to get away but totals his car in a collision with pursuing
police.</LD>
<TE>   Sparks and adapter Karen Janszen can scarcely be accused of
building sympathy for this bunch. Sullen and petulant, Landon is
lucky: The authorities give him a slap on the wrist by ordering him
to tutor a student on weekends and, of all things, participate in an
upcoming school play.</TE>
<TE>   He is cast opposite Moore's Jamie Sullivan, who is radiant onstage
but a virtual pariah offstage for her combination of brains and
dowdiness. The daughter of a conservative widowed minister (played by
Coyote), Jamie wears drab long dresses and almost always a bile-green
sweater. In a screen tradition as old as Hollywood, Jamie is not
really an ugly duckling, just a radiant beauty with a lousy wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie has a terrific effect on Landon, freeing him from the
tyranny of the mediocrity that seems to be the eternal by-product of
teen peer pressure. He discovers that Jamie is actually comfortable
within her father's conservative outlook, for she is as spiritual as
she is intellectual.</TE>
<TE>   While Landon is reassessing his values under her influence, he
succeeds in persuading Jamie's father to let him take his daughter
out to dinner. (He has less luck in the wardrobe department.)
Gradually, from their different perspectives, the two teenagers
succeed in opening each other up to the world and, of course, fall in
love in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing what is coming, it is possible to sense the movie
will throw a tear-jerking curve. It would have been nice if it
hadn't, but the film pulls it off fairly well, shameless
hearts-and-flowers music aside.</TE>
<TE>   West and Moore rise to the challenge their roles demand under the
committed direction of Adam Shankman, who works well with actors but
needed to attend more closely to the energy level of both this movie
and his first, "The Wedding Planner," which deftly teamed Jennifer
Lopez and Matthew McConaughey.</TE>
<TE>   "A Walk to Remember" could have been crisper and punchier, but
it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four
hankies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for thematic elements, language and some sensual
material. Times guidelines: The film is suitable family fare.</TE>

<LD>Two red carpets and photographers jockeying back and forth across
Hollywood Boulevard--the dueling premieres of "A Walk to Remember" at
Grauman's Chinese Theatre and "The Count of Monte Cristo" at El
Capitan Theatre--caused quite a commotion Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Pop singer Mandy Moore, star of "Walk," had a ball, especially at
the film's after-party. Not very many high school seniors can boast
about having a "senior prom" at the Hollywood Athletic Club, with
three open bars, buffet tables overflowing with shrimp and a leading
man at their side.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm missing my senior prom this year, so this is my senior prom
tonight. Aren't the decorations great?" said Moore, a student at
Bishop Moore High School in Orlando, Fla. The 17-year-old singer was
enjoying the after-party with co-star Shane West as photographers and
fans clamored around.</LD>
<TE>   Moore, who is finishing high school via correspondence, said she
hopes the movie's message, "not compromising whatever you believe in,
especially when others make fun of you," will appeal to audiences.</TE>
<TE>   On acting, Moore joked that her experience in "musical theater"
had helped. She played Adelaide in "Guys and Dolls" in her
sixth-grade school play. And she didn't mind trading in her MTV vixen
outfits for the ankle-length dresses, socks and a faded green sweater
she wears in the evangelical Christian film. She plays Jamie, a
Baptist preacher's daughter unashamed of her faith, who falls in love
with a troubled but popular boy (West) and wins him over.</TE>
<TE>   At the premiere and party, Moore, a Neutrogena spokeswoman, looked
more than clean-cut in a flesh-colored dress with a low-slung leather
belt. ... You know, your average churchgoing look.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gossip Is Forever</TE>
<TE>   Despite the post-Sept. 11 declaration by columnist Liz Smith that
gossip is dead and Goldie Hawn's plea to the National Press Club that
"words do hurt," a recent survey suggests that gossip is alive and
kicking.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer interest in reading about people and personalities has
increased 5% since October, according to a recent survey by Knowledge
Networks/Statistical Research. Company spokesman Jay Mattlin
described the phenomenon as a "comeback ... of comfort food for the
mind."</TE>
<TE>   More than 750 people nationwide, selected at random, answered a
series of questions over the Internet as part of the company's
ongoing magazine research. Results showed that the proportion of
consumers "very interested" in reading about people and personalities
increased from 11% in October to 16% during the period Nov. 27-Dec.
13.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also says consumers are less likely now than a year ago
to report waning interest in sports, movies or travel. In October,
consumers said they were more focused on news and finance than
movies, travel, sports and personalities. At that time, reader
interest in people and personalities had dropped 6% compared with a
year prior.</TE>

<TE>   Parental Support</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Aaron Spelling came out to see daughter Tori
Spelling at the Coronet Theater in West Hollywood for the premiere of
"Maybe Baby," in which she stars. The 78-year-old producer, who has
been known to take a very active role in his daughter's acting
career, sat with Candy and Randy, Tori's mother and brother. "Maybe
Baby" runs through March 23.</TE>

<TE>   "I'm honored. It's not every day that your work is compared to

after a sewage facility there was named for him.</TE>

<DH>It can be out of touch and mega-expensive, but haute
couture is what keeps the art in fashion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French haute couture, that institution of handmade high fashion and
even higher prices, has had more near-death experiences than that of
a soap opera star.</LD>
<LD>   It's clearly not dead, judging from the sublime displays of design
and craftsmanship that came down 26 runways in Paris this week. But
as an institution, it has changed. At best, the couture collections
are examples of high art; at worst, they're money-losing businesses
that exist to mollify egos of buyers and sellers alike.</LD>
<LD>   A new debate about the future of the 134-year-old institution
mesmerized fashion this week when one of its most important members,
Yves Saint Laurent, retired with a touching retrospective of his
40-year career. His longtime business partner, Pierre Berge, sparked
the heated controversy earlier this month when he declared , "I
believe absolutely in the end of haute couture. This way of life no
longer exists." Saint Laurent's departure leaves only 11 full-fledged
members in the couture ranks.</LD>
<TE>   Couture is many things--exclusive, excessive and exquisite. Often
called the laboratory of fashion, it exists as one of the industry's
most extraordinary contradictions. By reverently adhering to
time-consuming and often antiquated construction methods, its
practitioners guarantee the future of the art form. Yet as it strives
to be artistic, the clothes can become increasingly out of touch with
clients' needs.</TE>
<TE>   When the creative minds of designers no longer find a value in
elaborate embroidery, sumptuous fabrics or clothes cut and tailored
for an individual client, then couture's traditions and hope for a
future will vanish.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of couture is the search for the best in quality
workmanship, in construction and in fabric," said Kalman Ruttenstein,
senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, who
attended this week's shows. "It's the top of the line in design as
well."</TE>
<TE>   French couture remains the world's most prestigious clothing
enterprise partly because it comes with a long history that includes
dressing an international array of royalty. Parisian haute couture
was founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds which
regulated the operations of the city's couturiers, including the
influential Charles Frederick Worth, who was the first to sell
designs that were copied in the United States. Nearly 100 years after
it began, however, couture started to lose ground to ready-to-wear as
designers, including Saint Laurent, shifted their emphasis to the
less expensive collections beginning in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Despite periodic predictions of its demise, couture perseveres. It
remains as designers' only purely artistic exercise because it allows
them to create without the pressure of commercial constraints--broad
acceptance and, often, profitability. Saint Laurent's couture house
reportedly lost $11 million a year. Though the collections may not
support themselves from the sales of a few dozen ensembles that sell
from $25,000 to $100,000 each, executives believe couture is the gem
that shines glamour, prestige and distinction on the profitable parts
of the brand--fragrance, cosmetics, jeans and ready-to-wear.</TE>
<TE>   The twice-yearly couture presentations used to guarantee a respite
from the crass commercialism and circus atmosphere that has turned
the ready-to-wear shows into a bizarre form of entertainment. Yet
during the recent four-day round of couture, that feeling was
obscured by new kinds of mayhem, which included protesters from the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals who interrupted three of
the spring (and furless) shows.</TE>
<TE>   Long-absent superstar models such as Carla Bruni and Ines de la
Fressange, returned to the catwalks and shared headlines with an
ever-odder fleet of celebrity guests. This season's bold-type names
included Chelsea Clinton, Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, astronaut
Buzz Aldrin, Madonna, Sheryl Crow and a ubiquitous Gwyneth Paltrow,
who was providing a celebrity-eye-view of the collections for a
future In Style magazine piece.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good PR for the designers and the stars," said James
Galanos, a retired Los Angeles couture designer who shared customers
with many of Europe's top names.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all show. The taste is not there," he said, noting that
couture's traditional customers still want what it can offer. "They
don't give up that lifestyle. They are crying that they can't find
clothes in the retail stores. That is why they go back to the
couture. Everything else is geared to a 20-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   They'll pay dearly for the privilege of dressing elegantly. "I
have a friend who spent $45,000 for a suit," Galanos said. "She
ordered a pair of pants to match, and they charged her $30,000." A
simple suit can cost $25,000, while elaborately embroidered evening
gowns can cost $75,000 to more than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   At those prices, it's no wonder that only an estimated 3,000 women
in the world have the money or inclination to buy the handmade
clothes. In reality, some fashion houses suggest that the number of
clients who routinely buy a couture wardrobe totals only 70 to 500.
Though the garments are still expertly made, the cost and the less
reverent atmosphere discouraged longtime client and socialite Betsey
Bloomingdale to stop attending the shows nearly five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see on the runway is for the publicity of it," said
Bloomingdale from her Bel Air home. "I used to buy the couture, then
it became just too far-out and expensive. I used to buy a whole
wardrobe ... of wonderful clothes that I can keep and wear again.
Today, I don't know where the designers are going."</TE>
<TE>   Ruttenstein, who has attended Paris shows since the late '60s, has
witnessed significant changes in how couture influences fashion and
maintains that couture's real value is in creating "an excitement and
an energy that basically helps sell the ready-to-wear." In theory,
couture is supposed to set the direction for the next season's
ready-to-wear collections, he said, "but that isn't the reality.
Sometimes, ideas begin in the ready-to-wear and they travel up to
couture."</TE>
<TE>   The lines between the two levels of fashion have been blurring
since Saint Laurent gave ordinary clothes such as trench coats and
safari jackets couture interpretations. Younger designers, such as
Dior's John Galliano, increasingly look to the street for inspiration
in all of their collections. Few question that Saint Laurent created
the modern wardrobe for 20th century women, but life is proceeding at
a different pace in the 21st. If modern couture's unbridled
imagination seems irrelevant, it nevertheless remains inspiring to
new and seasoned designers alike.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the Dutch duo Viktor &amp; Rolf made their names in
couture, as did Josephus Thimister, though both decamped to more
profitable ready-to-wear. Rumors are rife that Alexander McQueen and
Gianfranco Ferre will seek to rejoin the esteemed ranks of couture, a
move that would elevate the contributions of the designers. Couture
clothing may look wildly overdecorated and impractical, but if it
didn't, fashion would lose an important outlet for dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see in couture is creativity--creativity that all the
others take from, like it or not," Galanos said. "Granted, sometimes
ready-to-wear looks better because we are tuned to a simpler kind of
look. That's part of the American look, which is clean and less
fussy. It can be a little dull."</TE>
<TE>   And if anything is past its prime in fashion, it's being dull.</TE>
<TE>   "Couture has changed," Galanos said. "And maybe for the better. We
can't all be there forever. Times changed and the way we look at
clothing is different. But there will always be a couture."</TE>

<HD>Another Eastwood  Looks to West</HD>
<DH>Alison Eastwood not only carries on a tradition of stars'
daughters striving in fashion, but her line even evokes her dad's
western persona.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making your mark in the fickle fashion world isn't easy, but having a
famous last name helps. (Just ask Stella McCartney, Jade Jagger and
Tatiana von Furstenberg.) Alison Eastwood--cowboy Clint's
daughter--is the latest second-gen celeb to get in on the act, with
Eastwood Ranch, a denim and sportswear line for men and women. And
she's tapped the progeny of another famous name to help: Sheridan
Tyler, son of fashion designer Richard Tyler.</LD>
<LD>   The genesis of the line is an L.A. story. Eastwood came up with
the idea after meeting her business partner Jeremy Lew at Maha Yoga.
"It used to be AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], but now all the deals are
happening in yoga studios," said Lew, who previously founded the
boutique advertising agency One Day Live and launched an online
holistic product store.</LD>
<LD>   McCartney made a name for herself by designing for French fashion
house Chloe, Jagger by creating jewelry and Von Furstenberg by
opening a chic Los Feliz boutique. But Eastwood, 29, is launching yet
another denim-based line at a time when many in the apparel industry
are hurting.</LD>
<TE>   "So many lines are trend driven. They have their 15 minutes, and
then they go away. We are going to focus on timeless pieces," said
Eastwood, relaxing in beige corduroys, a rag wool sweater and clogs
at her Westwood office, where the walls are plastered with movie
posters from her father's westerns.</TE>
<TE>   She is also sizing her clothes so that they are more generous in
their cut than some lines known for their ultra-snug fit. "We're not
going to be another Seven jeans or Juicy Couture," said Lew, 40, who
is president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood, an actress and former model, splits her time between the
family ranch in Carmel, where she goes to ride her five horses, and
West L.A. Her personal style is rugged and western-inspired but also
a bit eclectic. She likes to mix designer pieces with vintage western
duds, such as a pair of brown suede cowboy boots she picked up in a
thrift store in Australia. And she loves tooled leather accessories.
"I think everyone should have a piece of tooled leather in their
closet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her spring line, produced in L.A. and funded through private
investors, reflects the same sensibility. In addition to offering
jeans in two washes, the collection ($40 to $220) includes a
button-down "tequila shirt" with pin-tuck detailing for men, and
shaped eyelet tops, floral print camisoles, riding jackets lined with
a vintage-looking dusty-rose print and T-shirts with slogans such as
"Every Girl Loves a Dirty Cowboy" for women. The clothes will be
available at Fred Segal, American Rag, Saks Fifth Avenue and other
stores in February.</TE>
<TE>   Though she has no fashion training, Eastwood, who is the design
director, likes to sketch out ideas. She hired Tyler to refine the
tailoring. The 26-year-old worked with his father for several years
and helped design the first Richard Tyler menswear collection in
2000. He will begin work on Eastwood Ranch's fall line.</TE>
<TE>   "I love working for my father, but it was starting to make me
lazy," Tyler said. "I have always wanted to do younger, funkier
clothing."</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood wants to be involved with the business--the first to
carry her family's name--for the long haul. But she also wants to
continue making films.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps she can get some advice about dual careers from papa
Eastwood, who has the golf sportswear line Tehama and numerous other
projects, including a new post on the California Parks and Recreation
Commission. He is a support, she said, but not an investor.</TE>
<TE>   Guess it's her own fistful of dollars.</TE>

<HD>Oh, He's a Basket Case, All Right</HD>
<DH>Despite his bestsellers, Carl Hiaasen finds writing a
'nasty process.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know all the cliches about writing being torture? You know, that
it's a self-inflicted pain-fest of frustration, regret and
self-loathing? They're all true.</LD>
<LD>   That was the word from newspaper columnist and satirical novelist
Carl Hiaasen in a public discussion with local author T. Jefferson
Parker.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a brooding, awful, nasty process," said Hiaasen in Beverly
Hills on Wednesday evening as the two talked about his latest novel,
"Basket Case," before an audience of about 100. "But if you're not in
it for the pain, you're not in it."</LD>
<TE>   Even after his ninth novel, selling millions of books, one of
which was made into the movie "Strip Tease," starring Demi Moore and
Burt Reynolds, Hiaasen doesn't find the cruel creative process to be
treating him any more kindly. On most days, he still can't bear to
look over his own work, which he frequently is forced to do during
book tours.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a time that I don't look at a page of my work and
wince," said the boyish-looking Hiaasen. "I always see something to
tweak or something I would have done differently."</TE>
<TE>   Even his celebrated offbeat and sometimes twisted sense of humor
(one of his characters, who completely deserved it, spent 100 pages
with a severed dog's head on his hand) brings him little relief. He's
often asked if he laughs out loud at his own work.</TE>
<TE>   "I never have cracked a smile over anything I've ever written," he
said in complete earnestness. "My wife will say [after a writing
session], 'You look like you've been to a funeral.' And I'll say, 'I
was just writing a hilarious bit.'"</TE>
<TE>   Don't get the wrong idea. It's not all darkness and gloom.
Occasionally, the Florida native, who traces his heritage to Norway,
will run across a sentence that sings, and he'll marvel at it. But
within moments, he'll begin wondering why he can't write like that
more often.</TE>
<TE>   "You find millions of different reasons why life is [bad]," he
said, but to be honest, writing is "really a terrific way to make a
living."</TE>
<TE>   The prolific 48-year-old certainly squeezes in a lot of it. His
most recent effort draws from the same "straight from the headlines
of crazy south Florida" pool as his other works. "Basket Case"
(Knopf) centers on a frustrated obituary writer who stumbles upon a
conspiracy to murder the members of an '80s rock band called Jimmy
and the Slut Puppies. (One of their hit songs is "Painful Burning
Sensation.")</TE>
<TE>   Though his plots and characters sound farfetched, he says they're
only slightly embellished, if at all. His use of a character who
attacks another with a large frozen lizard, he said, was based on an
actual acquaintance. (The friend never got to assault anyone,
however, as the lizard thawed after an extended power outage.)</TE>
<TE>   "South Florida is immensely proud of its weirdness," said Hiaasen.
"It's all we've got."</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen, whose appearance was part of an author series sponsored
by the nonprofit group Writers Bloc, tracks the strange plot turns to
his rather simple Florida childhood. He grew up on the edge of the
Everglades, in a largely undeveloped area near Fort Lauderdale. He
loved to camp, fish and catch snakes. Even today, he has two pet
snakes, down from a high of eight.</TE>
<TE>   And then something traumatic happened--a convenience store opened
about three miles from his home when he was 12. It quickly became the
cultural and social center of his town, but the small edifice was a
harbinger of development to come. The idyllic, if swampy, home of his
boyhood was wiped out by progress.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Hiaasen said he began carrying around "a fair amount
of anger, which has certainly served me well." (Developers are often
villains in his tales and rarely survive.)</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his novel writing, he writes a twice-weekly column
for the Miami Herald, a paper he has worked at since 1976. Given the
success of his novels--seven of the nine have been bestsellers--he
could easily walk away from newspapers. He doesn't, he says, because
he thrives on journalism's immediacy versus the novel's lengthy
turn-around time.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the newspaper gives him incredible latitude in topics: One
column accused the paper's publisher of being a nut. Not a word was
changed in the piece. He often targets the big and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a privilege to write a column," he said. "Every time I write
one, I get to ruin the day of one of these [guys]. That's hard to
give up."</TE>

<LD>Caracals</LD>
<LD>   Most wildcats have a pattern of spots or stripes on their coats,
but some are solid-colored. You may be familiar with the large
solid-colored cats like lions and mountain lions (cougars), but have
you ever heard of caracals?</LD>
<LD>   These medium-sized wildcats live in Africa and the Middle East.
Their solid-colored fur ranges from brick red to tawny brown.
Gray-colored cats are found in the Middle East. The name comes from
the Turkish karakulak or "black ear." The cats have tufts on the ends
of their ears that are almost 2 inches long.</LD>
<TE>   It is thought that these tufts play a role in caracal
communications. The cats may "speak" to each other by flicking their
ears. Caracals can weigh up to 40 pounds but average 25. They hunt a
wide variety of prey, such as birds, rodents, hares and even small
antelopes. Caracals are known for their jumping ability. They can
leap over 10 feet in the air to knock down birds in flight. They are
still widespread in southern Africa but are becoming rare in parts of
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The Exotic Feline Breeding Compound's Feline Conservation Center
in Rosamond is home to two caracals. You can see and learn more about
these cats and many other wild felines by visiting the center or by
going to its Web site at www.cathouse-fcc.org. Center hours are 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Tuesday. For more information, call
(661) 256-3793 or (661) 256-3332 for recorded directions.</TE>
<TE>   This information was provided by Nancy Vandermey of the Feline
Conservation Center, HCR 1 Box 84, Rosamond.</TE>

<HD>Attention, Shoppers: Kmart Wrote Its Epitaph</HD>
<DH>The retail giant that sank five-and-dimes was a role model
for its surviving competitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is an almost Shakespearean justice to the imminent death of
Kmart, once the Goliath of the value mercantile. Since its inception
in 1962, it has stormed the landscape of low-end retail,
cannibalizing its ancestors--the local five-and-dimes, the Main
Street discount stores. Not even the venerable Woolworth &amp; Co. was
safe; the last red and gold sign came down five years ago, felled in
part by Kmart and its competitor cronies, Target and Wal-Mart. So it
is fitting that Kmart should suffer the same fate, hoist with its own
strategic petard--the big fish eat the little fish until a bigger
fish comes along.</LD>
<LD>   In its own slick-floored way, Kmart is an American icon. The
signatory loudspeaker announcement--"Attention, Kmart shoppers"--and
the famous Blue Light Special have entered the vernacular as
etymological kitsch, a sort of low-rent punch line. Kmart was tacky.
And sometimes tacky was good, in a post-Reagan-era ironic way, and
sometimes it was bad, in the ultimate high school fashion put-down
way. Still, it dominated the discount-store market for two
decades--it wasn't until the 1980s that Wal-Mart pulled ahead and
Kmart began to flail.</LD>
<TE>   For years, the company tried to change its image through a variety
of ill-advised relationships--first with a line of women's wear
designed for (or was it by?) Jaclyn Smith. More recently, Martha
Stewart endorsed a line of products, and Disney shipped over a bevy
of merchandise that didn't move fast enough at its stores. All of
which shared a what-were-they-thinking? air of inevitable failure,
although the personalities involved seem strangely
appropriate--Stewart is a chilly, merchandise-moving sort of gal, and
Smith's career seems to have followed a trajectory similar to the
store's.</TE>
<TE>   Icon or not, it is difficult to mourn the store's likely passing.
Unlike Woolworth, with its wood floors and white-aproned
lunch-counter waitresses, Kmart was never about anything but moving
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   When the first Kmart opened in Detroit in 1962, it marked a shift
in the pattern of American retail--the placement of low prices over
store loyalty, over a pleasant shopping experience. The store and the
tribe it soon founded were short on charm, ambience or personality.
In their place was merchandise. Rows and stacks and towers and wire
baskets full of merchandise. All priced to move.</TE>
<TE>   No one will reminisce years hence about grilled cheese sandwiches
and chocolate milk with Grandma at Kmart--there was food available,
but the homey lunch counter had been replaced by the ubiquitous fast
food window. One did not browse Kmart; the stores were simply too big
for idle wandering and grew bigger as the years passed and
super-sizing became a national habit. Yes, you could get a lot of
stuff at Kmart, laundry baskets and gym socks, coloring books and
motor oil, but there was little joy in the trip. Just an exhausted
sense of accomplishment when you finally made your way back to the
car, amid the dry whistle of those white plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   Even in its heyday, Kmart never hitched itself to our hearts. It
was more interested in our wallets. It pushed at the borders of what
people will endure to save a few cents--long checkout lines,
overcrowded aisles, battered merchandise in general disarray,
unhelpful staff. Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton famously said he
developed his store by studying Kmart and correcting everything it
did wrong.</TE>
<TE>   It is the most frightening fable in the storybook--the creation
turns on the creator. In essence, Kmart was eaten by its own
children. Soon that familiar red K may go the way of the Woolworth
sign, and we will be left with no blue light to guide us through the
ever-widening caverns and towering forests of discount merchandise.
Wal-Mart, Target, Costco continue to morph the family shopping
excursion from a stroll down Main Street into a weekend in Las Vegas
during which hours, possibly days, are lost, wandering an indoor
virtual world of consumerism.</TE>
<TE>   There is no warmth in any of these stores, no beauty or grace or
human connection. Just stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. And as any poet
or playwright will tell you, at the end of the day, it's never the
stuff that matters.</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see if a bigger fish comes along, a
leviathan large enough to swallow Sam Walton's dream. Or perhaps this
generation of giants will be undone by a microbe. When we get tired
of pushing shopping carts that weigh more than a small car, when the
endless mile-wide aisles stacked to the heavens with boxes and jars
finally render making a choice impossible, we may find ourselves
willing to pay an extra buck for a store not disgorged from the
imagination of Jonathan Swift.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it. The legacy of Kmart's demise may be the discount
boutique.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, seems to be the next
men's fashion icon.</LD>
<LD>   The soft-spoken Pushtun tribal leader, who took office as prime
minister last month after the Taliban was toppled, often wears a
green and purple striped Uzbek robe along with a lambskin cap.
European media reported that Tom Ford, creative director of Gucci,
said at a recent show in Milan that Karzai is "the most chic man in
the world."</LD>
<LD>   "We have achieved things. We are hoping to achieve more," Karzai,
44, told dignitaries Sunday at a reception in Tokyo.</LD>
<TE>   "But one thing I was surprised about yesterday--which I'm so glad
about--wearing the Afghan traditional chapan has become a fashion. I
believe Gucci said something about it--that's one of the
achievements," said the soft-spoken aristocrat.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's add more to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   NAME BRAND: Bin Ladin jeans? Let's hope not. Swiss authorities are
trying to make it tougher for one of Osama bin Laden's brothers to
turn his last name into a fashion label.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have moved to revoke the trademark "Bin Ladin" because
it could offend people in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
The move comes after reports last week that Yeslam Binladin, a Swiss
citizen who spells his name differently than his brother, hoped to
use the trademarked name on a clothing line.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Meier, trademark director at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Intellectual Property, said Swiss law doesn't protect trademarks that
go against "accepted moral standards."</TE>
<TE>   The trademark belongs to Falcon Sporting Goods, a Swiss firm owned
by Binladin, 51, who has lived in Switzerland since 1985. The company
can contest this recent move by Swiss authorities to revoke the
trademark, which was approved just last year.</TE>
<TE>   Binladin told the Swiss daily Le Temps last week that he didn't
want to use his name for commercial ends and had filed for protection
simply to prevent others from using it in bad taste.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't comment on earlier remarks by his lawyer, Juerg Brand,
that he was looking for a partner to produce a clothing line with a
Bin Ladin label. Brand told the Wall Street Journal last week that
the clothes would be marketed first in Arab countries and later in
Europe, adding that lawyers were working on a trademark request in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Binladin, one of more than 50 full and half-siblings of Osama bin
Laden, has said he and the whole family condemn his brother "for his
acts and his convictions."</TE>

<HD>More Cool Quarters</HD>
<DH>Part 5 Starting in 1999, new quarters began appearing--five
per year--to honor all 50 states. The Vermont and Kentucky quarters
were the last ones issued in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA WALSH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Vermont Quarter</LD>
<LD>   Vermont became a state on March 4, 1791. The sweet smell of maple
syrup signals the arrival of spring in Vermont. Collected with
buckets hung on trees, as you can see on the coin, delicious maple
syrup is still made the old-fashioned way in Vermont. Camel's Hump,
rising majestically in the Green Mountains, graces the background on
the coin, as it does in the state of Vermont.</LD>
<LD>   The Kentucky Quarter</LD>
<TE>   On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the 15th state. The governor and
first lady of Kentucky chose a song, a beloved home and a racehorse
to represent their state on the quarter. It is said that Stephen
Foster, an American songwriter from Pennsylvania, was inspired to
write the song "My Old Kentucky Home" in 1852, while visiting his
cousins in the Bardstown estate pictured on the coin. Kentucky is
also home to some of the country's best racehorses and for 127 years
has held the famous Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The California Quarter?</TE>
<TE>   California became the 31st state on Sept. 9, 1850. Its
commemorative quarter has not been designed yet. It is scheduled to
be circulated in the year 2005. What do you think should be on the
coin? Something to do with the Gold Rush? One of our 24 national
parks? Grizzly bears? Redwoods? Death Valley? Mt. Whitney? The Mojave
Desert? The Golden Gate Bridge? A movie camera? A famous Californian?
Use the blank coin in the illustration to come up with your own
design.</TE>
<TE>   2002 Quarters</TE>
<TE>   The first quarter issued in 2002 is for the state of Tennessee.
See if you can find one, then look for each of the succeeding coins
to learn more about our country's history.</TE>
<TE>   Maura Walsh wrote about the first series of state quarters in the
Kids' Reading Room from Nov. 27-Dec. 1, 2000. This story will be on

<HD>The Queen of Buzz Goes Silent? Doubtful</HD>
<DH>Both respected and reviled, Tina Brown ponders the next
phase of her career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She has been lionized and demonized, hailed as the most brilliant
editor on either side of the Atlantic and denounced--usually off the
record or in stage whispers--as a frosty perfectionist with a rare
talent for self-promotion. Yet few would deny that, wherever she has
gone, Tina Brown has made the clubby, inbred world of magazine
publishing a more colorful, unpredictable place.</LD>
<LD>   Now there will be a new chapter in Brown's life story, after the
suspension last week of Talk magazine, where Brown was founding
chairwoman and editor in chief. In a move that made national
headlines but surprised few media watchers, the 2-year-old general
interest monthly announced that its February issue, currently on
newsstands, would be its last.</LD>
<LD>   Talk's abrupt collapse has left dozens of staffers in New York and
Los Angeles looking for work, while across the country a Greek chorus
of commentators has arisen to pass judgment on its fate. Was Talk the
last gasp of the '90s, the inevitable comeuppance to a decade of
glitzy shallowness and celebrity worship, as some are asserting?</LD>
<TE>   "Talk was Tina Brown reductio ad absurdum. Talk was style without
substance, and Tina Brown was the poster girl" for that, said Robert
Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a
nonpartisan research and public educational organization that studies
the news and entertainment media.</TE>
<TE>   Or was Talk, as Brown and her supporters say, an experiment in
cutting-edge journalism and creative multimedia marketing that simply
ran out of time and money? "Don't be fooled by some of the snarkier
people who have written about us in the last period," said Brown,
stealing a few minutes between engagements for a cell phone interview
from her car in Manhattan on Wednesday. "The fact is we were getting
offered terrific pieces, terrific first serials."</TE>
<TE>   The news of Talk's demise was made public Friday by officials with
Miramax Films, a unit of Walt Disney Co., and Hearst Corp., which had
backed the magazine to the tune of an estimated $50 million. Just
hours earlier, Talk had hosted a pre-Golden Globe Awards bash at the
SkyBar in the Mondrian Hotel on the Sunset Strip, where guests sipped
apple martinis and munched on crab cakes and tuna tartar, and Brown
circulated as if nothing were amiss. The shutdown, which Miramax
Co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein and Brown blamed largely on the national
advertising slump since Sept. 11, came as the magazine was boosting
its circulation to a hefty 670,000 and, some thought, finally
beginning to find a voice and visual style distinct from those of
Brown's previous editorial charges, Vanity Fair and the New Yorker.</TE>
<TE>   It may take awhile before Talk's legacy can be separated from the
intensely mixed feelings of admiration and antipathy, gratitude and
resentment that Brown has aroused throughout her working life.
Meanwhile, the 48-year-old Brit is pondering the next phase of a
career that has not only taken her to the Annapurna of her profession
but turned her into a member of the very velvet-rope crowd she
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding more determined than regretful, Brown said that Talk had
"left an appetite" for "a new, sophisticated outlet for writers and
photographers who had something a little more counterintuitive to
say." "I know that that need is [still] there," she said. "All the
writers who were writing for me are calling me and saying, 'I don't
know where to place my piece, I don't know where to call, because
there is no place to place my piece.'"</TE>
<TE>   But did those individual pieces add up to a coherent identity for
Talk? "I felt the magazine very much had a voice," Brown replied.
"It's amazing the kind of response we've had in the last 24 hours. I
talked to a publisher who said to me, 'The incredible thing was, Talk
was the magazine that the media buyers read. Even if they didn't buy
it, they read it.' You know what I'm saying? And that's how I began
at Vanity Fair. It takes time. We were two years in. It took four
years for 'Seinfeld' to get an audience."</TE>
<TE>   Launched amid stratospheric expectations and not a little
hyperbole--one British writer declared it "the media event of the
year, if not the decade"--Talk was touted as a perfect union of
transatlantic journalistic moxie and Hollywood big bucks. With Brown
as its aggressive, well-connected editor and Disney and Hearst's deep
pockets, Talk looked primed to profit from the financial and creative
synergies of two multimedia giants. Star writers were hired to do
articles that, it was hoped, might someday morph into books, movies
and other intellectual properties. A Miramax spokesman said that
three Talk magazine articles had been optioned for Miramax movie
deals.</TE>
<TE>   A lavish start-up party at Liberty Island in Manhattan drew guests
from across the political and entertainment spectra, a testament to
Brown's bipartisan social skills. A former editor of Britain's the
Tatler, which she transformed from a stodgy social register into a
sharply written high-society gossip sheet, Brown understood that
while Henry Kissinger, Madonna and Salman Rushdie might belong to
separate cultural tribes, they're part of the same celebrity elite of
newsmakers and opinion-shapers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether her own celebrity might have been a distraction for
the magazine, Brown said the attention she drew was "a double-edged
thing." "At the end of the day, it also meant a lot of terrific
people were attracted to the magazine because of it," she said. "The
fact is, because of the energy and heat around the magazine, we got
offered a caliber of material that we certainly wouldn't have been
offered if myself and [Talk President] Ron Galotti had not been so
well-known in our industry."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's track record ensured that Talk would generate plenty of
buzz, a term so often associated with Brown that some think she
coined it. After resurrecting the moribund Vanity Fair in the 1980s,
she'd gone to another ailing publication, the New Yorker, in the '90s
and refashioned it from a leisurely patrician journal into a hipper,
punchier, more rough-edged magazine targeted at a younger, richer
audience. Some thought the new New Yorker was smart and forthright;
others found it trashy and insensitive. Circulation rose by a third,
to 800,000, but the magazine kept losing money.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Talk attempted to combine the seriousness and
polished writing of the New Yorker with the timeliness and cheek of
Vanity Fair. When it folded, it was still struggling to find a
comfortable middle between eye candy and sterner stuff, between
paparazzi shots of Courtney Love and a revealing look at the Nepal
royal family massacre. The premiere issue's cover story was an
interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton, in which the U.S. Senator and
former first lady disclosed her belief that her husband's
philandering had its roots in his troubled childhood. But few other
Talk stories reverberated in the wider culture.</TE>
<TE>   "This just happened to be a terrible time, not only to start a
magazine, but also to keep one going," said Clay Felker, a professor
in the graduate school of journalism at UC Berkeley. "When you're a
journalist, particularly an editor, it's like being a coach in the
NFL: You win some, and then you lose some, and then you've got
another job. And Tina had three big wins."</TE>
<TE>   Felker said he doesn't think it's possible anymore to start a
general interest magazine that's not connected to a television
program (such as Oprah Winfrey's O and Martha Stewart Living), which
allows for cross-promotion. Brown conceded that may be true. Yet she
said that Talk's multimedia marketing strategy was beginning to pay
dividends by offering writers "greater leverage and exposure."</TE>
<TE>   But Talk also was dogged by criticism that the magazine was too
subservient to its sponsors' other corporate interests--especially
whenever Miramax stars were featured in its pages, as they often
were.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Bachrach, a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and author of
an unflattering book about Brown and her husband, editor Harold
Evans, said that Brown's reign at the top of the magazine world is
now over. "She's very much like an actress whose time is up,"
Bachrach said. "There are always actors and actresses who are perfect
for certain moments in time, Julia Roberts or whatever. Tina was
emblematic of a very certain period, and Tina couldn't transcend that
period."</TE>
<TE>   But political commentator Arianna Huffington, a longtime friend,
said the magazine's folding may be a "blessing in disguise" for
Brown. "I really feel that for her this could be a new, wonderful
beginning," Huffington said. "I've said to her that I would love to
see her go back to writing. This could be her Act III."</TE>
<TE>   For now, other units of Talk Media will go forward, with Brown
continuing to serve as chairwoman of Talk Miramax Books, the
company's book-publishing arm. Owned by Miramax Films, the unit is
scheduled to publish books by former New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</TE>
<TE>   Brown acknowledged that many people have been urging her to
publish a diary she has kept for years. Could the Queen of Buzz be
ready to tell all? Brown isn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment," she said, "I certainly don't want to overload my
plate."</TE>

<HD>Bounty Hunters Are Stalking a New Image</HD>
<DH>A 1999 state law designed to rein in renegades has
produced a new breed. But respect can still be hard to earn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Friday night and party time at a Pico Rivera nightclub, and
young men in cowboy hats and women in tight dresses lined up to get
in. As they chatted, little did they know that a pair of binoculars
was trained on them from 200 yards away.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, check the white hat," Reed McInroy, a tall hulk of a man,
said as he passed the glasses to his partner in their rented Isuzu
sport utility vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   "Nope, not him," Bob Shandrew said after a quick look. Shandrew
had a 9-millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson strapped to his hip, McInroy a .45.
Both wore protective vests.</LD>
<TE>   The pair are bounty hunters. They make money tracking down people
who have a price on their heads.</TE>
<TE>   For six months, their prey has been an "armed and dangerous"
ex-con from Sonoma County who skipped bail on a dozen
burglary-related charges. If they don't bring him in, their employers
will be out $100,000. And they will miss out on a $10,000 bounty.</TE>
<TE>   The men are part of a new breed of bounty hunters, trained and
regulated under a 1999 state law designed to rein in renegades and
tame the Wild West spirit that had tarnished their profession for
more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   These days, newcomers to the field prefer to be called fugitive
recovery agents.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires bounty hunters to receive state-approved training
on arrest procedures and use of firearms. It excludes ex-cons from
their ranks. And it requires the recovery agents to give police six
hours' notice before making an arrest in most circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   There are 15 to 20 full-time bounty hunters in California and 50
to 70 nationwide, with an unknown number of part-timers, according to
state and national bail association officials.</TE>
<TE>   Shandrew, 44, a 15-year Army veteran, splits his time between
bounty hunting and being a bail bondsman. McInroy, 33, has been a
full-time bounty hunter for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Although determined to catch this fugitive, they say they will not
do anything rash.</TE>
<TE>   "If shots are fired, we retreat," said Shandrew, a big, calm man
whose gray goatee and cap make him look like an undercover cop.</TE>
<TE>   They're not police officers. But in some ways they have more
power. Armed with a bail agent's authority, they can pursue fugitives
into most other states and bring them back without going through
extradition proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Bounty hunters possess their power because they represent the bail
agents who posted the bond for defendants who then broke their
promise to return to court. Such fugitives not only lose their bail
but also face the prospect of being hunted down and recaptured by
bounty hunters.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, bounty hunters were outlaws ... who had decided
it was more lucrative to chase bad guys than it was to rob banks,"
Zeke Unger, a veteran bounty hunter, said from his office at World
Executive Protection in Van Nuys. "Since the beginning, bounty
hunters have always been on the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the recent reforms, the shadowy image persists. The
field continues to attract "the worst and the best," said McKenzie
Green, a San Francisco bail agent and bounty hunter who wrote part of
the bail for the fugitive Shandrew and McInroy seek.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, two bail agents got into trouble in Los Angeles
County. On the trail of a drug defendant, they encountered the
fugitive's girlfriend and allegedly forced her to accompany them in
the hunt. They got their man, but they were later charged with
kidnapping. One was accused of raping the woman. The charges are
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Bounty hunters say such incidents obscure the fact that they have
captured thousands of dangerous fugitives without incident. And
sometimes, they get blamed for things they didn't do.</TE>
<TE>   That happened in 1997 in Phoenix when five armed robbers, wearing
body armor and posing as bounty hunters, broke into a house at 4 a.m.
and kicked down a bedroom door as a terrified man grabbed a firearm
in a futile attempt at self-defense. He and his girlfriend were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The assailants carried documents seeming to back their claim to be
bounty hunters. By the time they were exposed as bogus papers, cries
for reform had swept the nation.</TE>
<TE>   California, with its Bail Fugitive Recovery Persons Act, is among
the many states that have since passed laws to regulate bounty
hunters.</TE>
<TE>   "They've gotten more professional [since then]," said veteran Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Larry Landreth.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in law enforcement agrees, saying some bounty
hunters still illegally claim to be cops.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they served a great role in the Wild West," said Burbank
Police Capt. Gordon Bowers. "I'd be hard put to say the good
outweighs the bad."</TE>
<TE>   But he concedes that bounty hunters do serve a function, because
police would rarely spend weeks tracking bail jumpers by staking out
homes and haunts.</TE>
<TE>   Shandrew and McInroy started tracking their current quarry when he
failed to appear at a preliminary court hearing in Sonoma County.</TE>
<TE>   The trail led to Los Angeles three months later, when Green, the
San Francisco bail agent, tracked calls from the fugitive's
ex-girlfriend to relatives in Downey. One call led her to a sister,
who confirmed that the fugitive was in the area.</TE>
<TE>   That trail went cold, as did a lead that surfaced from running the
fugitive's Social Security number through a database.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading back to San Francisco, the bounty hunters decided
to snoop around Downey again, hoping that the out-of-town fugitive
had become better-known since their last visit.</TE>
<TE>   "By hitting the streets, knocking on doors, talking, we found more
people who had seen him," Shandrew said.</TE>
<TE>   The shoe leather work led them to a McDonald's parking lot next to
the Pico Rivera nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   This is bounty hunting--sitting in a vehicle, watching, waiting
and eating fast food, McInroy said. It's also acting.</TE>
<TE>   In the pursuit of leads, he has played "everything from a priest
and a FedEx driver to a pizza delivery boy."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the pair had been staking out the nightclub for
three days. Inside, security guards quietly carried pictures of the
fugitive and kept their eyes peeled. Shandrew and McInroy promised a
$2,000 reward.</TE>
<TE>   "If he walks into that club, the first thing I'll do is call the
sheriff," McInroy said. "We're two guys with guns, and even if you're
against 12 guys without guns, it doesn't take more than a moment for
someone to overpower you."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if they found the fugitive alone, they would
make the arrest, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The hours crept by. McInroy passed time commenting on attractive
women he viewed in his binoculars. He and Shandrew bantered about the
long and odd hours and how the lifestyle can destroy a relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I have any regrets?" McInroy asked. "To some extent."</TE>
<TE>   Retorted Shandrew: "And, I get all the excitement of sitting in a
vehicle all night with an ugly guy like him."</TE>
<TE>   McInroy laughed, and then turned serious again. The real reward,
he said, comes as they start closing in.</TE>
<TE>   "That one-tenth of a second, when you finally get a glimpse of the
[fugitive's] face, makes everything worthwhile."</TE>

firearms, and bars ex-cons.</CP>

<LD>THE ROAD TO SANTA FE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Norman Zollinger</LD>
<TE>   Forge</TE>
<TE>   364 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Road to Santa Fe" is a fast-paced contemporary political
novel about the small group of characters who run one of the larger,
least populous, poorest and most complicated states in the union: New
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Zollinger, who died in 2000 after the book was finished,
lived in the Albuquerque area and wrote a number of well-regarded
novels about the Western regions. He knew the territory and the
people of New Mexico. The scenery and the inhabitants of the state
are all there in "The Road to Santa Fe": the august Latino patron of
the northern mountainous counties, where the descendants of the
conquistadores have lived in uneasy isolation for 400 years; the
cattle-running families on the plains in "Little Texas" in the
Southeast; the jostling urban life of Albuquerque, where remnants of
the earlier red-neck culture coexist uneasily with the well-to-do
miners, oilmen and rising corporate lawyers who hang out at the
Petroleum Club.</TE>
<TE>   There are also the young Hispanics, pulling themselves up into the
slightly larger and certainly dominant Anglo society by virtue of
their newly won credentials from the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque and New Mexico State in southern Las Cruces.</TE>
<TE>   And always, off to one side, are the Pueblo Indians, proud,
slightly aloof, wrapped in their ancient religions and several
languages, touched, if only partially, by their ancient and
ambivalent conversion to Catholicism by the invading Spaniards of the
16th century.</TE>
<TE>   Into this complicated ethnic and economic mix, in a state of only
1.8 million people, Zollinger deftly constructs a tale that defines
the plausible characters he creates and illuminates the milieu in
which they move and act.</TE>
<TE>   The principal character is Rick--Enrique--Garcia, who went from
the university to Georgetown's law school. He is back home in a
small, no-count imaginary county south of Albuquerque and east of the
Rio Grande. He has married the Anglo daughter of one of the area's
prominent ranching families, a woman beset by a devastating bipolar
illness neither she nor her therapists can lift from her. She kills
herself: Rick, shattered and infinitely lonely, eventually pulls
himself up and follows a youthful dream by running for district
attorney. Even in this predominantly Anglo district, he wins. (Such
things do happen in New Mexico.)</TE>
<TE>   Garcia finds himself prosecuting a prominent and popular Anglo
county man, with whom he played football in high school, for
willfully and scandalously building a mining catchment pond that
violates all contemporary safety standards for such environmental
safeguards. Three Latino children died by drinking the pond water.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia sends the defendant to the penitentiary in Santa Fe. The
convict vows revenge, even death. Very much on the surface in this
trial is the resentment in the community felt toward people like
Garcia, whom they habitually call "Messkins." Just under the surface
is the common Anglo attitude that the lives of Indian children aren't
worth very much.</TE>
<TE>   There runs through "The Road to Santa Fe" a troubling moral
element: Garcia wooed and won his first wife away from the man he
later sent to jail. Buoyed by his success as district attorney and
pulled by the lure of practical, idealistic leadership for a state
long troubled by a dispiriting combination of corruption and
indifference, Garcia is persuaded by a bright political operative and
her stalwart, high-minded father to run for the Democratic nomination
for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Some chunks of money come in to start him on his way. (In New
Mexico $50,000 is a substantial contribution to a governor's race.)
In an amusing vignette, Garcia gets briefly involved with a rich San
Francisco woman, who, like some outsiders, makes herself into an
"instant Santa Fe-an" by wearing long voluminous skirts, Navajo
velveteen blouses and spectacular silver-and-turquoise squash-blossom
necklaces. Garcia faces hazards on his bid for the governor's seat.
In true New Mexico style, they are serious and grim.</TE>
<TE>   "The Road to Santa Fe" is a brisk read with authentic,
recognizable characters.</TE>
<TE>   It is, to boot, a handsome portrait of what Garcia, flying south
in a small plane along the Rio Grande, accurately calls "this
astonishing state."</TE>

<HD>Use It or Lose It-- Even if It's Too Pretty to Wear</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the Fashion Police Blotter: We were chatting with a friend the
other day about--what else?--clothes, when she mentioned that another
friend of hers has some clothes she doesn't wear because she likes
them too much. It sounded odd to us at first, but after rolling this
around in our head for a while we realized we had the same feelings
about a few things in our closet.</LD>
<LD>   They're those things you buy because you can't live without them,
from the tea rose cashmere sweater that was a steal on sale to the
taupe wool crepe Armani pants that were a well-deserved splurge. But
after the goods have been brought home, they merely sit and wait for
their big debut. You open a drawer, caress a sleeve, sigh over how
pretty that sweater is, then admit to yourself that you're afraid of
getting it dirty or of wearing it out. As if putting it on your body
and walking around for several hours will so damage the threads that
it will be in tatters by the end of the day.</LD>
<LD>   Intellectually none of this makes any sense, but, let's face it,
shopping isn't so much an intellectual pursuit as it is an emotional
one (or for some, we suppose, spiritual). But it you're among the
clothes-savers who can't bear to allow your most precious objets de
la mode to see the light of day, here's some sensible advice: Let
them out!</LD>
<TE>   The last few months have taught us about enjoying the here and now
and being thankful for what we have. So open those drawers and
closets, haul out those lonely clothes and wear them.</TE>
<TE>   That's Some Fancy Footwork: Are you a shoeaholic? Are you a woman
who spends every penny of her disposable income on shoes? Have you
constructed a shrine to Manolo Blahnik in your home? Do you name your
shoes?</TE>
<TE>   If you answered "yes" to any one of these questions, do we have
something to tell you. We're sure you're familiar with Shuz magazine,
the hefty, glossy quarterly that's the Bible for footwear lovers. If
you have an extra $100 lying around, the publisher invites you to
join the new Shuz Society, whose purpose is "bringing together
passionate soles." Get it?</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, for that chunk of change--payable annually--you'll get a
subscription to the magazine, a monthly newsletter or e-mail that
includes trend updates and a listing of "shoe events" in your area,
plus access to a personal footwear concierge. Imagine it: someone who
will help find that amazing pair of Chanel couture two-tone brown and
pistachio slingbacks you saw in the magazine, or those incredible
gunmetal patent leather thigh-high boots your friend bought in New
York. Membership also entitles you to shoe discounts, as well as
admission to annual Shuz Society Cinderella Ball where you can
preview the hottest styles, meet designers and hobnob with others who
share your obsession ... er, hobby.</TE>
<TE>   "For the shoe enthusiast it's not really about the hunt, it's
about the have," Shuz publisher Mark Hulme told us from his Fort
Worth office. Obviously, he knows his readers. And is it so wrong to
give the true shoe devotee a sense of belonging? Hulme thinks not.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 8,000 different car clubs throughout the nation, but
these [shoe] folks have never had any sort of label," he said. "I
hope the society will do that. Trekkies scare me a little bit, but I
love the shoe enthusiast. She really appreciates the art and craft of
shoes."</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (800) 508-9098.</TE>
<TE>   We have another resource for Saddlin' Up to Go Shoppin', the
mother who is searching for a duster coat for her son. Several
readers recommended the Oil Finish Shelter Cloth Duster Coat from
Filson, a Seattle store that also has a catalog and Web site. The
coat features a plethora of pockets, an optional wool liner and a
storm flap and is 100% cotton with a water-repellent paraffin-based
wax finish. Prices range from $247 to $324. They're online at
smtp2.thewwwstore.com/filson/index.html, or call them at (800)
297-1897.</TE>

<LD>President Bush has proposed spending more than $1 billion a day on
defense next year. He will probably get what he wants, considering
the circumstances. Even so, Congress should resist issuing blank
checks.</LD>
<LD>   Pay raises and better housing for personnel are fully warranted.
But any number of weapons programs, from the Marines' troubled Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft to the Army's bulky Crusader artillery system,
ought to get a very hard look--not be rubber-stamped by generals
defending their turf and members of Congress funneling dollars to
their home districts.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld came into office
pledging a transformation of the military that would shed outdated
equipment and tactics left over from the Cold War. The new emphasis
would be on smaller, more mobile forces, able to reach a trouble zone
quickly and fight in a variety of situations. The proving ground has
been Afghanistan, and the combination of special operations troops on
the ground, supported by carrier-launched fighter planes and by
long-range bombers, has been highly effective.</LD>
<TE>   Like any war, the Afghan campaign has been costly--about $1
billion a month. The cost will, however, fall as the bombing campaign
ends and warships return home.</TE>
<TE>   Bush proposes adding $48 billion to the current year's
$331-billion defense budget. That's a hike of 14%, the biggest since
the defense buildups under Presidents Carter and Reagan, when the
Soviets were in Afghanistan and challenging the United States around
the globe. But in the last quarter-century the U.S. economy has grown
greatly as well, and while the percentage of gross domestic product
given to military spending in the 1980s was about 6%, next year's
spending, if approved, will be about 4% of a $10-trillion GDP.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Rumsfeld pointed out areas of cost savings last
year. He suggested cutting the fleet of B-1 bombers by one-third,
still worth considering even after the plane's good showing in
Afghanistan, and closing unneeded military bases. Members of
Congress, too often unwilling to let bases in their own districts be
closed, unfortunately refused even to consider the issue for at least
two more years. Congress should appoint an independent commission,
like the one that decided the last big round of closings, and vote
yes or no on the entire package. That would remove the onus from
individual legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 reminded Americans lulled by the post-Cold War peace that
the world remains a dangerous place and that an effective military is
necessary and expensive. But in a time of shrinking surpluses and
recession, the money must be spent wisely.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration is expected to announce today that it will
let California do something the state has long sought: use matching
federal funds to offer health insurance to 300,000 poor kids and
their parents. Now that the federal government has come around, Gov.
Gray Davis, who last month proposed delaying this expansion, needs to
show some flexibility. He needs to find alternative budget cuts
fast--and not just because his main GOP rival in the governor's race,
Richard Riordan, is already blasting his delay as "despicable."</LD>
<LD>   California leads the nation in uninsured people; 2 million are
children. The federal money would expand the state's Healthy Families
program to include the low-income parents of eligible children. About
440,000 youngsters are enrolled in Healthy Families now, but the
number of those who qualify is far higher. Research shows that more
children enroll and health care overall improves when coverage in
such programs is extended to parents.</LD>
<LD>   Davis asked to expand this program more than a year ago, when the
state budget was a lot healthier. Late in 2001, facing a
$12.4-billion shortfall and in search of cuts, he proposed delaying
the expansion. This would save the state the $200 million it had set
aside to qualify for about $400 million in federal money. This made
sense, since the feds hadn't agreed to come up with the money anyway.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't make sense now. Yes, the state's share of the costs,
even with a federal 2-to-1 match, is considerable. But delaying the
expansion doesn't make the need go away. It just passes the costs on
to the providers of last resort, the state's already beleaguered
county health departments and hospital emergency rooms. Patients
without insurance tend to delay seeking care until they are sicker
and their treatments more expensive. As it is, hospitals lost so much
money last year that the state allocated $25 million to keep some
from closing their emergency rooms altogether.</TE>
<TE>   The federal money the state could receive between now and July 1,
2003--the date Davis has said he wants the program to start--would
amount to $435 million. The state simply can't afford to turn down
that kind of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Riordan's political hip-shooting, Davis' attempt to save
the state money was the sort of hardheaded pragmatism a governor must
display. But even more important is the ability to change quickly
when circumstances change--especially when the right decision will so
clearly help both constituents and, in the long run, the state's
bottom line.</TE>

<LD>They make an odd couple, President Bush and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.). Bring up tax cuts and they are enemies. On education they
have become the best of friends.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh from their bipartisan overhaul of federal education
legislation, they focus now on preschoolers. They agree on the
importance of reaching children early, before they show up in first
grade unprepared for reading instruction because they don't know the
alphabet or their vocabularies are stunted.</LD>
<LD>   Bush considers the teaching of children through age 5 "a new
frontier'' in education. And in a recent speech at the National Press
Club, Kennedy urged Washington to make educating children under 6
years old a national priority, a wish that the White House is
prepared to help make real.</LD>
<TE>   So far, there are no bills that spell out who, what, when, where
and--the most important matter as deficits replace surpluses--how
much. Even so, the likelihood of a compromise has increased because
the two leaders seem willing to ignore Republicans loath to work with
a Kennedy and Democrats who want to deny the president another
political victory on an issue popular with voters.</TE>
<TE>   The odd alliance has an effective ally in First Lady Laura Bush, a
former teacher and librarian. In testimony Thursday before Kennedy's
Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee, she discussed how
babies learn language, how to increase pre-reading skills and how to
recruit good teachers--for starters by paying more.</TE>
<TE>   Both the president and the senator believe that Head Start, the
preschool program for disadvantaged children that began in 1965,
should become more like school and less like day care. During the
presidential campaign, Bush called for a certified teacher in every
classroom. Kennedy doesn't want to risk urban schools losing good
teachers to preschools. He would improve the quality of preschool
teachers through training, certification and higher salaries.</TE>
<TE>   These aren't big differences. Bush and Kennedy need to seize this
fraternal moment and cut a deal to deliver more money to Head Start,
while revamping that federal program to focus on proven ways to
prepare youngsters for reading. Then, since education is really a
state and local issue, they should persuade Congress to give states
more money and incentives to invest in their own similar programs,
which should include families that earn too much to qualify for Head
Start.</TE>
<TE>   Kids need all the friends they can get in Washington. They can't
vote or write large checks to get things done. Like the big brother
who sticks up for his smaller siblings on the playground, Bush and
Kennedy have stepped forward for preschoolers. Washington's partisan
bullies should get out of the way.</TE>

<LD>Yossi Klein Halevi ("Cycle of Violence Is a Middle East Lie,"
Commentary, Jan. 23) would have us believe that the Israelis are
peace-loving and the Palestinians are war-loving. My Palestinian
friends are peace-loving. They work for justice through peaceful
means. They are the rule, not the exception.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians have seen their land taken, their homes invaded and
destroyed, their olive trees uprooted, their freedom of movement
denied and so on. Israel uses tanks and helicopter gunships, paid for
with U.S. tax dollars, to extend the occupation of Palestinian lands.
They terrorize an impoverished and severely stressed population. The
fact that these conditions lead some into futile acts of violence
should surprise no one.</LD>
<LD>   My question for Halevi and your readers is: What level of offense
by the state of Israel would elicit an unreserved condemnation from
the United States? Israel should not hold itself above international
law, and neither should we.</LD>

<TE>   Praise goes to Halevi. How well he captured the essence of the
tragedy in the Middle East. How tragic that the lessons of the recent
history have been ignored. Hatred, whether in the name of God or a
leader, destroys. The article evoked a memory in this writer, who
witnessed and experienced the hatred of members of the Hitler Youth,
who in the name of the Fuehrer were destroying others.</TE>
<TE>   Hatred leads to destruction; the young must be taught about the
value of life and peace. It must start in the Middle East.</TE>

<TE>   The Times' continued use of the term "militants" when referring to
members of groups such as Hamas (Jan. 23) demonstrates anti-Israel
bias and an ongoing whitewashing of Palestinian acts of violence. If
members of Hamas are militants then so are members of Al Qaeda, the
very group that the U.S. is trying to dismantle. The American public
is ill-served by such editorial manipulation. It lulls us into a
false sense of security. It causes us to forget who the real enemy
is. It blurs the lines between the aggressor, the Palestinian
Authority, and the victim, Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Tell it like it is. Just as Ehud Barak so bluntly put it--if it
walks like a terrorist, speaks like a terrorist and acts like a
terrorist, it must be a terrorist.</TE>

are so hated by the Arabs and Muslims?</TE>

<LD>Re "Class Size Reform Eroding," Jan. 21: The Jan. 10 issue of
Education Week includes a report card on public education in the 50
states. California is one of only three states to receive a grade of
F on adequacy of resources. Our per-pupil spending in 2001, adjusted
for regional cost differences, was $5,603, third from the bottom of
the list of states and 21% below the national average of $7,079.
(Other data showing California closer to the national average are not
adjusted for the state's high cost of living.) Our student-to-teacher
ratio of 20.8 is the second-worst in the nation and lags far behind
the national average of 16.0. We spend 3% of our total taxable
resources on education, seventh from the bottom of the list.</LD>
<LD>   These cold figures have real consequences: shortages of qualified
teachers; overcrowded schools; elimination of science, music and arts
programs; and, now, erosion of elementary class-size reduction,
arguably the most important school reform initiative in the last
decade.</LD>
<LD>   Our schools' situation is unconscionable in a state that
constitutes the world's fifth-largest economy, and it should provoke
deep shame and embarrassment among our politicians and policymakers.
Of course, ultimately it is the voters who bear responsibility for
the crime that is being perpetrated on the state's children.</LD>

<TE>   According to Gov. Gray Davis on Jan. 8, funding for public
education was going to rise in the current budget. Now we learn that
schools have to make drastic cuts in services and raise class size.
Something is wrong, and once again the kids will suffer.</TE>

<TE>   I am a teacher in a middle school and was told that our school
will have to cut $95,000 from our budget for February 2002 through
June 2002. Our staff was also informed that next year class sizes
will possibly increase and teachers may be furloughed for one week.</TE>
<TE>   All the money that has been already spent to decrease class size,
increase literacy and encourage college graduates to become teachers
will have been spent for naught. Politicians have been quick to place
responsibility, as well as blame, at the feet of teachers and school
site administration but continue to provide no consistent support.
The prediction of a serious teacher shortage will definitely become a
reality. It will be our children who will suffer.</TE>

<LD>I have a few questions regarding "Rubin Eyeing Developments in Prayer
Case" (Jan. 22), on the Burbank City Council invocation controversy.
I would like to know exactly what a "secular" prayer is, and what is
the secular purpose of a religious invocation at a government
function? If government-sponsored public prayer really fosters peace
and understanding, then why isn't the Middle East the most peaceful
place on Earth?</LD>

<TE>   I find it shocking that David King, a Mormon bishop, resorted to a
personal attack against Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin.
Rubin's protest, apparently the first in the 49 years of Burbank City
Council prayers, is seconded by a co-plaintiff, noted legal scholar
Erwin Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, who happened to be at a meeting, believes that the
invocation of one's personal religious language is wrong and had the
guts to speak up. Nothing personal.</TE>

appropriate part of government work: This noble body is about to
impose its intelligence and judgment on the people it serves. God
help us all.</TE>

<HD>Enron Fraud: Appoint a Special Prosecutor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re Enron: Let's get this straight. Fraud is fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Enron executives have conspired with their auditors to cook the
books to wildly inflate profits and stock prices, failed to report
illegal transactions, broken multiple rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and then instituted a cover-up by a massive
destruction of files and evidence. The result has been literally
billions of dollars of losses to investors and the virtual
destruction of employee 401(k)s, while they manipulated their
personal stock options and walked away with millions in illegal
profits.</LD>
<LD>   Our attorney general, the overly pious John Ashcroft, has excused
himself for conflicts of interest, as has the entire federal
prosecutor's office in Houston. The administration is staffed by
multiple "graduates" of Enron and is tainted by massive campaign
contributions, as are large numbers of representatives and senators
of both parties. Isn't it time for a special prosecutor?</LD>
<TE>   Malcolm D. Wise</TE>
<TE>   Ontario</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding all the calls I see for a special prosecutor in the
Enron case, with its ties to the Bush administration, I can only say
this: a special prosecutor for what?</TE>
<TE>   Until someone can make some sort of illegal connection between the
two there is nothing but guilt by association.</TE>
<TE>   When a special prosecutor was assigned to the Whitewater matter,
at least there was evidence of a shady land deal and inappropriate
pressure being put on people by then-Gov. Clinton to make improper
loans, for example.</TE>
<TE>   No linkage of this sort has been made between Enron and President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   And until a linkage is made, all these shouts and murmurs for a
prosecutor are nothing but shameless partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Vaczy</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I came away from "Why Insiders Get Rich and the Little Guy Pays"
(Opinion, Jan. 20) ashamed to be a little guy. While we're busy
vilifying the fat cats at Enron and other larcenous corporations for
sticking it to us, it might be wise for us "littles" to examine our
own culpability in the sticking.</TE>
<TE>   Union membership is at historical lows; we allow our
representatives to green-light monopolistic mergers, and we continue
to elect politicians who ignore or undermine real campaign finance
reform.</TE>
<TE>   Until we start protecting ourselves from corporate avarice, we
will continue to be perfect "little" victims.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Buchanan</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I fail to understand why President Bush and Vice President Dick
Cheney are trying to distance themselves from former Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Lay is without question an exemplar of Republican values. Having
taken advantage of his position of privilege to maximize his personal
wealth, whatever the consequences, this role model of Republican
values is at least due a presidential commendation.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hopkins</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is it a coincidence that both Enron and its auditing firm Andersen
started massive document shredding operations about the same time? It
may be a concerted effort to make sure that all the documents no
longer exist. The investigation will be greatly hindered without
documents to support the allegations, especially of criminal
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the new economy highly touted by this administration.</TE>
<TE>   Wimol Chanjamsri</TE>
<TE>   Rowland Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What slays me is that high-ranking CEOs in large companies quickly
learn how to get big money for themselves but in actuality they do
not know how to run a profitable business. This includes successful
orchestration of deregulation that is also for their further benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Bad management is the bane of our existence.</TE>

<HD>AHP Profit Up 17%; Other Drug Firms Lag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three of the nation's largest drug makers posted lower or lackluster
earnings Thursday, hurt by generic competition for key drugs and
plant problems, while American Home Products Corp. bucked the trend
with robust results.</LD>
<LD>   Madison, N.J.-based American Home is one of the few major U.S.
drug firms not facing generic competition for key drugs--a blessing
not shared by rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and
Schering-Plough Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, companies that are having to scramble to fix
manufacturing problems, such as Schering-Plough and Eli Lilly, are
suffering lower profit margins that hurt earnings.</LD>
<TE>   American Home reported fourth-quarter profit rose 17% before
special items, boosted by soaring sales of its antidepressant drug
Effexor and its Premarin female hormone replacement medicines.</TE>
<TE>   Operating profit rose to $823 million, or 62 cents a share, from
$704 million, or 53 cents, in the year-earlier quarter, which
excluded huge charges for settling the liability claims of thousands
of former users of its diet drugs.</TE>
<TE>   AHP shares closed down 16 cents to $64.37 on the New York Stock
Exchange, after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel
rejected a new treatment regimen for the company's kidney transplant
drug Rapamune.</TE>
<TE>   For Bristol-Myers, slowing sales of once-key drugs BuSpar and
Taxol--both of which recently lost patent protection--dragged on
results. The company reported a 9% rise in operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   Net profit rose to $1.5 billion, or 75 cents a share, as sales
rose 10% to $5.3 billion. But excluding drugs from the recent
acquisition of DuPont Co.'s pharmaceuticals unit, sales rose only 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers shares fell $2.53 to close at $46.85 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, struggling to rebound from the loss
last year of U.S. patent protection on antidepressant Prozac, its
flagship drug, saw its operating earnings fall 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly said it earned $656 million before one-time items, or 60
cents a share, matching Wall Street forecasts. Lilly also projected
first-quarter earnings at 56 cents to 58 cents a share, below
analysts' predictions of 61 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Lilly fell 5% in the quarter to $2.8 billion because of a
dramatic 66% drop in Prozac's sales. Lilly's shares fell $1.67 to
$74.10 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough posted an 8% drop in operating profit for the
period, but profit fell by 74% after a $500-million provision for a
potential payment to U.S. regulators to clear up manufacturing
problems at its plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenilworth, N.J.-based drug maker reported net income of $143
million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $571 million, or 39
cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company's fourth-quarter net sales edged up 2% to $2.5
billion, but U.S. pharmaceutical sales fell 6%, hurt by generic
competition and manufacturing issues.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough shares lost 40 cents to close at $33.45 on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Other company earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Eastman Kodak Co., the No. 1 maker of photographic film,
reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $206 million, or 71 cents a
share, contrasted with net profit of $194 million, or 66 cents, a
year earlier. Excluding charges totaling $262 million, or 90 cents a
share, for a previously announced restructuring and other
nonrecurring items, and an income tax benefit of $20 million, or 7
cents a share, earnings for the fourth quarter were $36 million, or
12 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, excluding a charge of
2 cents a share related to the exit of a manufacturing facility,
earnings were $200 million, or 68 cents a share. The Rochester,
N.Y.-based company said fourth-quarter sales fell 6% to $3.36
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Euro Disney, 39% owned by Walt Disney Co., said first-quarter
sales rose 1.8% to $198 million, reflecting an increase in guest
spending on food and merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's Corp.'s profit fell for the fifth straight quarter as
the largest restaurant chain was hurt by job-cutting expenses in the
U.S., higher food costs and declining sales in Latin America and
Asia. Fourth-quarter net income fell 40% to $271.9 million, or 21
cents a share, from $452 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. The
Oak Brook, Ill.-based company said sales rose 5.1% to $3.77 billion
from $3.59 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., the maker of Camel and
Winston cigarettes, said fourth-quarter net income fell 11% as
interest income declined. Net income fell to $89 million, or 93 cents
a share, from $100 million, or 99 cents, a year earlier. The
Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company said sales rose 4% to $2.09
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Tribune Co., the Chicago-based publisher of the Los Angeles
Times, said fourth-quarter earnings before special items fell 45%,
reflecting a severe advertising recession. The company earned $69
million, or 21 cents a share, excluding one-time items, compared with
$124.4 million, or 36 cents, a year ago. Revenue declined 13% to
$1.32 billion. Revenue from publishing, which accounts for the vast
majority of the company's revenue, fell 10% on a pro forma basis.
Television revenue fell 14%.</TE>

<HD>Grocery Wholesaler Resumes Shipments to Kmart</HD>
<DH>Retail: Support from vendors will be a key issue for
discounter as it attempts to reorganize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grocery supplier Fleming Cos. and some other vendors to Kmart Corp.
said Thursday that they have resumed shipments, allowing the discount
retailer to restock shelves as it begins rebuilding after seeking
Bankruptcy Court protection earlier in the week.</LD>
<LD>   Fleming, Kmart's sole grocery supplier, said it has received
assurances that it will be paid today the $76 million it is owed by
Kmart. Other companies that began shipping again included soft drink
maker PepsiCo Inc., lawn and garden supplier Scotts Co. and Home
Products International Inc., which makes ironing boards, storage
containers and other products.</LD>
<LD>   Support from vendors will be a key issue for Kmart as the Troy,
Mich.-based company attempts to reorganize under Chapter 11
bankruptcy. Fleming cut off shipments to Kmart last weekend after the
retailer failed to make a regular weekly payment. That move played a
decisive role in Kmart's bankruptcy filing Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   It was "the signal that sent everybody to the loading docks to
stop the trucks," said James R. Tennant, Home Products' chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming spokesman Randy Hatcher said Thursday that it will be paid
for supplies shipped before the bankruptcy filing because the
Bankruptcy Court has deemed it a "critical vendor" for Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Most Kmart suppliers, however, won't be so lucky, at least in the
short term. They will end up getting checks just for products
delivered after the filing, because those are the only payments
guaranteed by $2.1 billion in financing Kmart arranged with lenders
as part of the voluntary bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Kmart suppliers are back on board.</TE>
<TE>   Dorel Industries Inc., a Canada-based maker of car seats, high
chairs and other furniture, said it is waiting for additional
assurances from company lawyers that it will get equitable treatment
from Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent, hopefully, is to be shipping next week if everything
goes well," said Jeffrey Schwartz, Dorel's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's shares closed Thursday at 93 cents, down 4 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the resignation this month of Paramount Television
Group Chairman Kerry McCluggage, the studio reorganized its
television operation into two divisions and named executives to run
them.</LD>
<LD>   Joel Berman has been named president of Paramount's worldwide TV
distribution. The former head of the studio's domestic TV operations,
Berman will add international distribution and pay TV to his current
responsibilities, which include the development, production and sale
of first-run syndication series such as "Entertainment Tonight."</LD>
<LD>   Paramount's new president of television production is Garry Hart,
who has served as president of Paramount Network Television since
1993 and oversaw the development of network shows such as "Frasier."</LD>
<TE>   Both divisions will report to Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman
Jonathan Dolgen.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Paramount's parent company, Viacom Inc., shifted
responsibility for the struggling UPN network from McCluggage to CBS
Chief Executive Leslie Moonves in a move to consolidate Viacom's two
broadcast network operations.</TE>
<TE>   The economic slowdown has crimped network advertising and the
television industry has been looking for ways to cut costs, including
trimming production expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But Hart and Berman said there would be no "downsizing" at
Paramount.</TE>

<LD>SBC Communications Inc., the nation's No. 2 local phone company,
reported lower fourth-quarter sales and profit Thursday, and said it
would cut thousands more jobs to reduce costs amid lower sales
expectations for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which owns San Francisco-based SBC Pacific Bell, said
its results reflect the ongoing economic downturn, which has dampened
demand for telephone lines and slowed the growth of other services.</LD>

billion, or 37 cents a share, compared with net profit of $1.3
billion, or 38 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Those results include more than $1 billion in special charges from
a proposed merger-related settlement in Illinois, the reduced value
of some international investments and costs related to employee
layoffs, terminated leases and the closure of some operations.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the special items, SBC's fourth-quarter profit rose
slightly to $2.2 billion, or 64 cents a share, up from $2 billion, or
57 cents a share a year ago. Sales for the quarter fell 2.5% to $11.9
billion, down from $12.2 billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, SBC booked net profit of $7.2 billion, or $2.13
a share, including extraordinary items, versus net income of $8
billion, or $2.32 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Traders seemed to shake off the disappointing results, as SBC
shares rose 7 cents to close Thursday at $36.40 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at what the company delivered for the fourth
quarter, what you saw was significantly worse momentum in the core
business than I think people were expecting," said Jeff Halpern, an
analyst at Sanford Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue from SBC's core local phone units fell 3.2% in the fourth
quarter, accelerating a decline that started in the second half of
2001. The company's total number of phone and data lines fell almost
3% in the quarter, including a 4.7% drop in residential lines.</TE>
<TE>   What set analysts on edge was SBC's announcement that future
results also would be lower than previously expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the current quarter, which ends March 30, SBC expects to post
net earnings of 49 cents a share to 51 cents a share, including
special charges related to goodwill adjustments and other items.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects earnings to improve later in the year,
with total 2002 growth of between 5% and 7%, not counting special
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Sales growth this year will be a mere 1% to 3%, according to SBC
Chairman and Chief Executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth estimate is just ugly," said Vik Grover, a
telecommunications analyst with Kaufman Bros. "One percent to 3% is
not very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   To keep up its profit margins, SBC said it has cut back capital
spending, shuttered some facilities and in the fourth quarter reduced
its payroll by 5,000 through layoffs and attrition. Executives said
Thursday that the company plans "thousands" more job cuts this year.</TE>

<HD>Qualcomm Cuts 2002 Forecast</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The wireless technology firm's revenue rises
6.6%. Phone maker Nokia to stick with targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cell phone titans reported mixed quarterly results Thursday and
offered differing forecasts for the year.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc., which licenses patents for mobile
phones, cut its 2002 revenue and profit forecast on
lower-than-expected phone demand. Nokia, the world's largest cell
phone maker, reported smaller profit but left its forecasts for the
year intact.</LD>
<LD>   Qualcomm said it earned $139.2 million, or 17 cents a share, in
its fiscal first quarter, compared with a loss of $419.2 million, or
56 cents, a year earlier. Revenue in the period ended Dec. 30 climbed
6.6% to $698.6 million from $655.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   Qualcomm reduced its fiscal 2002 revenue growth forecast to 5% to
15%, from a November target of 15% to 25%, on slower phone sales
growth. Fiscal second-quarter sales will drop 3% to 6% from the first
quarter, Qualcomm said. Some analysts had expected sales to rise.</TE>
<TE>   The company, whose CDMA technology is used in 103 million phones,
expects to benefit this year from increased sales of phone chips that
provide faster wireless Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia posted a 62% decline in its fourth-quarter profit but left
key forecasts for this year unchanged, including its estimate that
global sales of mobile phones should be in the range of 420 million
to 440 million. The company, based in Espoo, Finland, said it earned
$398.7 million in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $1.05
billion in the same period the previous year. Revenue for the quarter
fell to $7.7 billion, from $8.1 billion the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Net profit for the year fell 44%, to $1.9 billion. Nokia said that
global phone sales in 2001 were about 380 million and that it
increased its market share for the full year to 37%.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Autobytel Inc., the Irvine online automotive sales service,
reported its first quarterly operating profit, of $200,000 or 1 cent
a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. A year earlier, the
company lost $1.9 million, or 7 cents a share, before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. The net loss for the fourth
quarter fell to $900,000, or 3 cents a share, from a deficit of $3.3
million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * EMC Corp., a Hopkinton, Mass., data storage company, reported a
loss for the second straight quarter--though not as severe as
analysts predicted--and a $507-million loss for the year. The company
reported a fourth-quarter loss of $70 million, or 3 cents a share,
compared with net income of $563 million, or 25 cents a share, a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call predicted a loss
of 7 cents a share. EMC said fourth-quarter losses were mitigated by
cost cutting, including job reductions, improved operating
efficiencies and inventory reductions. Revenue for the fourth quarter
were $1.5 billion, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Peregrine Systems Inc., a San Diego maker of software for
keeping track of business property such as computers and vehicles,
said its fiscal third-quarter loss widened as expenses rose almost
four times faster than sales. The loss in the quarter ended Dec. 31
increased to $88.3 million, or 45 cents a share, from $83.8 million,
or 55 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales increased 12% to
$175.2 million from $156.6 million, while costs jumped 58% to $195
million.</TE>
<TE>   * Western Digital Corp., a Lake Forest maker of disk drives used
in personal computers and video game consoles, said second-quarter
profit rose on cost cuts and stable sales. Net income in the quarter
ended Dec. 28 was $12.7 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with
$3.58 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.3% to $574.7
million from $561.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., which began the first U.S.
broadcasts of music and news by satellite Sept. 25, had a bigger
fourth-quarter loss as costs rose more than sixfold. The loss
increased to $143.9 million, or $2.26 a share, from $14 million, or
40 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. The company had $532,000 in
sales. XM first reported sales in the third quarter. Costs rose as XM
spent more than some analysts expected to advertise its $9.99-a-month
service with 100 channels, fewer commercials and better sound quality
than conventional radio.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Record Second Straight Day of Gains</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Earnings reports and Fed chairman's comments
boost stocks despite some late selling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market eked out its first back-to-back gain in almost three
weeks Thursday as Wall Street was encouraged by solid corporate
results and upbeat comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan about the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Greenspan told us things are looking better and that the big
negatives on the economy last year are improving," said Robert
Barbera, chief economist for Hoenig &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   While the markets finished the day in positive territory, stocks
lost nearly half of the gains made earlier in the day.</LD>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index closed up 20.20 points, or
1.1%, at 1,942.58, after rising about 1.8% earlier in the session.
The Dow industrials gained 65.11 points, or 0.7%, to 9,796.07, after
rising 126 points. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 3.97
points, or 0.4%, to 1,132.15, lifted by shares of makers of data
storage systems, chip makers, defense contractors and oil drillers.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 17 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday marked a high point of the fourth-quarter
earnings-reporting season. Results that topped Wall Street's
expectations came from such companies as Nokia, the world's largest
cellular phone maker, and EMC, the world's largest maker of data
storage systems. Nokia gained $1.09 to $23.30, and EMC jumped $2.27
to $16.83.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the positive news, profits on average for S&amp;P 500
companies are down 21.6% for the second straight quarter, the worst
showing in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Budget Committee boosted
stocks after he said, "There have been signs recently that some of
the forces that have been restraining the economy over the past year
are starting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm."
This reinforced the view among traders that the central bank will not
change interest rates when it meets next week, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in weekly U.S. jobless benefit claims also buoyed market
sentiment. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits
fell last week to 376,000 from 391,000 in the previous week,
signaling a stronger labor market than economists had forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter-term Treasury yields spiked. The yield on the two-year
Treasury note rose to 3.14% from 3.01% on Wednesday. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year T-note slipped to 5.01% from 5.02%.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Biotechnology issues took a hit after some downbeat news from
companies such as Amgen, the world's largest biotech company. Amgen
said net income fell 23% because of costs to end collaborations and
inventory write-offs. Amgen shares fell $1.25 to $57.21. The American
Stock Exchange's biotech index fell 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks shot higher as comments on government spending
from Greenspan, coupled with several companies' solid outlooks for
2002, sparked a broad rally. Shares of every major defense contractor
gained ground, and the S&amp;P's aerospace and defense index climbed
3.9%. Raytheon rose $2.14 to $34.24, Northrop Grumman gained $5.19 to
$102.07, and Lockheed Martin rose $1.41 to $49.41.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil drillers also moved higher, led by Halliburton, whose shares
soared despite a cut in the company's credit rating, after it said it
is keeping the cost of asbestos damage claims under control.
Halliburton rose $2.57 to $13.37, or 23.8%. The Philadelphia oil
services index gained 3.7%.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Film Exec Joins Ovitz Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Columbia Pictures Chairman Mark Canton was hired Thursday to
run talent manager Michael Ovitz's film production unit.</LD>
<LD>   Canton will become a partner, chairman and chief executive of
Artists Production Group and will manage a joint film venture the
firm has with Vivendi Universal's StudioCanal that has been slow to
develop. All of the film unit's employees will report to him,
including President Cathy Schulman.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old Artists Production Group has been amassing
development projects but has yet to boast a major film release or
box-office hit. The company's future slate includes some potential
major releases in Michael Crichton's "Timeline" as well as Tom
Clancy's "Rainbow Six" and "Without Remorse."</LD>
<TE>   Canton's most visible job in Hollywood was a five-year stint as
head of Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures unit, which later included
overseeing the company's TriStar unit.</TE>
<TE>   But Canton was fired in 1996 after a series of flops such as
"Multiplicity" and "I'll Do Anything." Within months of his
departure, the studio released a string of hits developed during
Canton's regime, among them "Jerry Maguire," "My Best Friend's
Wedding" and "Men in Black."</TE>
<TE>   Canton then worked as a producer at Warner Bros., but the films he
produced there failed to catch fire at the box office, including "Red
Planet," "Angel Eyes" "Jack Frost" and "Get Carter."</TE>
<TE>   Canton said he recently wound up a joint venture with Germany's
Senator Entertainment and had been exploring other opportunities when
Ovitz and partner Rick Yorn approached him.</TE>

<HD>Rebates Cause Confusion on Tax Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year's tax refund checks are creating widespread problems now
that tax filing season has started.</LD>
<LD>   The "rate-reduction credit"--a credit of $300 to $600 to
compensate those who didn't get tax refund checks last summer--is
emerging as the most common mistake on tax returns this year, IRS
spokesman Don Roberts said.</LD>
<LD>   Some taxpayers who received refund checks are improperly
attempting to claim the credit, the IRS said. Others, who didn't get
checks but are due benefits under the law, are failing to claim them.</LD>
<TE>   Tax-processing centers around the country are reporting that
errors with the refund-check credit are far more common this year
than mistakes in reporting Social Security numbers, which typically
bedevil millions of filers and rank first among taxpayer errors,
Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   The rate-reduction credit is far more complicated than it may
appear, tax preparers say. The rate-reduction credit worksheet asks
taxpayers whether they received an "advance payment of 2001 taxes"
through refund checks. If so, they're supposed to reduce their
rate-reduction credit by the amount of that payment.</TE>
<TE>   However, millions of Americans never received a refund check--but
not because they weren't entitled to one. Their checks were
confiscated or reduced to satisfy unpaid taxes, defaulted student
loans or back child-support payments, government officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Internal Revenue Service withheld or reduced more than 6.5
million refund checks to pay back-tax debts, Roberts said. An
additional 1.5 million individuals had their refunds confiscated or
reduced to repay student loans or money owed Veterans Affairs,
child-support authorities or state tax authorities, said Alvina
McHale, a spokesman for the government's Financial Management System.
FMS also issued roughly half a million checks that were returned as
undeliverable by the Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: 84.5 million of the 91.3 million individuals whom
the IRS identified as being due refunds got checks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all these people who got the credit but didn't get
checks," said Brenda Schafer, senior tax research coordinator at H&amp;R
Block in Kansas City. "If you got less than the maximum, or if you
don't remember how much you got or whether you got a benefit, it
becomes an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Those who can't remember whether they got full refunds can call
the IRS' telephone tax line at (800) 829-4477. This automated line
instructs callers to press "1" to find out the amount of the advance
payment credited to their account last year, which is used to offset
the rate-reduction credit.</TE>
<TE>   If the amount matches the maximum rate-reduction credit for the
individual's filing status--$300 if single; $500 if a head of
household; and $600 if married, filing jointly--the rate-reduction
credit cannot be claimed again on the 1040.</TE>
<TE>   There's another complication for people who can be claimed as
dependents on someone else's return. These individuals did not
qualify for refund checks; technically, the law also barred them from
getting rate-reduction credits.</TE>
<TE>   However, the rebate checks and the rate-reduction credit are aimed
at passing on the benefit of the newly created 10% marginal tax
bracket, which applies to the first $6,000 in income earned by single
filers; $10,000 earned by heads of households; and $12,000 in income
earned by married couples.</TE>
<TE>   The whole process will be simpler next year because the 10%
bracket will be accounted for in tax tables and won't require
worksheets or computations, the IRS said. In the meantime, IRS
officials urge taxpayers to carefully read the instructions.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy, owner of California's third-largest utility, said
fourth-quarter net income rose 13% as costs for buying natural gas
and power fell.</LD>
<LD>   Net income increased to $107 million, or 52 cents a share, from
$95 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 40% to $1.38
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The company was expected to post earnings of 50 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   The company's cost of buying gas for customers fell 38% to $319
million. Power costs fell 82% to $87 million. Earnings at Sempra's
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric utility increased 18% to $45 million. The
company reaffirmed it expects to earn $2.65 a share this year. It
made $2.52 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the market conditions, it's hard to see where growth will
come from," said Argus Research Corp. analyst Jeffrey Gildersleeve,
who rates Sempra "buy" and doesn't own the company's shares.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Diego-based Sempra fell 27 cents to $25 on the New
York Stock Exchange. They have gained 25% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra's power-generating unit had a loss of $13 million,
contrasted with profit of $14 million a year earlier, because of
costs to build new plants and lower electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Del Monte Foods Co. said net income jumped to $18.9 million, or
36 cents a share, from $8.5 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier.
Sales at the San Francisco fruit and vegetable canner rose 9% to
$391.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Temporary staffing firm RemedyTemp Inc. in Aliso Viejo reported
that its fiscal first-quarter net income dropped to $692,000, or 8
cents a share, from $2.9 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Net
income a year ago included a charge of $1.9 million. Revenue declined
23% to $114.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Irvine-based Exult Inc., which operates human resources
departments for companies, narrowed its fourth-quarter net loss to
$15.7 million, or 15 cents a share, from $52.5 million, or 60 cents,
a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $89.4 million from $32 million.</TE>

<HD>Gateway to Slash Jobs, Close Stores</HD>
<DH>Computers: Cost-cutting measures come as the company
reports a net profit of $9.4 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Gateway Inc., the nation's fourth-largest computer maker, announced
Thursday that it will eliminate 2,250 jobs and close 19 stores and
several offices to cut costs as it struggles with reduced industry
sales and a shrinking share of the U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts come as the company reported a net profit of $9.4
million, or 3 cents a share, reversing a year-ago loss of $128
million, or 40 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   "We said we'd return to profitability in the fourth quarter and we
did," said Ted Waitt, Gateway's chairman and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   That profit came despite a 17% decline in domestic sales to
681,000 units.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue plunged 53% to $1.14 billion from $2.45 billion in the
year-earlier quarter, below analysts' expectations of $1.28 billion,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, the company earned $5.1 million, or 2
cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call were expecting Gateway
to earn a penny a share.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway, which laid off 5,000 workers last year, or nearly a
quarter of its work force, does not expect any more layoffs this
year, Chief Financial Officer Joe Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this gets us to the right level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gateway closed at $6.36, down 24 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange before the company's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
Gateway's debt rating to junk status this month after the company
reported that domestic sales fell in the fourth quarter and revenue
would come in below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The warning prompted one analyst, Ashok Kumar of US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, to write that Gateway was "struggling with an unsustainable
business model."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which is turning its focus to more profitable,
higher-end systems, lost market share in the fourth quarter but
remains the No. 4 computer maker in the United States, according to
preliminary findings by IDC, a technology market research firm in
Framingham, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The industry leader continued to be Dell Computer Corp. at 27.5%,
followed by Compaq Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway plans to close its marketing, engineering and
administrative office in Lake Forest; its Web sales office in
Beverly, Mass.; and tech support centers in Rio Rancho, N.M., and
Colorado Springs, Colo. Those closings will bring 1,180 layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The company also will cut 480 jobs at its North Sioux City, S.D.,
manufacturing, sales and support center ; 15 from its sales and
service department in Sioux Falls, S.D.; and 30 jobs at its
headquarters in the San Diego suburb of Poway.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway is closing 19 underperforming Country Stores in
California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Washington state, Ohio,
Texas, Michigan and Illinois.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Probing Milberg's Lawsuits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG, MYRON LEVIN and LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is investigating the activities
of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, a controversial New
York-based law firm that has brought hundreds of shareholder lawsuits
against American corporations, sources close to the case said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Led by San Diego attorney William Lerach, the firm has been at the
forefront of a flood of investor lawsuits filed recently against
bankrupt Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said the probe focuses on Milberg Weiss' financial
arrangements with plaintiffs in a number of cases, in particular, a
Beverly Hills eye surgeon who was convicted in 1999 of faking an art
theft to collect $12.5 million in insurance. Dr. Steven G. Cooperman
had been a plaintiff in more than three dozen shareholder lawsuits,
some of them filed by Milberg Weiss.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators are interested in whether plaintiffs received
improper payments to appear in lawsuits. The U.S. attorney's office
in Los Angeles declined to comment. Calls to the law firm's office in
New York and to Lerach's office in San Diego were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the probe said Milberg Weiss had received a
grand jury subpoena asking for records concerning the firm's dealings
with Cooperman.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is truth to this, it could have a serious impact on
cases that have been resolved as well as cases that are pending,"
said Bruce G. Vanyo, aleading securities defense lawyers in the
United States and a partner at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati in
Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Lerach is considered the king of class-action shareholder
lawsuits, a nemesis to countless corporations, especially those in
Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In a move aimed largely at Lerach and his law firm, American
corporations successfully lobbied Congress in 1995 to override a
presidential veto and pass the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act. The law raised the standards of evidence required to establish
corporate fraud and restricted so-called "professional plaintiffs" to
no more than five class actions in three years.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates and his foundation bought $508
million in shares of Cox Communications Inc., the No. 5 U.S.
cable-television provider.</LD>
<LD>   Cascade Investment, Gates' personal investment company, bought 8.1
million shares Oct. 29, Cox said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation purchased an
additional 5.4 million shares.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft, which analysts say invests in cable firms to ensure it
can sell software for interactive TV and deliver future services over
the Web, had $38.2 billion in cash at the end of last year to make
new investments.</LD>
<TE>   The company is backing Comcast Corp.'s planned $72-billion
acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s AT&amp;T Broadband, the biggest U.S. cable
operator. Cox, loser to Comcast in the bidding for AT&amp;T Broadband,
may now set its sights on Adelphia Communications Corp., perhaps with
Microsoft's support, said David Joyce, an analyst at Guzman &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>Safeway Sees 28% Jump in 4th-Quarter Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Safeway Inc.'s fourth-quarter net income rose 28% as the
third-biggest U.S. supermarket chain cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $384.1 million, or 76 cents a share, from
$299.1 million, or 58 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales
increased 6.7% to $10.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Steve Burd has been lowering costs from theft,
food spoilage and other factors while boosting sales of more
profitable private-label goods. Safeway, whose stores include the
Vons chain, also completed its purchase of Genuardi's Family Markets
in February and added 95 stores in the last year to help increase
sales.</LD>
<TE>   Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose
0.8% from a year earlier, adjusted for the effects of a strike
against the operator of its Northern California distribution center
in the last quarter of 2000. Without the adjustment, sales rose 2.1%,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway rose 75 cents to $40.55
on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 22% in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter results included setting up a reserve for
leases assigned in 1987 to Furr's Inc. and Homeland Stores Inc., both
of which filed for bankruptcy last year.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding these and other costs, Safeway said profit would have
been $409.6 million, or 81 cents a share, meeting the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Safeway may fall short of sales growth forecasts of
3% to 4% over the next five years because of increasing competition.
Rivals Albertson's Inc. and Kroger Co. have been reducing prices.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Biogen Inc. will pay German drug maker Schering as much as $250
million to settle a patent dispute over multiple sclerosis medicines.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. biotechnology company will pay Schering's Berlex unit $20
million initially. If a U.S. appeals court rules that Biogen
infringed Berlex's patents, the company will hand over as much as

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Datek Online Holdings Corp. agreed to pay a $6.3-million fine and
cooperate with regulators to settle charges that its day-trading unit
committed securities fraud between 1993 and 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Atty. James Comey
are probing the day-trading operation and its executives, including
Jeffrey Citron, 31, and Sheldon Maschler, 57. Datek sold the unit to
Heartland Securities Corp. in 1998. The settlement ends the
investigation into Datek.</LD>
<LD>   The day-trading firm improperly used the Nasdaq Stock Market's
small order execution system to gain an unfair trading advantage,
regulators said. The system was designed to execute small orders for
firm's customers, but Datek Securities used it to make millions of
trades for the firm's own account, reaping more than $250 million in
profit, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   Citron, who left the firm in 1999, is chief executive of Vonage
Holdings Corp.</TE>

<HD>Scams Over Slavery Reparations on Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing number of black taxpayers are being misled by scams falsely
claiming they can get tax credits or refunds as reparations for
slavery, the Internal Revenue Service said.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS received about 80,000 tax returns last year claiming
$2.7 billion in reparations refunds, up from 13,000 the previous year.
The majority of claims come from taxpayers in the South, but they
have occurred in all parts of the country--including some involving
Native Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Typical scams use terms such as "black investment taxes,"
"reparations for African Americans" or a "black inheritance tax
refund," the IRS said.</LD>
<TE>   Promoters charge an upfront fee, sometimes a percentage of the
promised refund, and provide a fake tax form for claims that
frequently seek $40,000 to $80,000 from the government.</TE>
<TE>   These con artists often warn clients not to contact the IRS
because the government doesn't want the general public to know.</TE>
<TE>   "Promoters are shamelessly preying upon people," IRS Commissioner
Charles Rossotti said. "In the end, the victims discover their refund
claims are rejected, and their money and the promoters are long
gone."</TE>
<TE>   There is no law allowing the U.S. government to pay reparations or
give tax refunds for slavery. Effective April 15, the IRS will send a
warning letter to taxpayers who filed for mythical slavery
reparations, giving them a chance to submit a corrected return
without fear of penalty. Otherwise, a $500 penalty could be assessed
for filing a frivolous tax return.</TE>
<TE>   IRS agents are stepping up enforcement efforts and increasing
contact with black leaders and churches so information about the
scams is distributed more widely.</TE>

<HD>Valero to Fight Patent Lawsuit by Unocal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline producer Valero Energy Corp. said Thursday that it will
fight a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by Unocal Corp. that
alleges it violated Unocal's clean-air gasoline patents.</LD>
<LD>   The patents are on a process to refine gasoline that meets
Environmental Protection Agency requirements, used at a third of the
nation's pumps to combat smog.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio-based Valero is one of the nation's top producers of
gasoline and other fuels. It produces about 2 million barrels a day
from its 12 U.S. refineries.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say Unocal's patents make for an unfair monopoly on the
EPA's cleaner-burning gasoline, and are partly responsible for higher
fuel prices.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil Corp. last year successfully urged a Federal Trade
Commission investigation of Unocal's fuel patents, claiming they were
an unfair monopoly. The investigation is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal also said Thursday that it would report a fourth-quarter
loss as it writes down the value of Gulf of Mexico sites by $86
million in response to lower energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding items, profit would be in line with the 24-cent average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call, Unocal
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal will report earnings Tuesday. Unocal shares rose 42 cents
to close at $34.62 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Microsemi Corp., a maker of semiconductors for computers and cellular
telephones, said it will close a plant in Watertown, Mass., that
employs about 300 people.</LD>
<LD>   The plant will be shut in several phases during the next six
months to a year and its functions transferred to other Microsemi
operations, the Irvine company said.</LD>
<LD>   Microsemi and other semiconductor manufacturers have faced slowing
sales growth because of a sluggish economy and excess inventories.
The company last year closed or consolidated three of its
underperforming businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Microsemi also said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 4% to
$4.26million, or 14 cents a share. Sales in the period ended Dec. 30
fell 9.5% to $57 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it will take a second-quarter charge for closing
the Massachusetts plant.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came after the close of regular U.S. trading.
Microsemi shares rose $1.20 to $22.38 on Nasdaq, but fell as low as
$20 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<LD>Alaska Airlines is proving that in the post-Sept. 11 airline
industry, it helps to have some northern exposure.</LD>
<LD>   Although most carriers have made massive cuts to weather the
plunge in air travel, Alaska has made only moderate trims in service
because demand for its flights is holding up fairly well.</LD>
<LD>   With its routes concentrated in the Northwest and West Coast, the
airline expects to be back to full strength next month and will even
expand a bit later this year.</LD>
<TE>   Alaska's Seattle-based parent company, Alaska Air Group
Inc.--which also runs the short-haul regional carrier Horizon
Air--has not laid off any of its 11,000 employees, while the rest of
the industry slashed roughly 100,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all this business is, is people," said Alaska Chairman and
Chief Executive John F. Kelly. "We looked at layoffs. They're not
going to save any money; they're just going to upset people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   But Alaska's decision to stay the course is risky. By keeping its
service largely intact, the nation's ninth-largest airline is losing
money like nearly every other carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest Airlines, the leader in providing low-cost, low-fare
service, is the only major carrier that has neither cut back service
nor laid off anyone since Sept. 11, and it's barely profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is betting that Alaska, by holding its expenses in check,
can keep its full network and recover financially when the airline
business starts to improve later this year, as many expect.</TE>
<TE>   "In our profit-planning and budgeting for 2002, we're really
trying to sharpen the pencil," Kelly, 57, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the strategy could work. Alaska's passenger
traffic "is still strong enough" to warrant keeping its schedule
full, especially because some competitors "have been cutting back,"
said Betsy Snyder, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the Shuttle by United, which was a major competitor, and
now it's gone," she said, referring to the decision by United's
parent, UAL Corp., to abandon the West Coast shuttle after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "With the big guys cutting back capacity, it's giving the smaller
guys like Alaska opportunities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska, known for its Eskimo logo that adorns the tails of its 102
planes, serves nearly 80 cities domestically--including Los Angeles,
Burbank and San Diego--and in Canada and Mexico. It flies up and down
the West Coast and although Seattle is its hub, it has 31 daily
departures out of LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The airline has several things working in its favor. About a third
of its business is flying people to and from Alaska, and ground
travel really isn't an option.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska's costs, though not as low as Southwest's, are still lower
than many other carriers, enabling Alaska to keep discounting fares
to fill its planes. Yet the full-service airline still captures a
good portion of the more lucrative business travel in the Pacific
Northwest, owing to its strong route structure in the region.</TE>
<TE>   And Alaska's service is far away from the East, so its passenger
traffic hasn't been dented as much by the terrorist attacks and the
fear of flying. "We're far removed from that portion of the world
that was affected," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Alaska's service could be appealing "this summer to
all the [West Coast] vacationers who want to stay local" because the
Sept. 11 attacks are still on their minds, S&amp;P's Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, Alaska is expected to report today a
fourth-quarter loss of about $60 million (excluding its portion of
the federal bailout program enacted after the terrorist attacks).
It's forecast to lose about $30 million for all of this year,
according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   But some on Wall Street see Alaska returning to the black faster
than most carriers. And analysts are quick to note that, before Sept.
11, Alaska was one of the few airlines that was profitable as the
others struggled in the face of the weakening U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska joined Southwest and Continental Airlines in posting a
second-quarter profit last year, and Alaska made a $25-million profit
in the horrendous third quarter. The latter earnings included
Alaska's portion of the federal bailout cash, but even without the
aid Alaska earned $7 million in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The airline also has about $670 million in cash, and currently
sees no need to apply for a federal loan guarantee, another part of
the bailout package. Some analysts also are recommending Alaska's
stock, which has jumped 38% since Sept. 11 to outpace both the
airline industry as a whole and the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index. Alaska's shares Thursday dipped 25 cents to close at
$30.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska is a buy "as a result of the carrier's good niche in the
Pacific Northwest and their relatively good liquidity position,"
analyst Raymond Neidl of investment firm ABN Amro said in a recent
report.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska was still recovering from its own travails when Sept. 11
struck. Two years ago this month, an Alaska MD-83 crashed into the
ocean off Ventura County, killing all 88 people aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The crash led to findings of lapses in Alaska's maintenance and
training (along with criticism of the Federal Aviation
Administration's oversight), but Alaska says it has adopted all the
new procedures mandated by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We produced an extremely comprehensive plan" to fix the problems
and "we have only one objective in mind: that's to be a model of
safety and compliance," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelly has other objectives, such as redirecting airplanes to
new routes where Alaska thinks it can turn a better profit. He's
taken some jets out of frequently served routes and used them to
create service between Los Angeles and Cancun, Mexico. In April,
Alaska will launch nonstop service between Orange County and
Vancouver, Canada, and will begin serving Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is to build up service to "growth cities on our hit list
that are ... strategically important to us," Kelly said.</TE>

<HD>Enron Hid Losses, Ex-Worker Says</HD>
<DH>Energy: Manager warned executives $500-million deficit was
attributed to another unit to create illusion of profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Enron Corp. manager warned top company brass in August that
more than $500 million in losses from the firm's energy services unit
were being hidden in another division so the unit could misleadingly
report profit to Wall Street, a copy of her e-mail reveals.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations by former employee Margaret Ceconi were made in an
Aug. 29 e-mail to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, who Wednesday resigned
from the empire he built.</LD>
<LD>   Ceconi's e-mail apparently wasn't connected to another
whistle-blower memo sent by Vice President Sherron S. Watkins to Lay
in mid-August.</LD>
<TE>   Although Watkins warned that losses hidden in off-balance-sheet
partnerships could cause Enron to "implode in a wave of accounting
scandals," Ceconi's concerns focused on the juggling of losses within
Enron units. A copy of her e-mail was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ceconi, whose allegations were  reported Thursday in
the Houston Chronicle, losses of more than $500 million were
transferred from Enron Energy Services to Enron Wholesale
Services--the firm's lucrative trading unit--in a financial sleight
of hand to deceive investors and analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Until last spring, the energy services unit was co-headed by
Thomas E. White Jr., who now is Army Secretary. He could not be
reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings," Ceconi wrote.
"This is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is
actually joked about. But it should be taken seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Ceconi wrote the e-mail--a rambling memo in which she lashes out
at Enron management--after she was fired from EES. She complains in
the memo that she was "fraudulently" recruited with misleading
information about EES and then unfairly let go.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer could not be reached Thursday. In the
Chronicle he characterized Ceconi as a "disgruntled" employee, but
would not comment on the specifics of her memo.</TE>
<TE>   Ceconi could not be reached for comment. But her attorney,
Demetrios Anaipakos, said her concerns about the accounting practices
outweighed her personal beefs with Enron. "She felt that EES was
being portrayed as a money-making operation when it was exactly the
opposite," he said.</TE>
<TE>   EES provided energy services to commercial and industrial firms,
promising them predictable long-term energy supplies and improved
energy efficiency. Enron touted the unit as having huge growth
potential.</TE>
<TE>   According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Enron revamped the EES unit last year, moving some commodity
"risk-management activities" to the Wholesale unit.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the restructuring, Enron restated its second-quarter
2000 results for EES. Originally, the unit had revenue of $840
million and operating income of $24 million. After the restatement,
revenue was cut in half to $420 million, but profit almost doubled to
$46 million.</TE>
<TE>   The restructuring could have been "an attempt to move a
money-losing operation into a segment that was more profitable," said
Randy Beatty, dean of the accounting school at USC, who reviewed the
SEC document for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said Enron repeatedly restructured operations to
boost the financial results of individual units. "They kept
restructuring the business segments so they could shift earnings from
one section to another," said Prudential Securities analyst Carol
Coale.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts said companies can freely restructure their
operations, thus altering the reporting of profits and losses. But,
said William Kinney, an accounting professor at the University of
Texas in Austin, such reorganizations should be done for valid
business purposes, not just to "move things around."</TE>
<TE>   "It's subject to abuse if you're trying to hide bad performance,"
Kinney said. But proving intent is difficult, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaipakos said Ceconi, who left a senior job at GE Capital to join
Enron in late 2000, received a call from someone in human resources
after she sent the e-mail. "She was told her allegations were being
taken seriously, [but] I can say she never heard from them again," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ceconi, now employed by a Houston consulting firm, also contacted
the SEC by phone twice in August and September to voice her concerns,
Anaipakos said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some would say the house of cards [is] falling," Ceconi wrote in
the e-mail to Lay, which also complained of favoritism and
discrimination at the company.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to decide the moral or ethical things to do, to right
the wrongs of your various management teams. I wish you luck."</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Turns More Optimistic</HD>
<DH>Economy: The Federal Reserve chairman says signs are
improving and a recovery won't depend on a proposed fiscal stimulus
plan now in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan painted a somewhat brighter
picture of the economy's progress out of recession Thursday and said
the fiscal stimulus package that Washington is about to debate might
not be needed after all.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan accentuated the positive in an effort to offset the
impression he left in a Jan. 11 San Francisco speech that the
recovery faces "significant risks." The speech sent stock prices
tumbling and the bond market flying.</LD>
<LD>   "There have been signs recently that some of the forces that have
been restraining the economy over the past year are starting to
diminish and that activity is beginning to firm," he told the Senate
Budget Committee on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   But the Fed chairman did not change his basic story about the
economy's condition, nor budge from his position that the recovery is
likely to begin later and prove less robust than most investors and
forecasters seem to think.</TE>
<TE>   "The [financial] markets have been assuming a far more rapid
snap-back than I frankly think is likely to happen, mostly because we
haven't gone down that far," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rose on Greenspan's new assessment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq
composite index jumped 20.2 points, or 1.1%, to close at 1,942.58.
The bellwether Dow Jones industrial average climbed 65.11 points, or
0.7%, to 9,796.07. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was up
3.97 points, or 0.4%, to 1,132.15.</TE>
<TE>   Bond traders, who only two weeks ago seemed convinced the Fed
would cut interest rates further, now are betting the central bank
will leave its key rate unchanged when the bank's policymaking
Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. The
so-called fed funds rate, which banks charge one another for
short-term loans, is at a four-decade low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Both the White House and Senate Democrats renewed calls Thursday
for a fiscal stimulus plan to spur recovery. But differences between
the two sides' proposals dim chances of anything passing. And as if
that weren't enough, Greenspan offered such a tepid endorsement he
effectively suggested that he opposes the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan declared himself conflicted over a stimulus package but
concluded, "I do not think it is a critically important issue .... I
think the economy will recover" whether or not a package is approved.</TE>
<TE>   As he has before, Greenspan pointed to the unusual nature of the
recession, saying it is concentrated in the nation's business sector,
rather than among consumers, as with most other downturns in the last
five decades.</TE>
<TE>   He said the economy should get its first shot in the arm when
companies, which have let inventories of goods run down to cut costs,
begin replenishing their stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "With production running well below sales, the potential positive
effect on income and spending of the inevitable cessation of
inventory liquidation could be significant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After that, he said, it depends critically on what consumers do.
To date, they have continued spending at a surprisingly strong pace,
prompted at least in part by low prices and the cash drawn from
mortgage refinancing.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said consumers' continued enthusiasm could be dampened
if employers continue to lay off large numbers of workers, but added
there are signs "suggesting some abatement in the rate of job loss."</TE>
<TE>   The Fed chairman said the economy's ultimate fate depends on a
revival in profits and business capital investment. He did not say
when he thought either would occur. Some cautious forecasters have
suggested it could take most of this year and some of next before the
business sector comes back strongly.</TE>

<HD>Kerkorian Answers Ex-Wife's Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he entered his 80s, MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian didn't relish the
prospect of a public court battle with a woman less than half his
age. And so, over the last six years, the billionaire paid more than
$10 million to keep former tennis pro Lisa Bonder Kerkorian happy and
silent about their relationship, according to a lawsuit that offers
the first glimpse of his side of the story.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Kerkorian went public this month with a 33-page declaration
filed in the couple's divorce file. She laid bare details of their
lavish lifestyle and asked for a record $320,000 a month in child
support for their 3-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Kerkorian has fired back with a 21-page lawsuit accusing her
of violating confidentiality clauses about their decade-long
relationship, marriage and divorce.</LD>
<TE>   Kerkorian says he bought her houses in Beverly Hills. He gave her
$1 million to move to New York. He forgave her debts. And in August
1999, nearly a year and a half after she gave birth to daughter Kira,
he called in the lawyers, acknowledged paternity and married
Bonder--albeit for one month.</TE>
<TE>   All Kerkorian asked in return, according to the lawsuit filed
Friday by his business lawyer, Terry Christensen, were six signed
confidentiality agreements in which she swore to keep his finances
and personal life secret.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian says in the legal papers that his ex-wife, 36, kept
upping the ante: $1 million in 1996, $4 million in 1997, $2.5 million
in 1999, along with forgiving $2.9 million of her "personal debt,"
and $3 million in 2000 to fix up her Beverly Hills house, which he
agreed to buy for $8 million. (The sale never went through and he has
placed a lien on the property.)</TE>
<TE>   As her money demands increased, Kerkorian's court papers say, so
did her threats "to reveal any and all information available to her."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian's lawyer, Stephen A. Kolodny, said the allegations
are untrue. "This lawsuit's stupid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Santa Monica, seeks to cancel the real estate
agreement and award damages for her alleged breaches of the other
contracts. He also asked the court to order Lisa Kerkorian and
Kolodny to stop divulging personal details in public records.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian says she disregarded Kira's best interests by
making the dispute part of the public divorce case when it could have
been handled discreetly through the sealed paternity case. No
hearings have been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The escalating dispute is about how much money it takes to
properly raise a billionaire's daughter, but the child in question
has been eclipsed by the personal charges and countercharges
exchanged by the litigating parents.</TE>
<TE>   Kira turns 4 in March, two days before her parents are due in
court in downtown Los Angeles for a hearing on the child-support
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   As it now stands--and the lawyers say there is more to come--the
court battle is a he said/she said spat, with each party using court
filings to get in the last word and malign the other.</TE>
<TE>   He said: She's a gold digger who engaged in "a six-year-long
campaign" to part him from millions of dollars, "using methods
ranging from pleas of poverty to various threats," not the least of
which was to tell all. They haven't lived together since 1995, and
she's using the child "as a pawn in an elaborate plan to obtain for
herself even larger sums of money." He refers to Kira in court papers
as "defendant's daughter," never as his own.</TE>
<TE>   She said: He's a commitment-phobic control freak who walked around
with $10,000 in his pocket and dropped $45,000 a couple of times a
year for custom-fitted Brioni clothes. They cohabited, off and on,
until August 2000, when she caught him out to dinner with another
woman. "I should not have to be a slave to Kirk's personal
manipulation, abusive personality, economic coercion and financial
control in order to provide Kira with that to which she is entitled."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the heady amounts involved in the child support case,
the dispute has gained national notoriety--despite the millions
Kerkorian paid to maintain his privacy. On television, it is referred
to as the case of the billionaire baby.</TE>
<TE>   As the ex-couple's lawyers, Kolodny and Dennis M. Wasser, appeared
earlier this week on the "Today" show's split screen, anchor Katie
Couric expressed amazement that the child's pets, including a bunny,
require $436 a month for sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   What does the bunny eat? Beluga? Couric asked.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbit has become emblematic of the issues in what legal
experts say is a test case for wealthy parents and their children.
Kerkorian was quietly paying far more child support than the courts
have ordered any other father to pay.</TE>
<TE>   In court documents, Lisa Kerkorian lists Kira's monthly expenses,
including: $144,000 for travel; $14,000 for parties and play dates;
$7,000 for charity; $4,300 for food; $2,500 for movies, theaters and
outings; $1,000 for toys, videos and books; and $436 for care of
Kira's bunny and other pets.</TE>
<TE>   In her declaration, Lisa Kerkorian says that after spending nearly
a decade with her billionaire boyfriend, she decided to leave him in
1997. Then, she learned she was pregnant with Kira.</TE>
<TE>   After Kira was born, Kerkorian agreed to pay $50,000 a month in
child support, then $75,000. Lisa Kerkorian filed her suit after he
cut off the extra cash and dropped the child support to $50,000.</TE>

<HD>Recession Might Hit Latinos Hardest</HD>
<DH>Study: The group includes a vast immigrant population
especially vulnerable to a downturn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON  and PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latinos, a group that made major economic strides in the late 1990s,
could rank among the biggest losers of the current recession,
according to research released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Concentrated in industries hammered by layoffs and lacking the
education and financial resources of other ethnic groups, Latinos are
seeing hard-won economic gains erode as their unemployment rises.
Forecasts released by the Washington-based Pew Hispanic Center
predict that Latino family income, employment and poverty rates are
unlikely to return to pre-recession levels until late 2004 at the
earliest.</LD>
<LD>   And if the current downturn were to mimic the early-'90s
recession, Latino unemployment would not return to its pre-recession
levels until March 2008--two years later than whites and African
Americans, said Jonathan Orszag, a researcher who prepared employment
forecasts for the study.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's fair to say that Latinos will be hit the hardest by
the economy, and it will be toughest for them to rebound," said Eric
Rodriguez, economic mobility project director of the Latino rights
group National Council of La Raza. "We need some provisions that are
going to provide some basic protections for families and help workers
get better jobs."</TE>
<TE>   A variety of factors explain why Latinos appear especially
vulnerable to a downturn, chief among them a vast immigrant
population possessing limited English, education and job skills.</TE>
<TE>   Still, researchers say their most surprising--and
discouraging--finding is that many young American-born Latinos are
faring  worse than their immigrant parents in employment. The jobless
rate for second-generation Latinos hit 9.6% in December, compared
with 8% for their first-generation counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about people who were born and educated here,"
said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan
organization affiliated with USC. "Clearly, it's something we all
should be paying attention to. That's the future work force."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos account for just more than  11% of the U.S. work force,
and about 28% of California's labor force.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew researchers remain optimistic about the long-term economic
prospects for Latinos, who made significant strides in the late
1990s. From 1995 to 2000, Latino median family income rose by 27%,
compared with 11% for all families. But Latino employment has fallen
dramatically recently.  Last month, the Latino jobless rate reached
7.8%, up from a record low of 5% in October 2000. That rise has been
similar to that of African Americans, whose unemployment rate reached
10.2% in December from a record low of 7.3% in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Second-generation Latinos--English-speaking, American-born,
U.S.-educated children of at least one immigrant parent--posted even
higher unemployment rates than first-generation Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Age explains some of the difference, said Arturo Gonzalez of the
University of Arizona, who contributed to the Pew research. Gonzalez
said the average age of the 10 million second-generation U.S. Latinos
is 19, compared with 37 for first-generation immigrants. Younger
workers with less experience typically  have higher unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   But Gonzalez said the low academic achievement of U.S.-born
Latinos also is a factor.  Only about 8% of U.S. Latinos have a
bachelor's degree or more, compared with 33% of non-Latinos. Gonzalez
said American-born Latino youths often have more schooling than their
parents, and high enough aspirations that they don't want to follow
them into low-paying, blue-collar work. Yet they lack the education
and skills.</TE>
<TE>   They are young people such as 22-year-old Jaqueline Yanez of Boyle
Heights. She's been laid off from two jobs in the last year, the
first as a stock clerk, the other as a cashier. An 11th-grade
dropout, Yanez knows she needs a diploma if she ever hopes to realize
her dream of working in a hospital. But for now, she'll take a job.
Any job.</TE>
<TE>   "I've put in 20 applications in the last month, and nothing," said
Yanez, who lives with her parents. "I'm older, so it's embarrassing
not to have a job. I want to be independent."</TE>

<HD>A Renewed Call to Redo Accounting</HD>
<DH>Reform: Two years after initially urging changes in
industry, a former SEC chairman has Senate panel listening closely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Arthur Levitt couldn't muster much support for a
proposal to make accounting firms more independent by limiting their
ability to sell consulting services to their audit clients.</LD>
<LD>   Amid strong opposition from the accounting industry, corporations
and members of Congress, the then-chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission backed down.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, however, the same proposal held the rapt attention of
a roomful of fawning senators and caused Levitt to be mobbed by
reporters after his testimony.</LD>
<TE>   "So do you feel completely--or just absolutely,
totally--vindicated?" quipped Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   In another sign that government priorities have changed as a
result of the Enron Corp. bankruptcy, the Senate on Thursday held its
first full committee hearing to examine why the energy giant
collapsed and what the government could have done to prevent the loss
of billions of dollars by employees and investors.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing set the stage for what is certain to be a vigorous
debate in the coming months over sweeping regulatory proposals to
rein in financial markets, retirement funds, campaign fund-raising
and the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, promised Thursday to lead an
aggressive nonpartisan investigation into the Enron debacle, seeking
answers from government agencies including the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "We will follow the facts wherever they lead us," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions Lieberman hopes to answer are: How did Enron
hide its debts and losses from SEC oversight? Could the Labor
Department have intervened to prevent Enron employees from losing
their retirement savings? Are Wall Street analysts providing
objective analysis of stocks? Did regulatory gaps allow Enron's
problems to slip through the cracks?</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans warned against rushing to new regulations. Only a
year ago, the Bush administration and the Republican Party were
vowing to slash government rules in many of the same areas currently
under a microscope.</TE>
<TE>   The blame for Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2--less than a month
after it restated earnings to account for $586 million in previously
unreported losses--may ultimately rest with illegal activity of
individuals, not a breakdown in regulation, said Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "No system known to man can prevent unscrupulous and clever
individuals from manipulating the system and even getting away with
it for a period of time," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   He also warned Democrats not to try to take political advantage of
the investigation by focusing on "titillating" issues, such as the
contacts between Enron officials and the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt called upon Congress to pass new laws to tighten regulation
of financial markets, which he said have been eroded by a "culture of
gamesmanship that says it's OK to bend the rules, tweak the numbers
and let obvious and important discrepancies slide."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to renewing his call for limits on the types of
consulting work accounting firms can perform for an audit client,
Levitt said companies should be required to change audit firms every
five to seven years; stock exchanges should require that a majority
of directors on company boards be independent; and analysts should be
forced to disclose how their compensation is affected by their firms'
investment relationship with companies they cover.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt and Lynn E. Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant, said
a new accounting oversight board is needed with independent members,
reliable funding and a mandate to move quickly and aggressively to
eliminate accounting loopholes and gimmicks.</TE>
<TE>   Turner said it has taken the Financial Accounting Standards Board
longer to approve new rules for special-purpose entities--the kind of
off-the-books partnerships used by Enron to mask its problems--than
"it's taken my children to get through high school."</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives trading is another area ripe for government
regulation, said University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy,
who told the committee Thursday that Enron's heavy reliance on the
high-risk market rivaled that of the Long-Term Capital Management
hedge fund, which failed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Partnoy said, Enron reported earning more money from
trading derivatives in 2000 than Long-Term Capital Management made in
its history.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron makes Long-Term Capital Management look like a lemonade
stand," said Partnoy, a former derivatives trader who is writing a
book about Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives, used by sophisticated investors as a risk-management
tool, are complex financial instruments whose value is based upon a
future variable, such as interest rates or gas prices.</TE>
<TE>   Though some derivative trading occurs on regulated exchanges, the
vast majority--more than $95 trillion a year--take place on
over-the-counter markets that were exempted from regulation in 2000
under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.</TE>
<TE>   Enron used derivatives in two ways. First, they were key to
structuring Enron's controversial partnerships, which allowed it to
hide debt, mask investment losses and inflate earnings. Enron used
them as a kind of financial "plastic surgery to make itself look
better than it really was," Partnoy said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they were key to Enron's profit. The company used its
Enron Online division to act as a go-between for other parties
wishing to trade not only energy-related derivatives, but also
contracts for such commodities as fiber-optic bandwidth. By the time
Enron filed for bankruptcy, the soaring revenue from the derivatives
trading business was masking problems in Enron's core energy
business.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of government oversight may have enabled Enron to smooth
out profits from derivatives trading to make the business appear less
volatile. He said that was accomplished by creating accounts that
enabled Enron to carry over trading profits from year to year.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokesman could not be reached for comment on Partnoy's
allegations.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Warrior Wields the Cello</HD>
<DH>Deals: Walter Hewlett emerges as a fierce opponent in the
battle over HP's proposed purchase of Compaq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The people on the boards of America's biggest corporations, often
chief executives elsewhere, are chronically overextended. Sometimes,
problems at their own companies force them to miss a board meeting or
two, as former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has lately at
Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett, however, might be the
first Fortune 500 director to skip a crucial strategy session because
of a prior commitment to play the cello.</LD>
<LD>   That choice helps illustrate why Hewlett, a philanthropist,
academic and amateur athlete who is the biggest obstacle to HP's
$25-billion bid for Compaq, ranks as one of the most unusual
corporate warriors in decades.</LD>
<TE>   "He is the most unlikely guy to wind up in this situation I could
possibly imagine," said Gerald Grinstein, former chief executive of
Burlington Northern Inc. and chairman of HP spinoff Agilent
Technologies Inc.,  on the board of which Hewlett also serves.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's associates say he felt compelled to fight the merger
publicly not for any emotional bond to his father, the company
co-founder, but because he takes his responsibilities as a
philanthropist seriously. And most of the money in his family's
foundation is in HP stock, which Hewlett believes will decline with
Compaq's weight.</TE>
<TE>   With several big HP shareholders planning to vote against the
Compaq acquisition and Hewlett courting others, HP has turned to his
unusual background in an attempt to derail the proxy campaign.</TE>
<TE>   HP sent a letter to 750,000 investors last week, deriding the
co-founder's 57-year-old son as a "musician and academic" who "has
never worked at the company." HP says more experienced
businesspeople, including HP CEO Carly Fiorina and the rest of the HP
board, are in a better position to advise shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett certainly has had an unorthodox career. But interviews
with a wide range of colleagues suggest that he is more of a
Renaissance man than a dilettante.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter is not a flake," said Grinstein, who credits Hewlett with
being a pragmatic and early advocate for Agilent selling a
health-care instruments business that his father had helped nurture.
Hewlett declined interview requests.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest of William R. Hewlett's five children, Walter Hewlett
took after his father in many respects. A math star in Palo Alto
public schools, he had frequent conversations with Bill Hewlett about
the company's technology and strategy, and he embraced his father's
management philosophy of egalitarianism and consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Now married with three children, Hewlett studied physics as an
undergraduate at Harvard University, where he became a star
long-distance runner. He was interested in business and could have
excelled at it, but friends believe he decided not to pursue a
traditional corporate path because of his father's long shadow.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Silicon Valley in the mid-1960s, joining the board
of his parents' charitable trust (the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation owns about 5% of HP) and earning the first of three
advanced degrees. He gravitated from engineering to operations
research, another rigorously analytical field, and then to music and
music theory.</TE>
<TE>   The Hewletts had long been a music-loving family, with father and
son  known to listen to a Puccini recording and  argue over who the
conductor must have been. While working in Germany, Walter grew
interested in Bach, then in rare organs from that era, said Michel
Guite, who shared Hewlett's Stanford dorm.</TE>
<TE>   One day at Stanford, "Walter just put up a sign that said 'Bach B
Minor Mass tonight, bring your own instruments,'" Guite said. People
dragged out clarinets, bass guitars and violas for the spontaneous
concert. "Walter was at the heart of such things," Guite said.</TE>
<TE>   Although proficient at cello and organ, Walter Hewlett was never
going to be a world-class performer or composer. He reverted to his
analytical skills instead, working to develop a system for
transcribing written music into electronic databases for study and
inexpensive reproduction, potentially saving cash-strapped orchestras
vast amounts of money.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't any obvious way to go about doing that," said
Hewlett's chief academic collaborator, Eleanor Selfridge-Field.
"Because he had such a good background in so many fields, he was able
to develop a system."</TE>
<TE>   The books, papers and databases that Hewlett and Selfridge-Field
produced at Hewlett's Center for Computer Assisted Research in the
Humanities haven't set the world on fire. But they have been "a
significant contribution to national and international projects,"
said Christoph Wolff, a Bach scholar at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett also helped the educational world in more practical ways.
As an advisor to Harvard and then a member of the university's Board
of Overseers, Hewlett funded and led an effort to wire one dorm for
digital communications in the early '90s, far ahead of other
universities. And he gave early direction on using the Internet for
distance learning, said former Harvard President Neil Rudenstine.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming from well outside the academy, he showed that he could
learn very quickly what a complex institution was like, and could
understand and respect its own way of doing things, and understand
important things that it might do," Rudenstine said.</TE>
<TE>   And he has kept his interest in business. When Guite worked as a
Salomon  Bros. analyst following the fractious communications
industry, Hewlett tagged along to industry executives' meetings for
big investors. His predictions about the value in local phone lines
seemed so perceptive that Guite asked him to join in buying a Vermont
phone company and serve as chairman. Vermont Telephone Co. has been a
small but profitable investment for both men. It has one of the
biggest U.S. penetration rates for high-speed lines, which reach 28%
of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a serious mistake to view Hewlett's thoughtfulness and
non-confrontational style as a weakness of will, friends said. After
all, he still undertakes marathon bike races over mountain ranges.</TE>
<TE>   A conscientious shepherd of his charity's assets, Hewlett's
concern for future giving has forced him into the spotlight now,
associates said. Worried that the merger with Compaq will depress
HP's value, he hired outside analysts who came to the same
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   All of that happened after the pivotal board discussions of July
19, which Hewlett missed when he kept a long-standing commitment to
perform with the orchestra at the exclusive Bohemian Grove retreat
north of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Other directors who were worried about taking on Compaq's troubled
personal computer business changed their minds during the talks that
day, which were the first to include investment bankers. When Hewlett
returned the next day, he said he was still opposed. Hewlett missed
two other meetings during the Compaq negotiations, according to
recent regulatory filings, while no other directors missed any after
Fiorina told them of early discussions in late June.</TE>
<TE>   "I have huge respect for Walter as an individual, but I have felt
very frustrated at the board not being able to engage Walter in
constructive dialogue about what to do for the future of HP," said HP
director George Keyworth II.</TE>
<TE>   HP's attempt to paint Hewlett as an out-of-touch aesthete,
however, doesn't wash with investors, including those who have heard
him and his team present their case against the Compaq acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very thoughtful person who, if he had his druthers,
wouldn't be engaged in this activity," said David Katz of Matrix
Asset Management, which opposed the merger before hearing from
Hewlett. HP "is trying to make this into a personality conflict, but
Walter Hewlett is not being a lone wolf. If the analysts had gone the
other way, you would never have heard another word from him."</TE>

<HD>Timeout Exactly What Safin Needs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The controversy over injury timeouts was rekindled at the Australian
Open at a most crucial juncture in today's semifinal between
seventh-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany and No. 9 Marat Safin of Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-nine minutes into their match--down a set and a service
break--Safin called for a trainer at the changeover, using a
three-minute injury timeout on a hot humid day here. He complained
there was no reaction in his legs, had his legs massaged and took
Vitamin C and aspirin. Haas led, 7-6 (5), 3-2, when Safin made his
move, and the development turned the momentum of the match.</LD>
<LD>   Safin promptly got the service break back in the next game, as an
unnerved Haas double-faulted twice and appeared to be upset about the
string tension of his racket. Australian television commentators
asserted the injury timeout was improperly used.</LD>
<TE>   The potential abuse of injury timeouts came under scrutiny the
second day of the tournament when Spaniard Alberto Martin used one in
the middle of a tiebreaker against Australian Lleyton Hewitt in his
first-round upset, saying he was cramping. Amid the furor, Grand Slam
officials planned to examine the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Martin match, Safin took the timeout on a changeover.
But his problems appeared not to be related to an injury, rather, it
looked like severe fatigue. The treatment seemed to revive Safin, who
had two set points in the 10th game of the second. Haas saved them
both and stayed alive. In the second tiebreaker, Haas won the first
three points before Safin rallied, taking the set, 7-6 (4), leveling
the match as this edition went to press.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Safin was the one with the fraying temper. After he lost
the first set in a tiebreaker, and his serve to trail, 1-2, in the
second, Safin smashed his racket after hitting a backhand out.</TE>
<TE>   Safin, who will turn 22 on Sunday, was trying to reach his first
Slam final since winning the U.S. Open in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Haas, 23, has not been in a Slam final as his best previous finish
was the semifinals here three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Already waiting in the final was No. 16 Thomas Johansson of
Sweden, whose previous best Grand Slam showing came when he twice
reached the U.S. Open quarterfinals in 1998 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson held his nerve in a tense semifinal against No. 26 Jiri
Novak of the Czech Republic, 7-6 (5), 0-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, a match
that lasted nearly three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really nervous before the match," Johansson said. "I never
played in a Grand Slam final. I was really tight, and in the whole
match, I was just fighting. I will be even more nervous before the
final."</TE>

<HD>Capriati Takes the Gloves Off in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Body language suggested Jennifer Capriati's Australian Open title
defense was teetering and tottering in the semifinals against Kim
Clijsters of Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   Clijsters saw that Capriati was tiring and she heard it too. "She
was puffing," Clijsters said.</LD>
<LD>   The Belgian teenager had just equalized their match, winning the
second set with a gambling topspin half-volley winner.</LD>
<TE>   And then, just as quickly, Clijsters was gone. Maybe there is
something to Capriati's kick-boxing regimen. She has been training
with a former world kick-boxing champion, who is here in her
entourage, and the defending champion and top-seeded player did
everything but take No. 4 Clijsters out with a swift left foot
Thursday, winning their semifinal, 7-5, 3-6, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   The first game of the third set was pivotal. Capriati fought off a
break point when Clijsters' attempted drop shot landed in the net and
went on to take a 3-0 lead before Clijsters won her lone game of the
set.</TE>
<TE>   And so, Capriati erased the doubts about her fitness and potential
second-year blues, earning a place in the final against third-seeded
Martina Hingis of Switzerland, a rematch of last year's final.
Hingis, who beat eighth-seeded Monica Seles in three sets in the
semifinals, is 5-3 against Capriati but has lost the last three
matches they've played.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati and Hingis have effectively traded places.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time going up against her, it's like she is the
underdog and I'm the one kind of favored to win because I won it last
year," Capriati said. "And I definitely know how she feels being in
that position because I was in that position last year."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hingis: "She has to defend the title and I'm the rookie."</TE>
<TE>   Overconfidence didn't help Hingis last year. After beating Serena
and Venus Williams to reach the final, the feeling in the locker room
was that Hingis felt the heavy lifting was over, especially because
another hard hitter, Lindsay Davenport, was out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati in a Grand Slam final was an unknown quantity, a seeming
novelty. After losing, 6-4, 6-3, Hingis got the message that Capriati
was a powerful force who could easily dismiss her.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati again beat Hingis at the French Open, in the semifinals,
on her way to winning the second leg of the Grand Slam last year.
After that, the 25-year-old reached the semifinals of Wimbledon and
the U.S. Open and was named female athlete of the year by Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   Since the French Open, Capriati has not won a title. Hingis ended
an 11-month drought by winning two weeks ago at Sydney but has not
won a Grand Slam tournament since the 1999 Australian Open. She has
masked her desperation with an omnipresent smile but redoubled her
physical efforts after ankle surgery last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's written in the media and then maybe it's somewhere in the
back of your head, but I knew I didn't have quite the game at that
point to always raise it another notch in the finals," said Hingis,
who will be playing in her sixth straight Australian Open final. "The
last year here, I was tired, and at the French Open, Jennifer just
played well and I wasn't just there. She was just better at that
point.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last two, three years, it was different circumstances.
The other girls caught up with me and I just couldn't raise it. But
now I think I'm moving forward and playing better than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis appears more comfortable in the role of pursuer, losing
only one set in six matches. Through the first five rounds, she
dropped only 14 games. Capriati has lost two sets but seemed to
relish the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati has found strength from her family and friends. Last
year, her mother, Denise, could not make the trip because of hip
surgery, but she was able to travel to Melbourne this time. Two years
ago, Denise and Jennifer read about a local center for cancer victims
and picked up the phone, arranging for several of the young adults to
come to the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   A tight bond was formed. After the Clijsters match, Jennifer's
mind was on a friend who could not make it, a young man named Darren.</TE>
<TE>   She explained that he would be at the final but had been absent
for the semifinal because he was receiving a blood transfusion.</TE>
<TE>   "In his mind, he's going to beat this," Denise said. "They've been
terrific friends over the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   Darren did send a message of support, Jennifer said.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that I'm The Ledge," she said, smiling at the symmetry.</TE>
<TE>   The words were the ones she used years ago, in 1990, to describe
legend Martina Navratilova. Now they were being used about her. No
wonder Capriati was smiling.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Williams, slowed by a series of strokes and congestive heart
failure in recent years, was back in a Gainesville, Fla., hospital
Thursday with a high temperature and low blood pressure.</LD>
<LD>   The 83-year-old baseball Hall of Famer was taken from his home by
ambulance to Shands Hospital at the University of Florida, about 50
miles away. He had open-heart surgery last January.</LD>
<LD>   Williams was given fluids and antibiotics in the intensive care
unit, and his vital signs improved, The Boston Globe reported
Thursday night. His temperature was 100 degrees before he arrived, it
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Dad's doing all right," son John Henry Williams told the
newspaper. "He's got some sort of cold or flu or something. But he's
far from dead."</TE>
<TE>   The family at first didn't think it was serious enough for
Williams to go to the hospital but decided not to take a chance.
Williams said his father might return home today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The hearing on the grievance by players to block contraction
resumed, then quickly recessed until the week of Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Management labor lawyer Rob Manfred was the only witness Thursday,
the 11th day of testimony before arbitrator Shyam Das. Management
lawyers finished their cross-examination of Manfred, who was called
as a witness by the union.</TE>
<TE>   When the hearing resumes, the union intends to put additional
questions to Manfred on redirect.</TE>
<TE>   After that, players intend to call Paul Beeston, baseball's chief
operating officer, and at least two other management officials.</TE>

<HD>Duke, Boozer Have Answers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Boozer turned a battle of the backcourts into a blowout.</LD>
<LD>   The Duke center tied his career-high with 28 points and had seven
rebounds on Thursday night at Boston as the top-ranked Blue Devils
opened a 29-point first-half lead and coasted to an 88-78 victory
over Boston College.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got the best perimeter in college basketball," Boozer said.
"I try to complement those guys so they can make threes and break
down the defense."</LD>
<TE>   Dahntay Jones had 18 points and six rebounds and Mike Dunleavy had
16 points, five rebounds and five assists for Duke (17-1), which has
won five consecutive games by an average of almost 20 points since
its only loss, to Florida State, on Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the third week of our season. That's the way we look at
it," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   Boozer's play overshadowed the matchup of two of the nation's top
backcourts. Duke's Jason Williams leads the Atlantic Coast Conference
in scoring and Boston College's Troy Bell is the top scorer in the
Big East.</TE>
<TE>   Bell and backcourt mate Ryan Sidney, each had eight turnovers, but
they outscored Williams and Chris Duhon, 36-25. Still, there was no
question which was the better team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at the bottom line," Eagle Coach Al Skinner said.
"They won, we lost."</TE>
<TE>   Williams scored 15 points and Duhon had 10 with seven assists for
the Blue Devils.</TE>
<TE>   Bell scored 26 points and Sidney had 10 as Boston College (14-5)
lost for the fourth time in its last six games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Virginia 93, Virginia Military Institute 59--J.C. Mathis had
career-highs of 20 points and 15 rebounds in 29 minutes at
Charlottesville, Va., and the Cavaliers defeated the Keydets for the
22nd consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia (14-2) improved to 99-15 in the series despite playing
without starting center Travis Watson and guard Adam Hall, who were
both nursing injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Jason Conley had 25 points for VMI (6-12), which lost for
the eighth time in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers led 49-29 at halftime and didn't let up after the
break, starting the second half with a 20-7 run and allowing Coach
Pete Gillen to clear his shortened bench.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Mason Jr. had 17 points, Elton Brown had 15 and Jermaine
Harper had 13 for Virginia. Freshman Jason Clark had eight of
Virginia's 13 blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Conley also grabbed 11 rebounds for the Keydets, but got little
scoring help. Ben Rand and Preston Beverly each scored eight points
for VMI.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Gonzaga 93, San Francisco 73--Blake Stepp scored 21 points
and Dan Dickau had 19 as the Bulldogs defeated the Dons at Spokane,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga (17-3, 4-1 West Coast Conference) improved to 39-1 at home
over the last four years, including 22 consecutive victories. Zach
Gourde had 17 points for the Bulldogs, off to their best start in
school history.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco (8-10, 3-2) trailed 49-48 early in the second half
when Gonzaga went on a 20-4 run as the Dons lost their shooting
touch.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's Darrell Tucker, who came into the game averaging
more than 18 points, was held to five. The Dons scored only 10 points
in the first 11 minutes of the second half and shot just 33 percent
in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga finished with a 49-28 rebounding advantage.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Ohio State 69, Michigan 47--Brian Brown scored 17 points
and Brent Darby had 16 at Columbus, Ohio, as the Buckeyes (15-2, 6-0)
pulled away in the second half to their ninth consecutive victory and
13th in a row in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   It was Ohio State's most lopsided victory over its chief rival in
34 years.</TE>
<TE>   Lavell Blanchard had 11 points for Michigan (7-9, 3-4).</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Miami 76, Villanova 58--Darius Rice had 30 points and 10
rebounds at Miami to become the first Hurricane player to have
consecutive 30-point games since Eric Brown in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Rice was 10 of 15 from the field and had four three-pointers for
Miami (18-2, 5-2 Big East), which improved to 12-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Buchanan had 15 points for Villanova (10-6, 3-4), which has
lost four of five.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How important is it to pick a quarterback high in the NFL draft?</LD>
<LD>   Drew Sharp of the Detroit Free Press did some research and found
it's not very significant. For instance, the last two Super
Bowl-winning quarterbacks--Kurt Warner in 2000 and Trent Dilfer in
2001--both went into their championship seasons as training-camp
backups, Warner as a free agent.</LD>
<LD>   "There have been 15 quarterbacks taken among the top 10 picks
since the 1990 draft," Sharp wrote. "Only three have participated on
divisional playoff weekends for two consecutive years--Drew Bledsoe,
Steve McNair and Donovan McNabb.</LD>
<TE>   "And who can forget David Klingler, Heath Shuler and Cade McNown?
Chances are, you have."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many times have the Winter Olympics been held in
the United States?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the tee: New Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier is known
for his short practices and busy golf schedule. This prompted Nick
Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune to offer a suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Spurrier will be the only NFL coach with an alarm clock on his
desk set for 5 p.m. [He] should bring in Ryan Leaf. Instead of
third-and-long, they could discuss the third hole and how long their
tee shots were."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More on Spurrier: Brian Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel: "Nothing
in Gator Nation could have been more sudden and surprising than the
retiring of Steve Spurrier. Unless it was the sudden and surprising
hiring of Ron Zook.</TE>
<TE>   "In a matter of five days, the Gators have handed the headsets
from Spurrier to Zook, which is like leaving a supermodel for Plain
Jane."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The old days: Norbert Schemansky, winner of four Olympic medals,
is considered one of the world's greatest weightlifters. Now 77, he
told Jerry Green of the Detroit News how times have changed.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't any more Olympics," he said. "They're the money
games. There's no more real Olympic spirit. I was looking at a
picture of a kid skiing in Sports Illustrated. He's got 13
endorsements. His headband's got a name on it. The poles got a name
on it. The skis got a name on it. His laces got a name on it."</TE>
<TE>   Schemansky never had an endorsement. "You couldn't take anything,"
he said. "If I was competing now, I'd be a millionaire. Budweiser
would sponsor me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attention, NFL: A rhythmic gymnastics judge who was suspended for
poor standards had his appeal rejected by the Court of Arbitration
for Sport in Switzerland. The International Gymnastics Federation
said the unnamed judge had been "guilty of scandalous,
unsportsmanlike behavior and serious mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you're interested: England defeated India by 16 runs in a
one-day cricket match in Calcutta. From the AP report: "Durham
all-arounder Paul Collingwood, with 71 not out, and Yorkshire's
Michael Vaughan, 63, were England's top batsmen as the tourists made
250-7 from their 50 overs."</TE>
<TE>   Got it?</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: Three, Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1932 and 1980, and
Squaw Valley, Calif., in 1960</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Odom to Miss at Least Three Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, forward Lamar Odom will be lost to the Clippers for much
longer than a game or two. The team announced that Odom will be
sidelined for at least three weeks because of a sprained right wrist,
an injury originally suffered Dec. 16 against the Detroit Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   Odom's wrist was placed in a cast Thursday and he was put on the
injured list. Forward Harold Jamison, who has been on the injured
list since Dec. 20 because of a shin contusion, was activated.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry had been hinting for some time that this was
the best way to go with Odom. There was no sense having him play with
one healthy wrist while attempting to keep pace in the competitive
Western Conference.</LD>
<TE>   Odom said the other day, "I do want to play down the stretch. It's
frustrating trying to play with one hand. The pain is just too much."
He also said he believes he returned too quickly Jan. 2 after sitting
out three games.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, Odom will sit out until the Clippers'
return to action after the All-Star break with a Feb. 14 game against
the San Antonio Spurs at Staples Center. He already has been
sidelined for six games because of the injury and probably will miss
at least eight more games.</TE>
<TE>   Odom is averaging 13.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists in 29
games. Corey Maggette has been filling in for Odom at small forward
and is expected to continue in that role. Maggette matched his career
high with 28 points in Wednesday's victory over the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after their best victory of the season, the Clippers
rested. Rallying to defeat the Lakers earned them a day off from
practice Thursday, and more praise from Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great win for us," Gentry said of the Clippers' 95-90
victory. "What it tells me is that we're headed in the right
direction. We've been able to come back from a 30-point loss [in the
Dec. 14 game] to beat this team. We want to beat them. They are the
measuring stick for the whole league. We're trying to make this a
rivalry by winning games."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Jeff McInnis put it this way: "This is bragging rights. We
respect them, but we just wanted to win and show we could play too.
Winning will be great for our confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a game we had to win and we came out in the second half
and fought real hard."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' victory was only their second over the Lakers in 20
games.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry believes the Lakers' current struggles are a mere hiccup
for the two-time defending champions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what their record is now, before anybody wins an NBA
championship, they're going to have to go through that team," Gentry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was pleased to see Laker center Shaquille O'Neal score only
24 points and take only 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "To think you're going to stop him is kind of ridiculous," he
said. "You try to slow him down.... We did about as good a job as you
can do on Shaq. We made him earn his points."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly didn't hurt the Clippers' cause to have their center,
Michael Olowokandi, outplay O'Neal at times Wednesday. Olowokandi,
who gives away an inch and at least 70 pounds to O'Neal, had 12
points and 12 rebounds.</TE>

<TE>   Forward Thinking</TE>
<TE>   With forward Lamar Odom expected to be sidelined at least three
weeks because of a sprained ligament in his right wrist, Corey
Maggette will take his place in the Clipper starting lineup, as he
has already done 14 times this season. A look at Odom's season

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Next Victory Will Finally Put Murray in 500 Club</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>This has been an inch-by-inch drive to a moment that doesn't mean
much to Duck Coach Bryan Murray's big picture.</LD>
<LD>   With one more victory Murray will reach 500 for his coaching
career, tying him with Toe Blake for seventh on the all-time list.
Yet, there are other matters on his mind.</LD>
<LD>   When the season began, Murray needed 16 victories for 500 and 32
losses to reach 400. He reached 400 losses Monday and is still
awaiting 500.</LD>
<TE>   When 500 will come is a guess. The Ducks play Dallas tonight, a
long shot. On Saturday, they face Nashville, but that will be their
second game in as many nights. St. Louis on Monday is unlikely.
Columbus at home Wednesday is a possibility, except the Ducks are 0-3
against the Blue Jackets this season.</TE>
<TE>   All of which shows the chore that has kept Murray too busy to
worry about No. 500. In fact, when asked about the push for 500 a few
weeks ago, his  record wasn't what jumped to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can just win a few games ... oh, 500 victories," Murray
said, thinking the question was about the Ducks getting their record
to .500.</TE>
<TE>   Murray grinned and added : "It seems to be taking forever now from
the start of year."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Dallas, 5:30, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--American Airlines Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--XTRA (690).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Ducks 15-29-6-3, Stars 23-17-6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Stars--0-0-1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Stars, who have won five consecutive division titles,
are struggling to catch San Jose. They are 2-3 in their last five
games and are four points behind the Sharks.</TE>

<HD>A Trying Debut for Tryon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The PGA Tour's youngest rookie received a rude welcome Thursday in
the Phoenix Open.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen-year-old Ty Tryon figured the toughest part of his debut
would be nerves. He also had to deal with cold, blustery conditions,
and a golf swing that went on recess during a front nine that left
him numb.</LD>
<LD>   "The more bad shots I hit, the more nervous I got," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Tryon recovered with a birdie on his final hole for a six-over-par
77. Only one other player fared worse in the opening round, although
Tryon was hardly concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Neither was the man 13 strokes ahead of him, Steve Flesch, who ran
off four consecutive birdies and wound up with a 64 for a one-stroke
lead over Duffy Waldorf.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, he won't shoot many 77s," Flesch said. "I saw
Q-school on TV when he shot 66 with everyone watching. Today was
knocking a little rust off, getting through that first PGA Tour
round. He'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Tryon concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go through the toughest part, I guess," he said. "It
might get a little easier from here, but I'm happy I went through it.
You've got to experience the bad shots."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, he gained a lot of experience Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't hit a fairway until his eighth hole, and that was with
an iron. He didn't have a birdie putt on any of the par fives. Birdie
opportunities were scarce.</TE>
<TE>   His round ended with a 20-foot birdie putt that he tracked all the
way into the cup, giving a faint fist pump and a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough day," he said. "It was windy, cold, I was nervous
and I was hitting shots that I didn't want to hit."</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh had a 66 and was joined by Matt Kuchar, Skip Kendall
and Tom Lehman. Mike Weir and Cameron Beckman were among those at 67.
John Daly, Fred Couples and Charles Howell III were at 68.</TE>
<TE>   The only score worse than Tryon belonged to Dudley Hart, who had
an 80.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Board, in a surprise move, gives approval to
two companies to start offering services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Horse Racing Board on Thursday approved licenses for
two companies to begin taking bets by phone and over the Internet,
surprising many industry leaders who had been skeptical that phone
betting would be in place this soon.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-member board, meeting before a standing-room only crowd
in Monrovia, ratified the action of Gov. Gray Davis, who signed the
bill into law last summer, making the system legal Jan.1.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from Magna Entertainment Corp., which owns Santa Anita,
said that they would begin opening accounts for bettors on Saturday,
and Mark Wilson, president of the Television Games Network (TVG),
said that customers opening accounts today would be able to bet the
quarter horses from Los Alamitos Race Course tonight.</LD>
<TE>   One other application was temporarily turned down and a fourth
application was withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   The license for Frank Stronach's Magna company, which will be
known as XpressBet,  is for two years, whereas the TVG license runs
through the end of this year. Magna doesn't have a plan in place to
televise the races into the homes, while TVG's coverage of races is
already seen in about 700,000 homes in California, something that
gave board members pause. They want to study the extent of
cannibalization--the erosion of on-track attendance--before they
extend the TVG license.</TE>
<TE>   For many, phone betting is seen as the last gasp for racing, a
sport that hit upon the hardest of hard times in the 1990s and has
continued to battle uphill against casino gambling, offshore
bookmakers, other sports and an aging fan base.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the start of a new era in California racing,"
Wilson said. "What is racing, 13th or 14th in popularity among all
sports? Maybe this will bring the game back to the status it had
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Landsburg, chairman of the racing board, would like to think
that phone betting, combined with expanded coverage of the  sport on
television, will broaden the fan base. New York City's phone-betting
network, introduced in 1970, was a red-ink proposition until 1995,
when telecasts of races into the home helped turn  off-track betting
into a billion-dollar business.</TE>
<TE>   But Landsburg, a horse owner and successful TV producer-director,
is not dreaming blindly.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are calling [phone betting] an absolute necessity for our
survival," he said. "Racing has a history of having white knights
ride into these meetings. I think we should move cautiously, because
I've seen too many tarnished white knights. ... Maybe we're planting
a very small seed that will grow into something."</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, Landsburg joined fellow commissioner William
Bianco in voting against the Magna license application, preferring to
delay approval until its application contained more specifics about
developing new fans. But Landsburg and Bianco were outvoted by board
members Roger Licht, Sheryl Granzella, Marie Moretti, John Sperry and
John Harris, who were less concerned that Magna's TV coverage of
California races is still theoretical.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be as aggressive as possible in moving forward
with our program," said Jim McAlpine, president of Magna
Entertainment. "The fact that we've spent $300 million on our
California tracks in the last three years says that we're committed
to racing. This is not about recycling the fans we have, it's about
growing the business."</TE>
<TE>   The trainers' group and influential owner-breeders such as Marty
Wygod and Gary Biszantz also opposed Magna's license approval, but
the application of TVG, which is a subsidiary of the monolithic
Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., sailed through via a 7-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Television is the way to popularize racing, not the Internet,"
Biszantz said.</TE>
<TE>   For almost a year, Magna and TVG talked about joining forces, but
then negotiations broke off late last year, because, McAlpine said,
TVG insisted on an exclusivity clause. As a result, phone betting
will begin in California with horseplayers required to maintain
separate accounts, depending on which track they want to play. The
Stronach tracks--Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields and Bay
Meadows--will not be carried by TVG, and the races from Hollywood
Park, which is owned by Churchill Downs Inc., a Stronach rival, will
not be available to Magna account-holders.</TE>
<TE>   "Multiple licenses will still serve California well," said Jack
Liebau, president of Magna's three California tracks. "Competition
should be good for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   One group that appears pleased to co-exist with Magna and TVG is
the Thoroughbred Owners of California (TOC). It was imperative that
Magna and TVG have signed contracts with TOC--to insure how much of
the betting handle would be funneled into purse money--before the
racing board could consider their applications. John Van de Kamp,
president of the TOC, said that the owners' share of phone betting
will increase dramatically in several areas.</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine said that starting Saturday, bettors with phone accounts
would be able to play races from 40 tracks, including the Magna-owned
Santa Anita, Golden Gate and Gulfstream Park in South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   TVG, while waiting for the Hollywood Park season to start in
April, will step up its coverage of Los Alamitos. The network, which
used to shut off its coverage of the Orange County track at 9:30
p.m., will now carry full cards, and it also plans to install a
permanent studio for its hosts at the track.</TE>

<LD>Mark Hardy first made his mark with the Kings as a tough, versatile
defenseman, but now he's succeeding as an assistant coach in charge
of the team's penalty-killing unit, which began Thursday's game
against Minnesota ranked No. 1 in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   "Harpo is very dedicated," said veteran winger Kelly Buchberger,
who played against Hardy when he was a member of the Edmonton Oilers.
"He's done a tremendous job preparing us for every team that we're
playing. He's always watching tape of every situation and breakout a
team uses.</LD>
<LD>   "He makes us take a lot of pride, and we don't want to let him
down."</LD>
<TE>   Hardy, who ranks 15th on the Kings' all-time scoring list with 303
points, played 15 seasons in the league and coached with the Detroit
Vipers and the Ice Dogs before joining the Kings' staff three seasons
ago..</TE>
<TE>   Penalty-killing specialist Ian Laperriere credits Hardy's
attention to detail.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, when we went through a stretch where teams did not
score against us for a while, he kept putting pressure on us,"
Laperriere said. "He kept telling us that we weren't perfect. He
would point out every little thing he noticed on tape. We know that
there are always something that we could be doing better, which is
good because it keeps us sharp and honest."</TE>

<HD>Kings Like a Good Ending</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Miller, Palffy and Laperriere score third-period
goals in a bunch to end any doubt in 4-1 victory over the Wild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can string together all of hockey's "key to winning" cliches to
describe the Kings' 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild. And they
would all fit because the bottom line is that good teams win games
such as the one the Kings won Thursday night in front of 15,917 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   After toying around for nearly 55 minutes, the Kings delivered a
finishing kick to put away the stubborn Wild to move within five
points of first-place San Jose in the Pacific Division.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Aaron Miller broke a 1-1 tie 14:57 into the third
period, then Ziggy Palffy added his second goal of the game 150
seconds later and Ian Laperriere followed with his sixth goal of the
season to finish off the win for King goaltender Felix Potvin, who
had 19 saves.</LD>
<TE>   In going 15-4-3 over their last 22 games, the Kings have put
together a better record than they had when they went 13-4-5 over
their final 22 games of last season, when they finished with a
furious run to qualify for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, improving to 23-18-7-2, are only a point behind Dallas
for seventh place in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We played real bad for two periods but we were patient," forward
Steve Heinze said of the Kings' late rally.</TE>
<TE>   "We just waited them out ... it was a boring game but we came
through in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings have been one of the league's hottest teams
since mid-November, General Manager Dave Taylor recently said people
should not be surprised if he makes a trade to pick up another
forward for the stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   With center Eric Belanger being placed on the injured reserve list
earlier this week because of a wrist injury and winger Bryan
Smolinski out because of flu symptoms, the Kings were a little thin
up front against the Wild. That's one reason Taylor isn't ready to
stand pat now.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting to see about Eric," Taylor said. "He tried
practicing the other day but his wrist wasn't very good so he will be
out a while longer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could add one piece we would like to pick up another winger
to the lineup. Getting a wing to play among our top six forwards
would be a priority."</TE>
<TE>   One area the Kings did fill recently was enforcer when they
recalled left wing Ryan Flinn from Manchester on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Because left wing Ken Belanger is still sidelined because of a
broken thumb, Flinn is being counted on to keep opposing teams in
line.</TE>
<TE>   After being a healthy scratch against the Mighty Ducks on Monday,
Flinn got his first chance against the Wild and he didn't disappoint.
Just ask Minnesota captain Brad Brown, crushed by a right cross from
Flinn 6:23 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Flinn's impressive debut must have inspired his teammates because
43 seconds after he picked up his first NHL fighting major, the Kings
took a 1-0 lead on Palffy's 13th goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   With Minnesota on a power-play, the Kings attacked goaltender
Manny Fernandez from all angles and Palffy scored a short-handed goal
from the right circle after defenseman Mattias Norstrom's shot from
the blue line deflected off the skate of a Wild defender.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which lost in overtime at Anaheim on Wednesday, refused
to roll over after falling behind by a goal. Even though the Kings
are 13-5-2-2 when scoring first this season, they failed to extend
their lead in the opening period and were outshot, 9-8, over the
first 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild made the Kings pay for their off-the-mark shooting in the
second period, picking up a goal similar to the way Palffy scored in
the first. .</TE>
<TE>   After center Jason Allison was sent to the penalty box for
interference, Minnesota scored a rare power-play goal against the
Kings when defenseman Nick Schultz banged in a score off the leg off
Norstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin never had a chance and the Wild tied the game, 1-1, 5:42
into the second.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, it was only the fifth power-play goal allowed in
the last 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The forecheck scheme that we use has been working for us and our
goaltending has been key," forward Kelly Buchberger said about the
Kings' penalty-killing. "Your goaltender has to always be your best
penalty-killer at all times. Our defensemen have also been really
strong and our forwards have been sacrificing themselves."</TE>

<LD>Panic may be setting in around greater Los Angeles, but not in El
Segundo, where the Lakers practice.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, they are stinging from Wednesday's 95-90 loss to the
Clippers. They don't like their recent trend of falling to teams with
losing records, either.</LD>
<LD>   But now is not the time to go into crisis mode.</LD>
<TE>   "If we could put our finger on it, I don't think we would ever
lose," Kobe Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio should present some motivation to a team that needs
it. Despite the absence of Shaquille O'Neal, who was finishing up his
three-game suspension for swinging at Chicago's Brad Miller, the
Lakers embarrassed the Spurs, 98-81, last week at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   Another trend is this: In the three games the Lakers have played
after losing two in a row this season, they've won by an average of
28 points. They have not lost three in a row in Phil Jackson's
two-plus seasons as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson may be ready to shake things up. On Thursday, he didn't
rule out any lineup or rotation changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge and the challenge is we've been playing .500
ball since about the middle of December," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the great start. Right now, we're not a great team."</TE>

<DH>Still Searching for Fame and Fortune, Mosley Is Leaving His
Promoter</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shane Mosley, frustrated by his inability to win the fame and fortune
of Oscar De La Hoya despite winning the only professional fight
between them, is leaving promoter Cedric Kushner after Saturday
night's fight against Vernon Forrest in the Theater at Madison Square
Garden.</LD>
<LD>   In the future, Mosley, an undefeated welterweight from Pomona,
plans to use whichever promoter is offering the best deal for a
particular fight.</LD>
<LD>   He is also signing with IMG, hoping the marketing group can
increase his visibility and appeal outside boxing.</LD>
<TE>   "This is what I believe will work," Mosley said. "Oscar is in the
mainstream, but Oscar is still in the boxing world as well. I've just
got to get into the mainstream and I'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley should be a marketer's dream--handsome, articulate,
scandal-free and, arguably, the best fighter, pound for pound, in the
world. The World Boxing Council welterweight champion, he is 38-0
with 35 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he hasn't fought on pay-per-view since beating De La Hoya in
June 2000; all three of his bouts since then were free to HBO
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   And he hasn't fought in a big arena since he and De La Hoya met in
Staples Center, stuck instead in small venues like the 5,000-seat
Theater for his matches against Antonio Diaz, Shannan Taylor and
Adrian Stone.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has left Mosley unfulfilled and perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   Lou DiBella, formerly a key HBO executive and now an advisor to
several fighters, says it is tougher for Mosley because he is African
American.</TE>
<TE>   "An African-American fighter is disadvantaged in this marketplace,
no matter how good he is," DiBella said. "Unfortunately, if an
African American is not getting headlines with bizarre behavior, if
he is not getting the publicity required to be featured on broadcast
television, it's going to be tough for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Premium cable and pay-per-view have made this more a niche
business. In a broadcast world where a million homes is a big number,
the African-American fighter does not have the national market of a
Latino fighter. The Latino community is the most loyal audience for
pay-per-view. A bilingual, Latino fighter is viewed as the most
desirable fighter today.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone always used to talk about the Great White Hope. Today, a
white fighter still has an advantage over an African-American fighter
even if the white fighter has marginally inferior skills."</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Bob Arum disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "That's ludicrous," Arum said. "It was always the African-American
fighters, like Ray Leonard, like Muhammad Ali, like Sugar Ray
Robinson, who were the biggest draws in boxing."</TE>
<TE>   But Arum, who tapped into the Latino market by building De La Hoya
into a superstar, concedes that, below the superstar level, Latino
fighters begin with an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true," he said, "that Latino fighters have rabid fans and
thus start out with a bigger base. African-American or Caucasian fans
generally are not going to identify with an African-American or
Caucasian fighter unless he is something special. If you have an
Irish fighter, Irish people are going to identify with him, but not
necessarily other whites or blacks. Rocky Marciano, who was Italian,
not only had Italians on his side but everybody else because he was a
special fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jay Larkin, chief of boxing programming at the Showtime
network, "Just because it's easier to sell to the Latino fan base
doesn't mean it's hard to sell an African-American fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "Boxing tends to go in waves. The first wave of immigration
included Jewish, Italian and Irish fighters, and a majority of the
boxing fans were Jewish, Italian and Irish. Then, there were an
increasing number of African-American fighters. Then, an increasing
number of Latin-American fighters. Now, we have an increasing number
of Eastern European fighters. It really does track the socioeconomic
patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Larkin doesn't agree with Mosley's decision to go from promoter to
promoter</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mistake," Larkin said. "There's no continuity. Every time
you have somebody new, they have to start over. And there's no way
they want to build you up to hand you over to the next promoter."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, however, doesn't want to be tied down even though Kushner
is planning to offer him a new deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to leave my options open from fight to fight," Mosley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Larkin also doesn't buy Mosley's belief that his victory over De
La Hoya should have automatically catapulted Mosley into De La Hoya's
role as the Golden Boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you beat the man doesn't mean you become the man,"
Larkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley thinks De La Hoya's triumph at the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona is also a key factor in determining the separate roads they
have traveled. Mosley was favored to win a berth on the U.S. team in
1992 but lost in the trials to Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a lot different if I had won a gold medal,"
Mosley said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cop-out," Arum said of Mosley's various reasons for his
failure to break into boxing's elite circle. "The truth is, Shane
Mosley and his promoter have themselves to blame. After Shane beat
Oscar, that was his moment. What he should have done was not go back
to HBO and fight tomato cans. After beating Oscar, that's when you
strike. Shane Mosley should have fought the best guys out there, but
he didn't want to take the risk. He didn't want to go for
pay-per-view. He didn't want to roll the dice. He went for the sure
money by fighting the easiest guys on HBO."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Kushner: "When I tried to make the fight with De La
Hoya, there was no interest. When I tried to make the fight with
Fernando Vargas, there was no interest. I disagree with Bob.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Shane is at the peak of his career. It's tough to be a
household name when you never once fought on network TV. Shane Mosley
is a can't-miss fighter. He will get his due this year whether I am
involved or not."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley insists it was more a matter of exposure than opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "After I beat De La Hoya," he said, "I really needed to go outside
the boxing world to get better known.</TE>
<TE>   "And that goes for boxing as a whole. Kids know who every
basketball player in the NBA is, but they don't know boxers."</TE>
<TE>   Shockingly, Arum pointed toward his archenemy, promoter Don King,
as a shining example of promotional expertise.</TE>
<TE>   "Don King did a really good job of promoting Felix Trinidad," Arum
said. "King is a promoter who knows the business. After Trinidad beat
Oscar, King doesn't have Trinidad go back to fighting tomato cans. He
looks for a [David] Reid. He fights a Fernando Vargas. That's how you
get the highest visibility. That's what a promoter does.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, you have a situation where Mosley and his promoter were
like little lambs sucking up to HBO. Shane Mosley doesn't have a clue
what it takes. He doesn't have a clue. Just the way Roy Jones doesn't
understand. These people can keep blaming the world, but they are the
problem. Shane Mosley only has himself to blame."</TE>

<HD>Independent Racing Leaving With Marcis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Marcis, the last of the old Winston Cup independents, will make
next month's Daytona 500 the final race of his long career.</LD>
<LD>   When Marcis drove in his first 500, in 1968, the field was half
filled with independent drivers. Racers such as Elmo Langley, Bill
Champion, Buddy Arrington, James Hylton and Wendell Scott, NASCAR's
first and almost only black driver, were in that race. Later,
independents such as Richard Childress, J.D. McDuffie, Cecil Gordon
and Ed Negre drove for years with little hope of winning.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Kulwicki broke the mold when he won a championship in 1992 as
an independent, beating the heavily sponsored Bill Elliott and Davey
Allison in the final race.</LD>
<TE>   It was never easy to be an independent, battling against
well-financed teams with corporate backing, but until the last few
years there were always a few stubborn guys willing to put up with
being a back-marker most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Marcis, 61, is the end of the line.</TE>
<TE>   Only seven-time Winston Cup champion Richard Petty has been in as
many Daytona 500s as Marcis, 32 of them, but Marcis is the only one
to have raced 32 consecutively, from 1968 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In 818 races since he left Wausau, Wis., to drive in NASCAR, he
has won only five times, never in the Daytona 500, where his highest
finishes were sixth in 1975 and 1978.</TE>
<TE>   He did win a 125-mile qualifying race in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget that first time I drove through the tunnel at
Daytona," Marcis said. "I didn't realize what I was getting into. I
looked down to the far right and that was Turn 1 and I looked over to
the left and there was Turn 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'I can't believe this place. I can't believe you go
out there and you hold the car flat-footed.' It was harder in those
days to hold the car flat-footed but it was just awesome when I saw
that place."</TE>
<TE>   To make his 33rd Daytona 500, Marcis will have to qualify his No.
71 Realtree Camouflage Chevrolet either through time trials that
begin Feb. 9 or in one of the Gatorade 125-mile qualifying races Feb.
14.</TE>
<TE>   "Making the race, that's the big deal at Daytona. That would be
very big for me. I started my career here and I would certainly love
to end it with the 2002 Daytona 500."</TE>
<TE>   There may be one unusual problem facing the popular Wisconsin
veteran. He has always worn wingtip shoes while racing, rather than
regular driver's shoes. This year, NASCAR has mandated that all
clothing must be fire resistant.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Marcis can dip the wingtips in a borax solution, the
long-ago method of fireproofing racing clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Personal Watercraft</TE>
<TE>   George Follmer, a Hall of Fame driver, once won the Sports Car
Club of America's Trans-Am championship in a Javelin and the Can-Am
crown in Roger Penske's L&amp;M Porsche-Audi 917K as a fill-in for the
injured Mark Donohue--in the same year, 1972.</TE>
<TE>   From the time Follmer's nephew, Mike, was born in 1955, he wanted
to follow in his uncle's footsteps as a driver. After trying
motorcycles and race cars for a few years, Mike found his niche on
water. He became a personal watercraft competitor.</TE>
<TE>   He won his first race on a Yamaha 701 Raider in San Felipe,
Mexico, in 1994. The next year he formed his own team, Mike Follmer
Watersports, and began campaigning in the International Jet Sports
Boating Assn. Twice he received the image-maker-of-the-year award
from Baja Promotions, organizers of IJSBA off-shore endurance races.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, as a factory Yamaha rider, Follmer climaxed a
championship season by winning the world's longest personal
watercraft race, the six-hour Team Endurance 300, and was crowned
national endurance champion with his co-driver, Greg Saugstad.</TE>
<TE>   In the six hours--actually 6 hours 1 minute 8 seconds--Team
Follmer made 44 laps of 7.2 miles around Long Beach harbor and
traveled 316.8 miles. Follmer and Saugstad took turns driving seven
laps each between fuel stops, changing drivers on every stop.</TE>
<TE>   After the first lap, Saugstad had the boat in sixth place, but
Follmer assured his crew that, "The only lap we have to lead is the
last one. For all the rest, all we have to do is keep everyone
leading in sight."</TE>
<TE>   By the four-hour mark, Team Follmer had the lead and finished more
than 10 minutes ahead of the second-place craft.</TE>
<TE>   "After chasing an overall title in BP Motorsports for over nine
years and coming very close on many occasions, it is especially nice
to capture my first absolute win in this prestigious event and get
crowned national team endurance champion too," Follmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way to end a dream season and pay back all of my
great sponsors."</TE>
<TE>   Follmer also won the expert open crown in both the Gran Prix and
Long Course series. He will receive his championship awards Saturday
night at the River Palms Resort Casino in Laughlin, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Malan, a Kawasaki rider from Apple Valley, will receive the
IJSBA overall points championship. Follmer finished second.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Four-time winners Ed and Tim Herbst and Brian Collins, all of Las
Vegas, will be going for fifth victories this weekend in the featured
SCORE Trophy Truck division at the eighth annual Laughlin Desert
Challenge. It is the opening event of the six-race Desert Racing
Series..</TE>
<TE>   Collins, whose first three wins were in Class 8, won the truck
main event last year. The Herbst brothers won in 1995, '97, '99 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Three new high-tech trucks, driven by Damen Jefferies, Darren
Skilton and Scott Steinberger, have been added to the elite Trophy
Truck race. Skilton will be in a new prototype Kia sport utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Racing will be split over Saturday and Sunday over a 13-mile loop
desert course starting and finishing at Laughlin Events Park Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   SCORE officials also announced that a new event, Henderson's
Terrible 250, will be held July 11-14, using portions of the old Mint
400 course, the forerunner of U.S. desert races.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>

longtime endurance champion John Ulrich have been elected to the
American Motorcylist Assn. board of trustees. The AMA also announced
that Andrew Leisner, a former Grand Prix rider, will head a newly

<HD>Jordan's 40 Helps Wizards Aim Higher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From a season's perspective, Michael Jordan's long-term memory
included the "We stink" game at Cleveland, when Ricky Davis
trash-talked as the Cavaliers routed the Washington Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   His short-term memory recalled his struggles in the second half of
the two previous games.</LD>
<LD>   Both maladies were erased Thursday night, when Jordan scored 16 of
his 40 points in the second half as the Wizards surpassed last
season's victory total with their 20th, beating the Cavaliers, 94-85,
at Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The Wizards (20-20) were 19-63 last season. It was the Cavaliers'
11th consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a long memory," said Jordan, recalling Davis' antics in
the 94-75 victory Nov. 27, which dropped the Wizards to 3-10 and
prompted Jordan to utter, "We stink."</TE>
<TE>   Davis had only seven points and four fouls in the rematch. Wesley
Person scored 19 points--16 in the first quarter--to lead the
Cavaliers, who have their longest losing streak in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to tell people he's got a long memory, and they don't
believe me," Cleveland Coach John Lucas said. "I think they believe
me now."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was 18 for 29, seven for 14 in the second half, and had
eight rebounds in 40 minutes with no turnovers. He scored eight
points in a 10-0 run, including a 16-foot jump shot over a
triple-team while being fouled, as the Wizards took command midway
through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   New York 96, Phoenix 91--Allan Houston scored 29 points, including
11 in the fourth quarter, and Kurt Thomas had a season-high 27 as the
Knicks rallied from a 19-point deficit in the second half to win at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks won their second game in a row for the first time since
the first week of December.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Hardaway had 28 points for the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 99, Milwaukee 88--Brent Barry scored 29 points and made
six three-pointers and the SuperSonics used an 18-0 run spanning the
third and fourth quarters to win at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cassell scored 29 points for Milwaukee, which fell to 1-8
against the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 103, Houston 98--Kenyon Martin scored 28 points as the
Nets overcame Cuttino Mobley's career-high tying 41 points and ended
a 10-game road losing streak to the Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, who hadn't won in Houston since Dec. 8, 1989, needed a
win or a Milwaukee loss Thursday to secure the Eastern Conference
All-Star coaching berth for Byron Scott. They got both.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Steve Francis had 23 points, 12 rebounds and a
season-high 11 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 92, Miami 87--Darrell Armstrong scored 18 points at
Orlando, Fla., as the Magic snapped the Heat's six-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Jones led Miami with 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 104, Denver 97--Dirk Nowitzki scored 26 points, including
two three-pointers in the fourth quarter, and the Mavericks won their
sixth in a row with a victory at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Raef LaFrentz led Denver with 24 points, 18 in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Maverick Coach Don Nelson returned after missing the last two
games to be with his wife, Joy, who underwent breast cancer surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 113, Utah 80--Chris Webber scored 24 points and Peja
Stojakovic added 21 as the Kings won their 17th consecutive home
game.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone had 14 points for the Utah, which suffered its worst
loss of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 120, Memphis 82--Rasheed Wallace scored 20 points as the
Trail Blazers held the visiting Grizzlies to 27 first-half points.</TE>
<TE>   Brevin Knight had 22 points to lead Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Pacer forward Al Harrington will miss the rest of the
season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in Wednesday's
loss at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, averaging 13.1 points and 6.3 rebounds, is expected to
be ready for next season.</TE>

<HD>Stallworth Broke Rules, but Wants Eligibility Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Receiver Donte Stallworth should have his eligibility reinstated,
despite violating two NCAA rules after declaring himself available
for the NFL draft for one day, Tennessee officials told the NCAA.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter dated Jan. 16 and obtained by the Associated Press on
Thursday, the university disclosed Stallworth received nearly $1,300
in benefits from an agent after declaring himself available for the
draft.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA has not yet responded to Tennessee's appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Stallworth, a junior, sent the NFL on Jan. 10 a petition to make
himself eligible for the draft early. He changed his mind the next
day, and the NFL withdrew his name from the underclassmen draft list
before the Jan. 11 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   By making himself available, Stallworth's eligibility was
immediately revoked under NCAA bylaws even though his name was
withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   During those hours his petition remained in effect at the NFL
office, Memphis agent Jimmy Sexton bought Stallworth $13.60 in FedEx
postage, a $48.60 dinner for two, a $6 ride to the airport, a one-day
rental car for $151.92 and a $980 one-way airfare from California to
Tennessee for his brother, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   The university's letter states Sexton has been repaid but doesn't
detail how or when.</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth and the university maintained the player didn't sign a
deal to make Sexton his agent and received all the benefits before
the Jan. 11 draft deadline. Sexton did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth has not spoken to reporters since his draft
announcement. His mother, Donna, a nurse in Sacramento, declined to
comment when reached.</TE>
<TE>   Because Stallworth was technically no longer an amateur when he
received the benefits, no NCAA rule was intentionally violated,
Malcolm C. McInnis, the university's associate athletic director for
compliance, wrote to the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie and wide receiver Marcell Allmond, who
dropped out of USC last fall, have re-enrolled in school.</TE>
<TE>   The school also announced that fullback Brandon Hancock, punter
Tom Malone and wide receiver Jason Mitchell have enrolled for the
spring semester and will participate in spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Coach John Bunting, who led the Tar Heels to a
victory in the Peach Bowl in his first season, received a contract
extension and a raise.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina's board of trustees approved the deal extending
Bunting's contract through the 2007 season and he received a $100,000
increase, raising his annual salary to $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   UEFA President Lennart Johansson increased pressure on FIFA
President Sepp Blatter to open an internal investigation of the world
soccer body's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson said there were too many questions still unanswered
despite a recent independent study of FIFA's financial situation.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson has been one of the leading critics of Blatter,
especially since FIFA lost more than $30 million after the collapse
of its former marketing partner ISL.</TE>

<TE>   Dutch defender Jaap Stam, who plays for Lazio of Rome, was

suspended for four months for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle aerialist Emily Cook, the top American qualifier in her
sport, will miss the Olympics because of a pair of dislocated bones
in her left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Cook injured herself jumping at an Olympic qualifying competition
in Lake Placid, N.Y., last week.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old jumper was selected to the Olympic team pending
exams by doctors, but after two exams this week, she was told she
would not be ready to jump by Feb. 16, when the women's aerials begin
in Park City, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Klug took a big step in his comeback from a liver transplant
when he clinched a spot on the U.S. Olympic snowboard team.</TE>
<TE>   Klug, who had the transplant in July 2000, was the second-fastest
American in qualifying for the parallel giant slalom race at
Kreischberg, Austria, in the final event before the Olympic team is
chosen. The second-place finish was good enough to land him a spot in
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Klug was diagnosed with a rare liver disease almost seven years
before the transplant. His disease is called Primary Schlerosing
Cholangitis, the same illness that killed Walter Payton.</TE>
<TE>   Also earning a spot on the Olympic team was Peter Thorndike. He
and Klug join Jeff Greenwood, who clinched his spot much earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Athletics Federation upheld a two-year doping
suspension of Andrea Longo, rejecting the 800-meter specialist's

<LD>St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner sat out most of practice Thursday
because of soreness and muscle spasms in his ribcage.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Martz expects Warner will be fine to practice today and
is not in jeopardy of missing Sunday's NFC championship game against
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "When the back spasms are like that you can get into a bad rhythm
and you can do damage elsewhere, and so we just kept him out," Martz
said. "The doctors and the trainers say that he will be fine and we
expect him to practice tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   While the training staff treated Warner's ribcage with electrical
stimulation, backup quarterback Jamie Martin ran the offense.</TE>

<TE>   Contract talks between Marty Schottenheimer's agent and the San
Diego Chargers hit a snag, the day both sides had hoped to reach a
deal for the veteran coach to take over the struggling team.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer's agent, Tom Condon, left face-to-face meetings
with Charger officials in Mobile, Ala., for his scheduled return to
Kansas City. He said he planned to continue to negotiate with the
Chargers by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no offer, and we haven't done the deal," Condon said by
phone before leaving Mobile. "I don't think that it's dead or
anything like that. I don't want to characterize it like that."</TE>

<TE>   New York Giant defensive coordinator John Fox interviewed a second
time with the Carolina Panthers about their coaching job and emerged
as the front-runner to replace George Seifert.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who first interviewed with the Panthers last week, was
brought in for his second meeting after team officials spent a day
with Baltimore defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Lions promoted Maurice Carthon to offensive
coordinator and hired Sherm Lewis, a former Michigan State player and
assistant coach, to be the team's special assistant on offense. ...
The New York Giants hired Bruce Read as special teams coach. Read,
40, spent the last three seasons with the San Diego Chargers.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Espen Knutsen had his first three-goal game and added an assist as
the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the San Jose Sharks, 6-2, Thursday
night at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Jackets began the game with 96 goals scored, fewest in
the league. They finished with their highest scoring game of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought our power play tonight was very effective against a
very good penalty killing team--one of the best in the league--and
that was probably the difference in the game," Columbus Coach Dave
Kind said.</LD>
<TE>   Columbus' four power-play goals and six goals at Nationwide Arena
tied franchise records.</TE>
<TE>   "The power play was just amazing tonight," Blue Jacket goaltender
Ron Tugnutt said.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved the puck around and created a lot of good
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sillinger tied a career high with four points on two goals
and two assists, and Grant Marshall and Ray Whitney each had two
assists for the Blue Jackets, who ended a three-game losing streak
and two game skid at home.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Calgary 0--David Aebischer made 25 saves and Milan
Hejduk and Chris Drury scored at Calgary, Canada, as the Avalanche
stretched its winning streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   It was Aebischer's first shutout of the season and fourth of his
career, but his second straight against Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   On March 29, 2001, Aebischer was in net as Colorado won in
Calgary, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   The game was evenly played until Hejduk put Colorado ahead with
1:46 left in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Drury added an empty-net goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche moved eight points ahead of the second-place
Edmonton Oilers atop the Northwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary continues to struggle on its six-game homestand, having
lost four of the first five games.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Philadelphia 2--Nashville's Denis Arkhipov hammered
in a rebound at 1:16 of overtime to give the Predators a victory at
Philadelphia, ending the Flyers' home unbeaten streak at eight games.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators have won only three of their last 19 road games
(3-14-2).</TE>
<TE>   Arkhipov scored from the right circle after Philadelphia
goaltender Roman Cechmanek made the initial save on a shot by
Vladimir Orszagh.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville's Cliff Ronning scored his second goal of the game at
7:45 of the third to tie the score at 2.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, New York Islanders 4--Alexei Morozov scored 1:29
into overtime as Pittsburgh rallied for the win at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins played without Mario Lemieux, who announced earlier
this week he would sit out the game to rest his sore hip.</TE>
<TE>   Morozov, who set up Kris Beech's tying goal with 3:03 remaining in
regulation, won it when he beat Garth Snow with a 35-foot wrist shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins, playing for the third time in four nights, have a
five-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, New Jersey 2--Ilya Kovalchuk and Tony Hrkac scored
third-period goals for the Thrashers at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrashers were down 2-0 and were outshot 19-2 in the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up the two New Jersey goals in the opening period,
Thrasher goaltender Milan Hnilicka stopped 47 shots the rest of the
way as Atlanta won for the fifth time in its last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Boston 3--Daniel Alfredsson and Shawn McEachern scored
power-play goals three minutes apart in the third period to lead the
Senators at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   The win gave the Senators their sixth point in their last four
games (2-0-1-1) and drew Ottawa within two points of Boston for the
Northeast Division lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have only one win in their last seven games (1-3-0-3).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ottawa Senators signed free-agent forward Jody Hull to a
one-year contract. The 32-year-old Hull, who hasn't played this
season, played for Philadelphia last season.... The Atlanta Thrashers
acquired goaltender Frederic Cassivi from the Colorado Avalanche for
defenseman Brett Clark.... Rookie defenseman Jeff Jillson was
recalled from Cleveland by the San Jose Sharks.</TE>

<HD>It's Just Another Case of Poise Over Potential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a simple gesture, a discreet palm out, a slow-down-and-think
sign given by point guard Julius Barnes to his Stanford teammates.</LD>
<LD>   After trailing UCLA by eight points, the Cardinal had taken a
three-point lead. As the team was running willy-nilly up the court,
jubilant in having forced another UCLA miss, confident that it could
do whatever it wanted, Barnes made his teammates slow down, look
around and run a play. And score. A lay-up. By Teyo Johnson, who is
more prominent as a football Cardinal than a basketball Cardinal.</LD>
<LD>   Such a gesture doesn't often come from a UCLA player or coach.</LD>
<TE>   Playing basketball for UCLA means you never know what is happening
next. Not from game to game, not from moment to moment, not from
offense to defense or defense to offense. Not at Pauley Pavilion, not
in Maui or Tucson or anywhere else. The Bruins lost Thursday night to
Stanford, 86-76. It was not a surprise, but it should have been.</TE>
<TE>   Take Duke off the table and it can be argued that UCLA has the
most talented starting five in the country. Who's better? Kansas or
Kentucky? No. Maryland might be close but no better. You watch the
Bruins, you marvel at Jason Kapono's quick release of his shot, at
Matt Barnes' great strength and control of his body, at Dan
Gadzuric's long arms, live legs, smooth moves, and at Cedric
Bozeman's speed and size. It all doesn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Why Pepperdine? How come Ball State? Got a clue about USC? Have an
answer for Arizona? And now this. No team had ever beaten UCLA five
times in a row at Pauley Pavilion. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   Julius Barnes makes a wide-open three-point basket to give
Stanford a 51-48 lead and the situation cries out for an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal has a four-game winning streak at Pauley and the team
is playing as if it owns the place. UCLA students had camped out for
three days, some of them. On TV they were calling Pauley Lavin-land
for Coach Steve Lavin. And that's the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Being in Lavin-land means never having to say you have a clue.</TE>
<TE>   There's a new and truly awful game show called "The Chair." The
hapless contestants are strapped into a chair and John McEnroe is
shouting at them. The contestant must keep his heartbeat below a
certain rate or lose money. UCLA fans could never be in "The Chair"
during a Bruin game. Heart rates fluctuate from nanosecond to
nanosecond.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric stands alone, tries to dunk and misses the shot. Misses
badly. On the next Bruin possession, Gadzuric flies high and smashes
the ball through the basket, a highlight dunk. On the ensuing
Stanford possession, Gadzuric commits a thoughtless foul near the
three-point line, where he shouldn't be fouling. It's his fourth and
there are still 14 minutes left. How could he? What was he thinking?</TE>
<TE>   We are thinking that Gadzuric's third foul had been equally
ill-conceived, an angry shove in the back to Stanford center Curtis
Borchardt with 2:06 left in the first half. It came after Kapono had
missed an even more ill-conceived 28-foot three-point shot that came
with 25 seconds left on the 35-second shot clock and which made the
fans go, in unison, "Huh?" Someone needed to put that palm out and
tell the Bruins to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   So now Gadzuric sits. Matt Barnes steals the ball. Races for an
uncontested and mind-altering dunk. Next UCLA possession, a pass goes
to Barnes for an alley-oop dunk. Barnes, nearly unguarded, misses the
slam.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA should be ahead by 20 instead of 56-53 with 11:35 to play.</TE>
<TE>   This is what makes being a UCLA fan so, so ... what? Exciting?
Nauseating? Exhilarating? Exhausting? It is what makes being a UCLA
player so, so ... what? Confusing? Confounding? Is it fun for the
Bruins to be so unpredictable? Is it exciting for them to be so
apocalyptic?</TE>
<TE>   Did we say UCLA should be ahead by 20? Never mind. With 5:50 left,
Stanford freshman Josh Childress gives the Cardinal a 65-60 lead.
After Childress's basket, Bozeman misses two free throws. And
Stanford's Casey Jacobsen makes a 28-foot three-point basket off a
screen and in the flow of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   It's the difference between saying "Huh?" and "Wow!" It's the
difference between having a 68-60 lead as an underdog and looking at
an eight-point deficit and a five-game home losing streak to a
Pacific 10 Conference rival.</TE>
<TE>   It's the difference between Kapono making three-point baskets
early and Jacobsen making them late, when the game is on the line and
they put Stanford ahead, 75-63, with only 3:31 left.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:50 left, Jacobsen and Barnes hug each other at midcourt.
The Cardinal led, 80-68. The UCLA fans were walking out. Confused?
Angry? Frustrated? Or thrilled? After all, this can only mean good
things are to come. That's life in Lavin-land.</TE>

<LD>They poked their heads through an eerie mist and found themselves
under a brilliant blue sky atop Vinson Massif, at 16,860 feet the
highest peak in Antarctica.</LD>
<LD>   A weeklong expedition fraught with stinging winds, blowing snow
and blistering-cold temperatures had come to a rewarding end: The
view from the summit.</LD>
<LD>   "It was spectacular," said Fullerton's Jeff Mathy, one of 12
climbers who conquered Mt. Vinson Jan. 17. "We were above the mist
and could see the whole expanse of Antarctica. We could even see the
curvature of the earth."</LD>
<TE>   After climbing down from his magnificent perch, and calling his
mother and girlfriend via satellite telephone, Mathy on Wednesday
found time for an interview from the airport at Punta Arenas, Chile.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, while scaling a steep headwall beneath the summit,
the temperature reached an estimated 84 below, factoring in the wind
chill.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, every second was a race to keep myself from
freezing," Mathy said. "I had been in 10- to 15-below temperatures in
Alaska, but this was just a whole other realm of coldness."</TE>
<TE>   And so it went for the 23-year-old mountaineer, who emerged from
this frozen part of the planet one peak closer to becoming the
youngest person to conquer the illustrious Seven Summits: the highest
on each continent.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson was his fifth. The others: Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,340
feet), South America's Mt. Aconcagua (22,840), North America's Mt.
McKinley (20,320) and Australia's Mt. Kosciuszko (7,300).</TE>
<TE>   To avoid controversy, since there is some dispute among climbers
as to whether Australia or Oceania is the official seventh continent,
Mathy has put Indonesia's Carstensz Pyramid (16,023) on a list that
still includes Asia's Mt. Everest (the world's highest at 29,035
feet) and Europe's Mt. Elbrus (18,510).</TE>
<TE>   Time is hardly of the essence: Jody Ogwyn of Shreveport, La., was
26 years and 107 days old when he notched all seven, choosing
Carstensz over Kosciuszko; and Sundeep Dhillon of England was 28
years and 323 days old when he became the youngest to accomplish the
feat by conquering both of the disputed peaks.</TE>
<TE>   The point of all this?</TE>
<TE>   "Being the youngest is just something that came up recently,"
Mathy said, perhaps alluding to how his age helped him land a
corporate sponsor (Mathy's dispatches can be viewed at
www.liptont.com).</TE>
<TE>   "But I do hope this will help get other younger people involved in
the sport because mountain climbing usually attracts people a lot
older than me."</TE>
<TE>   Mathy was 10 when he donned his first backpack, as a member of the
Boy Scouts exploring the San Bernardino mountains.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers his first climb being little more than a hike, up a
small peak called Little Jimmy.</TE>
<TE>   "I weighed about 45 pounds and the pack weighed the same," he
recalls. "It was a miserable experience--the worst thing I had ever
done. But the next month we did it again and it got easier."</TE>
<TE>   His love of the outdoors became a passion after a trip into the
Alaskan wilderness while on break during his senior year at UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a different environment than I had ever been in before,"
he says. "We were walking around in snowshoes and it was almost
dreamlike because we did all our hiking at night and with the full
moon [illuminating] the ice crystals, it made it seem like we were
hundreds of miles from our own planet. It really was otherworldly."</TE>
<TE>   Mathy was 20 when he joined his first real mountaineering
expedition, to Tanzania's Kilimanjaro on a trip sponsored by his
parents as a graduation gift.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he traveled to Denali National Park and bagged
McKinley. Then came Kosciuszko and suddenly, the Seven Summits were
within grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Still looming mightily in his path, of course, is the giant among
Himalayan giants, Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Mathy traveled to the region during the summer to train for the
Everest expedition by climbing Mt. Chooyu, at 26,906 feet the world's
sixth-tallest peak.</TE>
<TE>   He had planned to celebrate his 23rd birthday just before the
climb but the celebration never materialized. Mathy's birthday is
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a small village in China and I called home because it
was my birthday," he says. "My mom was crying and I thought it was
just because she missed me, but she didn't say why. Then my dad got
on the phone and said a plane had just hit the World Trade Center and
they thought it might be a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go and tell the other members of the team, and some of
them had friends who worked in the Trade Center. I had to share this
news and it was like delivering news of a death in the family."</TE>
<TE>   The next day they were at base camp, however, determined "to move
forward as representatives of the United States and to keep our
spirits and not have the terrorists affect our everyday lives."</TE>
<TE>   The summit attempt was cut short, however, because of foul
weather.</TE>
<TE>   A Fresh Start</TE>
<TE>   In a surprising development, the Department of Fish and Game has
wiped clean a slate of proposed marine closures mapped out as part of
a nearshore fisheries management plan being developed as mandated by
the Marine Life Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   During a California Assembly hearing held by the Joint Fisheries
and Aquaculture Committee last week in Sacramento, DFG Director
Robert Hight labeled the concept map "ill-crafted" and announced a
new process that will allow more public participation and the
exploration of alternative reserve locations.</TE>
<TE>   He also announced that a federal grant of $372,000 will be used to
fund economic analyses of any new reserves, and the formation of six
regional committees to serve as workshops on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The decision delighted the sportfishing community, which
complained it had unfairly been left out of the process the first
time around.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering that the first approach put us totally on the
defensive and it appeared as though something like this was going to
be stuffed down our throat, this is very big news," said Bob
Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California. "This
gives us the opportunity to argue where any reserves should be placed
to minimize economic loss."</TE>
<TE>   The implementation of marine reserves, which would either restrict
or render off limits large parcels of coastal and island waters, is
intended to allow for the recovery of several embattled species of
fish.</TE>
<TE>   Under the MLPA, a draft plan must be submitted to the California
Fish and Game Commission by Jan. 1, 2003. A final plan must be
adopted by Dec. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Spouting Off</TE>
<TE>   Bernardo Alps, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the
American Cetacean Society, announced in a recent newsletter that the
southbound migration of gray whales is well underway:</TE>
<TE>   "I went out on [Redondo Sportfishing's] the Voyager [last Friday]
afternoon, after the morning boat had seen only dolphins. We saw lots
of whales. At least 15, possibly more. It was difficult to keep track
because some were snorkeling, some were milling, some were going the
other way and some were moving perpendicular to the shore. There were
small whales and large whales, singles and pairs and even one
cow-calf pair."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, that was as good as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   What, No Merlot?</TE>
<TE>   Trout are biting like mad at Laguna Niguel Lake, and they're quite
the gourmets: The most irresistible bait, according to a lake
spokesman, is a red salmon egg stuck on the hook with an inflated
night crawler and dipped in garlic sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Precious Metal?</TE>
<TE>   The latest in winter sports products will be unveiled during the
Snow Sports Industries America trade show, Wednesday through Saturday
in Las Vegas. Atop the list of revolutionary products:
bacteria-fighting silver underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Medalist's X-Static fabric, made with pure silver, is designed to
combat odor and static, and to improve body heat regulation. Says the
SIA: "The silver fabric's anti-microbial properties mean that it can
be worn longer between washings."</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   There has been a big dose of sadness on the slopes of Lake
Tahoe-area resorts in recent weeks, brought about by fatal accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The latest involved an 11-year-old girl, who died Jan. 12 after
skiing into a tree at Squaw Valley USA. Hers was the second fatal
accident this season at Squaw Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week earlier, a 31-year-old man lost his life at
Heavenly Ski Resort, after losing his footing while holding his
snowboard and tumbling 1,000 feet down an expert trail that had been
closed because of hard-pack snow.</TE>

<LD>Doug Wrenn scored a career-high 32 points, including six over the
final 1:19, as Washington defeated No. 19 Oregon, 97-92, Thursday
night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, the turnaround team of the Pacific 10 Conference, had
won four consecutive and 10 of 11, but struggled defensively against
a team averaging 70.3 points.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's scoring output was its second best of the season and
the Huskies (8-11, 2-7) shot 54% in the first half.</LD>
<TE>   Washington converted 11 of 12 free throws over the final 40
seconds, six by Curtis Allen, who was 12 of 12 from the line and had
18 points. It was the first time this season the Huskies came back to
win after trailing with five minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, which played a ranked opponent for the fifth time in
seven games, had lost three consecutive and nine of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Jones scored 27 points and Luke Ridnour matched his
career-high with 23 for the Ducks (14-5, 6-2), who were looking for
their best conference start since 1939 when they began 11-1 in the
Pacific Coast Conference under Hall of Fame coach Howard Hobson.
Oregon's ranking is its highest in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Wrenn's previous career-high was 29 points set Jan. 6 against USC.
On Thursday, he got two points on a goaltending call with 1:19 left.
He scored 18 in the first half with three dunks and had seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Christoffersen, the Ducks' 7-foot-2 center, was held to
three points and limited to 13 minutes because of foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 74, Washington State 72--Jimmie Haywood scored a
career-high 23 points, including the game-winning free throws with
less than a second remaining, to lead the Beavers over the Cougars at
Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   The victory snapped a five-game losing streak for Oregon State
(9-9, 2-6). Washington State (4-13, 0-8) has lost 11 consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Moore, one of five Washington State players to score in
double figures, led the Cougars with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Haywood scored 14 points in the second half, including five in the
last 1:08.</TE>

<LD>Leagues Will Determine Mercy Rule for Baseball</LD>
<LD>   The Southern Section council on Thursday overwhelmingly adopted a
proposal that will allow individual leagues to decide whether to
implement the 10-run mercy rule for baseball starting this season.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the mercy rule will not be used during the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The council rejected at its meeting in Long Beach a proposal that
would have limited baseball teams to 30 games before the postseason.
Currently, under the section's 20-game rule, teams play between 23
and 31 games depending on the number of teams in their league.</TE>
<TE>   The council discussed a proposal that would increase the number of
divisions in girls' water polo from five to six to give the 207
girls' teams an equal number of championships as the 209 boys' teams.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal brought before the council for discussion seeks
to form playoff groupings based on competitive equity in those sports
not under the guidelines of enrollment-based divisions for state
playoffs. The affected sports would be baseball, boys' and girls'
soccer, softball, boys' volleyball, and boys' and girls' tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, all teams from one league would compete in the
same playoff division as determined by the strength of the league,
the enrollment of its schools and geography.</TE>
<TE>   The council will vote on the water polo and playoff grouping
proposals at its March 14 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Staunton, section commissioner, also said his staff would
attempt to remove selected individual records from the next section
record book that "stimulate unsportsmanlike conduct" and are
incompatible with the Pursuing Victory With Honor campaign. The move
was spurred by a recent lopsided water polo contest in which a coach
admittedly left a player in the game to achieve a record.</TE>

<LD>Parade Names Booker Its Co-Player of Year</LD>
<LD>   Record-setting tailback Lorenzo Booker of Ventura St. Bonaventure
joins Houston Madison quarterback Vincent Young as Parade magazine's
national high school co-players of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Booker, who holds California state career records for rushing
(8,502 yards), touchdowns (137), rushing touchdowns (131) and points
scored (882), was joined on the 55-member team by seven other

Southern Section Division XI titles.</LD>
<TE>   Young, who passed for 2,400 yards and 31 touchdowns this season,
is joined at quarterback by Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks and Trent
Edwards of Los Gatos.</TE>
<TE>   Linemen on the team include Winston Justice of Poly, Nathan Rhodes
of East Bakersfield and Derek Landri, who was Concord De La Salle's
only player on the team and selected lineman of the year for his play
on both sides of the ball. Cornerback Darnell Bing and tight end
Marcedes Lewis of Poly were also selected to the team, which will be
published in Sunday's edition.</TE>

<LD>Victory often comes at a cost. For Lake Forest El Toro High girls'
water polo Coach Don Stoll, it was his cell phone that paid the price
Thursday after the Chargers defeated San Clemente, 11-10, in overtime
in a key South Coast League game at San Clemente High.</LD>
<LD>   Several El Toro players pushed Stoll into the pool after the
victory, a traditional move but one he hardly anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   "When you win a league title, then you get pushed in," Stoll said.
"This was not good."</LD>
<TE>   That said, Stoll pulled a cell phone from the pocket of his
dripping shorts, shook his head and then noticed his wallet was
missing.</TE>
<TE>   The overzealous celebration only slightly dampened an otherwise
exciting game.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente's Courtney Thom tied the score, 9-9, with 2 minutes,
18 seconds remaining in regulation and the Tritons nearly won the
game in the closing seconds when Stephanie Cadman's lob was nudged
over the crossbar by El Toro goalkeeper Erin Greenberg.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente (13-2, 2-1), ranked seventh by The Times, and El Toro
(12-6, 3-0), ranked eighth, traded goals at the start of the first of
two three-minute overtimes.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Palacios gave the Chargers an 11-10 lead with a goal in the
final seconds of the first extra period.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Kuno scored five goals to lead San Clemente. Adrian
Beaney scored four goals to lead El Toro.</TE>

consecutive Golden League game and took an important step toward a
third consecutive league title at Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Junior guard Shaquina Mosley made three of Antelope Valley's eight
three-point baskets and scored 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sheena Crenshaw (three three-pointers) had nine points and Lori
Hodges added seven for the Antelopes.</TE>
<TE>   Teiosha George had 16 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks and
Jennifer Albertson added 11 points for Palmdale, 15-9 overall and 5-1
in the Golden League, which made only 17 of 55 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley (21-1, 6-0), which made eight of 19 three-point
shots, opened the fourth quarter with a 9-2 run to pull away and hand
the Falcons their 14th home loss in 14 seasons.</TE>

<LD>Starsky had Hutch, Thelma had Louise, Lassie had Timmy, so there's
nothing wrong with turning to a best friend in a time of need.</LD>
<LD>   At El Segundo High, basketball players Jeramie Hopson and Dashawn
Strong are so close they have their own call for help: "Koo-coo."</LD>
<LD>   Don't laugh, it really works.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll always jump in and help him or he'll jump in and help me,"
Hopson said.</TE>
<TE>   Humor, wit and laughter, more than fists, get these two seniors
out of predicaments.</TE>
<TE>   They can't look at each other without smiling. Maybe their parents
are keeping a secret because they act more like brothers than
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   They laugh at each other's jokes, borrow each other's possessions
and talk constantly on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the same music, the same clothes and sometimes I wear his
shoes and don't give them back," Hopson said.</TE>
<TE>   Said El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky: "Everywhere they go, they're
together. It's been a treat to watch them mature."</TE>
<TE>   In their case, maturity means they've gone from acting like
8-year-olds to 14-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   They've led El Segundo to an 18-3 record and transformed the
Eagles into a Division IV-AA title contender. Strong, who's 6 feet 5,
is averaging 22.7 points and 13.4 rebounds. Hopson, who's 6-2, is
averaging 17.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and is the team's defensive
stopper.</TE>
<TE>   Hopson has the more outgoing personality. He was selected
Homecoming King. Strong, at 225 pounds, is the gentle giant.</TE>
<TE>   They met as freshmen at El Segundo. They remembered playing
against each other the previous summer. Strong arrived from Redondo
after the school didn't offer the classes he needed.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of school, Strong saw Hopson in a doorway but was
too shy to approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to look
stupid," Strong said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopson recognized Strong and immediately greeted him. By the end
of their sophomore seasons, they had become best friends.</TE>
<TE>   "He's cool," Hopson said. "We play well together. We have a
bonding thing."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, though, have been warned not to let them sit side by
side in class. That happened in a history class, and the teacher had
to separate them to put a stop to the constant chatter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's funny," Strong said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hopson: "I'm never serious. I'm always joking. He gets me in
trouble because he's always laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they have to be reminded that not everyone appreciates
their humor. They were kidding with a large classmate wearing a red
hood. Hopson called him "Hawaiian Punch." Strong called him
"Kool-Aid." The classmate didn't think it was funny.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, security was called to break up the wrestling match, and the
jokesters were last seen being escorted to the assistant principal's
office.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, they are mostly serious. Strong uses his strength to
dominate around the basket. Hopson has an explosive drive to the hoop
and can hit the outside shot. He made 82 three-pointers last season.</TE>
<TE>   They've tried to learn from one another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my jump shot has gotten better because of Jeramie,"
Strong said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Hopson: "He's always calm. I get frustrated quicker than
him. You can never tell if he's mad or not. I'll have a good game one
time, a bad game next. He talks to me and makes it better."</TE>
<TE>   It would be interesting to see who'd win a one-on-one game, but
that's not possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played twice and never finished," Hopson said. "It's 9-9
and it's not serious anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Said Strong: "We can't stop laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Between them, they're showing everyone how to have fun while
succeeding in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Southland football coaches are going to feel envious of Sherman
Oaks Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney and his two assistants, Joe McNab
and Jeff Kraemer. Usually, at a team banquet, players chip in to get
their coaches a gift, like a trophy or sweatshirt. Notre Dame players
bought the coaches a $350 gift certificate to Lawry's.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches and their wives went to the restaurant last week.
Kraemer had prime rib and lobster tails. "Best coaching gift we've
ever gotten," he said....</TE>
<TE>   One of the top winter baseball games is set for Saturday at 2 p.m.
at Huntington Beach Edison. Andy Beal of Palos Verdes Peninsula,
perhaps the No. 1 sophomore pitcher in the nation, will throw the
first two innings against Edison, the defending Southern Section
Division I champion....</TE>
<TE>   David Johnson, an outfielder from Agoura High and Pierce College,
committed to Gonzaga....</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Oaks Christian, in its second year of existence,
is having quite a season. Its boys' basketball team is 17-0. Its
girls' soccer team is 15-0. The boys' soccer team is 9-3-3 and the
girls' basketball team is 12-7.</TE>

<LD>Senior point guard Jerry Green scored 20 of his 22 points in the
second half Thursday and sparked UC Irvine, which connected on seven
of eight three-point shot in a 10-minute stretch, to an 81-70 Big
West Conference victory at UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Green, Jordan Harris and Stanislav Zuzak each made two three-point
shots in a 27-11 run that erased a one-point halftime deficit and put
first-place Irvine (14-5, 6-1) ahead, 56-41, with 10:59 to play in
the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Green, who had a career-high 11 assists, made six of 10 shots in
the second half and the Anteaters shot 64% (18 for 28) in the half.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara (11-6, 5-3) was led by Nick Jones with 23 points.</TE>

<TE>   Pepperdine 74, Santa Clara 67--Boomer Brazzle sparked an 18-2 Wave
run midway through the second half of the West Coast Conference game
at Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   First-place Pepperdine (12-6, 5-0) trailed 41-32 at halftime and
was down 48-41 after Santa Clara's Jordan Legge scored with 13:57
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But the Waves rallied behind Brazzle, who scored nine of their 18
points during the crucial stretch and completed the run with a follow
shot at 8:15 that gave Pepperdine a 59-50 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara (7-11, 2-3) scored seven consecutive points to draw to
within 64-60. Santa Clara's Brian Vaka made a three-point basket with
1:06 remaining to cut it to 69-67, but the Broncos got no closer.</TE>
<TE>   Brazzle, who scored 19 points, made two free throws with 22
seconds left to account for the final margin.</TE>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge 92, Cal State Fullerton 68--Jermar Welch
scored a career-high 18 points as the Matadors (7-10, 6-2) moved into
second place in the Big West with the easy victory before 1,358 at
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge has won five of its last six games and now sits one
game behind league-leading Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge put the Titans away with a 57-point second half after
leading 35-27 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Markus Carr, who has had to focus on scoring this season,
went back to a familiar role of setting up teammates and had a
season-high 12 assists. Carr also had 15 points as five Matadors
reached double figures.</TE>
<TE>   Pape Sow had a game-high 28 points to lead Fullerton (4-13, 1-7).</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>

<TE>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 75, Long Beach State 63--Varnie Dennis
scored 20 points before fouling out as the Mustangs (10-6, 4-4 Big
West) defeated the 49ers (6-13, 2-6) at San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 73, Loyola Marymount 60--Jason Blair scored a
career-high 32 points and Sam Adamo sparked a key second-half run
that lifted the Toreros (11-7, 3-2 West Coast) to a victory over the
Lions (9-10, 2-3) at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 71, UC Riverside 59--Maurice McLemore scored 17 points and
had seven rebounds to lead the Tigers (12-6, 4-4 Big West) over the
Highlanders (6-10, 3-5) at Stockton.</TE>

low point total as they cruised to the victory at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's 10 first-half points also were a school-record low.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon 75, USC 65--Shaquala Williams scored 16 of her 18 points in
the first half, and the Ducks (11-8, 6-4 Pac-10) held off a late run

<HD>Spurs of the Next Moment?</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Admiral is fading, and there's the Laker
problem, but at least they have a future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>You guys still here?</LD>
<LD>   The San Antonio Spurs aren't actually dead, they just wish they
were sometimes while they pick up the pieces of their hearts and
other body parts, which the Lakers keep scattering all over the
countryside.</LD>
<LD>   And, if the agony of defeat isn't enough, there's the utter
torment of having to discuss it with reporters, who remain fixed on
last season's humiliation, when the Lakers swept them by an average
of 22 points a game in the Western Conference finals, after which the
Spurs were called everything up to, and including, "heartless,
gutless pigs" in print.</LD>
<TE>   The media keep asking if the Lakers are "in their heads," a
treasured cliche.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, the Spurs' confidence isn't at its zenith, but they
have more pressing concerns, in transition as they are from a
nice-enough past into what could be a promising future.</TE>
<TE>   For the Spurs, the problem is the present.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always there to some degree," said Coach Gregg Popovich
about last spring's experience, manfully taking questions without
winces or eye rolls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just as irrelevant as the championship [the Spurs won in
1999] was. It's a new group. They don't really care about last year
and they don't care about the championship. They care about getting
this team together, being as good as we possibly can be....</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough summer. It was real tough. I wanted to make sure
our guys faced it, knew what happened to us. You've got to face
something like this. We got our butt beat. No matter what the
reasons, no matter who's out, no matter this, that or the other, we
got our butt kicked, we got embarrassed; it happened, that's the
deal."</TE>
<TE>   Now, there's a new deal, because many of them are gone. Talk about
your scattered remnants--only six Spurs remain from last season.</TE>
<TE>   Avery Johnson, their fast-talking Little General, was allowed to
leave, taking much of their leadership with him. Derek Anderson
decided he'd been disrespected and locked himself into a seven-year
deal in Portland, where he now comes off the bench. Sean Elliott
became an announcer, Samaki Walker a Laker.</TE>
<TE>   In their place came such young players as Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen
and Charles Smith. Suddenly, the team was no longer old and thin but
athletic and deep.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last spring, people wondered why Tim Duncan would
want to stay beyond 2003, when he becomes a free agent. Now the Spurs
have a future, with young players and cap room.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, a budding phenomenon, was actually starting at point guard
in his first week in the NBA, having arrived only months before from
his native Paris--the one in France--at age 19.</TE>
<TE>   Parker has since run into that rookie wall, but the best is surely
to come. The problem is David Robinson, one of the foundations for
all they've been and still hope to be, whose best was a while back.</TE>
<TE>   So they've got young guys coming, no cohesion, their Admiral on
his way out and their Laker nemeses dropping in occasionally to
pulverize them and make the media go all atwitter again.</TE>
<TE>   Better days may lie ahead. The trick will be surviving until then.</TE>
<TE>   'Phenom' in French Is 'Le Tony Parker'</TE>
<TE>   It must be a new world, indeed, if a teenage European rookie can
start right away, at the point, for a veteran players' coach, on a
team with title aspirations, but here he is.</TE>
<TE>   This is like Fernando Valenzuela, emerging from the Sonoran desert
with a chunky body and a natural's game, with his smooth delivery and
deft fielding ability. Oh, and he could hit too.</TE>
<TE>   Amazed NBA coaches try to account for Parker's stunning precocity.
Orlando's Doc Rivers and Indiana's Isiah Thomas, Chicago natives,
thought he was the son of another local player, Sonny Parker, who
appeared briefly in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Tony's father, Tony Sr., was a lesser-known Chicagoan
who started for Loyola and played overseas, where he met Tony Jr.'s
mother, who's Dutch.</TE>
<TE>   In the European way, Tony Jr. turned pro young--at 15--and began
playing against older players, including some from the NBA, including
J.R. Reid and Keith Jennings.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, Parker was recruited by several major U.S. universities,
including UCLA, and actually wanted to attend Georgia Tech, but his
team, Paris Basket Racing, wouldn't let him out of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Parker was unfazed and impressive in the
Nike-sponsored U.S. Hoop Summit at Indianapolis against such young
Americans as Darius Miles, and suddenly he'd caught the attention of
scouts for NBA teams, which, unlike colleges, could buy out his
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the pre-draft camp in Chicago in June, Parker looked
lost, bounced around in his Spur workout by a University of Texas
guard named Lance Blanks.</TE>
<TE>   But then came a string of impressive visits. Parker's workout in
San Antonio was so stunning that Popovich, who had been unimpressed
in Chicago, joked to his staff that the kid would probably be
starting in 10 games, which turned out to be no joke.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, first the Spurs had to get him. With the No. 28 pick,
they tried to trade into the teens but failed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, lots of general managers thought about Parker but went
with more conventional picks.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden State Warriors, desperate for a point guard, rejected
offers to trade down from No. 14 and took Troy Murphy, although
then-Coach Dave Cowens later said of Parker, "I don't care where he
played. I looked at him and said, 'I'd like to play with that guy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Boston thought about Parker at No. 21 but took North Carolina's
Joseph Forte. Orlando considered him at 22 but took Southern
Methodist's Jeryl Sasser.</TE>
<TE>   Parker was still there at No. 28 and became a Spur. Then he
started playing against NBA guys and everyone was amazed.</TE>
<TE>   Said Robinson to the San Antonio News-Express' Johnny Ludden: "The
last time I saw a young player who acted like that, it was Tim."</TE>
<TE>   Said Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich: "I hate that little son of a
gun, just the way I hated Duncan the first time I saw him make a
reverse pivot."</TE>
<TE>   Still unfazed, Parker doesn't know why everyone keeps asking if he
was scared or intimidated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not expecting nothing," he says. "I was just happy to be
drafted in the first round. San Antonio was a winning team with
superstars like David and Tim. I was just happy to be here.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not thinking how I'm going to do, I was just happy to be
here, trying to learn as much as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Has he surprised himself?</TE>
<TE>   "No, not really," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else is blown away. The Spurs, once a half-court team
that often struggled on offense, are now up to No. 6 in scoring.
Popovich says it wasn't by design as much as Parker's ability to
break down defenders, get into the lane and find teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine where this prodigy could be in two or three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in the meantime, they still have a full schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Robinson's Old Neighborhood</TE>
<TE>   "I was supposed to walk him [Robinson] out, but he scored four
points. Let him walk himself out."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio policeman,</TE>
<TE>   after a recent game</TE>
<TE>   The NBA has always been weird for Robinson, a former most valuable
player, praised effusively for his grace and manners (Sports
Illustrated ran a memorable cover of him with halo and angel's wings)
and alternately reviled for not winning or caring enough.</TE>
<TE>   Everything seemed easy for Robinson. He was a rare, or unheard-of
athlete for a 7-footer but away from the game, he was shy (he said)
or aloof (some teammates said before getting to know him). He was
from the suburbs, had a mathematics degree from the U.S. Naval
Academy and, as Rivers, a former teammate, once noted, seemed happy
to tap away at his laptop. In the summer, Robinson didn't pick up a
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when a team underachieves, the blame always goes to its
greatest star, and something assuredly was missing, if only in
Robinson's modest supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs blew up annually in the playoffs, never more
spectacularly than in 1995, Robinson's MVP season, when they were
seeded first and imploded against the Houston Rockets in the West
finals, as Dennis Rodman flipped everyone out, taking off his shoes
on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, another offshore prodigy, arrived in 1997 and Robinson
slid graciously into a supporting role, leading to their 1999 title.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, people were asking if the Spurs, who had swept
them, were in the the Lakers' heads, or if the Lakers had any heads
at all, having been previously dispatched by the Utah Jazz in
successive 4-1 and 4-0 series.</TE>
<TE>   (There's a lot of symmetry. In 1999, the Spurs tied the playoff
record by going 15-2. Two years later, the Lakers broke the record at
15-1.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Spurs' Jaren Jackson, who'd never been a factor
before and never would again, rained three-pointers on everyone,
turning close games into routs. In 2001, Derek Fisher made 15 of 20
three-pointers against the Spurs.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Robinson was 33, averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds, but
his numbers kept slipping as he got older, Duncan got better and they
got more scorers. Robinson often drifted out of the offense and, not
infrequently, the game too.</TE>
<TE>   Indignities now arrive atop indignities.</TE>
<TE>   Before re-signing him last summer, the Spurs, who had $16 million
available, tried to talk to Chris Webber, failing because Webber had
fired his agent and everyone had to go through his aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Webber's aunt kept saying her nephew was interested, but the Spurs
could never talk to him.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Spur fans were up in arms. Owner Peter Holt, who
finally ordered Robinson signed, told the Express-News: "There were
e-mails, calls, people stopping me on the street, even my own family.
Everyone wanted to know the same thing, 'Why, why, why? Why haven't
you signed David?'"</TE>
<TE>   Then, within hours of the newspaper reporting on its Web site that
the Spurs had agreed to terms with Robinson, Webber's people called
the team, wanting to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Now Robinson is down to 10.9 points (3.5 below last season's
career low) and 7.8 rebounds (.8, or almost 10%, below last season's
career low.) He often sits out the fourth quarter, which Popovich
attributes to matchups.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Popovich once let opponents worry about matching up
with them.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is only dirty work for Robinson, who's no longer a No.
1, 2 or 3 option on offense and guards the best big man to keep
Duncan out of foul trouble. One day, Robinson is out on the floor
chasing Karl Malone, who's essentially a jump shooter; the next, he
is trying to shove Shaquille O'Neal out of the lane.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is still as willing, but recently, not as effective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my job to be Superman any more," he joked after a game
last week, nodding toward Duncan's cubicle. "We got Superman sitting
over there. I'm supposed to be filling the gaps and doing the things
that we need to do to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably not the one to ask [why he sits out fourth
quarters]. Right now there's probably 1,000 reasons and Pop knows
them all. I'm enjoying myself. I'm playing well. I'm feeling pretty
good. There's been one or two games where I haven't felt like I
played great, but for the most part I have played well.</TE>
<TE>   "No question, when I go out and see the stats--you know, 12 points
a game, eight rebounds--I'm thinking, that isn't very much for me,
coming from where I've come from.</TE>
<TE>   "But, you know, I've got to gauge it from within what [Popovich]
wants me to do for this team. I mean, I'm not going to shoot 20 times
a game."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, the bottom fell out.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs started the Laker game by pounding the ball into
Robinson, who went 0 for six in the first half, started the third
quarter with a 15-foot airball and didn't play in the fourth, after
which Popovich noted he had "a couple people who didn't show" and
Robinson ducked out on the media, the first time in his 13-year Spur
career he had fled the heat.</TE>
<TE>   That was after a pregame show in which Jayson Williams, NBC's
even-farther-off-the-wall answer to Turner's Charles Barkley, said
Robinson was "scared" of O'Neal (who wasn't in town), noting "this
isn't a knife fight" and advising Robinson to "bring your heart."</TE>
<TE>   Heaven forbid. All they do in this league is step on hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight O'Neal is in town and so is Robinson. The Spurs'
transition continues, day by extremely challenging day.</TE>

<DL>GONZALES, La.</DL>
<LD>Despite an array of legal problems, Greg "Toe" Nash was such a hot
baseball prospect that local officials gave the high school dropout a
second chance.</LD>
<LD>   Those efforts may have gone for naught.</LD>
<LD>   Nash, an outfielder in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' farm system, was
in jail Wednesday after his arrest on a charge of raping a
15-year-old girl.</LD>
<TE>   "The local community, the political people, the mayor all wanted
to give this kid an opportunity," District Attorney Tony Falterman
said. "From what I know about him, he had every opportunity to have a
productive life in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Nash, 19, was arrested Tuesday on one count of aggravated rape and
one count of aggravated crime against nature, a felony charge that
covers a variety of sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "My sympathy now goes to the victim and her family," Falterman
said. "I certainly did not want anything like that to happen to
someone."</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated case, Nash also was charged with one count of
felony theft. He was jailed in lieu of $300,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Benny Latino, the scout who found Nash for the Devil Rays, said he
thought he could make a difference in Nash's life.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I was naive, but to me he's innocent until proven guilty. I
can't abandon him now," Latino said.</TE>

<HD>A Dubious Exit for Summerall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Summerall enjoys working with John Madden, enjoys being Fox's
lead NFL play-by-play announcer, says his health is fine, and says he
is not retiring.</LD>
<LD>   So why is Summerall stepping down?</LD>
<LD>   Summerall, 71, says it was his decision, and no one at Fox is
saying otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   David Hill and Ed Goren, who run Fox Sports, flew to Dallas to
visit with Summerall at his home last week. Goren said Thursday they
went to Dallas mainly just to talk."I was watching 'Monday Night
Mayhem' on TNT and there were two things that stuck out," said Goren,
the president of Fox Sports. "One was that Keith Jackson found out he
was off 'Monday Night Football' [after the first season] by reading
it in the newspaper. The other was that Howard Cosell, when he was
deciding what his future would be, couldn't even get Roone Arledge to
return his call."</TE>
<TE>   And Goren noted that Cosell told a reporter he was quitting
"Monday Night Football" before he told Arledge.</TE>
<TE>   Goren and Hill are fond of Summerall. And they respect him. They
wanted his exit, or whatever you want to call it, to be classy and
amiable. And they wanted an open line of communication.</TE>
<TE>   According to Goren, one thing they tried to convey to Summerall
during their meeting in Dallas was that it might be in everyone's
best interest for him to make a decision about his future before
Super Bowl week.</TE>
<TE>   "It was his decision," Goren said.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall said the same, only he added, "However, I'm not saying
they are not glad I decided to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall didn't say so, but maybe he was feeling unappreciated.</TE>
<TE>   It all goes back to the 1999 season, a bad one for Summerall. He
was making more mistakes than he should have, and he wasn't seeing
plays he should have been seeing. And he was getting criticized.</TE>
<TE>   So after the season, Fox executives came up with a plan. They
decided to have Summerall announce he was going to retire after the
2002 Super Bowl, which would give him 50 years of association with
the NFL as a player and broadcaster. The 50 years would look good on
a press release.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was that Fox would later announce that Joe Buck was
taking Summerall's place alongside Madden.</TE>
<TE>   Everything went according to plan until the summer of 2000, when a
news conference was held in a Century City hotel, complete with a
buffet. Summerall and his wife, Cheri, were there for the big
announcement, which had been leaked to the press the night before.</TE>
<TE>   But Summerall did an about-face. At the news conference, in front
of local media and with the national media hooked up via a conference
call, Summerall said he wasn't retiring and that he hoped to continue
working with Madden for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   It was later learned Summerall had a good excuse for his bad
performance during the 1999 season. He was taking pain medication for
a bum knee, and the medication was affecting his play-by-play.</TE>
<TE>   The knee was replaced in March 2000, and the 2000 football season
was a better one for Summerall. But the question remained: Would
Summerall still step down after the 2002 Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   It was a question Summerall heard a lot during the past
year-and-half. It was one he wanted to avoid hearing over and over in
New Orleans during Super Bowl week.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall talked things over with his two close friends, director
Sandy Grossman and producer Bob Stenner. Summerall, Madden and those
two worked together at CBS before coming over to Fox as a group in
1994, after Fox obtained CBS' NFL package.</TE>
<TE>   He told Madden what he was going to do last Friday in St. Louis,
over breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he had the agency that manages him, IMG, alert the
media there would be a conference call Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, a network sets up such conference calls, but this whole
thing has been different from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the announcement, along with some confusion. It all
didn't make much sense unless you were familiar with the history.
Summerall wasn't forced out, but he apparently believed he had to
make the decision he did.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions</TE>
<TE>   Madden gave an impassioned speech about his longtime partner when
he talked with reporters during a conference call Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When the announcement came out, it was like a kick in the
stomach," he said. "That's when it hit me. You think about the 21
years you've been with someone and you're not gonna be with them any
more. It's been 21 more-than-great years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the smoothest or the easiest guy to get along with. I
kind of go up and down, but in 21 years we've never had a cross word,
not one argument. That's because of him. If you can't get along with
Pat Summerall, you can't get along with anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Madden said Summerall always took care of the things he couldn't
or didn't want to. "I've never said I was a television guy. I've
never passed myself off as a broadcaster. I'm a football guy who does
television. I went though school for 21 years being in recess, and
Pat was the school."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Gumbel and Chris Simms, CBS' lead NFL announcing team, also
praised Summerall during a conference call Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a broadcaster that I have identified more with, a
broadcaster I would like to be like more, than Pat," Gumbel said. "I
think he says and has said mountains with a minimum of words."</TE>
<TE>   Simms said, "I can hear it in my sleep, Pat Summerall going,
'Simms. Bavaro. Touchdown.' And you just go, 'Wow! That just said it
all.' It takes me a hundred words to say what Pat Summerall can sum
up in about five."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Rashad, who attended Wednesday night's Laker-Clipper game,
says he will go with his "NBA Inside Stuff" show to ABC next season.
Whether ABC signs Rashad to use him in any other capacities remains
to be seen.... On Saturday's NBA pregame show on NBC at 11:30 a.m.,
Rashad will announce the starters for next month's NBA All-Star
game.... NBC has an NBA doubleheader Saturday and in the first game,
New York at Milwaukee, former Clipper Tom Tolbert makes his network
debut as commentator.... The Lakers' game at Philadelphia on Sunday
is on NBC at 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   John Saunders has been named the host of ESPN's "The Sports
Reporters." He replaces Dick Schaap, who died last month after
complications from hip-replacement surgery.... A&amp;E features NFL
greats in its "Biography" series this coming week.... "Sugar" Shane
Mosley's fight with Vernon Forrest will be on HBO Saturday night at
6:35.... Fred Couples is featured on next week's edition of Fox
Sports Net's "Golf the West." The show, with a number of airings
beginning Sunday at 11:30 a.m., features the Sky Course at Lost
Canyons in Simi Valley. .</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield, a guest on KXTA (1150) Wednesday, said he would
have remained a Dodger had they "done what the Atlanta Braves did."
Asked why the Dodgers don't win, he said, "It's about spending money
wisely." ... Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian announced their show on
KSPN (1150) will be expanded one hour to 3-7 p.m. beginning Feb.
11.... Roger Lodge, the host of the hit TV show "Blind Date," will
fill in for Chris Myers on KMPC (1540) next week while Myers fulfills
his duties for Fox Sports Net in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Several listeners complained about Lee Hamilton's show Wednesday
on XTRA (690) and the way he handled a discussion of Mike Tyson's
behavior. Hamilton said that no black leaders came forward to condemn
Tyson. The listeners said that when Hamilton was asked to name the
leader of the white community, he said it was President Bush, who of
course is the leader of all Americans. Hamilton claims he is being
unfairly criticized.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Hamilton, with his track record, should just stay away from
racial issues altogether.</TE>

<HD>USC, UCLA Held at Bay</HD>
<DH>Bruins: Leading by two at the break, Stanford dominates
second half to win fifth consecutive game at Pauley Pavilion, 86-76.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This wasn't blowing a huge lead in a hostile arena. It wasn't taking
a weak opponent for granted. It wasn't UCLA sleepwalking,
substituting its 'A' game with a string of Zs.</LD>
<LD>   It was getting beat, pure and simple.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes that's the toughest kind of loss to take.</LD>
<TE>   Stanford steadily pulled away in the last 10 minutes to win at
Pauley Pavilion for the fifth year in a row, 86-76, Thursday night in
front of a crowd of 12,243 who showed up boisterous and left booing
the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Never before has a team won five in a row here, but history is the
least of the Bruins' problems. Coming on the heels of squandering a
20-point lead at Arizona, an uncomfortable edginess pervaded the
locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "Up to this point, in the games we lost we beat ourselves,"
forward T.J. Cummings said. "Tonight, they just out-executed us. They
played smarter and took advantage of every mistake we made."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was UCLA outplayed, Dan Gadzuric wasn't the best big man,
Jason Kapono wasn't the best clutch long-range shooter, Cedric
Bozeman wasn't the best freshman and Matt wasn't even the best
Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Julius Barnes, a Cardinal junior from Rowland Heights, scored 23
points, 16 in the second half, when Stanford turned a two-point
advantage into its third double-figure victory at Westwood in four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Jacobsen, a junior from Glendora, shook off a cold start to
score 15 of his 20 points after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   So this is how it works when a player feels at home on the
road--Jacobsen popped a three-point basket from NBA range for a 68-60
Cardinal lead with five minutes left, made another to extend the
margin to 10 points a minute later and gave his brother a
glad-to-be-home hug afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Childress, a freshman forward from Lakewood Mayfair High,
overshadowed Bozeman, scoring 14 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal center Curtis Borchardt scored a quiet 13 points, but
added eight rebounds and three blocked shots, outplaying Gadzuric,
who scored 19 points and made several ferocious dunks, yet was once
again compromised defensively because of foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric had four fouls and Cummings was called for his third with
13 minutes to play and became cautious thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 UCLA, 13-5 overall and 5-3 in the Pac-10, played with
emotion and purpose. The Bruins just weren't good enough to avoid
losing two in a row for the first time in two years.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 57-57, No. 17 Stanford (12-4, 5-2) used an
11-3 run to seize control. Two baskets by Childress, two free throws
by Barnes and the 25-footer by Jacobsen stuck the stake in UCLA. That
the Cardinal trio grew up in the Southland, a point not lost on
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of kids from Southern California who enjoy this
challenge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All of which galled the Bruins to no end.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate Stanford, and they beat us," Matt Barnes said. "They were
better tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, who averaged 25 points in the last four games, scored 20
but made only six of 16 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were without guard Rico Hines, who sat out for the
third game in a row because of lingering effects from a concussion.
He was cleared by a doctor Tuesday but experienced headaches before
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed Rico's defense--we have to cut down on penetration,"
Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric couldn't help getting three fouls in the first half
despite making an obvious effort to avoid them. Several times he
opted not to contest Cardinal players on drives for layups.</TE>
<TE>   As the game wore on and the fouls mounted, Stanford took control.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a personal goal of mine to beat them on our home floor,"
Matt Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   "And it didn't happen."</TE>

<LD>   "We were going with the percentages," USC Coach Henry Bibby said.</LD>
<TE>   The percentages did not pan out.</TE>
<TE>   Cal rode a school-record wave of three-point baskets to take the
No. 23-ranked Trojans to overtime and beat them on one last
three-pointer with two seconds to play, 92-91, stunning the crowd of
7,982 at the Sports Arena. The defeat left USC (14-4) tied with
Oregon atop the Pac-10 at 6-2. Cal is 5-2, 14-3.</TE>
<TE>   With two seconds remaining in overtime, and the Trojans nursing a
91-89 lead, Cal junior point guard Shantay Legans heaved up a
23-footer from the left wing that found nothing but net.</TE>
<TE>   USC couldn't get off a shot before time expired, completing a
Trojan collapse. They squandered a 10-point lead with 10 minutes to
play in regulation and a four-point advantage with 37.1 seconds
remaining in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "This just feels terrible," said USC senior forward Sam Clancy,
who led all scorers with 26 points and had 11 rebounds, his fourth
straight double-double and league-leading 10th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know how to feel. We got stung."</TE>
<TE>   Cal's winning play was made possible seconds earlier.</TE>
<TE>   After USC point guard Brandon Granville converted a pair of free
throws with 37.1 seconds to play in overtime to give the Trojans a
seemingly safe 91-87 lead, the 5-foot-10 Legans drove the lane for an
easy layup.</TE>
<TE>   With USC trying to kill the clock, Granville was trapped along the
sideline at midcourt and the ball was stripped by A.J. Diggs. As they
both fell to the floor, a held ball was called. The possession arrow
pointed to California.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to play keep-away but Brandon got caught in a
corner and I think he slipped," Bibby said. "That's basketball. It's
tough, a tough loss for us."</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday, Cal was making a league-worst 29.6% of its
three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Against USC, the Golden Bears set a school record by making 15
three-pointers. They converted 53.6% (15 of 28, including three of
three in overtime) from beyond the arc. The 15 three-pointers also
tied a record for a USC opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears sent the game into overtime when junior guard
Brian Wethers made a turnaround three-pointer from the right wing
with 4.6 seconds to play, tying the score, 79-79. Bibby said USC was
supposed to foul on the play, before a shot was attempted.</TE>
<TE>   USC freshman guard Errick Craven missed a runner as time expired.
Trojan forward David Bluthenthal scored 20 points, tying a career
high with six three-pointers. Granville had 19 points and six assists
but committed three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Junior center Kostas Charissis played a season-high 30 minutes and
had a career-high 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Wethers, one of five Cal players to score in double figures, came
off the bench to lead the Golden Bears with 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   USC made a dramatic three-point basket to close out the half.</TE>
<TE>   With 1.4 seconds remaining, Desmon Farmer inbounded a bounce pass
toward the right sideline to Bluthenthal, who took one dribble and
heaved a two-handed shot from 55 feet that swished for a
three-pointer, giving the Trojans a 42-40 lead at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Cal was determined to get 6-foot-11 freshman center Jamal Sampson
involved in the second half. After being held scoreless in the first
half, Sampson, who grew up in Inglewood, scored the Golden Bears'
first seven points of the second half to give them a 47-46 lead at
the 16:55 mark.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans embarked on an 18-7 run over the next six-plus
minutes to go up by a game-high 10-points, 64-54.</TE>
<TE>   Cal chipped away as USC had only two field goals over the final 10
minutes of regulation, setting up the dramatic finish.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever USC hit a big shot at the end, we would respond," Cal
Coach Ben Braun said. "USC kept hitting and every time you thought
they had inserted the dagger, we responded. Every time USC appeared
to get momentum, we bounced back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "It was like two heavyweights going toe-to-toe.
Something had to give."</TE>

<KH>NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Philadelphia at St. Louis, Sunday, 1:15
p.m., Ch. 11</KH>
<HD>St. Louis Spirit</HD>
<DH>Vermeil Has Coached Both Teams, but He'll Be Rooting for
the Rams</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Dick Vermeil lives just outside Philadelphia and gets the royal
treatment whenever he ventures into the city. And why not? He rescued
the hapless Eagles in the 1970s, turning a 4-10 team into a Super
Bowl participant in his first five seasons as coach. So, it's with a
hint of sadness that he confesses this:</LD>
<LD>   He won't be rooting for them Sunday in the NFC championship game.
Not against St. Louis. Not a chance.</LD>
<LD>   "If they were playing any other team, I'd be in their corner," he
said Thursday. "But I have so many personal relationships left within
the Ram organization, there's no way I could ever root against them."</LD>
<TE>   Vermeil, now Kansas City's coach, has spent the week scouting
talent at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. He was hesitant to talk
about the NFC title game and said he has turned down interviews all
week because "that game isn't about Dick Vermeil, it's about the Rams
and the Eagles."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, he's hailed as a hero in both cities. After the 1980
season, he was named NFL coach of the year when he led the Eagles to
their only Super Bowl appearance, a 27-10 loss to Oakland. Nineteen
years later, he won the honor again by coaching the Rams--the worst
team in football when he took the job--to their only Super Bowl
title.</TE>
<TE>   Time has mellowed the 65-year-old Vermeil. He now adheres to a
strict midnight curfew and goes home every night. It wasn't always
that way for the man who invented coaching burnout.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his career, he slept three nights a week in his office,
turning out the lights at 4 a.m. and getting up three hours later. By
his thinking, an idle moment was a moment wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lyon, longtime columnist at the Philadelphia Inquirer,
remembers getting into an elevator at Veterans Stadium with Vermeil
after the coach's introductory news conference. Vermeil pushed a
button, waited two seconds, then sighed with frustration when the
doors didn't immediately close.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing's too damn slow," Vermeil said. "Where are the
stairs?"</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles forced Vermeil to be patient. When he arrived, the
Eagles were short on talent, shorter on draft picks. They finished
4-10 his first season, then 5-9, 9-7 and 11-5. Finally, in 1980, they
won the NFC East and beat Dallas in the conference championship to
reach the Super Bowl. Vermeil said that victory was so stirring, his
players were unable to regain their focus for the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't relive it," he said. "I've developed the discipline not
to look back in regret. All that does is pull you down for the
future. When I look back, I look back at all the wonderful
relationships and friends I have from that time."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, after a 3-6 finish in the strike-shortened 1992
season, Vermeil stepped away from coaching in what would be a 14-year
hiatus. He returned in 1997 to coach the Rams, who had lost 76 games
in seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   As with the Eagles, Vermeil was forced to be patient. His team
went 5-11 and 4-12 before its abrupt turnaround, which came after
quarterback Trent Green suffered a season-ending knee injury and
Vermeil put the offense in the hands of arena-league refugee Kurt
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," Vermeil said, "that season wasn't so much a fairy tale.
It was a process."</TE>
<TE>   He said progress was being made behind the scenes during those
first two seasons. He weeded out problem players. He toughened those
who remained by resorting to some of his Philadelphia tactics,
including full-speed practices in pads all week. He retooled the
coaching staff and, before the 1999 season, hired offensive guru Mike
Martz, now head coach.</TE>
<TE>   In came Marshall Faulk and Torry Holt. Out went Tony Banks and
Eddie Kennison. The Rams' Super Bowl roster had only nine holdovers
from Vermeil's first season as coach.</TE>
<TE>   One player Vermeil regretted letting go was Chad Lewis, now a
standout tight end for the Eagles. Lewis, undrafted out of Brigham
Young, spent his rookie season with Philadelphia, then was cut the
next season after suffering an ankle injury. The Rams signed him
later that season, kept him as the fourth tight end for their first
nine games, then released him to create roster space.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great organization and a great coaching staff, and I
just felt like I came out of that a much better player," Lewis said.
"It's only a positive to me."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say getting released was painless. Vermeil called
him into his office, broke the news and added, "I'm sad to see you go
because we're going to the Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'It's OK. I understand your position, and I
appreciate you. I think you're a class act,'" Lewis said. "He
contemplated keeping me there on injured reserve or something, but he
felt like things would work out best if he let me go play someplace
else."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, the Eagles claimed Lewis off waivers. He made the
Pro Bowl in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Vermeil abruptly retired after winning the Super Bowl, sat out the
2000 season, then signed a three-year deal to coach the Chiefs. Yet
another test of patience.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan to go two more seasons," he said. "If I feel real good at
that time and I like where the team is going, then I might stay.
Hell, if we don't win they won't want me. It will take care of
itself."</TE>

<HD>To Top Bidder Go Spoils of Crime</HD>
<DH>Consumers: Treasury Department auctions draw crowds looking
for bargains among items seized from criminals or at customs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some attended the government auction for business. Some went to make
personal purchases. And others were there for the rush--if they could
follow the fast-talking auctioneer.</LD>
<LD>   "Thirty-three hundred? 33?" asked the auctioneer standing atop a
platform in front of a large warehouse. "Willyougive 34? Willyougive,
willyougive, willyougive?"</LD>
<LD>   Every nine weeks, the Department of the Treasury holds public
auctions in the EG&amp;G Technical Services Warehouse in Rancho Dominguez
to sell off jewelry, cars, electronics and other items seized by
customs and from convicted criminals.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 people gathered for the auction Thursday, some of them
experienced, others clearly bewildered by the high-speed bidding. The
auctioneer was still stuck on $3,300 when he heard from one of his
"ring men."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah!" shouted the ring man, who helps track bids, after he
spotted a bidder raising his lime green bidding card.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty-four hundred," the auctioneer said, recognizing the new
bid. "Canyougive 35? Willyougive, willyougive, willyougive?"</TE>
<TE>   In the back of the room, a man nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" yelped the ring man. Then nothing. Sold.</TE>
<TE>   In just seconds, Jerry Herskowitz of South Carolina had bought a
four-carat emerald and diamond ring. It didn't matter to him that the
ring was seized by the IRS from a couple who pleaded guilty to a
$42-million Medicare fraud. All that mattered was that his wife was
going to be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cars. She loves jewelry," Herskowitz said. "As far as I'm
concerned, it's a good deal."</TE>
<TE>   But EG&amp;G Technical Services spokeswoman, Britney Bartlett, said
that to get a deal, bidders should keep a clear head.</TE>
<TE>   "People get caught up in bidder frenzy," she said. "They think,
'You could get deals from Uncle Sam for pennies on the dollar.' No,
that doesn't happen. You have to do your homework."</TE>
<TE>   Herskowitz does his homework. He travels all over the country
buying items from public auctions for his discount retail business
and for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to pay retail for anything," he said, showing off a
navy blue sweater, a plaid shirt and gold necklace he wore, all
bought at auctions.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa resident Aniko Kenesei was an auction novice and
struggled to understand exactly what the auctioneer was saying.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't raise your hand for anything," her mother-in-law, Marie
Teglas, warned as Kenesei lifted a hand to her head. "Don't scratch
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Teglas, who was shopping for some machinery for her Orange County
deli, said that at auctions, "most of the time, I don't get
[anything]. The guys beat me out."</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benzes Draw Heaviest Bidding</TE>
<TE>   The audience was mostly male. They bid on African artifacts,
clothing, and sports cards of famous players, including rookie cards
of Ken Griffey Jr. and Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett said that to ensure that the merchandise doesn't return
to its original owners, auction staff run background checks on bid
winners.</TE>
<TE>   The heaviest bidding Thursday was for two Mercedes-Benzes
forfeited after an IRS investigation led to dozens of arrests for
money laundering, tax evasion and methamphetamine manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Several people who stood outside the warehouse eyeing the cars
wandered in when the auctioneer began the bidding at $10,000. But it
was those who sat for hours in rows of metal folding chairs who
actually bid. A 1999 Mercedes SL500 sold for $57,500, a 2000 Mercedes
S430 for $64,500.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident George Santana said that he planned to bid on
other cars, which included a Chevy Camaro and Toyota 4-Runner, but
that he was worried about the previous owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that it doesn't become a problem, and suddenly the
owner doesn't show up on my doorstep," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the quality and range of items that government agencies
seize, Bartlett said, people keep piling into the auctions every nine
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have a variety of things you can't get anywhere else,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Auctioneer Sean Fraley remembered an auction that put authentic
"Planet of the Apes" costumes up for bid. "There's no end to what the
government seizes," he said.</TE>

<HD>Baca: Agency Is Better Than Ever</HD>
<DH>Speech: Sheriff sees department as stronger, larger,
smarter and more secure. Rivals for his job accuse him of
understating problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, who is up for reelection in
March, on Thursday delivered his first "state of the department"
address, in which he proclaimed that his agency is "stronger, larger,
smarter and more secure" than at any other point in its history.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to a meeting of city managers in the Santa Clarita
Valley, Baca did not shy away from some of the more controversial
aspects of his first term in office: his budget deficit, his recent
purchase of a jet and his push for a homeless shelter in downtown Los
Angeles, among other so-called nontraditional law enforcement
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, Baca declared his leadership a success. "Simply put," he
said, "we are in the best shape ever."</LD>
<TE>   His comments prompted applause a couple times from the city
managers who represent the 41 cities that contract for Sheriff's
Department services. But he also drew criticism from his two
challengers, Sgts. Patrick Gomez and John Stites, both of whom heard
the speech.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Gomez and Stites accused the sheriff of understating
the department's financial troubles and sidestepping other, more
pressing problems, such as understaffing in patrol and increasing
gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's improved," Gomez said. "In fact, it's gotten worse."</TE>
<TE>   Stites sarcastically praised the sheriff for a "well-orchestrated"
event and said Baca appears comfortable speaking only when he has
"complete and total control." Baca has refused to debate his two
challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Stites initially was asked to leave Baca's speech, but sheriff's
officials decided he could stay as long as he didn't "make it into a
campaign event."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants say Baca is protecting his presumed lead, a
time-tested strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what incumbency is: He gets to go out there and highlight
his record," said Rick Taylor, a veteran consultant not involved in
the sheriff's race. "For him to go out there and tell the citizens of
L.A. County what he's done over the last four years is exactly what
he should be doing. That's what I would tell him to do."</TE>
<TE>   Besides delivering his speech, Baca also picked up an unusual
endorsement Thursday. Leo Terrell, a civil rights attorney known for
his lawsuits against police departments, said he supports the
sheriff's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "He's trying to make changes in an institution that doesn't like
change," said Terrell, who has numerous lawsuits pending against the
LAPD and the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell particularly praised Baca's Office of Independent Review,
for which civil rights attorneys were hired to aid in investigations
of Sheriff's Department actions. "That, to me, was a very, very bold
step," Terrell said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Baca said he is pushing the department to move in
new directions--initiating jail classes for sex offenders and drug
addicts, for instance, and launching programs for teenagers at risk
of dropping out of school and becoming gang members.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has "been accused of being an idealist, and, yes, I am
guilty."</TE>
<TE>   But, Baca said, "I choose to call what I do 'practical idealism.'"</TE>
<TE>   He also touted his support for a downtown homeless shelter that
would be staffed by deputies and mental health experts. If the
shelter succeeds in treating homeless people, Baca believes, the
Sheriff's Department can reduce the numbers of mentally ill inmates
in its jails.</TE>
<TE>   Baca did not address, however, medical care in the jails, which is
costing the county millions of dollars in lawsuit settlements and
judgments. His challengers say the $2.4 million Baca recently spent
on an airplane for himself and the department should have been used
to improve medical care for inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff, however, contends that much of the money for the
airplane was restricted for air support functions and therefore could
not have been spent on jails. Moreover, he said the plane is being
mostly used by homicide investigators to travel as part of their
work.</TE>
<TE>   On the budget, Baca acknowledged that the $25-million shortfall in
this year's spending plan caught him off guard. He blamed the deficit
on increased staff for new programs--some of which he created--as
well as the costs of housing illegal immigrants in county jails. He
said the department will pay off its shortfall, in part by using
federal funds that reimburse the county for the illegal immigrants in
jails.</TE>
<TE>   But the Board of Supervisors has not yet released that money, and
it is unclear when that will happen. The supervisors have control
over the department budget.</TE>
<TE>   Baca, however, is undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "It is only applicable to my department," the sheriff said. "They
can't use it for any other purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Baca said the department must continue to grow. To accomplish
that, he is asking voters to approve Proposition C on the March
ballot. The measure would allow him to add five high-level positions
at an annual cost of about $600,000. Those include an assistant
sheriff, who would be a civilian, and four chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   "I want us to be a leader and an innovator in law enforcement to
be envied and copied by others across the nation," Baca said. "Not
because it is self-serving, but because it's the right thing to do.
Better law enforcement makes for a better community."</TE>

<HD>Rule Limits Bacteria Levels  in Bay</HD>
<DH>Pollution: State rules are expected to make 44 beaches safe
within three years. Affected area reaches from Ventura to Palos
Verdes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water officials on Thursday ordered local governments to clean
up bacteria pollution streaming into Santa Monica Bay within three
years so that all of its beaches are safe for swimming every day
during the summer.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules cover 44 beaches that stretch from the Los
Angeles-Ventura County line to Outer Cabrillo Beach just south of the
Palos Verdes Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   Adopted as a result of a federal lawsuit settlement, the rules
mark the first time that state officials have clamped down on
water-borne bacteria that can cause stomach and respiratory ailments
in swimmers, surfers and others who come in contact with the ocean.</LD>
<TE>   City and county officials also have six years to make sure no
coastal waters in the bay exceed safe bacteria levels during dry
winter days, under the rules passed unanimously by the Los Angeles
Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   The state agency on Thursday postponed the tougher task of
cleaning up bacteria swept by a deluge of storm water into the ocean
during rainy days. That issue will surface later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Thursday's decision is expected to have perhaps the greatest
practical impact on human health because summertime is when the most
people wade into the surf.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 55 [million] to 60 million people visiting the beaches of
the Santa Monica Bay every year," said H. David Nahai, chairman of
the regional water board. "This is a significant step forward in
protecting the health of the people who use the beach and swim in our
coastal waters."</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown on bacteria pollution is part of a larger plan
outlined in the settlement of a lawsuit filed by environmental groups
Heal the Bay and Santa Monica BayKeeper. The agreement between
government officials and these groups worked out a schedule to set
limits on a variety of pollutants that wind up in coastal waters of
Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the regional board approved plans to scale back trash
that is often swept by runoff into the sea. In coming months and
years, it will crack down on toxic metals and chemical pollutants
that harm marine life.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, the board is focused on limiting bacteria from
spilled sewage, rotting vegetation and animal droppings that have
made warning signs and beach closures a common occurrence on some
stretches of the bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Just informing the public of health hazards is clearly not
enough," said Mark Gold, director of Heal the Bay, which grades
beaches in a weekly report card. "This will ensure that all of the
beaches will be A-plus beaches during dry weather. That's a huge
improvement when we see a third of the beaches don't reach A grade
and there are many, many F beaches."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Surfrider Beach in Malibu, a legendary surf spot
with notoriously polluted water, will have to pass muster all summer
long and will be allowed to exceed bacterial standards during only
three dry days in the winter. Last year, in contrast, it exceeded
such standards on 66 days, Gold said.</TE>
<TE>   The rules, setting "total maximum daily loads," do not require
that all bacteria be eliminated, but rather that it be reduced to a
level that the bay can absorb without being harmful to people or
marine life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a zero level, but a safe level," Nahai said.</TE>
<TE>   These rules calculate safe levels using "indicator"
bacteria--total coliform, fecal coliform and enterococci--that show
up in the ocean at the end of storm drains, discharge pipes, streams
and rivers.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to get sick off total coliform, but we know that
viruses and harmful bacteria often accompany it," said Jonathan
Bishop, a manager at the regional water board.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning up such discharges, even during dry weather, is difficult
because the pollutants don't come from one source.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they are carried by what some scientists call "urban
slobber." That's the accumulation of pet waste, rotting garbage and
other contaminants that are carried by lawn sprinkler runoff, car
washing and myriad other spills and flows that find their way into
the storm drains and then into the surf.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, such as Santa Monica and Los Angeles, have begun to
clean up these dry-weather discharges by diverting the runoff into
the sewage system so it can be treated, or purified by ultraviolet
light. Some of the reclaimed waste water will be used for irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   Others cities raised objections to the new rules, complaining that
they are too costly. A group of mostly inland cities, called the
Coalition for Practical Regulation, has been opposing virtually all
of the tighter pollution standards as they work their way through the
approval process.</TE>
<TE>   The new bacteria standards will be forwarded to Sacramento for
approval by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board,
which oversees its regional board in Los Angeles and eight other
jurisdictions. Then the standards go to the Office of Administrative
Law and finally the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The EPA has already agreed to approve this in coordination with
the regional boards," said David Beckman, a senior attorney with the
Natural Resources Defense Council. Beckman, who handled the lawsuit
brought by Heal the Bay and BayKeeper, said tougher bacterial
standards were part of the settlement, which was approved by a
federal judge.</TE>

<HD>The Fate of Easter Service Comes Down to Chance</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Bowl: A coin toss today will determine who will
produce the annual sunrise event. Veteran organizers of the event are
outraged by county's decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of this year's Easter sunrise service at the Hollywood Bowl
will remain up in the air until a coin falls to the ground this
morning.</LD>
<LD>   Two organizations--the long-time producers of the event and the
nation's largest Christian television network--are wrestling over who
should control the content of the annual religious spectacle.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County officials, who own the Bowl, have decided to
settle the fight by flipping a coin. The winner will be either the
Los Angeles civic group that founded the event or the Santa Ana-based
Trinity Broadcasting Network.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of the nonprofit Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service
Inc. contend that they have the right to hold the sunrise service
because their predecessors created the Hollywood Bowl more than 80
years ago and gave it to the county in exchange for permission to use
it each Easter morning.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of the 29-year-old Trinity network say they should have
an opportunity to stage the Easter program and televise it worldwide
because the Bowl is a publicly owned site.</TE>
<TE>   The coin-flip order has outraged veteran sunrise service
organizers. They contend that they are only partway through a 99-year
renewable lease that guarantees them the annual use of the Bowl for
$1 a year.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say they have no evidence that such an agreement
ever existed, however. They contend that a lottery system is the only
fair way to decide who gets the Bowl each Easter morning.</TE>
<TE>   Today's coin toss will be conducted at 10 a.m. at the Music Center
headquarters of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., which handles
Hollywood Bowl lease arrangements for the county.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Trinity say the broadcasters would turn the traditional
event into a fund-raising telethon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable the county would come up with this decision
knowing the documents and the rights we have," said Norma Foster, a
Hollywood film and television producer who is president of Hollywood
Bowl Easter Sunrise Service.</TE>
<TE>   "The sunrise service doesn't belong to an Orange County ministry.
It belongs to the people of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Foster said the Hollywood Bowl exists today because of the Easter
sunrise service.</TE>
<TE>   According to her group's records, Hollywood's first Easter service
was conducted in 1919 by the Hollywood Community Chorus and the
Community Park and Art Assn. on a residential street in the Whitely
Heights area. Two years later, it moved to a nearby natural
amphitheater, where the predawn audience stood in knee-high weeds
while musicians played on a makeshift stage.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed by the acoustics of what was then known as "Daisy Dell,"
leaders of the Community Park and Art Assn. purchased the canyon site
and renamed it "Hollywood Bowl." On Sept. 29, 1924, the association
gave the land to the newly incorporated Hollywood Bowl Assn., which
controlled it until the late 1930s, when it deeded the property to
the county, according to Foster's group.</TE>
<TE>   The Bowl association's Easter sunrise service committee was
incorporated as the Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service in 1943 and
for nearly a half century more continued the traditional religious
services at the Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Trinity Broadcasting entered the picture in the early 1990s. In a
move that drew criticism, supporters of Trinity televangelists Paul
and Jan Crouch seized control of the Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise
Service's board and quietly signed an agreement authorizing the
network to produce and broadcast the Bowl's 1992 Easter service.</TE>
<TE>   The Crouches' network boasts that it is carried on 17 satellites
to more than 2,500 television stations and hundreds of cable TV
systems around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime supporters of the sunrise service were irritated by
Trinity network personalities who took over the event and accused
them of undermining the service's traditional multidenominational
character. They were also angered when they saw Trinity's promotional
"prayer line" telephone number superimposed on the television screen
over images of the service.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran association leaders regained control of the service the
next year and Foster and her associates resumed producing the sunrise
event. She said work was underway for this year's program when county
officials announced two months ago that the 2002 producer would be
picked at random.</TE>
<TE>   "Trinity threatened a lawsuit against the county, saying it's
unfair it only goes to one group," Foster said. "They got Los Angeles
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich to lobby for them."</TE>
<TE>   Trinity's Paul Crouch could not be reached for comment Thursday
and calls to the network's spokesman, Washington, D.C., lawyer Colby
May were not returned. A spokesman for Antonovich, Tony Bell, said
Antonovich supports the concept of a random drawing to pick the
producer of the sunrise service but has not lobbied on behalf of
Trinity.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike has been featured on Trinity Broadcasting Network and agrees
with the work they do. He agrees with the Philharmonic and the
[county] parks department that a drawing is the best way to handle
it," Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic association leaders said Friday that they were
unaware of any legal action threatened by Trinity Broadcasting. But
they conceded that the network's complaints prompted the change in
Easter procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be as fair as possible," said Elizabeth Hinckley,
a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Hinckley said that Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service has
failed to convince officials that its predecessors are responsible
for today's Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "They've never been able to come forth with legal documents that
would prove that. Saying the Hollywood Bowl exists because of the
sunrise program hasn't been proven. We appreciate what has happened
in the past. But the argument that they have a right to it hasn't
been quite proven."</TE>
<TE>   County lawyers are preparing a memorandum that will outline
officials' rationale for opening future sunrise services to competing
groups. That document is expected to be finished by the time today's
coin is tossed, Hinckley said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, officials have drafted new rules that will
prevent Trinity--or any other future Easter service producer--from
using the event as a fund-raising tool.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's going to be left to chance in this," Hinckley said.</TE>
<TE>   Except naming the sunrise service's producer.</TE>

<LD>A man suspected of fatally shooting a woman in 1987 in Long Beach
over a drug squabble has been extradited from Arizona, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Barragan, 42, arrived in Long Beach on Wednesday, almost 15
years after he allegedly killed 31-year-old Debra Pilato in a home in
the 2400 block of Pasadena Avenue, said Long Beach Police Officer
David Marander.</LD>
<LD>   Police said that Barragan shot Pilato when he went to the home
looking for two men, who were not there.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they think Barragan fled to Mexico. In September 2000,
Arizona authorities arrested Barragan after he tried to enter the
United States illegally, Marander said. He will be arraigned today in
Long Beach.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police shot and killed an armed man in a stolen pickup
truck at a busy Encino strip mall parking lot, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whom police have not identified, had illegally parked
outside a bookstore in the 16500 block of Ventura Boulevard, said
Officer Nadine Hernandez, a Los Angeles Police Department
spokeswoman. The truck was used in an earlier theft, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jeffrey Douglas Ingalls and his partner, Officer Patrick
Joseph Merrin, were waiting for the man to come out of the bookstore
about 9 p.m. Wednesday. When the officers approached him, he got in
the truck and closed the door.</LD>
<TE>   Ingalls shattered the driver-side window with his nightstick, and
as he reached in, he saw the man was armed, said Sgt. John
Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman. Ingalls fired his gun once, striking
the man in the chest.</TE>

<HD>Bamieh Leads in Funds for D.A. Race</HD>
<DH>Election: Candidate's father donated nearly all the
$217,000 he has raised in the last three weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County district attorney candidate Ron Bamieh collected
$217,000 in campaign contributions in the past three weeks, almost
entirely from his rich father.</LD>
<LD>   San Mateo businessman Sam Bamieh gave his son $215,000, doubling
the amount he has spent on the campaign since last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, rival candidate Greg Totten picked up $49,000 in small
donations from nearly 150 supporters, including local attorneys,
doctors and ranchers, according to campaign finance reports filed
Thursday. He also picked up $6,000 from labor and law enforcement
unions.</LD>
<TE>   Totten has raised about $227,000 since the campaign began--less
than half the $530,000 raised by his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   But Totten said he is not threatened by Bamieh's overflowing
campaign treasury, which he expects will pass the $1-million mark
before the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County voters are very smart," he said. "I've got the
experience, the character and support that money can't buy."</TE>
<TE>   The two prosecutors are vying to replace retiring Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury, who steps down next January after six terms.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, the 47-year-old chief assistant district attorney, has
been endorsed by Bradbury, Sheriff Bob Brooks, police and labor
unions, and four Ventura County supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, a 36-year-old senior deputy district attorney, has
endorsements from former state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and
the Simi Valley police officers' association.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates liken the contentious race to a
David-versus-Goliath fight--one battling big money, the other
fighting big endorsements and Bradbury's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "This office was going to be handed down," said Bamieh, who argues
that without big money no one could challenge the "good-old-boys"
network.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, to run against the system they created, you need
resources," Bamieh said. "My father and mother love their son. They
worked hard all their lives, and they have the resources."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Bamieh owns several privately held corporations and has been a
major GOP contributor. He raised $1.1 million for former Gov. Pete
Wilson by holding a fund-raiser at his Hillsborough home, and
personally gave Wilson $259,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to retire from it until Ron Bamieh decided
to run for office," Sam Bamieh told The Times in an interview last
fall. "Ron has the experience, so I feel as a loving father I will
help him all I can to provide him resources."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reports show the elder Bamieh made seven large
donations from Jan. 3-18 totaling $215,000. To date, he has given
about $454,000 to his son's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just proof that his father is making good on his promise to
buy this election," Totten said Thursday. "Less than half a percent
of his money comes from within Ventura County. We have raised our
money from people living and working in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Bamieh's role in the race has riled Totten's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very concerned about this race," said Ventura County
Supervisor John Flynn. "I feel it is very important that candidates
for office in Ventura County get their money from the residents and
people who live in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want someone up in San Mateo County electing a district
attorney for my county."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh counters by saying he won't take any contributions over
$500 from anyone inside Ventura County because he believes the
district attorney should never appear beholden to local political
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be naive. People contribute because they want to have
some say. They want access, and I always worry about insiders trying
to gain influence inside the district attorney's office," he said.
"You just have to be very careful."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign finance reports filed Thursday show Bamieh
outspending Totten 3 to 1 with mailers, television and radio ads.
Bamieh also spent about $39,000 on a New York-based campaign
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Totten knows he will be outspent. But he plans to unleash hundreds
of supporters, including his union backers, to take the campaign
door-to-door, he said.</TE>

<HD>Readiness Is the Canyon Way</HD>
<DH>People: 'We're our own best, first line of defense,'
resident says. Everyone knows where the water is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The men of Holy Jim and Trabuco canyons--and they are mostly men,
heavily bearded and favoring flannel shirts and sturdy work
boots--know where every drop of water is on the hillsides and in the
creek beds around them.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to be ready," said Frank Romero, who has 2,500 gallons
of water in a spring-fed cistern in front of the cabin he has
co-owned for 10 years here, ready for blazes like the one that
erupted Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   In this rustic world just five miles from the sprawling red-tile
rooftops of south Orange County, fire and flood are constant perils
bookending an otherwise utterly tranquil existence. Knowing where the
water is--in natural springs, wells, water tanks and the like--is
essential for survival.</LD>
<TE>   People here live literally on the edge, in wood and creek stone
cabins tucked in the Cleveland National Forest without electricity,
sewage, plumbing or other modern conveniences. They like it that way.
Nature is not conquered here; at best it is held at bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Electricity? Nah, what do you need that for?" said a man, 59, who
goes simply by Shannon, with a full snowy beard and a ponytail down
his back, who has owned a Holy Jim cabin for more than 28 years.</TE>
<TE>   Holy Jim is loosely named after "Lyin'" or "Cussin'" Jim Smith,
who lived in a now-gone cabin in this storied area of the Santa Ana
Mountains in the early 1900s. "Every time he appeared in town, every
other word out of his mouth was a cussword," Shannon said. But when
the canyon was formally named, neither Lyin' nor Cussin' Jim Canyon
sounded quite right, so it became Holy Jim.</TE>
<TE>   Today's denizens, most of whom are self-employed as contractors,
auto repairmen, gardeners or other types of handymen, were grinning
with relief and pleasure in front of Trabuco General Store on
Thursday morning after a long night on the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a massive fire," said Steve Hansel, 63, who has owned his
cabin for 29 years. "It burned down to within 10 feet of my solar
panel out back."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies and U.S. Forest Service rangers tried to
evacuate all the residents at least twice during the night, but many
simply melted into the darkness, then popped back up at their cabins.</TE>
<TE>   "We're our own best, first line of defense," said Mike Horna, 48,
of Anaheim, who like many owns a cabin in the canyon that he gets
away to every chance he can.</TE>
<TE>   All night Wednesday, they kept an eye on the sprinklers, water
pumps, hoses, cisterns and other hand-rigged defenses they had
mounted well in advance of this week's blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the Everglades out here--everything was wet,"
chortled Kevin Jordan, 47, who has owned one of the larger, newer
cabins for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, like many of the other 100 or so residents, raced up to
the cabins after hearing news reports or receiving phone calls from
friends on cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   As walls of flame raced along the ridge above them, and at one
point in Trabuco Creek below, they went door to door, evacuating
those who wanted to go. They gently rounded up Betty Somes, an
elderly woman with one leg who uses an oxygen machine. She was in her
cabin reading.</TE>
<TE>   Cats, dogs and pet birds were all secured. Propane tanks, which
can explode like missiles in a fire, were shut off.</TE>
<TE>   "When something happens here, everybody shows up. It's an
old-fashioned community," Shannon said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who wanted to leave were escorted down the 5 1/2-mile rutted
road that meanders near Trabuco Creek through stands of sycamore and
live oak.</TE>
<TE>   Behind them, flames were racing up the ridge between the two
canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Some gathered at the forest-green fire station that houses two
aging fire engines and serves as the headquarters for a volunteer
fire corps. Others began laying out hose near the "forks," the
confluence of Holy Jim and Trabuco creeks where there is a deep pool
of water year-round.</TE>
<TE>   As professional firefighters from Station 16 in nearby Modjeska
Canyon and elsewhere arrived, the residents directed them to huge
wooden water tanks they have built in the woods, which they regularly
top off by pumping water from the creeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fire Department didn't have any problem with us," Jordan
said. "We know where everything is."</TE>
<TE>   The residents were happy with the firefighters as well.</TE>
<TE>   "They are incredible," Jordan said. "They saved us."</TE>
<TE>   The weather helped too.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy, cold winds fanning the flames switched course before
midnight and began knocking the fire down. By 3 a.m., "it was so
cold, and the flames were so low, we were out back of my house
warming our hands over them," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the residents who had stayed behind emerged Wednesday to
pick up provisions at the general store below the canyon, using one
of the aging red fire trucks. By midday, the mountain men were headed
back up the dirt road, fresh supplies of beer and cigarettes tucked
in the back of the truck. Above them on one charred ridge, a line of
rescue workers hosed down smoldering embers.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, the truck climbed through emerald green slopes set
against a sparkling blue sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at it," exclaimed Romero, who stood watching at the fork of
the two canyons. "It's beautiful."</TE>

<DH>Courts: Decision clears Aliso Viejo church volunteer who
was imprisoned 6 1/2 years on child sex abuse charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN YSIDRO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>An Orange County church volunteer who spent 6 1/2 years in a Baja
prison was cleared of child sex abuse charges Thursday by a Mexican
federal appeals court, ending a protracted legal odyssey with an
emotional celebration amid the smog and bustling traffic at the
Tijuana border.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very relieved and very grateful," David Cathcart, 60, said,
adding that his incarceration was marked by more than the passage of
time. "My father passed away. Eight granddaughters were born. Two
sons were married. You can't put a price on that."</LD>
<LD>   But he's going to try. While the decision ends the criminal case,
Cathcart said he plans to take legal action against those he believes
conspired to imprison him to protect a politically connected director
of La Puerta de Fe, or Door of Faith, orphanage, where Cathcart had
volunteered.</LD>
<TE>   In the near future, though, Cathcart said he planned to celebrate
with a vodka martini at the Aliso Viejo apartment he shares with his
girlfriend, Tammy Stoller.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried this morning--I don't know if it's sunk in yet," Stoller
said. "I worked for seven years to make this happen. I finally got
what I prayed for."</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart was released from prison in May when a state judge
overturned his 1994 conviction on charges that he had sex with
children at the orphanage in La Mision, a dusty crossroads town near
Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Marta Flores Trejo ruled that the case was built on the lies
of four boys who were coerced by former orphanage director Gabriel
Diego Garcia, with whom Cathcart had argued over how orphanage
donations--mostly from Orange County Christians--were being spent.</TE>
<TE>   Diego, who could not be reached Thursday, has repeatedly denied
misusing funds or orchestrating the accusations against Cathcart.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a state-level appeals court overturned Flores'
decision and ordered Cathcart to finish the 12-year sentence.
Cathcart appealed, leading to Thursday's 35-page decision issued in
Mexicali.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Arce, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor in Ensenada,
said the ruling had not been forwarded to that office, so she had no
comment other than to reiterate its belief that Cathcart is guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling means that I'm free, that I don't have to live in
fear of being extradited, and my name is cleared," Cathcart said as
old Dean Martin songs seeped from speakers outside a duty-free shop
about 100 yards from the border.</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart insisted that he harbors no general anger toward the
Mexican judicial system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the evildoing of one man in the beginning and several others
after that," Cathcart said. "I dearly love the [Mexican] people. I
would love to live there. I have a friend there that came between me
and a knife. So how can you be angry?"</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart and Stoller received word of the ruling in an 8:30 a.m.
phone call from their Irvine attorney, William Bollard, who had
traveled to Mexicali to pick up the decision. Then the couple sped to
the San Ysidro border crossing to greet Bollard and Cathcart's Mexico
City attorney, Enrique Gandara Zepeda, and to talk to
reporters--including TV crews from Mexico, where the case has been
closely followed.</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart, a former travel agent, said he owes about $250,000 in
legal bills, including about $60,000 to Bollard, the last in a series
of lawyers Cathcart employed to try to win his freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The years spent sleeping on a cement prison bunk exacerbated
arthritis problems, Cathcart said, and he now is unable to work.
"There's days I can't move," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Cathcart said those problems did not lessen the sense of
relief that came with Thursday's ruling, which ended fears that he
might have to finish the 12-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart's religious faith continued to buoy him Thursday, as it
did during his time in prison. Despite his health troubles, he said
he remains optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "God brought me to this point, and he's not finished with me,"
Cathcart said, wearing a fleece pullover in patriotic red, white and
blue. "He's not going to let me down.... Today has been one of the
best days in a long while."</TE>
<TE>   Bollard said the ruling was unequivocal and "remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   "This federal court panel unanimously states that Mr. Cathcart
never should have been convicted and that he spent six years of his
life in Ensenada unjustly," Bollard said.</TE>
<TE>   Bollard said no decision has been made on what civil action to
pursue against whom, but that the federal ruling could serve as a
loaded gun by finding there was "credible evidence" that the
accusations against Cathcart were coerced by Diego and unnamed
co-conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   Bollard declined to say whether those involved included Americans.
He said any civil actions would be pursued in Mexican courts.</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart was charged while volunteering as a liaison between St.
Timothy's Catholic Church in Laguna Niguel and the orphanage, which
is financed by a network of Southern California Christians--including
an Irvine-based foundation whose star-studded galas have raised more
than $1million for the Door of Faith and other Baja orphanages.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were based on statements by four boys who later
recanted their allegations, saying Diego had coerced them to lie. The
orphanage now is under the direction of a former Orange County
couple, and Baja orphanage supporters say problems that plagued the
facility in the mid-'90s have been cleaned up.</TE>

<HD>Riordan and Davis Widen Money Lead</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former mayor outpaced GOP rivals and the
governor in early January, financial reports show. Both candidates
have begun buying TV time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN  and DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Gov. Gray Davis widened
their fund-raising advantage in recent weeks, pulling away from their
competitors in the race for governor of California.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign contribution reports filed Thursday show that Riordan not
only outpaced the other candidates in the Republican primary contest,
but also raised more than the governor he hopes to defeat in
November. Davis, a Democrat, faces no serious opposition in his party
primary.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan collected $605,804 between Jan. 1 and Jan. 19, far
outdistancing businessman Bill Simon Jr. and Secretary of State Bill
Jones as the GOP contest entered a crucial period.</LD>
<TE>   Davis received $472,810 in the reporting period.</TE>
<TE>   Early polls have suggested that Riordan enjoys a substantial lead
in the Republican race. The prospect of a contest between the
incumbent governor and former mayor has led both candidates to begin
buying expensive television air time across the state--in Riordan's
case, to introduce him to voters outside of Los Angeles who may know
little about him; and for Davis, to tout his record at a time when
the Republican candidates are united in their criticism of the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spent almost $2.7 million in the first 2 1/2 weeks of the
new year. Riordan's TV advertising was his largest expense during a
period in which he spent $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The two-term mayor of the state's largest city still had nearly
$2.3 million on hand Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis has more than $33 million in his campaign treasury and
continues to raise money quickly. The governor plans a major
fund-raiser next week featuring former President Bill Clinton, who
enjoyed warm relations with Riordan during the two men's terms but
who, like Davis, is a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Erie, a political science professor at UC San Diego, said
Riordan has several advantages in the Republican race, including his
fund-raising ability, his powerful name recognition after eight years
as mayor in the state's biggest media market and the desperation of
Republicans to recapture the governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and Jones are hampered by their relative obscurity, Erie
said.</TE>
<TE>   The professor added that Davis needed to get on the air with
campaign commercials or risk letting Riordan gain momentum in a
potential head-to-head fight next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "He has much to fear with Riordan," Erie said.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor's campaign received a major boost last Friday
when a longtime supporter, Los Angeles billionaire Jerrold Perenchio,
gave him a $100,000 check, bringing Perenchio's total contributions
to $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio, owner of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, also
is a major financial backer of Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also received $50,000 from Redondo Beach jury consultant
Gail Jaquish and $25,000 from the Shiloh Trust of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokesman downplayed the significance of Riordan's
fund-raising surge. "He's only got $30 million to go to catch up,"
said campaign press secretary Roger Salazar. "A two-week period is
not a good snapshot. Even if you extrapolate that out for the rest of
the campaign, we're still going to be in a good position."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said Davis began his own TV commercials to counter "a
daily diet" of negative comments made by his Republican opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's largest contributions in early 2001 came from the
International Assn. of Firefighters, which gave him $75,000, and
Maurice Marciano, chairman and chief executive of Guess Inc., who
donated $50,000 to the Davis campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Robert J. Abernethy, president of American Standard Development
Co. of Los Angeles, also contributed $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   While Riordan and Davis dominated the fund-raising and spending
during the early part of the year, Simon and Jones continued to
struggle in gathering contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Jones raised $237,391 in the latest period, almost half in a
single $100,000 contribution from Oakhurst, Calif.-based Sierra Tel
Communications. He received $50,000 from Cubic Corp., a San
Diego-based defense contractor, last Friday. He spent just under
$154,000, not enough to get his ads on the air.</TE>
<TE>   By holding on to campaign funds, Jones was able to keep his cash
on hand at $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Simon reported only $196,685 in contributions during the latest
period, despite an endorsement and appearances by former New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   The wealthy businessman has made substantial loans to his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In early January, he spent 10 times as much as he raised--almost
$1.95 million--mostly to buy time for TV and radio commercials. As of
Saturday, he had just under $1.28 million left in his campaign
treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Bob Taylor said the candidate's fund-raising has
actually accelerated far more than is apparent in Thursday's report
and that it will continue to grow through the primary.</TE>
<TE>   A $1,000-per-person event with Giuliani on Jan. 17 raised about
$500,000, Taylor said, but the money did not show up on the report
because most of it was in pledges, and the money itself has not yet
been received.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Lapsley, campaign manager for Jones, said the campaign is
determined to reach 1 million voters to win the Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   "Money isn't everything," Lapsley said. "If it was, it would be
Gov. Checchi and President Perot. We know who our voters are. It does
not take $10 million to communicate with those folks."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Spillane, political director for the Riordan campaign, said
the former mayor is gaining momentum not only in fund-raising, but
also in polls and endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   He scoffed at the contention of the Jones campaign that big money
is not crucial in the Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   "Any candidate who's running for governor of California and
doesn't believe he needs millions of dollars, doesn't have millions
of dollars and doesn't have a chance," he said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Officials Go to Washington to Push for Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Contingent, including two supervisors, reports
positive feedback from federal agencies. El Toro foes say trip is a
waste.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Orange County officials used a visit to the nation's
capital Thursday to push ahead with plans to build an El Toro
airport, even as polls indicate that a majority of county voters have
soured on the project.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors Jim Silva and Chuck Smith, along with El Toro planning
director Gary Simon and architect Mark Molen, said they intend to
continue with airport planning even as voters go to the polls in
March to once again decide the fate of the closed Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   During a round-table discussion, they emphasized that an
international airport at El Toro would be the first built with
post-Sept. 11 security requirements in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Simon said the group had met with officials from several key
agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, and had
received positive feedback.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited and encouraged that our federal colleagues are on
schedule," he said, referring to the expected completion of an
environmental review in February by the Navy and the FAA. He said
officials encouraged them to begin seeking funding for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport opposition's claim that federal funding is not
available is ridiculous," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition groups argue that there is no guarantee that federal
funding would be granted to convert the base to a commercial airport.
An FAA report released last year said the airport, as designed, would
conflict with flights arriving at John Wayne and Long Beach airports,
and would add delays to Southern California's already overcrowded
airspace.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also say an airport at the base would hurt the quality
of life in South County.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport spokeswoman Meg Waters called it a waste of money to
send a contingent to Washington to promote an airport voters will
kill in March.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking about the terminal design at El Toro is about as useful
as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic," said Waters, who
represents the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a coalition of
anti-airport South County cities.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said county officials travel to Washington every two months
to meet with administration officials and lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The group will continue working to increase the airport plan's
visibility at the federal level despite the March 5 vote on Measure
W, the initiative that seeks to replace airport zoning at the base
with that of an urban park and other development, Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, planners were phasing out the name El Toro in favor of
Orange County International Airport, or OCX, its potential airport
code, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to stop thinking about it as the development of a former
military base and start thinking about it as the development of OCX,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Silva and Smith said they still strongly favor an
airport at El Toro. But Silva repeated earlier statements that he
would probably stop pushing for the airport if Measure W passed. The
county's airport plan is supported by a 3-2 margin on the board, with
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad joining Smith and Silva in support.
Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson oppose the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "El Toro is the ideal location for an ideal airport," Silva said.
"The FAA has determined that OCX is a safe airport to fly in and out
of.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take billions of dollars to create what we already have
in Orange County," he said, referring to the existing runways at the
base and its large buffer zone.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's demand for air travel will grow and demand in
general should fully recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
18 to 24 months, the officials said. John Wayne Airport, they said,
is operating at 95% of its pre-Sept. 11 levels. "The demand is
there," Smith said. "We as elected officials have got to meet that
demand some way."</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes question the county's demand estimates, arguing that
other airports in the region can accommodate future passenger loads.</TE>
<TE>   In its current design, the El Toro airport terminal would have
three levels: one for departures, a second for ticketing and
security, and another for arrivals. Curbside passenger drop-off and
baggage check-in areas would be more than 300 feet from the main
terminal and would be connected to the terminal by moving walkways.</TE>
<TE>   "Pulling the curbside away from the terminal is something we would
have never looked at pre-Sept. 11," said Molen, vice president of
architectural design for URS Corp. "It would be a very different
experience from most airports."</TE>

<HD>Canyon Fire Quelled as Winds Die</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAN WEIKEL and JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hampered by steep terrain but assisted by changing weather, about 500
firefighters battled a day-old brush fire Thursday that had
threatened a colony of historic cabins in the Orange County back
country.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which started late Wednesday afternoon, came close to 50
rustic dwellings in the Holy Jim Canyon and Trabuco Canyon areas of
the Cleveland National Forest before the roaring winds suddenly
declined and the flames died down. Authorities said 25 to 35 people
were evacuated. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   "The flames were uncomfortably close, about 20 to 30 feet away,"
said Beep Colclough, treasurer of the Holy Jim Cabin Owners
Improvement Assn., whose husband Steve is chief of the Holy Jim
Volunteer Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the blaze had burned 100 to 125 acres by Thursday
afternoon and was no longer a threat to the cabins, many of which
were built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Holy Jim Canyon area--named
after a long-ago settler with a fondness for profanity--had not been
touched by fire for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although crews were still hosing down hotspots along creek beds
and charred treetops, U.S. Forest Service officials reported that
most of the fire had been extinguished. By Thursday night it was 80%
contained, they said, and if the winds don't increase today it should
be fully contained late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a difficult fire to fight," said Kathy Bacon of the
U.S. Forest Service. "It's a very rural setting with narrow roads and
steep terrain that is hard for firefighters to work in. The winds
were a real problem Wednesday night, but they have died down since
then."</TE>
<TE>   Among those fighting the blaze are crews from the Orange County
Fire Department, the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the U.S.
Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. They began using five water-dropping helicopters Thursday
morning. No property damage or serious injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, whose cause is under investigation, was reported at 5:37
p.m. Wednesday. Authorities said it appeared to have started at the
far end of Upper Trabuco Creek Road. It burned furiously until the
winds changed early Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The leading edge headed away from the cabins," Bacon said. "But
we are still concerned because the fire is still active."</TE>
<TE>   Holy Jim Canyon and Trabuco Canyon are filled with old dwellings
that have been used as weekend and vacation retreats for more than 70
years. Power comes from generators and propane.</TE>
<TE>   Access is from Trabuco Creek Road, a rutted, dirt course about 5.5
miles long. The surrounding landscape is covered with manzanita,
yuccas, ceonothus, clump grasses and groves of scrub oak and
sycamore--a hazard when dry.</TE>
<TE>   Battalion Chief Dave Wilson, 57, of the Irvine Fire Department was
among the first to reach the mountain blaze Wednesday. He and other
firefighters feared the worst when they saw gusting winds kicking
walls of flame down the ridge directly toward them.</TE>
<TE>   Between the firefighters and the flames were the cabins in Holy
Jim and upper Trabuco canyons. The wind was blowing so hard and the
fire behaving so erratically, Wilson said, that he and the others
were not sure they could stay.</TE>
<TE>   But as they watched, the cold, heavy winds changed course,
knocking down the flames. "If you believe in miracles, this surely
would be one," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   As firefighters entered Holy Jim Canyon late Wednesday, Betty
Somes, a retired graphic artist, was reluctant to leave her cabin,
which she has owned for more than 20 years. After being warned by a
neighbor, she opened her front door and realized how grave the
situation was.</TE>
<TE>   "The sky was all turbulent and rosy red. That scared me. That made
me believe I ought to go," said Somes, who went to Laguna Beach to
stay with friends.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters and canyon residents said the flames were so low by 3
a.m. that many caught snatches of sleep. But at about 7 a.m., just
after sunrise, the winds kicked up again and threatened to revive the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters, however, were able to maneuver into the remote
canyons by daylight and began dumping water. Long, snaking lines of
firefighters fanned out over the scorched ridge and creek beds,
extinguishing smoldering embers.</TE>
<TE>   By midday, Orange County fire investigators were at work,
examining a stone and wood cabin in upper Trabuco Canyon, where some
locals said the fire might have started in a barbecue. Investigators
declined to comment, saying it was too early to say how the fire
started.</TE>
<TE>   At the nearby Joplin Boys Ranch, officials of the county probation
camp remained ready to evacuate 64 youths if the fire started to
spread again. Five 15-passenger vans are on standby to take the
inmates to Juvenile Hall in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   In Trabuco Canyon, residents were not evacuated, but they said the
fire was frightening nevertheless. Many were relieved the blaze did
not start Tuesday night when winds whipped through the area in 50-mph
gusts.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky," said Jim Iacono.</TE>

<HD>Quake Center Given $10 Million for 5-Year Study</HD>
<DH>Research: The facility at USC will focus on the physics of
temblors and hazards specific to the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Science Foundation has awarded $10 million to the
Southern California Earthquake Center, headquartered at USC, for five
years of research to better understand the physics of earthquakes and
specific hazards in the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Although scientists involved said Thursday that they expect new
computer systems developed with the funds will centralize their
knowledge and allow more precise quake simulations, they cautioned
that no prediction of specific quakes is likely by the end of the
study.</LD>
<LD>   Many academic and scientific institutions throughout California
and the United States will participate in the work under the auspices
of the Earthquake Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not about to predict earthquakes," said Bernard Minster, a
UC San Diego geophysicist who is the center's science director. But
"if we can better understand the aspects of the physics, then we
should be able to predict some aspects of the earthquake process for
a short period into the future."</TE>
<TE>   Minster said that despite issuing some general 30-year quake
probabilities in the past, "we still do not have a framework in which
we can put in all the various aspects of the earthquake physics."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a way of putting everything together and ending the
gaps in our understanding," he added.</TE>
<TE>   That, he said, is what the new study is designed to bring about.</TE>
<TE>   With the new computer systems to be developed, scientists all over
the country will be able to summon very quickly all that becomes
known, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Heaton, professor of earthquake engineering at Caltech and a
member of the board of the Earthquake Center, said the overall aim is
to get a better overview of seismic hazards in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "Until now, we've only been able to say that quakes are happening
in some areas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't really focus on the issue of how the system works, why
some quakes are big and others small, whether they are happening
regularly or on a random basis."</TE>
<TE>   How the system works is "a surprisingly rich physics problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   More intricate earthquake models will be constructed with the
National Science Foundation grant, "but will they be stable enough to
tell when something is going to happen?" Heaton questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Ned Field of the Pasadena office of the U.S. Geological Survey
said one of the most important aspects of the study "will be building
the next generation of information technology and building computer
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "So this project is not only an application to a problem but the
further development of the Internet," he said.</TE>

<HD>Greuel Takes Lead in Fund-Raising in Council Race</HD>
<DH>Politics: She wins an endorsement from Councilman LaBonge
and continued support from the entertainment industry in her run
against Tony Cardenas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six weeks before the election, Los Angeles City Council candidate
Wendy Greuel has taken a fund-raising lead over opponent Tony
Cardenas and picked up the endorsement of Councilman Tom LaBonge.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel, an executive at DreamWorks SKG, got a big boost from
entertainment industry donors, who helped her bring in much of the
$58,100 she collected by Jan. 19, the close of the most recent
reporting period.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas, a Democratic assemblyman from Mission Hills, reported he
raised $47,550, although he has a fund-raiser planned next month by
top executives of the Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<TE>   Both candidates have also received $20,000 in matching funds from
the city.</TE>
<TE>   They are competing in the March 5 runoff to fill the 2nd Council
District seat vacated in October by the resignation of Joel Wachs.
Cardenas finished ahead of Greuel in the Dec. 11 primary. The 2nd
District covers much of the eastern San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although a fund-raiser by her employer is planned for February,
Greuel's campaign already received 18 contributions this month from
entertainment industry sources, including DreamWorks partners David
Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, as well as the
latter's wife, actress Kate Capshaw Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, a Van Nuys resident, also received contributions from
political figures, including Los Angeles school board member Marlene
Canter, Community College board member Georgia Mercer, Rep. Lucille
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), former Assemblyman Richard Katz and
former Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters also backed Greuel.
She and Cardenas both received support from a host of developers,
lobbyists, attorneys and city contractors, including the firm
Fleishman-Hillard Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas reported contributions from businessman Alfred Mann, Rep.
Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), and Democratic Assembly members John
Dutra of Fremont, Edward Chavez of La Puente and Joe Canciamilla of
Pittsburg.</TE>
<TE>   He also reported campaign donations from two Native American
tribes that operate casinos: the Pechanga Band of Mission Indians and
the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge is the ninth City Council member to back Greuel's
candidacy in a race that has divided the panel and could influence a
power struggle for the council presidency. Current City Council
President Alex Padilla and three other council members are backing
Cardenas in the race.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, who was recently elected to the 4th District seat, said
he has known Greuel for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we worked together over 20 years ago on [former Mayor] Tom
Bradley's Youth Advisory Council, she has gained a wealth of
experience in public service and private industry to make her a
highly capable and effective member of the Los Angeles City Council,"
LaBonge said.</TE>

<HD>School Board OKs Cuts of $56 Million</HD>
<DH>Budget: Non-classroom areas take the hit. But trustees
delay larger trims until lawmakers reduce state spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to an unusual midyear budget crisis, the Los Angeles
school board voted unanimously Thursday to cut its spending by $56
million, mainly by targeting maintenance and administrative programs.</LD>
<LD>   But the Board of Education delayed a vote on Los Angeles Supt. Roy
Romer's full austerity proposal, which would require an additional
$92 million in cuts that would affect classrooms more directly. In
anticipation of Gov. Gray Davis' proposed state education budget,
district officials directed principals last week to comb their
ledgers for spare funds. Some campuses warned that they would have to
end music classes or ration paper and pencils.</LD>
<LD>   "The board is unwilling to make tough choices until the
Legislature tells us what tough choices we need to make," said Board
of Education President Caprice Young. The board will make a decision
on other reductions within 30 days.</LD>
<TE>   Board members said they were not convinced that state lawmakers
would approve all of the governor's proposed education cuts, which
would remove $74 million from the Los Angeles district's bottom line.
The district is overspending its current budget by $59 million, and
Romer wants additional cuts as a cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Board members Jose Huizar and David Tokofsky said they had heard
from legislators who plan to fight the governor's proposed cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some skepticism," said Huizar, who led his colleagues
in suggesting a wait-and-see stance on Romer's proposal. "I wanted
more information."</TE>
<TE>   Board member Genethia Hayes said Romer's request that principals
find $59 million in savings would harm instruction. She advocated
deeper administrative cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's cuts were $25 million in unspent funds for
utilities, insurance and legal fees, $15 million for district office
supplies, and $7 million for a counseling program that will instead
be funded by Medi-Cal. The board also voted to advise principals to
reduce spending in case bigger cuts are implemented later, but set no
specific numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Times are tough and we need to prepare," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he wanted to be careful to safeguard core
instructional programs and was heartened Thursday by the board's
approval of a landmark $45-million literacy program to emphasize
reading throughout the school curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Principals have complained that Romer's plan to trim per-student
spending by $59 million could cut into vital programs just when many
schools are making gains in test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever their disagreements with the specific cuts in Romer's
plan, most board members said they were pleased that he asked
principals for their suggestions instead of dictating uniform
rollbacks at all campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky said that making school principals examine their budgets
revealed a surprising number of possible trims.</TE>
<TE>   "If schools have enough money dangling around to make up the
district shortfall," Tokofsky said, "it means they aren't managing
their money."</TE>
<TE>   Huizar said Romer's move will make schools more responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, we don't have a history of knowing how much money is
allocated to each school and how much money they are spending,"
Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, the district announced Thursday that it had hired
Thomas C. Boysen, the head of the Milken Family Foundation education
grant program, as chief operating officer of the school system,
responsible for business and facilities management. Boysen, who will
be paid $215,000 a year, is a former state commissioner of education
for Kentucky, and led school districts in Washington, New York and
California, including the San Diego County district.</TE>

<HD>Hahn in Hot Seat in Old 'Hood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I saw the Page One story about Mayor Jim Hahn appointing a small
army of wealthy pals to city commissions, I knew exactly where I had
to go. To L. Tolliver's Barber Shop at Florence and Western.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere in all of Los Angeles did Slim Jim Hahn have more
passionate support during his campaign than at L.T.'s clip shop, a
mile east of where he grew up. The resident elders argued that Hahn's
daddy had been good to the community, and the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.</LD>
<LD>   But sons do not always grow up to be their fathers, and it sure
looks like Jim Hahn has stiffed the very people who helped put him
where he is. Of Hahn's 114 appointments to various commissions so
far, the majority are campaign donors with fancy ZIP Codes, as The
Times' Matea Gold neatly documented.</LD>
<TE>   Would you like to know how many are from South L.A., where Hahn
had practically passed himself off as another brother from the 'hood?</TE>
<TE>   Five (5).</TE>
<TE>   It's true after all. You just can't trust white people.</TE>
<TE>   "The young cat was right," said a boastful Kevin Hooks, a young
pup of just 30 and a regular L.T. customer. Hooks had been beaten
down by the elders last year for suggesting that Hahn ought to be
judged on his own merits, not his father's.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't just pick up the fruit and eat it when it falls from
the tree," gloated customer Tony Wafford, the only one who had sided
with Hooks at the most politically tuned-in barbershop in Los
Angeles. "You squeeze the fruit, you smell it. You make sure it's not
rotten."</TE>
<TE>   "I am appalled by this," confessed proprietor Lawrence Tolliver,
dapper as always, his white beard impeccably manicured. Tolliver and
his partner, Mr. Ford, had voted with pride for Jim Hahn, whose
father--the late county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn--used to wave to them
as he drove by the shop.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's too early to condemn the man," Tolliver added
hopefully. "I still believe I rode the right horse."</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," Mr. Ford said from the red-cushioned comfort of his own
barber chair. Behind him is a sign that says, Cows may come and cows
may go, but the bull in this place goes on forever.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn still has two-thirds of his appointments to fill, so there's
time to prove he's aware that black people exist even in nonelection
years. He told The Times that even his sister, an L.A. city
councilwoman, had asked him to get on the stick.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't step up and support Bernard Parks, that's going to
be another black eye," Tolliver promised, referring to the L.A.
police chief, whose reappointment hangs in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Wafford agreed, but asked a very smart question. Why doesn't Hahn
quit playing games and take a stand on Parks now? Is it lack of will?
General indecision? Long afternoon naps?</TE>
<TE>   "The heat's on Parks now," Wafford said of a poll in which 93% of
the force expressed no confidence in its leader. "Why would Hahn wait
around except to see which way the public might go?"</TE>
<TE>   "Because that's the way politicians are," Tolliver retorted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd try to fend off Parks' attackers before they got to him, not
wait around and check the polls," Wafford snapped. "I thought you
said he had courage like his father."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to talk about his father," said a customer. "We're
here to talk about Kenny Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   He meant Jim, of course, and Wafford delighted in the mistake.
Like Tolliver, Wafford's not ready to write off Jim Hahn over the
snub on commission appointments. But he'd warned his buddies last
year about the risks of voting for a dead man.</TE>
<TE>   "If the mayor had looked ahead, this wouldn't have happened,"
Wafford said. "If he'd had me there, I would have said, 'Hey, Jim.
Where's the brothers?' You wouldn't have had just these white boys."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you one thing," Mr. Ford interjected, drawing the
silence that is due a man with eight decades' worth of wisdom. "You
don't want to appoint some fool to one of these commissions just
'cause he's a Negro. We need someone who's got brains."</TE>
<TE>   "I got a list right here," said Tolliver, who opened a drawer and
produced no fewer than 90 names of community leaders he's come to
know over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I even got a call from Gov. Davis and gave him three or four
names."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Ford suggested that with a little more time, Mayor Hahn will
surely pay heed to his old neighborhood, the one that trusted him
with its votes.</TE>
<TE>   This brought Wafford out of his seat.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was some redneck from the Valley, we'd be blocking his
car, standing in the driveway singing 'We Shall Overcome,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just saying we should be as aggressive with our so-called
friends as we are with our enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have any trouble finding you when he needed the vote,
and now he's hanging around in Santa Monica. You'll probably find him
over at that place; what's it called? Yeah, Shutters."</TE>
<TE>   What the mayor needs, all the gents agreed, is to keep company
with fewer pale-faced yes-men and hangers-on, and start seeking the
guidance of those who aren't in it for the money.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs someone who's beholden to nothing but the truth, and
that's what I've got," said Tolliver, waving his list of 90 good men
Hahn overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   With Slim Jim, there may be even less than meets the eye. But I
think there might be enough goodwill at L. Tolliver's Barber Shop to
save him.</TE>
<TE>   Haircuts are $10, Jim. It'll be the smartest money you've spent in
months.</TE>

<HD>OCC Instructor Returning as Feud Hits New Chapter</HD>
<DH>College: Ken Hearlson, who angered Muslim students, now
fights an administration letter.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a five-week hiatus due to winter break, the classroom drama
that brought national attention to a political science instructor
resumes next week at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Hearlson returns to the campus Monday after being suspended,
then cleared in December of accusations by Muslim students that he
called them "terrorists" and "murderers" during a heated classroom
discussion. His return has reignited the debate over where academic
freedom ends and classroom harassment begins.</LD>
<LD>   An independent investigator concluded after an 11-week inquiry
that "most of the allegations made by the Muslim students ... are
unsubstantiated."</LD>
<TE>   Keeping the dispute alive is a fight over a letter written to
Hearlson on Dec. 11 by college President Margaret Gratton, who
cautioned him against singling out students for their religion or
race.</TE>
<TE>   "Students should not feel that they are required to defend their
religion after you have portrayed it in a negative manner," she wrote
in the letter, which Hearlson made public this week.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was labeled a reprimand by Hearlson, his union and
academic freedom watchdogs. Hearlson said his attorney is trying to
get an injunction to set aside the letter's admonitions, and union
officials are fighting to keep it out of his personnel file.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a prior-restraint issue," he said. "They're stopping
academic speech before it even starts. How can you not discuss
terrorism in a political science class?"</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson and union President Kristina K. Bruning said they fear
that the letter is crafted to curtail the instructor's academic
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   College officials declined to talk in detail about the letter but
said it wasn't a reprimand.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson said he'll continue to teach as he always has, although
he'll tone down both the volume of his voice and the classroom
debates. He said he now wears $8,000 worth of hearing aids, which
have made him aware of how loud his voice is.</TE>
<TE>   But he vowed to keep presenting controversial matter. This
semester he plans to show "Terrorists Among Us," a PBS documentary
alleging links between terrorists and some U.S. Muslim leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson was suspended with pay after the Sept. 18 classroom
debate on Islam and terrorism. During his time off, Hearlson became a
favorite topic for newspaper columnists and talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   Next Friday, Hearlson is scheduled to be on "Now with Bill Moyers"
at 9 p.m. on KCET-Channel 28.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we receive a complaint about this class," said Hussam
Ayloush, executive director of the Southern California chapter of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations, which provided guidance to the
Muslim students. "I hope we can just put this behind us and move
along."</TE>

<HD>Police Kill Armed Man in Stolen Truck</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Officer fired upon suspect who had returned to
the vehicle in an Encino parking lot and displayed a gun, authorities
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police shot and killed an armed man in a stolen pickup
truck at a busy Encino strip mall parking lot, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whom police have not identified, had illegally parked the
pickup truck in a spot reserved for the disabled outside Barnes &amp;
Noble bookstore in the 16500 block of Ventura Boulevard, said Officer
Nadine Hernandez, a Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman. The
truck had been reported stolen and was used in an earlier theft, she
said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jeffrey Douglas Ingalls and his partner, Officer Patrick
Joseph Merrin, were waiting for the man to come out of the bookstore
about 9 p.m. Wednesday. When the officers approached him, he got in
the truck and closed the door. Ingalls shattered the driver-side
window with his nightstick, and as he reached in, he saw the man was
armed, said Sgt. John Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Ingalls fired his gun once, striking the man in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquariello said the officers then took cover behind other
vehicles and waited for backup.</TE>
<TE>   "The truck had tinted windows, and [the officers] could see he was
still moving inside with a gun," Pasquariello said. "Unless we have
good eyes on a suspect, we regard him like he is barricaded in a
house."</TE>
<TE>   Ingalls and Merrin called the department's SWAT team, which
removed the man's body from the truck at 11:55 p.m., Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers involved were not injured, and the department's
robbery-homicide division is investigating the shooting. Both
officers remain on duty, but will not return to street patrol until
they have completed a standard departmental psychiatric evaluation,
Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   Ingalls, a six-year department veteran, received an administrative
disapproval in 1998 after a fellow officer, Erik Cortes,
inadvertently pulled the trigger of Ingalls' semiautomatic pistol.</TE>
<TE>   The two were in the restroom of a Hermosa Beach tavern when
Cortes, while trying to remove Ingalls' gun from its holster, shot
Ingalls in the hand, according to a department memo. A bullet
fragment also struck Ingalls in the neck, the memo stated.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred while the two officers were drinking with
friends and discussing the merits of various weapons, according to
the memo.</TE>

<HD>After the Neighbors Squawk, Cops Give Parrot's Owners a
Good Talking To</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You Think You Have Problems Dept.: The Laguna News-Post reports that
residents called police "because a noisy parrot was bothering them
with continued squawking. Officers responded to the location and
advised the owners of the bird." No word on what the parrot said to
the cops.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly a recycling container: On her morning walk, Peggy
Horngren of Buena Park came upon a strange item among one resident's
trash (see photo). Was it a prank? She's not sure but she checked
later and the, uh, box had disappeared before the trash truck pulled
up.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, some driver could have stopped and loaded it aboard. If
so, I hope it wasn't too heavy.</LD>
<TE>   Typical Angeleno's to-do list? Don't know if you've heard about
the foundmagazine.com Web site, which posts discarded and misplaced
memos, love notes, doodles, kids' homework and other neglected
literature. (No, nothing from Enron on there yet.)</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I'm contributing a note that a reader found several years
ago in an L.A. parking lot (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I never heard from the busy writer of the note.</TE>
<TE>   A little reverse Scrabble: The mention here of the strangely named
Slander restaurant in Whittier brought a note from Teri Wilkinson.</TE>
<TE>   She informed me that it was actually called Slanders, which still
ranks high on the strangeness scale, I think you'll agree.</TE>
<TE>   "We all laughed when the new owners came up with Slanders, not
only because it was such an odd name, but because they were being so
cheap," explained Wilkinson, a resident of Whittier for four decades.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, the name of the previous restaurant in the building was
Islanders, with a huge scripted capital I and the 'slanders' in
smaller script. The new owner simply took off the I on the old sign!
No one was surprised when they closed their doors a few weeks later."</TE>
<TE>   Silence of the hamburgers: Bud Baker phoned to say that my list of
eateries with wacky names should have included a favorite of
Southland surfers: Shut Up Frank's, in the Baja California town of
Todos Santos (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   The story, Baker said, is that it was so dubbed because Frank, the
owner, married a woman whose spoke only three words in English: "Shut
up, Frank."</TE>
<TE>   (Let's not get into the matter of the comma missing after "Up.")</TE>
<TE>   Baker added that "Shut Up Frank" T-shirts and stickers are bigger
sellers than the burgers and beer the place dispenses.</TE>
<TE>   They never checked in here: Todos Santos, by the way, is also the
home of the Hotel California, which once promoted itself as the site
where the Eagles' song of that name was written. The Eagles, who
don't agree on very many things, are in accord that they never
visited the place.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: My second-favorite L.A. newspaper, the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise, carried this police log item:</TE>
<TE>   "A man thought someone had entered his residence, since his dog
was inside and the toilet seat was left up."</TE>

<HD>Hoffman Trouncing Parks in Funding for Supervisor Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Money is pouring into businessman Randy Hoffman's campaign for
Ventura County supervisor six times faster than that of his opponent,
Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks, finance statements released
Thursday show.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman raised $59,750 during a three-week period ending Jan. 19,
compared with $9,800 for Parks. That means the technology
entrepreneur has raised $211,750 in the two months since he announced
his candidacy, nearly triple the $73,900 raised so far by Parks.</LD>
<LD>   Parks and Hoffman are vying to fill an open Thousand Oaks-based
seat in the March 5 primary being vacated by retiring Supervisor
Frank Schillo.</LD>
<TE>   About half of Hoffman's money has come from David H. Murdock, the
billionaire chairman and CEO of Dole Food Co. and developer of the
luxury Lake Sherwood estates in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock kicked in another $25,000 for the most recent filing
period, bringing his total contributions to $91,000. Hoffman's other
backers include the Conejo Valley's GOP establishment and business
elite.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the latest contributions to Hoffman came from
backers with ties to the building industry. Construction companies in
Westlake Village, Santa Paula and Camarillo gave a combined $24,500.
Soils engineering firm Geolabs-Westlake Village contributed $5,000,
and Haaland Group, a Thousand Oaks development consultant, gave
$4,500.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, a slow-growth activist, said Hoffman's money trail belies
the claim that he will work hard to preserve open space and stop the
3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development slated for the county's
southeastern edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as a Madison Avenue sales job," said Parks, 44. "He is a
manufactured candidate. It's really up to the voters if they want
someone who has actually done something or a developer-bought image."</TE>
<TE>   Parks has voluntarily limited her donations to $500 per individual
and has not received any contributions from the development industry.</TE>
<TE>   Most donations to Parks ranged from $150 to $500 and came from
homemakers, lawyers, retirees and professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, 48, said his supporters are backing him not because he
wants to "pave over the Conejo Valley" but because they see him as
more friendly to business.</TE>
<TE>   "I am supported by the business community because Linda Parks
votes nine out of 10 times against business, and local businesses at
that," said Hoffman, who made a fortune building Magellan Systems, a
firm that manufactures hand-held tracking equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman repeated his claim that Parks' campaign will eventually be
aided by independent committees that pour money into mailings and
advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   "My supporters are fully aware of the kind of money that Linda
Parks' supporters spent getting her elected to the City Council,"
Hoffman said. "Almost a quarter-million [dollars] was spent to her
benefit. Both times she has run, she has found ways to finance her
campaign without spending a lot of her own money."</TE>
<TE>   In the county's other supervisors race, contributions have been
more moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels has raised $8,888 since Jan. 1, bringing
her war chest to $75,258. She has spent about $50,000 on research and
campaign advertising for her 4th District, based in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman patron Murdock also continued to bankroll Mikels'
campaign, contributing $2,413 in printing and postage this reporting
period. He is responsible for 36% of the contributions Mikels'
campaign has received and is hosting an invitation-only,
$150-per-plate fund-raising event for her at the Sherwood Country
Club at the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mikels' challenger, John Lane of Moorpark, has criticized
Mikels' ties to Murdock, the incumbent says the corporate executive
is supporting her because he likes her style and her conservative
Republican ideology.</TE>
<TE>   Other Mikels contributors included Tom Barber Golf Centers in
Moorpark ($1,500); Ventura County Sheriff's Correctional Officers'
Assn. ($500); the Channel Islands Village apartment complex in Oxnard
($900); and Sempra Energy Co. in Oxnard ($300).</TE>
<TE>   The most recent contributions to Lane were not available Thursday.
As of Jan. 1, he had raised just under $46,000, most of that a
$30,000 loan to himself.</TE>

<HD>District  Loses Suit  Against  Law Firm</HD>
<DH>Belmont: L.A. Unified alleged malpractice in advice it got
from O'Melveny &amp; Myers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District lost its malpractice suit
Thursday against the prestigious law firm that advised the district
on construction of the Belmont Learning Complex, the $200-million
high school still unfinished because of environmental worries.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge said that some of the district's
allegations of legal malpractice were unfounded and others could not
be proven one way or another. But that doesn't matter, she argued,
because the school district did not show that the advice it was given
by the O'Melveny &amp; Myers firm had caused it financial or other harm
involving the campus, where construction is halted.</LD>
<LD>   Had it won, the school district planned to ask the court to award
it damages of about $100 million.</LD>
<TE>   The incomplete hulk of the school near downtown has been a
prominent symbol of school district failure since work on it was
stopped in December 2000. The district's decision to cease work and
the lawsuit both arose from concerns about potentially lethal
concentrations of explosive methane and other toxic chemicals on the
site, part of which is on a defunct oil field.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Ann Kough's 34-page summary judgment in the
politically sensitive case rejects the claims that law firm failures
led to the project's problems. The ruling says the firm did not err
in regard to its advice on satisfying California's environmental
laws, including its recommendation that a full environmental impact
study was not needed.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, law firm spokesman Ralph J. Shapira said, "We are
gratified by the court's decision to dismiss this case entirely. We
never doubted the merits of our case, and we are pleased that the
court agreed with us in such a dramatic and definitive way."</TE>
<TE>   But school district general counsel Harold Kwalwasser contended
that the law firm's victory was narrower and that an appeal was
possible.</TE>
<TE>   A separate case now before the California Supreme Court also
involves the issue of whether actual damages have to be proven to win
a legal malpractice suit. And a decision in that case may strengthen
the district's suit, Kwalwasser said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Kough's ruling says her decision would have been more
favorable to the school district if she could have relied on the
earlier appellate court ruling in that other case.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, the Los Angeles Unified School District ruling
ends a lawsuit that had mobilized some of the most powerful political
and legal figures in Los Angeles. O'Melveny, founded in 1885, counts
among its senior partners former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and its clients include Gov. Gray Davis and the state of
California.</TE>
<TE>   To protect its white-glove reputation, the law firm hired a
political consulting firm to persuade nervous politicians and a
skeptical public that the 4,000-seat Belmont project should be
completed to help ease overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   The unfinished school became a key factor leading to a major
turnover of school board members in 1999 elections. With financial
backing from then-Mayor Richard Riordan, three new members swept into
office with promises to reform the school district and improve
student achievement.</TE>
<TE>   One of the new board's first decisions was to file the lawsuit
against O'Melveny &amp; Myers. That came after an internal investigation
said the law firm was negligent in its handling of the construction
process.</TE>
<TE>   That audit also criticized the actions of nine school district
employees involved in the Belmont project and urged they be
disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the board voted previously to abandon the project, it
is still alive. The school district has asked for bids on completing
construction of the school and mitigating the environmental problems.
It has received three proposals that it will consider in the coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young said she was disappointed
with the legal ruling but she defended the decision to file the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the former LAUSD staff made some very bad decisions based
on some extraordinarily bad advice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she acknowledged that the Belmont saga has long cast a
shadow over the district, and has distracted attention from
educational issues.</TE>
<TE>   Young recalled, for example, that on the day the lawsuit was filed
in 1999, the school board approved an expensive overhaul of how
elementary schoolchildren are taught to read.</TE>
<TE>   That reading effort won much less attention but has gone on to
bear fruit, with test scores for the district's youngest children on
the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so frustrating because we're trying to reform this place,
and it's like we're trying to swim at the same time the lead weights
of the past are dragging us under," she said.</TE>

<HD>Mother, 2 Daughters Killed; Father Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man is held without bail in slayings at former
girlfriend's Sun Valley home. She had recently left the suspect to
start a new life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 27-year-old long-haul truck driver whose girlfriend recently left
him drove to her new home in Sun Valley on Wednesday night and
fatally stabbed her and their daughters, ages 2 and 6, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Julian Beltran then called 911 from his car and told a dispatcher
that "somebody was hurt" at a house in the 7400 block of Craner
Avenue. When authorities arrived there minutes after the 11:30 p.m.
call, they discovered the bodies of Maria Michelle Barahona, 24;
Marissa Beltran, 6; and Natalie Beltran, 2.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so bad when firefighters got there that they backed out
and told the police something to the effect of, 'You don't want to go
in there,'" said Los Angeles Police Department Officer Jack Richter.</LD>
<TE>   Beltran continued driving to Stanton in Orange County, where he
again called police from his car, telling them where to find him. He
was distraught, authorities said, and told them, "I have a knife and
I am sorry I hurt her."</TE>
<TE>   When Orange County sheriff's deputies approached Beltran at Beach
Boulevard and Katella Avenue about 12:30 a.m., he was standing in
front of his car, bleeding from cuts on both wrists and waving a
knife, police said.</TE>
<TE>   After he ignored repeated orders to drop the knife, deputies fired
four beanbags, said Sheriff's Department spokesman John Fleischmann.
Beltran, who was hit, dropped the knife and surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   He was treated at a hospital for welts from the bean bags and
superficial knife wounds, then turned over to the LAPD, Fleischmann
said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, he was being held without bail at the Van Nuys
jail. He could be arraigned as soon as today on the murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Barahona and Beltran had been together on and off for about eight
years and had moved throughout the state with their daughters,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   He drove a night route between Los Angeles and Kettleman City for
California Overnight, a package delivery company based in Phoenix.
Brian Erickson, the company's southern regional operations manager,
said Beltran had worked there for two years and had been "a great
employee."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, Nancy Barahona, 23, Maria's sister, sat in
the bedroom of her North Hollywood apartment and looked at
photographs of her nieces. She described Maria, 11 months her senior,
as her "unofficial twin."</TE>
<TE>   She said her sister was a student at Grant High School in Van Nuys
when she met Beltran.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a year ago, the couple moved to Palmdale. They
moved again in the fall to Sun Valley, where they rented a home owned
by a co-worker of Barahona's mother. But Beltran moved out in October
or November, Nancy Barahona said, and was staying with his sister in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Barahona told her sister last week that Beltran was acting
oddly.</TE>
<TE>   "He was calling her 15 times a day and really freaked her out,"
Nancy Barahona said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Beltran went to Maria's home and gave her money. He
wanted to restart the relationship, but Barahona said she wanted to
start a new life without him, her sister said.</TE>
<TE>   Barahona had been looking into jobs at hospitals so she could use
her training as a medical secretary, her sister said.</TE>
<TE>   Marissa had started kindergarten last fall at Roscoe Elementary,
where her mother occasionally chaperoned field trips. The child loved
school, insisting on doing her homework before anything else when she
came home each day, Nancy Barahona said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Marissa's family celebrated her sixth birthday. She
was excited by her presents, especially a Britney Spears Barbie Doll,
her aunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Barahona said she had a closet full of presents for Natalie,
who would have turned 3 on Valentine's Day. She described the small
child as shy, and said she called her older sister "Honey."</TE>

<HD>Court to Review Law on False Accusations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court agreed this week to review a lower court
ruling that a state law prohibiting false accusations against police
officers is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   The decision stems from the case of Oxnard residents Barbara
"Sunny" Atkinson and Shaun Stanistreet, who were convicted in 1998 of
falsely accusing a city police officer of exposing himself to a group
of teens at a 1997 party.</LD>
<LD>   A state appellate court overturned those convictions in October,
saying the law on which the two were arrested violates the 1st
Amendment. Ventura County prosecutors believe the statute is valid,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Schwartz.</LD>
<TE>   Atkinson, the former director of an Oxnard anti-gang program, and
Stanistreet also asked the state Supreme Court to find that their
accusations against the officer were true, but that appeal was
denied.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the couple each filed $30-million claims against the
Oxnard Police Department alleging wrongful arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing before the Supreme Court has not yet been set.</TE>

<HD>Dam Foes in Court to Save Trees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics of the Lang Ranch dam in Thousand Oaks are scheduled to
appear before a judge this morning, hoping to stop county officials
from cutting 40 oak trees to make way for the project.</LD>
<LD>   Dam opponents filed a motion for a temporary restraining order
Thursday afternoon in Ventura County Superior Court after flood
control officials received the final permit needed to go forward with
the dam.</LD>
<LD>   Although construction isn't likely to begin until April, the trees
are slated to be cut Monday, before bird nesting season begins.</LD>
<TE>   Nature advocates and dam opponents had urged the county not to cut
any trees until the state Division of Safety of Dams issued its
permit; opponents had hoped to raise enough concerns to block that
permit. Late Wednesday, however, the state informed county flood
control officials that the final permit was being issued.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry Langer, director of Save Lang Oaks Fund, said opponents will
argue that the permitting process did not follow state guidelines and
that concerns that the dam site is vulnerable to a landslide were not
adequately addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're filing for a temporary restraining order to save the trees
and stop the project until this can be aired out in court," Langer
said. "If we lose, we're going to have a farewell funeral party for
the trees. If we get the temporary restraining order, it's not over
by a longshot. But it will show everybody there's merit in what we're
saying."</TE>
<TE>   Flood control officials have said the planned 66 1/2-foot dam is
needed to protect homeowners and habitat downstream in the event of a
100-year storm. In fact, they say the need for the dam was
exacerbated by the Lang Ranch housing development, where Langer and
many other people now fighting the dam live.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very open in this process. You can't be too careful
when you're building a dam that's close to a landslide," said Jeff
Pratt, the county's flood control manager. "If there are holes in our
knowledge we want to know, but we feel we've been duly diligent. I
don't know how adding one more review can help."</TE>
<TE>   Project opponents dispute the county's argument. Some say no dam
is needed or that a smaller dam would suffice. Others say they would
have fewer objections if the dam were placed in an area with no oaks.</TE>

<LD>State budget--A Times editorial Jan. 14  incorrectly said it would
cost the state more than $4 billion to borrow $2.4 billion over a
20-year period. Gov. Gray Davis' budget called the $4-billion figure
"debt service," which often is defined as interest on a loan. In this
case, Finance Department officials said it referred to both interest
and principal.</LD>

<HD>Police Arrest Suspect in 11 Southland Bank Robberies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man suspected of 11 bank robberies from Santa Barbara to San
Clemente has been arrested in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Agents responding to a witness' tip from a bank robbery in San
Clemente this month arrested Richard John Geise, 52, of Ventura on
Wednesday evening at a hotel near downtown.</LD>
<LD>   In an unrelated case, Geise's son Richard, 32, of Ojai will be
tried April 2 on charges of murdering a grocery clerk last year at
Central Market in Ventura, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephanie Arthur.</LD>
<TE>   The son's alleged accomplice in the April 6, 2001, shooting,
Alfonso Acosta Delgado, was shot and killed by a Ventura special
tactics officer during an early-morning standoff a month later.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Geise was booked on charges relating to the San Clemente
bank robbery and is expected to be charged with 10 others in Ventura
and Santa Barbara counties, FBI Special Agent Brent Robbins said. One
occurred Tuesday at a Bank of America in downtown Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins said the FBI has been looking for the robber since last
summer. The investigation intensified last fall when six banks in
Oxnard and Ventura were robbed within 11 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The robberies usually occurred between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. The
robber, whom investigators called the "Both Hands Bandit," typically
handed tellers a note with both hands.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he good-naturedly told a teller at Goleta National Bank in
Ventura, which had been robbed three days before, that he was back.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Bank of America robber brought a partner with him
who is still at large, Robbins said.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur said the son, Richard Jr., was a suspect in a robbery last
March at the same Bank of America in Ventura that was hit Tuesday,
but there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Delgado also was a
suspect in that robbery at the time of his death, Robbins said.</TE>

<HD>Pacifist 'People in Black' Deliver Silent Message Against
Violence</HD>
<DH>Opinion: Ojai group, modeled on Israel's Women in Black,
gathers for weekly vigils to protest terrorism and the U.S. war
against it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They gather at dusk in downtown Ojai, carrying candles and standing
in silence. Cars pass, people stare and someone shouts, "Get a life!"
but nobody flinches.</LD>
<LD>   It's been like this every Friday since the United States began
bombing Afghanistan--when a group of pacifists calling themselves
People in Black launched its silent vigil for peace.</LD>
<LD>   They aren't interested in discussing the merits of war or the
causes of terrorism. When someone approaches, they silently hand over
a slim flier explaining their motives: that they mourn for victims of
violence anywhere and stand in silent contemplation of peace
everywhere.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people felt powerless after Sept. 11 to express
nonviolent views," said Carol Wade, 48, of Ojai, one of the 15 to 30
regulars. "It's interesting to watch people as they drive by. You see
people with thoughtful expressions on their face. If we get them
thinking, then we've accomplished something."</TE>
<TE>   People in Black is patterned after Women in Black, which began in
Israel in 1988 and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize last year.
That organization held silent vigils against the Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Similar organizations formed in places such as Yugoslavia, Britain
and Argentina to protest war, rape as a tool of war, ethnic cleansing
and human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   In Ojai, the idea came to 51-year-old Annat Provo while she was
having dinner with friends. As pacifists, they condemned both the
terrorist attacks and the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan, and were
looking for a quiet way to register dissent without provoking
arguments or endless debate.</TE>
<TE>   Provo, originally from Israel, suggested adopting the Women in
Black model but expanding it to include men.</TE>
<TE>   "The visual of women dressed in black and not speaking was very
powerful," she said. "We don't carry placards; we don't try to engage
people in arguments. People who come say they like the chance to be
quiet and to think about this."</TE>
<TE>   Karen McAuley said she comes every Friday to "be a witness."</TE>
<TE>   "We need to publicly grieve for victims of violence," said the
57-year-old Ojai woman. "It's important to be there in public saying
that you care."</TE>
<TE>   About 16 people, mostly women, stood in front of Libbey Park
facing busy Ojai Avenue last Friday. Cars crept past. Some honked
support. One man shouted, "Bush! Bush! Bush!" Another screamed, "Hey,
what are you staring at?"</TE>
<TE>   No one spoke until the vigil broke up 45 minutes after it began.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably an individual reason why everyone is here," said
Carol Grier, 51, of Ojai. "It's more of a personal statement, saying,
'I want to stand up and be counted.' Since Sept. 11, there has been a
fear in the liberal community to speak out. War is not the answer. We
won't get anywhere blowing off the legs of little kids."</TE>

<HD>Suit Assails Conditions at Youth Prisons</HD>
<DH>Corrections: Alleging 'deplorable' practices, litigants say
goal of rehabilitation has been usurped by punishment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Juvenile convicts are routinely Maced and assaulted by guards, live
in constant fear of being raped and are sometimes locked in solitary
confinement 23 hours a day for months on end, according to a lawsuit
alleging that conditions within the California Youth Authority are
unconstitutionally inhumane.</LD>
<LD>   The class-action suit, filed Thursday in federal court in
Sacramento, paints a horrifying picture of life inside the CYA, which
was once a national model for its rehabilitation of wayward youth.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing on the stories of 11 inmates, the lawsuit claims that many
of California's youngest offenders are forcibly injected with
mind-altering drugs, denied psychiatric care, housed in units where
they are vulnerable to sexual assaults and sometimes schooled while
locked in metal cages.</LD>
<TE>   "The list of deplorable conditions truly goes on and on," said
attorney Richard Ulmer Jr., whose firm, Latham &amp; Watkins, is
assisting with the suit. "The California Youth Authority as it exists
today should be an embarrassment for all Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Ulmer and other lawyers on the case stressed that there are many
good people doing good work in the CYA, the agency responsible for
the state's toughest young offenders. But they believe that the
system's statutory goal--rehabilitation--has been displaced by a
culture of punishment and, in some cases, brutality.</TE>
<TE>   The Youth Authority's director, Jerry Harper, was not available to
comment. But his spokesman--while declining to respond to specific
allegations--said most of the charges were a "rehash" of old problems
that the agency already is working to fix.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman George Kostyrko also said each allegation of abuse is
promptly investigated, and he strongly disputed the charge that the
agency has abandoned its goal of rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "We take the mission of the Youth Authority extremely seriously,"
Kostyrko said, "and that mission is treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Agency Long Touted Its Compassion</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1941, the Youth Authority houses 6,300 inmates in 11
institutions and four camps. The average age is 19, the average stay
29 months. This year's budget is about $437 million.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was created after activists decried the inhumanity of
placing teenagers alongside hardened criminals in California's adult
lockups. For years the agency prided itself on a paternalistic,
compassionate approach to rerouting delinquent kids back toward a
future as productive citizens.</TE>
<TE>   But over the past decade or so, the authority has become the
destination of last resort for some of the state's most violent young
offenders, including murderers, rapists and carjackers. At the same
time, politicians have favored punishment over rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the authority's methods have come under fire from
numerous sources, including the Legislature and the state inspector
general. But the Davis administration, critics say, has failed to
respond in a meaningful way.</TE>
<TE>   The suit caps a yearlong inquiry that included interviews with
more than 100 wards. It was filed by 11 named plaintiffs but on
behalf of all of those incarcerated by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Stevens, 18, says that he was sexually assaulted at two CYA
facilities--and that his efforts to get guards' help were spurned.</TE>
<TE>   After he was raped by two wards at Preston Youth Correctional
Facility east of Sacramento, Stevens says, he told his counselor and
filed an emergency grievance--even though the assailants had warned
him not to tell. Instead of protecting him, a staff member told other
wards about the rapes, the lawsuit says. One of the rapists beat him
up a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff Edward Jermaine Brown, 17, was allegedly forced to live
in a small, filthy solitary confinement cell in the "dungeon-like"
basement of an old Preston building, the lawsuit says. The toilet
often did not work for days, and Brown frequently refused to eat his
"blender meals--an indiscriminate mush that was made by mixing his
daily food ration all together in a blender."</TE>
<TE>   During the one hour per day that Brown was removed from the cell,
he was placed outside in a "cage, where he was unable to perform any
meaningful exercise." Brown was kept in solitary confinement for
seven months, apparently for scuffling with a guard.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also alleges substandard medical care, citing the case
of ward Randy Jones, 24. After a fight caused a rupture in his eye, a
doctor at the CYA's Chaderjian facility in Stockton treated the
injury and left a temporary plastic tube beneath the eyelid.</TE>
<TE>   The tube was supposed to be removed after two months, but Jones
was transferred to another facility. There, four attempts by state
doctors and outside practitioners failed to remove the tube, which
was causing continual discomfort, the suit says. It was not until one
year later, when Jones was sent back to Chaderjian, that his original
doctor finally took out the tube.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the Youth Authority is supposed to be doing these boys
good, said his mother, Carlene Jones. But they injure them; they
abuse these young men. There is no help at all."</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges violations of the 1st and 14th amendments, the
Americans With Disabilities Act and the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act. It seeks a court order directing state
officials to make prompt efforts to fix the substandard conditions.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men were fatally shot Wednesday evening in a parked car outside a
Compton restaurant shortly after finishing dinner, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies found the bodies near the Tacos El Sinaloense
restaurant at 6:15 p.m. By Thursday afternoon, investigators had
identified one victim, but did not release the 36-year-old's name.
The other man may be between 55 and 60 years old, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Det. Patrick Tapia.</LD>
<LD>   Josefina Salas, the owner of the restaurant in the 4800 block of
East Rosecrans Avenue, said the two men ate tacos and talked for an
hour at an outdoor table. A few minutes after the men left the table,
customers heard gunshots.</LD>
<TE>   "When we went to look outside, we saw one man inside the car,
dying," said Salas, 55, who has run the restaurant for 20 years. "The
other man was laying next to the car with blood everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Both men had several gunshot wounds in the upper body, Tapia said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Saldano, who lives near the restaurant, said he heard
between nine and 12 gunshots. The men later died at hospitals, said
sheriff's Deputy William Spear.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had no motive for the shooting.</TE>

<HD>Jones Says Enron Gifts Taint Foes</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Gov. Davis and Richard Riordan received
donations. The secretary of state says the money presents an ethical
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to tie his campaign for governor to national outrage over the
collapse of the energy trading company Enron, Secretary of State Bill
Jones sharply criticized Gov. Gray Davis and former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan on Thursday for accepting campaign contributions from
the politically active firm.</LD>
<LD>   "When it comes to ethics in government, you are either part of the
problem or part of the solution," said Jones, who with Riordan and
businessman Bill Simon Jr. is seeking the GOP nomination for
governor. The winner of the March 5 Republican primary will face
Davis in November.</LD>
<LD>   Jones noted that Davis has received $117,000 from the troubled
energy company and its employees since 1998, and Riordan got $500
from an Enron subsidiary during his mayoral reelection campaign in
1996.</LD>
<TE>   The governor has not directly said whether he would return the
money, but he said he adopted a policy last year not to accept money
from independent power companies, including Enron.</TE>
<TE>   During a Republican debate Tuesday, Riordan said he had not
received money from Enron. But his campaign corrected him Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said Thursday that the former mayor plans to return
the money.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Dick either didn't know or didn't correctly state his
record in accepting contributions from Enron," said Jones, speaking
to members of the United Agribusiness League in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick has said repeatedly he will hire the best and brightest and
empower them to do the job. . . . I guess that's what happens when
you leave all the details to others."</TE>
<TE>   Jones also announced Thursday that Los Angeles County Supervisor
Don Knabe, a Republican, was supporting him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is of great significance to me that an individual so closely
involved in the governing of the metropolitan Los Angeles area--in
fact, who has governed side by side with one of my opponents, the
former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan--has chosen to endorse
my campaign," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe, who joined Jones at a news conference on the steps of the
county Hall of Administration, said he supports Jones because of his
20 years of experience in state government.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, meanwhile, ignored his opponent's swipes.</TE>
<TE>   He spent Thursday making campaign stops along the Central Coast,
where he touted his plan for reforming California's schools.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, the third candidate, Simon, held a brief news
conference on the steps of the state Capitol to announce his
endorsement by state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   But even Haynes' backing came with a reminder of the untested
nature of Simon, who is making his first run for office. Haynes said
he held off endorsing Simon because, "I was worried, quite frankly,
about where he was going to go with the campaign. . . . When you get
the new guy on the block, will he be able to make the commitment,
especially the guy who's got to write the check?"</TE>
<TE>   Haynes said his concerns were eased by Simon's performance in the
debate and while campaigning. "I've been impressed by how far he's
come," Haynes said. "I've been impressed by Bill's willingness to
talk about his conservative agenda for California.</TE>
<TE>   "When we've been faced with Republicans who think the way to win
an election is to articulate a Democratic message," Haynes continued
in a swipe at Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spoke briefly, saying Haynes is "a real, true conservative."</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 8  Years in Drug  Smuggling Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A member of a Southern California smuggling ring that bribed a
Customs Service inspector to get cocaine and marijuana across the
U.S.-Mexico border was sentenced Thursday to eight years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Hart, 30, had pleaded guilty earlier to one count of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   Hart was part of a ring based in the Imperial Valley that relied
on assistance from Customs inspector Ernest Michael Zabala to get
drugs into the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Zabala, who is Hart's cousin, would allow trunkloads of cocaine
and marijuana to pass through his inspection lane at the Calexico
Port of Entry, about 100 miles east of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The two were arrested last summer with another defendant, Sal
Carrillo of El Centro, who is awaiting trial. The smuggling took
place in 1996 and 1997, said Tim Coughlin, an assistant U.S.
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "It took some time to build the case," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Zabala has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and
faces a maximum sentence of 10 years to life in prison when he is
sentenced later this year.</TE>

<HD>Victim's Family Seeks Hit-Run Driver</HD>
<DH>Crime: A $25,000 reward is offered in the case of a young
man struck in Big Bear. 'Life just can't be snuffed out with no
accountability,' his father says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Determined to catch the unidentified driver who ran down their son
outside a Big Bear Lake restaurant, a Chino Hills family is offering
a $25,000 reward, hoping that the cash and publicity will help
uncover the person responsible for the 19-year-old's death.</LD>
<LD>   With few clues to follow, deputies investigating the Dec. 17
hit-and-run death of Richard Peck are at a standstill. But the
victim's father, Jim Peck, an information technology employee in
Irvine, is leading a campaign in the small San Bernardino Mountains
resort community, convinced that perseverance will lead authorities
to an arrest.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think there's a soul in Big Bear who doesn't know
Richard's story," said Jim Peck, "how some stranger hit him, dragged
his body 15 feet.... I just don't want to get up at the end of the
day and say I didn't do everything I could do to find that person."</LD>
<TE>   So Peck, his wife, Brenda, and their five children, ages 8 to 26,
have been tirelessly walking the streets of Big Bear and nearby
Running Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The Peck family has handed out more than 1,000 fliers announcing
the $25,000 reward for information leading to the driver who ran down
Peck outside a Denny's restaurant and then sped away. Just about
every grocery store, gas station and mom-and-pop restaurant in the
area has the flier in its window, with a grinning photo of the
victim.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Department, said the family's efforts have touched
investigators, who know what it's like to hit a wall in a case.</TE>
<TE>   "We go through this all the time, where leads just aren't enough
and the case just cannot be solved," she said. "We know what it's
like to want so bad to solve a case."</TE>
<TE>   Peck was struck about 9:45 p.m. The dark-colored sedan traveling
west didn't stop, dragging him for several feet before speeding from
the scene. Witnesses said the collision left the car with damage on
its left side.</TE>
<TE>   Although four families were dining at the restaurant, and a
passenger in another car on the road saw the accident, investigators
gathered little information about the car that hit Peck.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to the Big Bear area last year. To support himself, he
worked at a local drugstore, where he was hoping to begin a
management training course after he turned 20 on Feb. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying motivation here for me is that no parent wants to
outlive a child," Peck said. "And there's a higher sense of justice
between people. Life just can't be snuffed out with no
accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information can call the Sheriff's Department at (909)
866-7581. Calls can be made anonymously.</TE>

<HD>Jury Selection Begins in Mauling Death</HD>
<DH>Court: A pool of 280 potential jurors is asked about
attitudes toward dogs. A couple are standing trial in the San
Francisco case, which was moved to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jury selection began Thursday in the trial of a San Francisco couple
charged in connection with the death of a woman who was fatally
mauled by their two dogs.</LD>
<LD>   Potential jurors filled out questionnaires that asked about their
feelings about dogs, whether they had ever been snapped at or bitten
by dogs, and whether they ever had a dog that needed a muzzle.</LD>
<LD>   A judge screened 280 possible jurors in search of a panel for the
four- to five-week trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court, where
the trial was moved because of publicity in the Bay Area. More
prospective jurors are expected in court today.</LD>
<TE>   The trial was moved when Judge James Warren ruled that the
defendants--Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel--would have a better
chance of finding an unbiased jury in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   One prospective juror Thursday demonstrated that may be a
difficult task. She said she valued human life over animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone has to account for the death," she said. "The dog can't
testify."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, and Noel, 60, are charged with involuntary
manslaughter and keeping a vicious dog. Knoller also faces
second-degree murder charges in the death of college lacrosse coach
Diane Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple was attacked on Jan. 26, 2001, by two Presa Canario
fighting dogs as she scrambled to unlock her apartment door.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Knoller could face 15 years to life in state prison.
Noel could receive four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel were allegedly keeping the dogs, Bane and Hera,
for state prison inmates who authorities say are members of a white
supremacist gang and were running an illegal attack-dog breeding
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Opening statements in the trial are expected to start Feb. 19.</TE>

<HD>Motorist, 23, Gets Life Term in Fatal Crash</HD>
<DH>Courts: Chatsworth man is sentenced for killing a
77-year-old Holocaust survivor while fleeing police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-year-old former drug addict was sentenced to life in prison
Thursday for killing a 77-year-old Holocaust survivor when he crashed
into her car during a televised high-speed police chase.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing an emotional appeal from the victim's husband, the
judge ordered a smirking James Arthur McMann to prison for life
without parole.</LD>
<LD>   "There were so many opportunities [for McMann] to make other
decisions," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Warren G. Greene
said. "He consistently made bad decision after bad decision after bad
decision."</LD>
<TE>   Last month, a San Fernando jury found McMann, of Chatsworth,
guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Charlotte Lenga during
the commission of a robbery, burglary and carjacking.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's husband, David Lenga, urged Greene to sentence McMann
to the maximum penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "He deprived my children and my grandchildren of their beloved
mother and beloved grandmother," he said in court. "Her grievous
murder left such an incredible void in our family's life."</TE>
<TE>   McMann did not speak, but wrote a letter to the Lenga family in
which he apologized and described himself as "a young man who
happened to make a very bad decision."</TE>
<TE>   McMann was arrested Dec. 15, 2000, after leading police
helicopters and patrol cars on an hourlong chase that ended with
Lenga's death in Encino. McMann's sport utility vehicle broadsided
Lenga's car on White Oak Avenue near Miranda Street.</TE>
<TE>   Lenga died at the scene. The collision was broadcast live on
television.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, trying to evade police, McMann crashed a car into a
ground-floor apartment in Panorama City, said Deputy Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. John F. Nantroup Jr.</TE>
<TE>   McMann then forced his way into another apartment and stole a
change of clothes and the sport utility vehicle from a woman and her
two young children, Nantroup said. McMann drove that vehicle through
the garage door and into a patrol car parked at the end of the
driveway to block his escape.</TE>
<TE>   "He smirked at the officers" as he pushed their car out of the way
and continued to lead them on a chase at speeds of up to 95 mph, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing here that shows any regard for other human
beings," Nantroup said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Lisa-Marie Krause asked the judge to reduce
McMann's mandatory life sentence to 25 years to life in prison. That
request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Krause argued that sentencing the young man to life in prison was
"cruel and unusual punishment" and violated the state and federal
constitutions because it is disproportionate to the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the crimes involved in this case were premeditated," she
said. "They were impulsive."</TE>
<TE>   In his one-page letter, McMann stated that he was a drug addict
with "clouded" judgment at the time and "never had any intentions to
hurt anybody let alone take someone's life."</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I am thinking clearly, I replay that tragic moment in my
mind, wishing I could have done something to have changed the outcome
of this terrible accident," McMann wrote. "I am no animal. I'm just a
young man who happened to make a very bad decision."</TE>
<TE>   He said he feels remorse and sympathy for the Lenga family.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, the victim's eldest daughter, Helene Lenga
Kohen, recalled her mother's strength and generosity.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Lenga survived concentration camps at Auschwitz and
Bergen-Belsen. In the year before her death, she was one of seven
Holocaust survivors to sue Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and
several German companies for compensation for the slave labor they
allegedly provided to those firms while imprisoned.</TE>
<TE>   Lenga lost her parents and a sister in the concentration camps,
her daughter said, but insisted on returning to Europe eight years
ago to visit the sites where her family members perished.</TE>
<TE>   From her experience in the camps, Kohen said her mother learned
the value of family and always put her husband, three daughters and
seven grandchildren first.</TE>
<TE>   "The sudden way she left us left a hole in our hearts forever,"
Kohen said.</TE>

<HD>Instructor Returning as Feud Continues</HD>
<DH>Education: The junior college teacher was suspended after
Muslim students said he insulted them. An inquiry largely backed him,
but now he's fighting over a letter.</DH>

<LD>After a five-week hiatus due to winter break, the classroom drama
that brought national attention to a political science instructor
resumes next week at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Hearlson returns to the campus Monday after being suspended,
then cleared in December of accusations by Muslim students that he
called them "terrorists" and "murderers" during a heated classroom
discussion. His return has reignited the debate over where academic
freedom ends and classroom harassment begins.</LD>
<LD>   An independent investigator concluded after an 11-week inquiry
that "most of the allegations made by the Muslim students ... are
unsubstantiated."</LD>
<TE>   Keeping the dispute alive is a fight over a letter written to
Hearlson on Dec. 11 by college President Margaret Gratton, who
cautioned him against singling out students for their religion or
race.</TE>
<TE>   "Students should not feel that they are required to defend their
religion after you have portrayed it in a negative manner," she wrote
in the letter, which Hearlson made public this week.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was labeled a reprimand by Hearlson, his union and
academic freedom watchdogs. Hearlson said his attorney is trying to
get an injunction to set aside the letter's admonitions, and union
officials are fighting to keep it out of his personnel file.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a prior restraint issue," he said. "They're stopping
academic speech before it even starts. How can you not discuss
terrorism in a political science class?"</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson said he'll continue to teach as he always has, though
he'll tone down both the volume of his voice and the classroom
debates. He said he now wears $8,000 worth of hearing aids, which
have made him aware of his loud voice.</TE>
<TE>   But he vowed to keep presenting controversial matter. This
semester he plans to show "Terrorists Among Us," a PBS documentary
alleging links between terrorists and some U.S. Muslim leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Next Friday, Hearlson is scheduled to be on "Now with Bill Moyers"
at 9 p.m. on KCET-Channel 28.</TE>

<HD>TV Evangelist Drops Oil Refinery Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television evangelist and businessman Pat Robertson has abandoned
plans to reopen an oil refinery on a 100-acre site in Santa Fe
Springs, deciding instead to develop a business park, the city
manager said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, who owns CENCO Refining, had planned to reopen the
former Powerine refinery, which closed in 1995. Environmental groups
had opposed the plan, and city officials have been working with CENCO
for several months to explore alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   City Manager Fred Latham said those discussions led CENCO to
abandon its plans.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead, CENCO will work with the city and the development
community to do a mixed-use business park development in three
phases," Latham said.</TE>
<TE>   The development will be similar to a conversion of a refinery
owned by Thrifty Oil. The 255-acre site is in the process of being
turned into a business park, Latham said.</TE>
<TE>   Communities for a Better Environment, an activist group that has
been fighting the refinery in court, said it was pleased by the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have stood up to Pat Robertson and to the city and
said no to a refinery near our schools and seniors," group spokesman
Jesus Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's family trust purchased the Powerine refinery in 1998
using money from the sale of some of the Robertson family
broadcasting interests.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson pledged that the refinery would be "the most
environmentally friendly refinery in the entire United States."</TE>
<TE>   When the refinery was operating five years ago, residents in Santa
Fe Springs, which straddles the Santa Ana Freeway 20 miles southeast
of Los Angeles, complained about its effect on their skin and lungs.
Michele Davis, a mother of four, said last year that her daughter and
husband suffered from severe facial rashes. Other neighbors said
black oil spots used to spoil the finish of their cars.</TE>
<TE>   The plant drew heavy fines from air quality agencies and
complaints from neighbors before it was shut down in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's decision also brings to an end a story from last
year's California power crisis. Robertson tried to build a power
plant to supply cheaper electricity for the refinery under Gov. Gray
Davis' emergency power orders that permitted construction.</TE>
<TE>   The natural gas-powered plant was meant to provide power during
hours of peak demand.</TE>

<LD>Sheik Mohammed bin Ibrahim bin Jubeir, 76, the head of the Shura
Council--Saudi Arabia's equivalent of a parliament--died Thursday,
the Royal Court announced. Bin Jubeir served as a judge in Mecca,
home to one of Islam's holiest shrines, and as minister of justice.
He also headed a department for citizens to file complaints against
the government.</LD>
<LD>   The pinnacle of his career was being named head of the Shura
Council when it was established in 1992. The council is a wholly
appointed body of 120 members that advises the king.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with The Times earlier this month, Bin Jubeir
suggested that Saudi Arabia had been unfairly criticized after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   He suggested that the United States has done little to offer
substantive proof that any of the hijackers involved in the attacks
were actually from Saudi Arabia.</TE>

<HD>Paul Carpenter, 73; Former Legislator Went to Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Bruce Carpenter, the former state legislator from Orange County
who championed progressive legislation on a variety of fronts but
ultimately served a prison term for political corruption, has died.
He was 73. Carpenter died of cancer Thursday at his home in San
Antonio, where he had lived since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   During his two years in the Assembly (1974-76), 10 in the state
Senate (1976-86) and four years on the State Board of Equalization,
(1986-90) Carpenter, a Democrat from Cypress, became an advocate for
property tax relief years before California voters passed Proposition
13 in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   He wrote legislation establishing a state Superfund to clean up
toxic wastes and was among the first to advocate toll roads to
relieve traffic congestion in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   "Paul was a different kind of politician," said Conway Collis, who
served with him on the Board of Equalization from 1986 to 1990. "He
played politics the way many people play poker."</TE>
<TE>   Known as a risk-taker personally as well as professionally,
Carpenter invested in repossessed property, new technology and
racehorses, and enjoyed climbing mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But his maverick behavior led to trouble in 1986 when, during his
successful campaign for the Board of Equalization, he became a target
of an FBI sting in which federal agents surreptitiously contributed
money to lawmakers in exchange for legislative favors.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted in 1990 of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy for
accepting $20,000 from a fictitious shrimp fishery, Carpenter got off
on a technicality when a federal appeals court ruled that the jury
had not been properly instructed. But he was forced to leave public
office.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case three years later, a jury convicted him on 11
counts of obstruction of justice and money laundering. The
well-publicized trial featured one of his closest legislative
colleagues, former state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), as the
prosecution's star witness.</TE>
<TE>   "I was arrogant," Carpenter admitted to a Times reporter in 1993
during the trial, in which he was accused of illegally funneling
$78,000 to Robbins through a Santa Monica public relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before he was to be sentenced, Carpenter fled to Costa
Rica, saying he was seeking "a more adventuristic" treatment for the
prostate cancer that doctors had predicted would kill him within two
years. He wrote in a note to the judge: "I find my drive for survival
stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system."</TE>
<TE>   His drive for survival didn't keep him and a friend from
entering--and winning--a national bridge tournament in the Central
American nation.</TE>
<TE>   Tracked down less than a year later by U.S. officials, Carpenter
spent several months in a Costa Rican jail before being returned to
California for sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   With his cancer in remission, Carpenter was sentenced in 1995 to
seven years in federal prison. After his release from prison in 1999,
Carpenter settled in seclusion in San Antonio with Doris Morrow, a
former Senate aide who became his companion after his legal
separation from his wife, Janeth, in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   When Carpenter's daughter Jana Carpenter-Koklich, 41, disappeared
from her Lakewood home last August, her father came forward briefly
to discuss the case with the news media.</TE>
<TE>   "If they come back alive, it usually happens in the first 24
hours," he said. "I'm pretty discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter-Koklich has not yet been found but her disappearance was
not thought to be linked to her father's legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some former colleagues remember Carpenter for his antics in
Sacramento. Faced with a lobbyist seeking his vote, the senator might
stare at a computer screen, then announce that the person's client
had given more money to his opponent. In fact, the screen was blank,
but the bluff persuaded more than one lobbyist to sweeten Carpenter's
campaign coffers. He also made a habit of staring intently into the
eyes of a person speaking to him, then responding in a slow,
mechanical voice, former colleagues recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, fellow Democrat Otto Lacayo, whom Carpenter had
defeated for the Assembly nomination in 1974, said of his rival:</TE>
<TE>   "Paul is very intelligent and very well spoken. But he has kind of
a stone-faced look and a dry sense of humor. If you use that against
your enemy, it's a look that can kill."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on Feb. 24, 1928. He did
undergraduate work at the University of Iowa and earned a doctorate
in experimental psychology from Florida State University.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Orange County in 1960, and while working as a
psychologist he became involved in Democratic politics. He made two
unsuccessful bids for public office, running for Congress in 1964
and, two years later, for the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974 he finally won an Assembly seat and, building a power base
in Sacramento, was elected to the state Senate in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Morrow and his missing daughter, Carpenter is survived by
another daughter--Julie Stevenson, of Palm Springs--and two
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the heels of an autumn that saw unprecedented numbers of pelicans
injured off the wharf, the City Council, on a 7-0 vote, moved toward
letting the city close the pier to fishing when needed to protect the
birds.</LD>
<LD>   But the plan, which got preliminary approval, stresses education
and includes trained volunteers, who would walk the pier to inform
fishermen about how their gear and trash can harm the state and
federally endangered birds.</LD>

<LD>Bay Area Rapid Transit officials are confronting a $32-million
deficit for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in June,
officials said. To meet the challenge, BART is moving toward running
shorter trains, delaying some projects and perhaps even laying people
off.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, ridership was at an all-time high. But it is now down
7%, and fare revenues are down 6%.</LD>
<LD>   Even worse, revenue from a half-cent sales tax is down 9%.</LD>

<LD>The City Council voted unanimously this week to ban bow hunting
within city limits by amending a 1983 law that makes discharging a
firearm illegal. The amendment adds bows and arrows to the law, along
with other "dangerous weapons," including air rifles, crossbows and
any other instruments that project objects more than 50 feet.</LD>
<LD>   The law, expected to take effect 30 days after another reading and
a final council vote next month, exempts backyard target archery,
provided that residents obtain police permits.</LD>

<LD>California sued Squaw Valley USA, alleging that the ski resort that
hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics is harming the water quality in a
sensitive Sierra Nevada area.</LD>
<LD>   The suit accuses the resort of violating federal, state and local
environmental protection laws for years by eroding the mountainside
and hurting the water quality of Squaw Creek and its tributaries. The
streams flow into the Truckee River, which has a sedimentation
problem.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that Squaw Valley built ski lifts, ski trails, a
gondola, drainage culverts and parking lots without obtaining proper
permits, or violated those permits by allowing excessive erosion and
runoff.</LD>

<HD>Slave-Labor Lawsuit Dealt Setback</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court has dealt a procedural setback to a Koreatown
resident's slave-labor lawsuit against Japanese companies.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel's unanimous order, issued Wednesday but made
public Thursday, involves 79-year-old Jae-Won Jeong's use of a 1999
state law permitting wartime forced-labor victims to seek redress in
California courts.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Superior Court Judge Peter D. Lichtman permitted the
case to proceed, rebuffing the federal government's claim that the
state law is unconstitutional. Lawyers for Onoda Cement Manufacturing
Co. and its successor entities and affiliates in the United States
sought appeals-court review.</LD>
<TE>   The appeals panel's two-page order, signed by Presiding Justice
Candace Cooper and Associate Justices Laurence D. Rubin and Paul
Boland, halted all proceedings before Lichtman and set an April 30
hearing before the appeals panel.</TE>
<TE>   Jeong was studying economics at a Tokyo university in 1943, when
he was taken to a slave camp for refusing to be drafted into the
Japanese army.</TE>
<TE>   Jeong said he was not obligated to serve in the Japanese military
because he was a Korean national. But his refusal earned him hard
labor, breaking limestone by hand at a quarry for Onoda Cement
Manufacturing Co., in the northeastern tip of the Korean peninsula.
Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 until 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Jeong, a retired teacher who is now a U.S. citizen, expressed
disappointment, saying it is the nature of Japan's government and
companies "to deny they're wrong, then, when they can't deny anymore,
seek delay after delay."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Japanese companies had no comment on the latest
procedural victory for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Jeong sued the company and its successor entities under
the state law that says wartime European and Asian forced-labor
victims can bring cases in California until 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike European Holocaust cases, the complaints against Japanese
companies that used slave labor throughout Asia before and during
World War II, have met with U.S. government opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Jeong wants compensation for his labor and injuries, an apology
and a trust to benefit former forced laborers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ron Taylor, an actor-singer who co-created and starred in the
Tony-nominated musical revue "It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues" on
Broadway, has died. He was 49.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor died Jan. 16 of an apparent heart attack at his home in Los
Angeles. He had suffered a mild stroke in 1999 during the run of "It
Ain't Nothin' but the Blues" at Lincoln Center in New York City but
was back on stage five weeks later.</LD>
<LD>   Described by one critic as a big man with an even bigger voice,
Taylor played the voracious, man-eating plant ("Feed me, Seymour!")
in off-Broadway's "Little Shop of Horrors" in the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The versatile Taylor worked steadily in film and television. He
had a recurring role in "City of Angels" and appeared in more than 30
other shows, including "Ally McBeal" and "The Simpsons," for which he
supplied the voice for saxophonist "Bleeding Gums" Murphy. He also
appeared in more than 20 films, including "Trading Places," "A Rage
in Harlem" and "Rush Hour, Part II."</TE>
<TE>   As a vocalist, Taylor performed with Billy Joel, Bruce
Springsteen, Etta James, Sheila E., Slash and others. His blues band
"The Nervis Bros." played at clubs and other venues across the
country. His greatest triumph was "It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues."
The show, which traces the history of blues music from its African
roots to American pop, debuted at the Denver Center in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor suffered his 1999 stroke just a few days after the
televised Tony Awards ceremonies in which "It Ain't Nothing but the
Blues" was up for four awards, including best new musical and Taylor
for best featured actor in a musical.</TE>
<TE>   The revue didn't win any awards, but it generated an uproar in the
theater community when CBS bumped a scheduled four-minute "Blues"
production number on the nationally televised awards show because the
program was running too long.</TE>
<TE>   The live broadcast included performances of the four other
nominated musicals and the omission generated criticism of racism,
favoritism and just plain bad planning. But Taylor and his fellow
cast members received even greater national exposure two days later
when they were invited to perform on David Letterman's CBS late-night
show.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Galveston, Texas, Taylor was a football player at Wharton
College in Texas when he joined the school choir after its director
heard his booming voice during an impromptu imitation of the
Temptations with some friends in a hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor also became active in the college's theater department and
later attended the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts in
New York City.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife, DeBorah Sharpe-Taylor, in 1977 when he portrayed
the Lion and she was the understudy for Dorothy in the national
touring company of "The Wiz." In addition to his wife, Taylor is
survived by a son, Adamah; parents, Mario and Robert "Bruno" Taylor;
and two sisters, all of Galveston.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at the New Christ
Memorial Church of God and Christ, 13333 Vaughn St., San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Adamah Taylor
Education Fund, c/o the law firm of Ivie, McNeil &amp; Wyatt, 201 N.
Figueroa St., No. 1150, Los Angeles, CA 90012.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Man Is Cleared by Mexican Court</HD>
<DH>Law: A successful appeal ends the ordeal of an Aliso Viejo
church volunteer who was wrongly imprisoned for 6 1/2 years on sex
abuse charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN YSIDRO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>An Orange County church volunteer who spent 6 1/2 years in a Baja
prison was cleared of child sex-abuse charges Thursday by a Mexican
federal appeals court, ending a protracted legal odyssey with an
emotional celebration amid the smog and bustling traffic at the
Tijuana border.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very relieved and very grateful," David Cathcart, 60, said,
adding that his incarceration was marked by more than the passage of
time. "My father passed away. Eight granddaughters were born. Two
sons were married. You can't put a price on that."</LD>
<LD>   But he's going to try. While the decision ends the criminal case,
Cathcart said he plans to take legal action against those he believes
conspired to imprison him to protect a politically connected director
of La Puerta de Fe, or Door of Faith, the orphanage where Cathcart
was a volunteer.</LD>
<TE>   In the near future, though, Cathcart said he planned to celebrate
Thursday afternoon with a vodka martini at the Aliso Viejo apartment
he shares with his girlfriend, Tammy Stoller.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried this morning--I don't know if it's sunk in yet," she
said. "I worked for seven years to make this happen. I finally got
what I prayed for."</TE>
<TE>   Released From Prison Last May</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart was released from prison last May when a state judge
overturned his 1994 conviction on charges that he had sex with
children at the orphanage in La Mision, a dusty crossroads town near
Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Marta Flores Trejo ruled that the case was built on the lies
of four boys who were coerced by former orphanage director Gabriel
Diego Garcia, with whom Cathcart had argued over how
donations--mostly from Orange County Christians--were being spent.</TE>
<TE>   Diego, who could not be reached Thursday, has repeatedly denied
misusing funds or orchestrating the accusations against Cathcart.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a state-level appeals court overturned Flores'
decision and ordered Cathcart to finish the 12-year sentence.
Cathcart appealed, leading to Thursday's decision issued in Mexicali.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Arce, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor in Ensenada,
said the ruling had not been forwarded to that office, so she had no
comment other than to reiterate prosecutors' belief that Cathcart is
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   As Dean Martin songs seeped from speakers outside a duty-free shop
about 100 yards from the border, Cathcart said, "This ruling means
that I'm free, that I don't have to live in fear of being extradited,
and my name is cleared."</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that he harbors no general anger toward the Mexican
judicial system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the evildoing of one man in the beginning and several others
after that," Cathcart said. "I dearly love the [Mexican] people. I
would love to live there. I have a friend there that came between me
and a knife. So how can you be angry?"</TE>
<TE>   Cathcart, a former travel agent, said he has $250,000 in legal
bills.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Gain Ground on Blaze</HD>
<DH>Battle: Dying winds are a help in fight against wildfire in
Orange County back country. Authorities expect to be able to declare
it contained by tonight.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hampered by steep terrain but assisted by changing weather, about 500
firefighters Thursday battled a day-old brush fire that threatened a
colony of historic cabins in the Orange County back country.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which started late Wednesday afternoon, came close to 50
rustic dwellings in the Holy Jim Canyon and Trabuco Canyon areas of
the Cleveland National Forest before the roaring winds suddenly
slowed and the flames died down. Authorities said 25 to 35 people
were evacuated.</LD>
<LD>   "The flames were uncomfortably close, about 20 to 30 feet away,"
said Beep Colclough, treasurer of the Holy Jim Cabin Owners
Improvement Assn., whose husband, Steve, is chief of the Holy Jim
Volunteer Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the blaze had burned 100 to 125 acres by Thursday
afternoon and was no longer a threat to the cabins, many of which
were built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Holy Jim Canyon area--named
after a long-ago settler with a fondness for profanity--has not been
touched by fire for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although crews were still hosing down hotspots along creek beds
and charred ridge tops, U.S. Forest Service officials reported that
most of the fire had been extinguished. If the winds don't increase
in the days ahead, authorities said, the fire probably will be
declared contained by this evening and designated under control by
Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a difficult fire to fight," said Kathy Bacon, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. "It's a very rural setting
with narrow roads and steep terrain that is hard for firefighters to
work in. The winds were a real problem Wednesday night, but they have
died down since then."</TE>
<TE>   Among those fighting the blaze are crews from the Orange County
and Los Angeles County fire departments, the U.S. Forest Service and
the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</TE>
<TE>   They began using five water-dropping helicopters Thursday morning.
No property damage or serious injuries have been reported.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, the cause of which is under investigation, was reported
at 5:37 p.m. Wednesday. Authorities said it appeared to have started
at the far end of Trabuco Creek Road.</TE>

<LD>State budget--A Times editorial Jan. 14 incorrectly said it would
cost the state more than $4 billion to borrow $2.4 billion over a 20-year
period. Gov. Gray Davis' budget called the $4-billion figure 'debt
service,' which often is defined as interest on a loan. In this case,
Finance Department officials said it referred to both interest and

<HD>State Court Backs Police on Searches</HD>
<DH>Rights: Justices split sharply in 4-3 ruling allowing car
inspections for license, registration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Police in California may search cars if a driver fails to produce a
license or registration regardless of whether the officer has a warrant,
the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The high court, in a 4-3 vote, sided in favor of law enforcement
despite sharply worded dissents declaring that such searches violate the
U.S. Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Joyce Kennard, one of the dissenters, suggested the ruling may
have been motivated by security fears stemming from the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "As this opinion is being written, our nation is undergoing a painful
recovery from the devastating physical and psychological effects of that
day," Kennard wrote. She said the ruling "does nothing to enhance our
security and does much to erode our 4th Amendment rights."</TE>
<TE>   California courts previously have allowed police making routine
traffic stops to search for licenses and registrations in glove
compartments and under visors. The Supreme Court's decision Thursday
approves for the first time searches under the seats of cars and
elsewhere when there is no reason to believe a crime has been committed,
lawyers in the case said.</TE>
<TE>   Other courts have also given police more freedom in dealing with
motorists. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month reaffirmed that
police have extensive leeway in determining when to stop motorists and
that they may rely on innocent-looking actions as grounds for their
suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court's majority, in an opinion written by Chief
Justice Ronald M. George, reasoned that police can look for documents in
a vehicle to determine the identity of the driver and the owner of the
vehicle. The decision upheld two police searches in Orange and Solano
counties in which drugs were found under car seats and the drivers were
prosecuted for possession.</TE>
<TE>   "Limited warrantless searches for required registration and
identification documentation are permissible," George wrote, when the
officers look for documents "in an area where such documents reasonably
may be be expected to be found."</TE>
<TE>   George contended that allowing such searches would be less intrusive
than arresting a motorist for driving without a license. He also noted
that it would not be permissible to search a car trunk unless the officer
had reason to believe the documentation was in there.</TE>
<TE>   Voting with George were Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming W. Chin and
Justice Carlos R. Moreno, whom Gov. Gray Davis recently appointed to fill
a vacancy left by the death of Justice Stanley Mosk in June. Mosk
frequently sided with defendants in police search cases.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled in a case involving the kind of
circumstances before the California court, although some high courts in
other states have upheld searches for vehicle registration.</TE>
<TE>   The three dissenting justices sharply accused the majority of
violating the U.S. Constitution by creating a "blanket" exception to
warrant requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar said the majority erred in saying that
the space beneath a driver's seat is a reasonable place to keep vehicle
registration. She also noted that driver's licenses are not usually kept
under a car's seat and contended the Constitution prohibits car searches
for licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing--not the Constitution, nor any statute nor the cases cited by
the majority--authorizes police to conduct a warrantless vehicle search
in an attempt to discover the license of a driver who asserts he or she
does not have it in the car," Werdegar wrote.</TE>
<TE>   If a driver fails to produce a license, the officer can run the
driver's name on a computer, ask the driver to submit a thumbprint,
accept another form of identification or arrest the driver, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "By what logic," she asked, "would a police officer believe that
searching a vehicle for a person's driver's license would be fruitful
when the driver has just informed the officer that he does not have a
license in possession?"</TE>
<TE>   Kennard, joined by Justice Janice Rogers Brown, discussed "the
horrendous events of Sept. 11" and asked whether anyone would ever be
able to forget them.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the recovery has been to create more security for citizens but
"an equally important part" should be a "rededication to the principles
upon which our nation was founded," Kennard wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She predicted the ruling "may well result in limitless searches
throughout a vehicle whenever a driver cannot produce the requisite
documentation."</TE>
<TE>   The court reached its decision in a single ruling on two similar
cases. One of them stemmed from a traffic stop of Randall Ray Hinger, 40,
who was making unsafe lane changes, in Orange County in August 1997.
Hinger told the officer that he did not have his driver's license with
him and had no car registration.</TE>
<TE>   The officer asked Hinger whether he could search the car, and Hinger
said no. The officer replied that he would search the car anyway to look
for identification and registration. Hinger then mentioned that he might
have a wallet in the car.</TE>
<TE>   The officer lifted papers in the glove box and then walked around near
the driver's seat and looked under it. He then walked to the passenger's
seat and looked under it. He found a wallet, and inside it, a plastic bag
containing methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Hinger pleaded guilty to possession after a trial court refused to
throw out the evidence on the grounds the search was illegal. A Court of
Appeal later upheld that decision.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, Arturo D., who was 16, was stopped in August 1998
in Solano County for speeding. Arturo gave the officer his name, date of
birth and an address but admitted that he had no driver's license. He
also said the truck was not his and he had no registration for it.</TE>
<TE>   The officer felt under the driver's seat for documentation. When he
couldn't feel anything, he went behind the driver's seat, bent down and
peered under under it. He found a glass smoking pipe and a white vial
that contained methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   A trial judge approved the search, but a Court of Appeal in Orange
County overturned the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda F. Doerrer, the lawyer who represented Hinger, said she was "in
a little shock with the decision" and was strongly considering asking the
U.S. Supreme Court to overturn it.</TE>
<TE>   "It significantly reduces a person's expectation of privacy when they
are in an automobile," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No appellate court has approved such searches for identification
unless the officer suspected contraband was in the car or feared for his
safety, she said. Neither officer in the two cases had such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Alana Butler said the ruling "will give officers
more guidance about what they can and cannot do."</TE>
<TE>   "It really gives officers room to be able to look at the totality of
the circumstances and to be able to use their good judgment," she said.
"At the same time, they can't go on a pretext search and rummage in a
place where these things might not reasonably be found."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Jeffrey M. Laurence said he does not believe the
terrorist attacks directly shaped the court's decision in People vs.
Arturo D., S085213, and People vs. Hinger, S085218.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 reflects the need for officers to confirm the identity of
drivers, but I don't think it impacted the outcome" of the cases,
Laurence said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Talib Goes to Court on Conspiracy Counts</HD>
<DH>Law: John Lindh says little as prosecutors accuse him of freely
choosing to join enemy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>His hair and beard shorn, a made-over John Philip Walker Lindh
stood accused Thursday in the heavily fortified federal courthouse where
lawyers will lay out conflicting versions of his story: Was he a traitor
working with the Taliban or a brainwashed kid from Northern California?</LD>
<LD>   Lindh said little to the judge, except to acknowledge the gravity of
the terrorist conspiracy charges against him. It fell moments later to
his parents and their team of gray-suited lawyers to speak in his defense
outside the courthouse here in this Washington suburb.</LD>
<LD>   His father said he was no turncoat; his mother said the United States
is his true home.</LD>
<TE>   "He never meant to harm any American, and he never did harm any
American," Frank Lindh said. "John is innocent of these charges."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors, from Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft--who spoke at a
separate news briefing--down to a phalanx of government lawyers that
packed the hearing, insisted that Lindh freely chose to fight for the
enemy, before and even after the terrorist strikes of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, Ashcroft said, "will be held responsible in the courtroom for
his choices."</TE>
<TE>   The early morning hearing--held hours after Lindh arrived back in the
United States under heavy guard--brought together his parents from the
West Coast, government prosecutors and the team of high-powered attorneys
who will defend him.</TE>
<TE>   Security was extraordinarily tight, as armed officers in black SWAT
uniforms positioned themselves outside the courthouse and in the
surrounding streets. And the mob of reporters and camera crews offered a
glimpse of the media frenzy that will accompany the case.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Lindh could be sentenced to life in prison with no
parole. If new charges of treason are added--a possibility that U.S.
Atty. Paul McNulty left open after the hearing--Lindh could face the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   He was captured last fall during the war in Afghanistan, and he
immediately gained celebrity as the "American Talib"--a naive, privileged
young man who converted to Islam and made his way to that far corner of
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The image of a disheveled Lindh--unkempt hair, grizzled black beard
and frightened, sometimes angry eyes--has been replayed almost
incessantly on American newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   But it was clear from Thursday's events that his family and attorneys
are seeking to soften that image.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers said he would no longer use his Islamic names, Suleyman
al-Faris and Abdul Hamid. Nor would he use John Walker, the name he first
gave to authorities. He would once again use his given name, John Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he was charged with federal offenses including conspiring
to kill U.S. citizens overseas and providing material support and
resources to foreign terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh entered the courtroom in a green jail jumpsuit, the word
"PRISONER" emblazoned in white letters across his back. His father and
his mother, Marilyn Walker, sat near their son as the charges were read,
and U.S. Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell sought to make sure Lindh knew what
was happening.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to his sometimes confused countenance in television news
footage, Lindh appeared quite composed.</TE>
<TE>   Did he understand the charges against him?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I understand the charges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Did he understand the possible punishment?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I understand generally."</TE>
<TE>   Anything further?</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't have any questions."</TE>
<TE>   The judge set a Feb. 6 bail hearing, and the brief session ended. The
seventh-floor courtroom, rimmed inside and out with security officers,
slowly emptied.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Lindh had met for about 20 minutes with his parents, speaking
to them through a security screen. He also huddled with his lawyers for
45 minutes. The defense team, assembled by his father, who is also a
lawyer, includes four former federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Bill Cummings, the onetime U.S. attorney in this eastern
Virginia district, and George Harris, who served as a special prosecutor
in the Iran-Contra case.</TE>
<TE>   The chief lawyer, James J. Brosnahan of San Francisco, who was an
Iran-Contra special prosecutor, said the parents' meeting--their first
with their son since before Sept. 11--was monitored by the FBI. The
lawyers' session was not, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the courthouse, the parents, who are separated, spoke of
their devotion to their middle child. Marilyn Walker, appearing near
tears, offered her first public remarks in her son's case.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been two years since I last saw my son," she said. "It was
wonderful to see him this morning. My love for him is unconditional and
absolute, and I am grateful to God that he's been brought home to his
family, me, his home, his country."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lindh expressed relief that his son had received medical
assistance aboard a Navy ship and appeared to be feeling well. "We're
very grateful to see that John is in good physical condition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lindh then began to speak more like a lawyer, insisting that his
son was not the enemy and that he had never raised a rifle in threat to
U.S. forces or their allies.</TE>
<TE>   "John did not take up arms against America," Lindh said, proclaiming
his son's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan went on the offensive, arguing that the young man was
deprived of legal assistance for too long and that any statements he may
have made to U.S. interrogators should be tossed out.</TE>
<TE>   "For 54 days, the United States government has kept John Lindh away
from a lawyer," Brosnahan said. "He began requesting a lawyer almost
immediately, which would have been Dec. 2 or 3. For 54 days, he was held
incommunicado."</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft sharply denied that there was any coercion and maintained
that Lindh twice declined the assistance of a lawyer while he was being
held abroad.</TE>
<TE>   He said Lindh "chose to join terrorists who wanted to kill Americans.
And he chose to waive his right to an attorney, both orally and in
writing, before his statement to the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have used that statement as a key building block for the
charges against Lindh, alleging that he left the U.S. several years ago
and found his way into the arms of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   McNulty, whose office in Alexandria is prosecuting the case, also said
Lindh was getting legal help. "He had a right to meet with his counsel,"
McNulty said. "He met with them this morning."</TE>
<TE>   The key legal question, initially, will center on whether Lindh was
treated as a prisoner of war or a criminal defendant, and whether he was
properly advised of his rights before he spoke with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   When that question is resolved, the broader issue surfaces: Was he
indeed a soldier for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, or was he in
the Middle East merely in pursuit of his religious faith, and there fell
unwittingly onto the wrong side of American interests?</TE>
<TE>   "At no time did he ever actually harm any American," Brosnahan
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what Lindh was doing in Afghanistan, Brosnahan paused. "That's a
long story," he said. "But we're going to get to that."</TE>
<TE>   How that will play to a jury remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "American people love trials," Brosnahan said. "That's why there are
so many on television. Don't miss this trial. Be there."</TE>

<HD>House Yields on Campaign Money Reform</HD>
<DH>Finance: Embarrassment over Enron's political donations revives
petition by lawmakers, forcing GOP leaders to allow a vote. Bush signals
he would not thwart bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With the Enron Corp. scandal providing powerful momentum, campaign
finance reform advocates Thursday broke through a major legislative
barrier and won the right to a House vote on their bid to limit the role
of big money in politics.</LD>
<LD>   Although the fate of the reform effort remains uncertain, the
development gives renewed life to a movement that had stalled last year.
The odds now have improved that the most extensive overhaul of the
campaign finance system since the Watergate era will become law.</LD>
<LD>   The reformers' main goal is to ban so-called soft money, unlimited and
largely unregulated donations to political parties instead of to specific
candidates. And reform advocates clearly believe the controversy over
Enron--which over the years has been a large soft money donor--has fueled
their cause.</LD>
<TE>   "As the Enron storm clouds roll in, the public's tolerance for this
soft money system is growing increasingly thin," said Rep. Martin T.
Meehan (D-Mass.). Soft money, he added, "needs to banished, and banished
fast."</TE>
<TE>   There also were new indications Thursday that President Bush--a major
recipient of campaign contributions from Enron--would not thwart a reform
bill if it were sent to him.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has differed with congressional reformers on how
extensive a soft money ban should be, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer
said at his daily briefing that the president "is committed to having
campaign finance reform enacted into law."</TE>
<TE>   And in a clear signal to GOP congressional leaders that the burden for
blocking a reform bill is on their shoulders, Fleischer added: "The
president has made it very clear to Congress that [it] cannot count on
him to veto campaign finance reform."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer's comments came as two Republican House members and two
Democrats gave reform advocates the final signatures they needed on a
petition to force a vote on the issue, overcoming opposition from GOP
House leaders. The new names gave the petition 218 signatures--the bare
majority in the 435-member House.</TE>
<TE>   Without the rank-and-file rebellion--a rare feat in the history of the
House--the reform effort would have been dead in this year's
congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   The reform effort had crossed a milestone last April when the Senate
passed a bill that would abolish soft money contributions, as well as ban
certain types of political advertising in the last 60 days of a campaign.
But parliamentary skirmishing in the House derailed action on a similar
reform bill last July.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly when the new House debate on the issue will begin is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charles F. Bass (R-N.H.), who was one of those signing the
petition Thursday, said that House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)
promised him a vote in February. A spokesman for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-Texas) said the GOP leaders would discuss the schedule at a
party retreat this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   While the petition drive to force a House vote likely would have
succeeded even without Enron's financial collapse late last year, the
saga of the energy-trading company's demise has given campaign finance
reform a potent new rallying cry.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 election cycle, Enron and its executives gave $1.7 million
in soft money contributions to both parties. Such donations typically are
spent on television commercials and other advertising that stop just
short of explicitly advocating a candidate's election or defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The two parties raised almost $500 million in soft money in the
two-year period that ended Dec. 31, 2000, and an additional $133 million
during 2001, according to reports filed with the Federal Election
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the current system say banning soft money would infringe
on the constitutional right of free speech. And to bolster their argument
that large contributions do not necessarily buy influence, they argue
that Enron got no special treatment for its money.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of soft money say the Enron case underlines the corrosive
power of unregulated campaign cash. The say that at the least, Enron
benefited from an unwillingness of lawmakers to take a close look at the
company's business practices until it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, said Rep. Thomas E. Petri (R-Wis.), "dramatizes and exemplifies
and gives a specific face to the problem. . . . It gives [the soft money
issue] an edge that it had lacked before."</TE>
<TE>   Petri was the other Republican who broke with the GOP leadership
Thursday to sign the petition.</TE>
<TE>   One reason reform advocates are optimistic about their chances now
that the issue has been muscled back onto the congressional agenda is
that versions of a soft money ban passed in the House twice in recent
years, most recently in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   So opponents of the legislation, such as Hastert and Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas), will have to persuade some lawmakers to change their
positions--not an easy sell with the Enron scandal dominating the news
and November elections looming.</TE>
<TE>   The House reform bill is sponsored by Reps. Meehan and Christopher
Shays (R-Conn.). It closely tracks the bill sponsored by Sens. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) that won Senate
approval.</TE>
<TE>   House GOP leaders back an alternative bill that would limit, but not
ban, soft money.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Bush has said he favors a ban on soft money donations by
labor unions and corporations--but not a ban on such contributions by
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The reform bills that previously passed the House were backed by most
of the chamber's Democrats. But one hurdle reform advocates will face in
the upcoming debate is objections among some Democrats to a key provision
that helped the bill clear the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   To build a winning coalition in the Senate, backers agreed to raise
the long-standing campaign contribution limits for donations that go
directly to federal candidates. These donations are known as hard money.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate and House bills, the limits on hard money donations
would double, from $1,000 per election to $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats argue that it sends the wrong signal to raise that
limit in a bill that aims to diminish the influence of contributions in
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The petition to force a House vote on the reform issue had stalled in
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but then had steadily
gained signatures before Congress' recess for the holidays in late
December.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, 20 Republicans signed the petition, along with 197
Democrats and one independent. The two Democrats who signed Thursday were
Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts. His
signature was the 218th.</TE>
<TE>   All 32 House Democrats from California signed. The only lawmaker in
the state's 20-member Republican delegation to sign was Rep. Stephen Horn
of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Reps. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) and Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), both
of whom have been past supporters or sponsors of reform bills, resisted
pressure to sign and stood with GOP leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say it may not be easy for lawmakers such as Ose and
Gallegly to oppose the bill on a final vote.</TE>
<TE>   Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise
Institute think tank, said that any lawmakers who switch their positions
after the Enron collapse would have "a lot of explaining to do."</TE>

<HD>Bush Wants $38 Billion for Security</HD>
<DH>Spending: Protecting the nation from terrorism is a high priority
in the president's new budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Thursday he would ask Congress to spend nearly
$38 billion next year to protect the nation from terrorism, double the
current year's budget, with considerable extra money going to beef up the
"first responders" to attacks: local police, fire and rescue services.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal to dramatically increase funds for homeland security,
coming one day after Bush said he would seek the biggest boost in
Pentagon spending in two decades, spotlights the rapid shift in the
nation's official priorities after the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., had suggested last
week that the homeland security budget would be doubled next year. But
this is a budget category that did not exist before Sept. 11, and Daniels
left the impression that a doubling would leave the budget considerably
smaller than $38 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking to a group of several hundred mayors who were in Washington,
D.C., for a conference, Bush called winning the war against terrorism the
first priority of his budget. "The second priority of our government, a
priority which will be reflected in my budget, is making sure we protect
the people at home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal calls for $3.5 billion in federal assistance to states
and local governments to bolster police, fire and rescue services, a
tenfold increase over current spending. Bush also said some of the money
would be spent on stockpiling medicines and modernizing the nation's
public health system.</TE>
<TE>   The mayors left the White House delighted by the prospective increase
in federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   "This will give us the seamless approach to how we deal with the issue
of terrorism in America," said Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, adding that
$3.5 billion "goes a long way to helping cities deal with the issues, the
training, the equipment, and all those things that are necessary to make
sure cities are prepared if we ever have another day like Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said he and other city
leaders would continue to seek federal reimbursement for the millions of
dollars--$45 million by July 1 in Los Angeles' case--that the cities are
spending on security.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect to get every single dime back, but I think we are not
giving up on our request for reimbursement," Hahn said. "What's been
difficult for us has been the additional overtime dollars. That's really
dug a hole in our budget this year."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the mayors, some members of Congress expressed concern
that such a sudden increase in funds over which the federal government
would exercise relatively little control could result in considerable
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice) criticized the president for an "ad hoc,
inconsistent and confusing" strategy. "There needs to be a comprehensive
and detailed strategy, based on threat assessment, to prevent or respond
to future attacks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The president unveiled his homeland security plans, which will be part
of the budget he sends to Congress on Feb. 4 for fiscal year 2003, one
day after revealing his intention to ask for a $48-billion boost for the
military. Today he travels to Portland, Maine, to highlight port security
and border control, aspects of homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   With the approach Tuesday of his first State of the Union address,
Bush and his top aides have been working to tout popular spending
initiatives. They are not talking about the many programs that face cuts,
nor about earlier presidential initiatives such as Social Security
reforms and prescription drug coverage, which stand little chance of
enactment in the new climate of budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   As with his announcement of the huge Pentagon budget increase, neither
Bush nor the White House gave many details of his homeland security
plans. Aides told reporters to wait for the president's speech and the
submission of his budget.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said he was ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to bring about compatibility in communications and rescue equipment among
the nation's 36,000 municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   His press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said the $37.7 billion in homeland
security funds for next year would be spread across many government
agencies and represented a combination of beefed-up existing programs and
new ones.</TE>
<TE>   The sharply increased support for first responders would include $2
billion to buy emergency equipment and $1.1 billion to train rescue
personnel to deal with chemical and biological attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the most populous states would receive the most federal
aid. The states in turn would parcel out the funds to their cities and
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Border control, another aspect of homeland security, is budgeted at
$8.7 billion in the 2002 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The funds are
shared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Customs
Service, the Agriculture Department's food inspection bureaus and the
Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland
Security, said there would be a "significant increase" in Bush's budget
request for various border control programs. He declined to be specific.</TE>
<TE>   One issue being debated vigorously within the administration is
whether to propose consolidating the array of agencies that play a role
in border security.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and the other mayors were especially happy that the first
responder program was to be coordinated through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. They said FEMA would be able to speed the flow of
federal aid to cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us who unfortunately have had disasters in the past have had
a real good working relationship with FEMA," Hahn said. "They seem to be
able to cut through the red tape much more quickly than other federal
agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who was in Washington for two days to attend the mayors
conference, met Thursday afternoon with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney as
well as with officials at Fannie Mae, hoping to get their help in
building up the city's housing trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was scheduled to return to Los Angeles late Thursday night.</TE>

<HD>Speedskating Dispute Puts Chill on Olympic Spirit</HD>
<DH>Sports: A rejected U.S. skater drops his claim of foul play, but
another case rages on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He claimed the purported plot was hatched a month ago at an ice
rink in Kearns, Utah.</LD>
<LD>   Allegedly, short track speedskating's budding U.S. superstar and his
main challenger threw a race to help a pal win a spot on the Olympic
team--snatching opportunity away from another skater they disliked. Or so
the losing skater said.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, an arbitrator dismissed those claims, finding that no
rules were broken by either the skaters or U.S. Speedskating, which
governs the sport. The Olympic roster remains intact. The displaced
skater formally dropped his protest and, in return, one of his
adversaries withdrew the defamation lawsuit he had filed in response.</LD>
<TE>   But even in resolution, the case's ripples have spread beyond the tiny
sphere of elite speedskating, exposing rivalries and cutthroat tactics
familiar to athletes, but disillusioning to true believers in the Olympic
promise of fair play.</TE>
<TE>   There have always been bitter disputes over Olympic slots--the most
high-profile, of course, being the attack orchestrated by figure skater
Tonya Harding on rival Nancy Kerrigan in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Winter Games in Salt Lake City approach, more of them than
ever are finding their way into the public record--and, thus, into the
public eye.</TE>
<TE>   As a battery of attorneys saw the speedskating rhubarb to its end, an
arbitrator was hearing testimony in a San Diego courtroom in a separate
case filed by women's bobsledder Jen Davidson, who claims she was
unjustly robbed of her chance to compete.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletes are going to court about these disputes instead of just
complaining and arguing," said David Wallechinsky, an Olympic historian
and author of "The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the speedskating case turned teammates into witnesses
against each other at an already stressful time, rupturing the team's
fabric, possibly for good, said Anita DeFrantz, the senior International
Olympic Committee member from the U.S. and president of the Amateur
Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The psychic damage is almost inestimable to the athletes," she said.
"I do believe our Olympic athletes are prepared at the start of
competition, but the agony in between, the loss of sleep, the ups and
downs, that's all part of it. You start second-guessing yourself and say
things and then say, 'Did I really say that?' "</TE>
<TE>   The speedskating controversy began at the Olympic trials, held in late
December.</TE>
<TE>   Short track is the younger, edgier sibling of long track speedskating,
the more elegant art form of Olympic legends Eric Heiden and Bonnie
Blair.</TE>
<TE>   In long track, two skaters compete at a time, staying in their lanes
and racing the clock, not one other.</TE>
<TE>   Short track, added to the Olympic roster in 1992, has more in common
with Roller Derby: A pack of helmet-wearing skaters bull their way around
a smaller, padded rink. Some jockeying is legal but the rules forbid
pushing, obstructing, colliding or body contact while passing.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, Apolo Ohno is the poster boy for short track, personifying its
punky, rebellious image. Born in Seattle and raised mostly by his father,
he won the 1999 world junior short track championship and became the
youngest American ever to win a World Cup race that same year.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno and his top competitor, the spiky-haired, peroxide blond Rusty
Smith of Sunset Beach, had accumulated enough points to clinch spots on
the six-member Olympic squad going into the final race. Tommy O'Hare,
seen by some in the sport as abrasive and a bit of an outsider, had what
he thought was a solid hold on sixth place. Ohno's close friend, Shani
Davis, lagged behind.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare did not skate in the final group. Instead, he was watching as
Davis beat out the more celebrated Ohno and Smith, grabbing enough points
to nab the sixth, and final, Olympic slot.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare immediately accused Ohno and Smith of conspiring to fix the
race, making strategic moves to help their friend Davis. Ohno admitted
publicly that he had not gone all out, saying he was trying to avoid
injury, but he denied he had broken any rules.</TE>
<TE>   Smith filed a defamation lawsuit against O'Hare, claiming the
accusation marred his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. athletes can appeal the team-selection process twice. O'Hare took
his case first to U.S. Speedskating and then, when that did not produce
the resolution he sought, demanded a hearing before an officer from the
American Arbitration Assn.</TE>
<TE>   As the hearing date approached, material from sworn statements made by
skaters Chris Needham, Adam Riedy and Chad Richards leaked out. They
claimed to have overheard Ohno and Smith conspiring to ease up or aid
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear to me that Apolo Ohno was not skating the race in order
to win and that he skated the race to ensure that Shani Davis won,"
Needham said, according to a report published by the Denver Post.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, who did not compete because of an injury, said he heard
Smith tell Ohno just before the race: "If Shani gets in the lead with
three laps to go, I won't pass him."</TE>
<TE>   And Riedy, who didn't qualify to race in the finals, said that "after
the race Shani went up to Rusty and Apolo right as they were getting off
the ice. I heard Shani say, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."'</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, however, an arbitrator decided no rules were broken.
O'Hare gave up the fight, saying he was satisfied with the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of circumstances that went on outside the hearing and
outside his control, he resolved to amicably resolve" the matter, said
John Collins, O'Hare's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Williams, Smith's attorney, said that, ultimately, the case proved
that the structures in place to ensure fairness in the Olympic selection
process are working.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five or 30 years ago, we didn't have procedures and processes
in place to protect an athlete's right to compete," said Williams, who
was a biathlon competitor in the 1968 Winter Games. "It's a lot more fair
now. It's just painful."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Speedskating President Fred Benjamin is simply glad the case is
over. Now the athletes can concentrate on competition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But can they? Will the public forget such damaging allegations, even
if they are deemed baseless?</TE>
<TE>   Ohno, a favorite to win as many as four gold medals, has the most to
lose. He is expected to be featured in Olympic television coverage. If he
wins, he could garner considerable celebrity and endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   "It could [hurt him], depending on how he handles it," Wallechinsky
said. "If he comes off as gracious and as a good guy and charming, then
people are going to forget this. He can say he wasn't trying to hurt
anyone, he was just trying to help a friend or not to hurt himself."</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime observers say this year's bobsled and speedskating
controversies may have attracted more attention than similar cases
preceding other games because the Olympics are being held in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake City Games will be the last on American soil for many
years, and swelling patriotism has only intensified the focus on them.</TE>
<TE>   "The day the Olympics begin, usually these things cease to be a
story," Wallechinsky said.</TE>

<CX>   Figure skating--A Jan. 25 story in Section A incorrectly reported
that Tonya Harding orchestrated the attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan in
1994. Harding's husband, Jeff Gillooly, and three others admitted their
guilt and maintained that Harding took part in planning the assault.
Harding, who admitted only that she knew about the attack after it took
place, pleaded guilty to conspiring to hinder prosecution of a case.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With three years' experience putting money into get-rich-quick
programs online, Jack Reitzel believes he has learned all the rules.</LD>
<LD>   One rule is not to believe anything the promoters say. If they promise
a 300% return on investors' money in two weeks, it's more than likely the
site will disappear before the deadline arrives. If they claim their
response is slow because they've had emergency surgery or technical
problems or a dispute with their bankers, it's time to worry.</LD>
<LD>   And above all, one should understand that the longer one plays, the
better the chance of losing.</LD>
<TE>   "There have been dozens [of programs] where I've lost $10, $20, $50,"
he said. "In some, I've lost $500." One program purportedly investing in
racehorses, into which he was enticed by a recommendation from a friend
of a friend, cost him $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take me a long time to get my head above water," said
Reitzel, a 56-year-old computer engineer. "I definitely don't call this
investing. It's gambling."</TE>
<TE>   Tell that to the roughly 1,000 people who lost a combined $1 million
in "Invest Better 2001," a scheme run by 17-year-old Cole Bartiromo of
Mission Viejo. Like Reitzel, many of them appear to have been serial
players, jumping from program to program on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike true victims, many often know what they are getting into:
online variations of the Ponzi, pyramid and get-rich-quick come-ons that
have lured credulous citizens for decades. Relying on tips passed among
users of online bulletin boards, they are gambling that they can get
their initial investment out fast, then reap as much profit as possible
before the wild promises collapse.</TE>
<TE>   This strategy involves risk. For one thing, without insider complicity
it is almost impossible to be sure where one is located in the pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   "All these sites say 'get in on the ground floor now' no matter when
it is in the life of the pyramid," said Jim Kohm, an attorney for the
Federal Trade Commission. Most participants lose everything they invest,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, many state laws define any participation in pyramid
scams--even that by apparent victims--as engaging in an illegal activity,
said Steve Larsen, manager of the Washington state attorney general's
Cyber Consumer Resource Center. That subjects investors to similar
criminal and civil penalties as promoters.</TE>
<TE>   Those penalties vary widely by jurisdiction and the scale of the
crime. Under federal sentencing guidelines, the sponsors of scams that
net more than a million dollars and involve a large number of victims can
face big fines and up to 20 years in prison. In most cases, the
perpetrators also are expected to repay victims.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Internet has proved a boon to shysters, it has also
helped prosecutors catch them in the act, said John Reed Stark, chief of
Internet enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The
electronic footprints that they have left on the Internet [offer] a
resplendent evidentiary trail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Bartiromo's Invest Better Web site, which was shut
down this month by the SEC, bore several common characteristics of online
investment scams. These include the promise of outlandish investment
returns, backed by a marginally plausible investment idea seized upon by
eager investors. Bartiromo promised his customers returns of up to 2,500%
"risk free," purportedly as a result of placing "safe bets" on sports
contests.</TE>
<TE>   Other suspect Web sites hint that they are associated with investments
in gold, foreign bank securities or investment opportunities not
otherwise open to small investors. The vagueness of the actual investment
goal, perversely, often enhances its appeal to customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The nonsense of believing in pyramid schemes goes back to childhood
days of telling ghost stories in tents," said Mike Caro, a games and
gambling expert associated with Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Today there is a new element: the Internet's ability to facilitate the
spread of these schemes. Mass e-mailings, or "spam," circulate word of
new programs to thousands of potential marks at a click. "Once your name
gets into the mill, it's like junk mail," Reitzel said. Promoters use
public message boards, easily accessible via services such as Yahoo, to
reach huge audiences of computer users. They often disguise themselves as
delighted investors eager to pass on word of a sure-fire program.
Anonymous Web-hosting services enable investment promoters to shield
their identities and locations from investors and law enforcement
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been easier for con men to reach so many victims so
easily," said David Marchant, a Miami-based publisher of newsletters
exposing offshore investment scams. "The Internet has accelerated the
life span of your average Ponzi scheme, which used to be spread by word
of mouth. With the Internet, they don't have to do the traditional things
like infiltrating church groups anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Ponzi schemes are named after Charles K. Ponzi, a 1920s-era swindler
who purportedly invested his clients' money in postal coupons but
secretly paid investors from the money he collected from later investors.
The Web hosts thousands of programs that promise to earn customers
returns of 150% to 200% a month by investing in offshore trading and
other international opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Pyramid schemes operate much the same way--paying investors from the
proceeds contributed by others--but the relationship is often more overt,
with investors at each "level" knowingly entitled to a share of later
contributions, as in a chain letter.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ponzi schemes, it's extremely common for people at the beginning
to get high returns," Marchant said. "You put $2,000 in and get $4,000
back. The problem is that human nature is to put that $4,000 back in;
then, when they get $8,000 back, they mortgage the house and lose
everything. At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of money
ends up in the hands of crooks."</TE>
<TE>   Those few who make money often do so by making a quick change from
sucker to fraudster.</TE>
<TE>   "People knowingly become shills or spokesmen for the schemes in online
chat rooms or [via] e-mail to protect their investment," said James H.
Vaules, chief executive of the National Fraud Center, a subsidiary of
database giant LexisNexis. "There are a lot of people who begin as
victims and end up as co-conspirators," said Vaules, a former FBI
executive specializing in white-collar crime.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution of online fraud is hampered by the difficulty of showing
clear criminal intent.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to prove that inside a guy's brain he knew this was a
fraud," said Timothy Healy, chief of the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint
Center. "The challenge on any type of fraudulent scheme is to prove that
he intended fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, as con men have known for centuries, the pool of willing
marks is almost bottomless.</TE>
<TE>Complaints Represent Only Tip of the Iceberg</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people who really believe they can make money doing
nothing," said Michelle Haggerty, a Thousand Oaks operator of an online
self-publishing service who was inundated with e-mails after her
testimonial for ZoneHunt Matrix, a pyramid program, appeared on the
ZoneHunt Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I got e-mails from people saying they've put their grocery money into
this, and that's scary," she said, adding that she tried to warn some
people that the system would yield results only if allowed to run for
years.</TE>
<TE>   ZoneHunt works by inserting customers into a series of "matrices" of
84 investors each; every investor is theoretically paid a portion of the
contribution of the 83 who follow. The matrices range from "beginner
level," in which everyone contributes $5 to earn $150, up to "platinum
level," in which participants each contribute $29,997 for a theoretical
gain of nearly $480,000. Once his or her matrix is filled, the investor
can move up to the next level and, again theoretically, reap
proportionately greater gains.</TE>
<TE>   The ZoneHunt Web site portrays this as a virtual perpetual motion
machine of increasing wealth ("Look at it this way: If you joined at the
$5 level and it took you one year to complete Silver, you've earned
$15,952--all for $5"). Not surprisingly, however, the process is much
more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 11,000 customers, according to Amber Jalink, the program's
Canadian organizer, fewer than 50 are invested in the Silver level,
including several who started there. If the number of new customers slows
or the site shuts down, unrealized profit would disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "If it stops, someone would be left putting money in and not getting
anything out," Jalink acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Investment schemes are so widespread on the Web that law enforcement
authorities know the thousands of complaints they receive each year
represent the barest tip of the iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional swindles such as pyramid schemes made up 6% of the
Internet complaints received by the FBI for the 12 months ended in May,
and only 1% of 204,000 consumer-fraud complaints to the FTC in 2001.
(Most complaints are filed over Internet auctions, identity theft or
credit card fraud.) The average victim of an Internet pyramid scheme lost
$339, according to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures vastly understate the extent of the problem, law
enforcement officials say. For one thing, naive investors often fail to
report even blatant rip-offs.</TE>
<TE>   "People have confidence that they will strike it rich [the next] time.
They don't often see themselves as victims of fraud," said Betsy Broder,
an attorney with the FTC's consumer fraud division. "Although we know
with mathematical certainty that about 90% of people who participate in a
pyramid scheme will lose money."</TE>
<TE>   And repeat losers are common, experts say. "The vast majority of
people involved in these things are those who grab for the brass ring
continually, who believe the pitch over and over again and lose money
every time," not unlike compulsive gamblers, Kohm said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are feeling more comfortable with the Internet," said the
FBI's Healy. "With more commerce comes more fraud."</TE>
<TE>   And, he might add, more enablers.</TE>
<TE>   "The scam industry is so big that there's a well-defined
infrastructure," said Jay D. Adkisson, an Irvine financial consultant who
operates Quatloos.com, a clearinghouse for information about financial
swindles. "There's a long list of facilitators."</TE>
<TE>   These include online shills who post messages in Internet discussion
groups playing up their own sites and denigrating others as frauds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the phenomenon of scam artists creating 'due diligence'
sites," which purport to distinguish honest sites from frauds as a public
service or for a membership fee, Adkisson said. "That speaks volumes
about how high-yield investment programs [generally get-rich-quick
schemes offering implausible monthly or annual returns] have become an
industry and a very significant problem to retirees and low-income
people."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, the Internet has provided easy ways to move
money from investors' pockets to promoters'. Many online scams advise
their customers to open accounts at online money-transfer services such
as PayPal or E-Gold. These services were founded principally to
facilitate e-commerce payments by acting as financial intermediaries
between buyers and merchants. But they also can facilitate the funding of
scams without requiring cash to be sent through the mail.</TE>
<TE>Scam Promoters May Use Offshore Services</TE>
<TE>   Some online payment services say they are sensitive about being
misused this way. Among them is PayPal, an electronic financial
transmission service often used by online financial promoters to receive
contributions and, where applicable, distribute proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Our user agreement clearly states that PayPal cannot be used for any
illegal purpose or activity," Vince Sollitto, a spokesman for the Palo
Alto-based company, said in an e-mail to The Times. Other services say
the uses to which their systems are put are none of their business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's vexingly difficult to determine the legality of what someone
does," said Douglas Jackson, chairman of E-Gold Ltd., an intermediary for
e-commerce transactions. "We don't ask."</TE>
<TE>   Although E-Gold describes itself as an offshore market for the buying
and selling of gold, backed by precious-metal reserves the company
maintains overseas, in practice the system allows users to transfer money
among themselves almost as though they are writing checks.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters of online scams may find the system even more inviting
because it is legally headquartered in the Caribbean island of Nevis, a
notorious offshore financial haven. Jackson said this is because Nevis
has "a strong tradition of respect for contract law" and added, "I have
not observed that it's liable to abuse."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that E-Gold regards itself and its user accounts as
"not subject to U.S. regulatory agencies" and said any subpoenas it might
receive from an onshore law enforcement agency might need to be "brought
before Nevis courts" to determine their legal jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest Internet-based pyramids prosecuted by the FTC
involved a company called Fortuna Alliance. The firm promised investors
profit of at least $5,000 a month on an investment of as little as $250.
Thousands of investors in 60 countries were drawn in. The FTC filed a
complaint against Fortuna in 1996, but it took years to recover funds, in
part because the company stashed millions of dollars in offshore accounts
in Antigua, in the West Indies.</TE>

<HD>Now, the $51-Million Severance Question</HD>
<DH>Pay: Enron's Chapter 11 status may jeopardize compensation for
ex-CEO Kenneth Lay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ousted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay could get a severance
package worth at least $25 million--and perhaps exceeding $51
million--although his ability to collect that payday is clouded by the
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Lay, who resigned Wednesday under fire, also could get parting gifts
that include a lifetime annual pension of nearly $475,000, a $12-million
life insurance policy and payment of taxes on any severance pay.</LD>
<LD>   But Lay may never see a dime because, with most of Enron Corp.'s
operations tangled in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, he slipped overnight from
corporate commander to yet another among the thousands of Enron
creditors.</LD>
<TE>   "I would be incredulous if he got any money, and if he did take any
money he'd be spending the entire amount on bodyguards," compensation
expert Graef Crystal said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron
since 1999, has been accused of misleading shareholders about Enron's
finances as it plunged toward ruin last year.</TE>
<TE>   In his 15 years building Enron from a small pipeline company to the
world's largest energy trader, Lay was paid handsomely, and his severance
agreement and other benefits reflect that, according to documents on file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how much Lay might receive in severance is only vaguely
spelled out in Enron's most recent proxy statement, filed with the SEC in
March. Enron representatives declined to clarify the matter and hinted
that the payout might not be a sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The terms of Mr. Lay's separation are still being determined," Enron
spokesman Vance Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>Three Times His Salary and Bonus, Plus</TE>
<TE>   Lay's severance is based on payments he received in 2000, multiplied
by the three full calendar years left on his contract. That means Lay
would be entitled to a lump sum of about $25 million, or three times his
2000 salary of $1.3 million and bonus of $7 million.</TE>
<TE>   That $25-million tab would be further swelled by an unspecified
"long-term grant value" received in 2000, according to the proxy
statement. Compensation experts said that could include the $7.5 million
of restricted stock and a $1.2-million cash payment that Lay also
received in 2000, which Enron called "long-term compensation."</TE>
<TE>   If that assessment is correct, the total payout would be $51 million.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC filing also said that Lay is entitled to a lifetime pension
that would have been valued at $475,042 if Lay, 59, had stayed until 65.
In addition, the company said it would pay all taxes on Lay's severance
if the IRS rules that the severance package is an "excess parachute
payment."</TE>
<TE>   What is more, Lay, as of the end of 2001, owns a $12-million life
insurance policy that Enron helped him buy, according to Lay's 1996
employment agreement, also filed with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Lay also remains as an Enron director, and they are paid at least
$50,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Compensation experts said it is unlikely Lay will get his severance
package and most of his pension because all preexisting contracts are
invalidated by the bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lay technically
resigned, rather than being terminated. But the refusal of the company to
rule out a severance is "troublesome," Crystal said.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, even as Enron was hiding losses in a murky series of
off-the-books partnerships and using questionable accounting on its way
to the nation's largest bankruptcy filing, the company served another
purpose that nearly was hidden from public view: It effectively was a
personal bank for Ken Lay.</TE>
<TE>   The company last year provided Lay with an unusual line of credit of
as much as $7.5 million that he used repeatedly, often to help cover
soured investments he made elsewhere, his lawyer has said. This despite
the fact that Lay has received more than $200 million in compensation
from Enron since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   And the collateral securing the line of credit apparently was Lay's
own Enron stock, shares of which were showered on him by the thousands
either directly or through stock options that were part of his
compensation package during Enron's explosive growth in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Lay typically repaid the credit line with his Enron shares, then would
draw down the loan again and repeat the process, Earl Silbert, Lay's
lawyer, said. Lay did this on 15 occasions between February and October,
just as Enron's collapse was accelerating.</TE>
<TE>Lay Expected to Face Huge Legal Bills</TE>
<TE>   Lay's apparent financial problems, signaled by his repeated tapping of
the credit line, are compounded by the specter of huge personal legal
bills facing him. Lay is the subject of more than 50 lawsuits resulting
from Enron's financial meltdown, as well as numerous federal
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   His credit line is a perk that has surprised several experts in
executive compensation, a field already chock-full of various stock
options, bonuses and other benefits paid to Corporate America's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   To have a standing credit line for an executive who can pay back the
loan with stock the company has awarded him is "very unusual," said Alan
Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation
consultant in New York. The arrangement, approved by Enron's board,
allowed Lay "to treat the company as a personal piggy bank," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at Salary.com, an
Internet compensation site, said that "there is something fundamentally
odd about a company loaning money to an executive and collateralizing it
with the company's own stock."</TE>
<TE>   "Why is Enron in the business of loaning money?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>Company Loans to Top Management</TE>
<TE>   It is common for a company to make one-time loans to senior
managers--say to help them relocate or to buy the company's shares.
Sometimes corporations will even waive the interest, or total repayment,
as part of the executive's future compensation. Indeed, Enron in 1997
made a $4-million loan to Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive who
abruptly quit in August.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the dollar amount of Lay's credit line isn't sizable relative to
the billions of dollars of debt that sank Enron. After a series of
financial setbacks that sent its stock plunging and eroded investors'
confidence, Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection Dec. 2, citing
more than $31 billion in debt and $50 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which traded around $80 a share a year ago, now trades for
just pennies, and the options that Lay and others still have are
virtually worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Silbert did not return calls requesting elaboration on Lay's
arrangement, and Enron spokesman Meyer said he could provide no further
details.</TE>
<TE>   No one has suggested that Lay's arrangement involved any wrongdoing,
and Enron's proxy statement last year disclosed--in two sentences--that
the credit line existed. About the same time that the proxy appeared, in
March, was when Lay was starting to use the credit line repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   He typically repaid it by returning shares of his Enron stock to the
company, said Silbert, who said he made the public disclosure to offset
speculation that Lay was aggressively dumping shares because the
executive knew the company was headed toward disaster.</TE>
<TE>   But that disclosure--coming on top of so many other revelations,
including that some top Enron executives had financial interests in
partnerships that helped finance Enron's operations--adds to the
appearance that "there is an awful lot of self-dealing going on in this
case, and this is symptomatic of that," said Rajesh Aggarwal, an
assistant business professor at Dartmouth College.</TE>
<TE>   In September, at the same time Lay was using his Enron stock to
support his line of credit, he urged company employees to buy more shares
only weeks before Enron disclosed the worst financial results in its
history.</TE>
<TE>   The stock then was selling for about $25 a share, and two months later
for $4 a share. The stock's collapse wiped out billions of dollars of
investor holdings and the retirement savings of Enron employees who owned
the stock.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Lay's credit-line arrangement "is not one that's
shareholder friendly," said Salary.com's Coleman. The whole point of
executive compensation is to give top managers incentives to build the
company and boost its stock price for all shareholders, he said, yet
Lay's credit line gave him protection from having to reach into his own
wallet even when Enron's stock nose-dived.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't get hurt," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   The credit line served another purpose not afforded the average Enron
stockholder, said Kevin Murphy, a finance professor at USC. Letting Lay
repay his credit line with Enron stock "allowed him to get liquidity out
of his stock that was easier than going to the open market," he said. In
other words, Lay didn't have to first sell $4 million or so of Enron
shares on the stock exchange--an event that likely would have depressed
Enron's price on the market--each time to pay back his Enron loans.</TE>
<TE>   "That gives him an advantage that most stockholders don't have,"
Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   The credit line also raises questions about the amount of risk Lay was
personally accepting at the same time he was leading Enron's fight for
survival.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear why, in light of his enormous compensation at Enron, he
was having to repeatedly tap his credit line.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his salary and bonuses, Lay realized $43.8 million from stock
options that he cashed in during 1999, and $123.4 million from exercising
options in 2000, according to Enron's government filings.</TE>
<TE>   Lay sometimes borrowed from his Enron line of credit last year when he
expected to face margin calls from other lenders, Silbert has said. That
meant he had bought other investments partly with borrowed funds--or on
"margin"--and now had to repay some or all of those amounts because their
underlying investments had tumbled in value.</TE>
<TE>   Lay recently put several properties up for sale, including vacation
homes in Aspen, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Lay is gone, Enron is searching for a restructuring
specialist to run the company. Sources close to the company said an
interim chief executive will be announced in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Enron reportedly has narrowed the candidates for its interim chief
executive, and the front-runners are three New York companies that
specialize in corporate turnarounds, according to Bloomberg News. Those
companies--Alvarez &amp; Marsal, Glass &amp; Associates and Zolfo Cooper--all
declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Enron Auditor Says Fired Partner Drove Shredding</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senior Andersen accounting firm executives told Congress on
Thursday that a fired partner destroyed potentially revealing Enron
documents in an apparent attempt to keep them away from federal
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Partner David B. Duncan "gave every appearance of destroying these
materials in anticipation of a government request for documents,"
Andersen executives C.E. Andrews and Dorsey L. Baskin Jr. testified
before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which is taking the lead in what promises to be
an extensive congressional inquiry into the bankruptcy of the
seventh-largest company in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Documents released by the House subcommittee indicated that personnel
at Andersen's Chicago headquarters specifically warned Duncan in early
October that Enron's financial results harbored "a heightened risk of
financial statement fraud."</LD>
<TE>   The results had set off a red alert in FIDO, a proprietary software
program Andersen used to test financial statements for unusual patterns,
according to two e-mails sent to Duncan by Mark B. Zajac, a
risk-management executive in Chicago. The e-mails were sent Oct. 9, or
about the time that Duncan allegedly undertook a large-scale effort to
destroy documents related to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails covered a test apparently run on Enron's results for the
year ended June 30. Although the test was incomplete because some of
Enron's figures were missing, Zajac said the figures that did exist had
set off an alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Zajac further advised Duncan to run the test on the results for the
quarter ended Sept. 30--figures that Duncan was reviewing at the time. He
sent copies of one message about the alert to two of Duncan's superiors,
including Michael C. Odom, one of the Andersen executives who testified
Thursday. The House subcommittee did not bring the issue up with Odom,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Zajac cautioned Duncan that FIDO occasionally generated red alerts
because of "legitimate business activities" and therefore did not
indicate that fraud necessarily existed. But he advised the Andersen
partner that the alert was serious enough to warrant discussions between
Duncan and senior Andersen executives aimed at a resolution of the alert.</TE>
<TE>   "It is imperative that you evaluate the results carefully and
objectively before reaching any conclusion," Zajac advised Duncan
presciently, "because of the significant adverse impact of failing to
detect a material financial statement fraud."</TE>
<TE>   What steps, if any, Duncan and the other Andersen executives took in
response could not be learned.</TE>
<TE>Congress Questions Firm's Passivity</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's hearing, members of Congress questioned their assertion
that Duncan acted "without any consultation with others in the firm"
before destroying documents.</TE>
<TE>   And they expressed skepticism that senior executives were as passive
as they now say they were in October when federal agencies were known to
be zeroing in on Enron, a $50-million-a-year Andersen client.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Mr. Duncan being made a scapegoat?" Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.)
asked, declaring that "it seems maybe an explicit order was given to
destroy documents, yet backsides were covered."</TE>
<TE>   And Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.) told the four senior Andersen
executives seated before the committee: "You should be ashamed."</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 2, less than a month
after it restated earnings to account for $586 million in previously
unreported losses since 1997. More than 4,000 workers lost their jobs;
many more lost their retirement savings. In the last year the company's
stock price plunged from more than $80 a share to less than a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, the man at the eye of the storm, appeared briefly before the
House subcommittee but was dismissed after invoking his 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen provided the
getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel," said Rep. James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after hearing from Andrews and other executives at Andersen,
known until last year as Arthur Andersen, Greenwood said: "I still
haven't made up my mind on whether Mr. Duncan was a rogue employee or
whether Mr. Duncan was set up as a scapegoat."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of Capitol Hill, former Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. told a Senate committee that
Enron's collapse underscores the need to eliminate apparent conflicts of
interest among auditing firms, stock analysts and others the public
relies on for investment information.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's House hearing focused on the shredding of documents, an
aspect that could result in criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews and the other Andersen witnesses insisted that, at the time,
they knew nothing about what they now concede was large-scale destruction
of Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   But they were questioned closely about an e-mail memo sent from
headquarters in Chicago by staff attorney Nancy A. Temple, directing
Andersen units to stay current with the company's program of destroying
all documents except those classified as official audit papers.</TE>
<TE>   The shredding policy covered working-level memos, e-mails and notes on
meetings--material investigators now consider important to unraveling the
Enron crash and Andersen's role in it.</TE>
<TE>   Temple and others said the message, sent Oct. 12, was merely a routine
reminder to comply with a company policy against what some have called
the "pack-rat" tendencies of accountants.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not instruct Mr. Duncan to shred documents," Temple said
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not condone that. It is not what the firm's policy would
require," Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Andersen executives acknowledged that the firm's Chicago
headquarters did not specifically order employees to preserve Enron
materials until Temple made a call Nov. 9, a day after the company
received an SEC subpoena and weeks after a federal investigation was
known to be underway.</TE>
<TE>   It was this failure to take earlier, proactive steps that seemed to
leave subcommittee members incredulous.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can't understand--what I'd like to know--is why . . . didn't
the top brass at Andersen immediately send out word to everyone in the
company, and particularly those involved in the Enron case obviously, to
not touch a document, not shred a document?" Greenwood asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't that come down from the top immediately?"</TE>
<TE>   Scores of Andersen employees participated in the shredding, Greenwood
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet to date," he said, "committee investigators have been unable to
locate or learn about a single Andersen employee who raised any concerns
or objections about destroying Enron-related documents, even after the
SEC inquiry became public."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood called Andersen's explanation "hard to swallow." And Rep.
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), top Democrat on the full committee, said the
shredding was "criminally stupid, stupidly criminal or both."</TE>
<TE>Auditor Scolded for Disposal Policy</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the full House Energy
and Commerce Committee, scolded Andersen executives for a policy that
left it to an accountant, rather than to lawyers, to decide what
documents should be kept or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Baskin, managing director of Andersen's assurance professional
standards group, told the committee that the firm follows a standard
industry practice of disposing of documents other than work
papers--personal notes, for example--when no longer needed, but that such
records should be retained when litigation has commenced or is
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Baskin testified that shortly after Oct. 23, Duncan organized the
destruction of thousands of documents. The SEC investigation began Oct.
17.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin asked Temple why she didn't sent out a memo after the SEC
investigation was underway, specifically telling employees: "Don't
destroy anything . . . because we're under investigation and there's
litigation coming, and you'd better make sure that nothing is destroyed
for the sake of the reputation of our company and for the sake of the
integrity of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   "The issue was not raised with the legal group," she responded.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin shot back: "Does it have to be raised, Ms. Temple, when you are
the counsel representing this company internally on litigation?"</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said that company policy--now being revised--left it with the
lead auditor, Duncan in this case, to decide what documents to save.</TE>
<TE>   "With an accountant, not a lawyer?" Tauzin asked in apparent
disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "Every accounting firm who's listening to this had better listen very
carefully: If all of your policies are to let accountants decide when
it's legal to destroy documents in a pending investigation, an awful lot
of people are going to be in trouble down the road, not just in this
case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange, Tauzin asked Temple about her Nov. 10 memo that
followed her call the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "It says, 'We don't want anybody to falsely accuse Arthur Andersen of
destroying documents. . . . Save everything,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't find it necessary to write this memo the date that SEC
upgraded its investigation from informal to a formal investigation,"
Tauzin said. "You only found it necessary to write this memo saying,
'Keep everything; don't destroy anything,' the day a subpoena was
issued."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has told committee investigators that he read Temple's Oct. 12
e-mail as a directive to clean up the Enron files.</TE>

Angeles.</TE>

<HD>China Softens Tone Against Taiwan's Ruling Party</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>A top Chinese official Thursday tempered Beijing's hostility toward
the ruling party in Taiwan, blaming only a small minority for pushing
Taiwanese independence and extending a tentative welcome to the majority,
a shift that could ease tensions in one of the world's hot spots.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe there is a difference between the majority of Democratic
Progressive Party members and the extremely small number of die-hard
'Taiwan independence' elements," state media quoted Vice Premier Qian
Qichen as saying.</LD>
<LD>   "We welcome them, under an appropriate status, to come and look around
and to pay visits to further understanding," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The remarks by Qian, China's top diplomat, were Beijing's most
conciliatory yet toward the party of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian,
which China has denounced as a separatist movement.</TE>
<TE>   The move could lead to greater dialogue and cooperation across the
narrow Taiwan Strait, although Qian reiterated China's insistence that
the island must recognize that it belongs to China before any formal
political negotiations between the archrivals can be revived. Chen's
government has steadfastly refused to accept any preconditions to talks.</TE>
<TE>   Since Chen's election shocked the world two years ago, upending the
long-ruling Nationalists, Beijing has been implacable in its opposition
to the DPP. The party has historically advocated the idea of independence
from the mainland, which considers Taiwan a renegade province.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Chen's presidency, Chinese officials have sought to isolate
him on the world stage and to court his opponents, inviting several
Nationalist Party members to Beijing for friendly chats.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, the ruling party further strengthened its position on
the island while the Nationalists' fortunes continued to plummet. In
island-wide elections, the Nationalists lost their long-held majority in
the legislature and glumly watched the DPP become the party with the most
seats.</TE>
<TE>   The new political landscape may have prompted Beijing to moderate its
position toward the party.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts warned against too much sudden optimism. Beijing would
almost certainly exclude Chen from any list of party members it would
invite to the mainland, as well as his deputy, Vice President Annette Lu,
an ardent independence supporter whom Chinese media once called "scum."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Thursday's change of tone may be part of the mainland's
strategy of shunning Chen and pushing him further into a corner by
himself. Just last October, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
publicly called Chen a liar.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Beijing regime regard Chen as a closet independence
advocate, a notion seemingly reinforced this month by the Chen
administration's decision to change Taiwanese passports to say, "Issued
in Taiwan." (The idea was ultimately scrapped.)</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Chen is no likelier to abruptly reverse course and
embrace the "one China" principle. "I don't think Chen's going to give
Beijing the brass ring they're seeking," said Jonathan Pollack, a China
expert at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   But both sides appear eager to increase economic ties, despite some
fear in Taipei that the island may become too dependent on the mainland
and have no choice but to reunify with it eventually.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan and China are new members of the World Trade Organization,
which will increase the scope of economic activity across the Taiwan
Strait. Qian said that "political differences should not interfere with
trade exchange, and man-made obstacles which limit economic cooperation
should be removed as soon as possible," the New China News Agency
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Qian's comments came at a gathering marking the seventh anniversary of
a plan put forth by President Jiang Zemin to reunify China and Taiwan.
The island has been governed separately since civil war on the mainland
between the Communists and Nationalists ended in 1949.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Israeli helicopter gunships fired missiles at a car in the southern
Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing a Hamas militant and seriously wounding
two others, Palestinian and Israeli sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, said the airstrike in
the Palestinian-controlled town of Khan Yunis was "a drop in the sea of
Israeli crimes," and he vowed to respond with "painful" retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian hospital sources identified the militant as Bakar Hamdan.
Israeli security sources said Hamdan was targeted for his involvement in
the killings of Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said at least two missiles hit the car Hamdan was riding in.
The two people injured were also in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has killed dozens of militants under its internationally
condemned policy of tracking and striking at people who it says have been
behind attacks on Israelis during a 16-month Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the policy is state-sponsored assassination.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ponders Sanctions on Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As Washington loses patience with Arafat, the policy
debate is over hard-line versus harder-line options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Exasperated with Yasser Arafat, the United States is considering a
raft of punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority because of
its leader's failure to end terrorism and deal with arms smugglers, U.S.
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The moves now under debate include drastic steps such as closing down
the group's Washington "embassy," or pre-statehood diplomatic office, and
suspending relations, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The deliberations mark a turning point in U.S. relations with the
Palestinian movement, which are today more strained than at any time
since the peace process began in the early 1990s, according to U.S.
officials, Arab diplomats and Mideast experts.</LD>
<TE>   But the tension is particularly ominous for Arafat because the Bush
administration holds him personally responsible for a series of setbacks
in U.S.-brokered peace efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've called on him to make a strategic decision [about his
commitment to the peace process]. But the problem from the [2000] Camp
David talks onward is that he wants to be everything to everybody in his
organization and the Arab world, so he won't do it," a senior State
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we think he's about to do or say something, we instead see
an organized attack by groups he hasn't clamped down on or Palestinian
involvement in arms smuggling. And this isn't acceptable," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The policy options under debate include cutting off talks with Arafat
but continuing informal discussions with others in the Palestinian
Authority. Another option is formally suspending the peace mission of
special envoy Anthony C. Zinni, who has made two short-lived attempts at
ending the cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst time in relations between Arafat and the United
States since 1993--or even before 1993. The administration is now
questioning whether the entire enterprise of dealing with Arafat is even
possible," said Shibley Telhami, a Brookings Institution fellow and
holder of the Anwar Sadat chair in peace and development at the
University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leader's recent handling of an incident involving the
Karine-A, a ship smuggling Iranian arms to the Gaza Strip that was
intercepted by Israel, was seen as the last straw for many in Washington,
both because Arafat allegedly lied about his government's role in the
operation and because he claimed to clamp down in ways he did not.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said he ordered the arrest of three Palestinians in the
smuggling operation, then later admitted that only one was detained
because the other two could not be found. In the end, U.S. officials
claim, none of the three was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Presented with damning evidence from Israeli intelligence, the United
States is also demanding that Arafat admit he knew about the deal and
that he arrest several figures identified as connected to the shipment.</TE>
<TE>   The Karine-A incident marked a dangerous escalation in tension, U.S.
officials say. Arafat had declared a cease-fire just before the shipment
was discovered. And the weapons, including explosives, mortars and other,
more sophisticated arms, suggested a new and direct Iranian connection
with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a full explanation of what this is all about. Then we want to
see the people involved arrested and pulled in--not just 'Let's pretend,'
" the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is also demanding that Arafat, whom Israeli forces have had
under virtual house arrest for weeks at his headquarters in the West Bank
city of Ramallah, shut down all extremist groups and arrest everyone
involved in them.</TE>
<TE>   In a reflection of how low relations have sunk, there is only a narrow
gap among U.S. policymakers as they deliberate the next step. The two
sides are divided into hard-line and harder-line camps, according to
Robert Satloff, director of the Washington Institute of Near East Policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard-liners say we have to create a situation where Arafat has no
choice but to do the right thing, so we must set high standards and
deadlines. We'll send him down a tunnel in which there is only one way
out," he said. "The harder-line approach is to consider steps toward
suspension of relations with Arafat altogether, on the basis that Arafat
is now beyond the pale. The Karine-A underscores that for the U.S. to be
party to relations with the current Palestinian leadership would bring
about a state inimical to U.S. interests."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the United States has let up its pressure on Israel
to end its targeted killings of militants and its punitive measures
against the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Thursday that President
Bush "understands the reason that Israel has taken the action that it
takes."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Militia Chief Slain in Beirut</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Lebanon government blames Israel after Elie Hobeika,
linked to the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in refugee camps, dies in
bombing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A former Lebanese militia leader linked to the massacre of hundreds
of Palestinian refugees in 1982 was killed in a car bombing in Beirut on
Thursday, leaving behind a trail of enemies and a long list of possible
suspects--including an allegation that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon was behind the hit.</LD>
<LD>   Elie Hobeika, 45, former leader of the Christian militia known as the
Lebanese Forces, allied himself with Israel after it invaded southern
Lebanon in the early 1980s and then switched allegiances to Syria a few
years later when that regime in effect took control of his war-racked
country.</LD>
<LD>   The notorious militia leader, whose maneuvering won him positions in
the Lebanese government, died in an explosion that also killed three
bodyguards. Investigators said 22 pounds of TNT packed in a nearby car
was detonated by remote control.</LD>
<TE>   Fingers were pointed at Syria, Israel and inside Lebanon itself. Some
on the streets of Beirut said they hoped that Israel was behind the
attacks--if it wasn't, they said, they fear a return to the kind of
home-grown violence that fueled a devastating 15-year civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Even as investigators were poring over the debris, the Lebanese
government pointed to Israel and Sharon. Officials, including
Syrian-backed President Emile Lahoud, suggested that Hobeika was silenced
to stop him from testifying against Sharon at a possible war crimes trial
in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was Hobeika's militia that massacred the unarmed
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, then-Israeli
Defense Minister Sharon was forced to resign because his troops were
encircling the area during the attack. An Israeli commission found that
Sharon shouldered at least indirect blame for the bloodletting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a confirmation that Israel and its agents were behind this
terrorist act," Lebanese Interior Minister Elias Murr said at a news
conference late Thursday, though he did not provide any evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Israel dismissed the allegations. "I am simply saying, from our point
of view, we have no link to this subject at all, and this is not worthy
of a comment," Sharon told reporters in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   While the Lebanese blamed Israel, there also were unconfirmed reports
that a Lebanese nationalist group may have been behind the killing. When
Hobeika switched allegiances to Syria, he won the enmity of members of
his former Christian militia, who disapproved of Damascus' puppet-master
role.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press reported that a group calling itself Lebanese for a
Free and Independent Lebanon had claimed responsibility for the killings
in a fax sent to a Western news agency's office in Cyprus. The fax called
Hobeika a "Syrian agent" and protested Syria's influence in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were the Palestinians. Many refugees in Lebanese camps
cheered Hobeika's death and suggested that perhaps a very patient
survivor had finally exacted revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wide range of theories, the talk in the government and on
the streets pointed south to Israel. The case brought by Palestinians in
Belgium involves Sharon's alleged complicity in the 1982 attacks.
Hobeika's militia, which was trained by and allied with Israel, entered
the refugee camps after its leader, President-elect Bashir Gemayel, was
assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities conducted an internal review after the massacre
drew widespread condemnation. A commission recommended in 1983 that
Sharon be removed from office after concluding that "everyone who had
anything to do with events in Lebanon should have felt apprehension about
a massacre in the camps if armed [Christian] Phalangist forces were to be
moved into them without the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] exercising
concrete and effective supervision and scrutiny in them."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon resigned but returned to office as prime minister almost 20
years later--a move that brought his hard-line approach to the
Palestinians back to the fore of Israeli politics and also refocused
attention on his alleged connection to the massacres.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's political resurrection coincided with the implementation of a
Belgian law that allows anyone anywhere to seek the prosecution of
individuals for so-called crimes against humanity in Belgian courts.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a debate within Belgium over the law's viability,
authorities there have pursued the Sharon case, and a court is scheduled
to decide in early March whether the prime minister should stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Hobeika held a news conference in July announcing his willingness to
testify in Belgium and claimed that he had documents showing his
innocence and the guilt of others. He had repeated his offer to testify
at a meeting Wednesday in Lebanon with a group of Belgian senators.</TE>
<TE>   "His readiness to testify was key to the investigation," said Chibli
Mallat, a lawyer representing the Palestinian plaintiffs. "The timing is
obvious. It is sad--those who assassinated him were clearly keen to use
violent methods as opposed to the attempt to deal with this case without
any violence involved. It's a sad setback."</TE>
<TE>   The killing of Sharon's onetime ally dominated Israeli radio and
television reports.</TE>
<TE>   Oded Granot, the Arab affairs commentator for Israeli state
television, said there are two things that can be said with certainty
about Hobeika: "He was a man who knew too much, and he was a man born to
be killed."</TE>

<DL>SKOPJE, Macedonia
</DL>
<LD>Macedonia's parliament Thursday voted 85 to 4 to approve a
long-disputed law granting broader rights to the ethnic Albanian
minority, a crucial move toward stabilizing this tense Balkan nation.</LD>
<LD>   The law was an important part of a Western-mediated peace accord that
ended an ethnic Albanian insurgency in August. The rebels surrendered
about 4,000 weapons to North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops and
agreed to disband in exchange for promises of greater constitutional
rights.</LD>
<LD>   Ethnic Albanians, who make up at least a quarter of Macedonia's 2
million population, hope that the law will bring autonomy to their areas.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Foreign Minister Slobodan Casule said passing the
self-government law was a precondition for Macedonian police to reenter
villages in northwestern Macedonia still controlled by ethnic Albanians.</TE>

<HD>A Limited Release for U.S. Resident Detained in China</HD>
<DH>Asia: The move comes less than a month before President Bush's
planned trip to Beijing. Liu Yaping's passport has yet to be returned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Less than a month before President Bush arrives for a summit here,
Chinese police have freed an ailing U.S.-based businessman who had been
detained since March, his wife said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia region, allowed
entrepreneur Liu Yaping to return to his parents' apartment there Jan.
15. But they haven't handed over the passport and identification card Liu
would need to seek medical treatment elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   "They told my husband that he would get everything back very soon,"
Liu's wife, Zhang Pei, said by phone from their home in Weston, Conn.</LD>
<TE>   Zhang said her husband suffers from a brain aneurysm and gall bladder
polyps. "He has lost like half his weight" since being detained, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that during a visit by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) to
China in August, police "released him, but later we found out it was a
false release, so this time we're still trying to determine whether it's
the same situation."</TE>
<TE>   Since Liu's detention, diplomats, human rights groups and U.S.
lawmakers have persistently lobbied the Chinese government for his
release.</TE>
<TE>   Liu was among several U.S. residents and citizens whose detentions
prompted the State Department to issue a travel advisory in April. The
notice said that ethnic Chinese who had close contacts with Taiwan or had
publicly criticized the Chinese government should assess the risk of
detention before traveling to China.</TE>
<TE>   Liu, a former government employee in Hohhot, moved to the United
States in the early 1990s with his son and wife, who is now a U.S.
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Liu returned to Hohhot several times on business on a Chinese
passport. Two years ago, he set up a company in Hohhot. He had just
started the business when police froze his bank account and detained him
on fraud and tax-evasion charges.</TE>
<TE>   Liu's supporters allege that local law enforcement deprived him of his
rights under Chinese law. Hohhot police, they charge, denied him medical
care and, on the grounds that the case involved state secrets, deprived
him of access to legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Liu's wife said he has been held more than 10 months without trial, in
violation of Chinese law.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Liu, his supporters say, were the result of a
power struggle within the Hohhot police department.</TE>
<TE>   Liu's release comes just days after a Chinese prison freed Ngawang
Choephel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar.
Authorities released Choephel and returned him to the United States on
medical parole after he served six years of an 18-year jail sentence
after being convicted of espionage.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for Bush's visit next month, diplomatic advance teams
are crisscrossing the Pacific, outlining what each side wants and can
expect to get from the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say China is seeking a commitment from the Bush
administration that it opposes independence for Taiwan, which the
mainland sees as a separatist province. Washington is likely to put human
rights, including the release of dissidents and U.S. residents, high on
its agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Hong Kong this week, the U.S. ambassador to China, Clark
T. Randt Jr., called for Liu's release. "I earnestly hope that before the
president visits Beijing in late February, I shall be able to report
additional releases by China on humanitarian and medical grounds," he
said.</TE>

<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>A Canadian follower of Falun Gong was expelled from China on
Thursday after being detained for protesting in Tiananmen Square against
the Communist country's ban on the spiritual group, a Canadian diplomat
said.</LD>
<LD>   Connie Chipkar, 61, left aboard a British Airways flight for London,
said Charles Reeves, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   Chipkar, a former teacher from Welland, Ontario, was detained
Wednesday after she sang and held out her arms in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square. She was wearing a sash that read "Falun Gong" and "SOS."</LD>
<TE>   The square is the symbolic political heart of China and the site of
frequent protests by Falun Gong supporters. Chipkar's son took part in a
demonstration there in November by 35 Western followers of the group.
They also were detained and expelled.</TE>
<TE>   Chipkar was held overnight at a Beijing hotel but wasn't arrested,
Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her actions broke the laws of the People's Republic of China on
gatherings and parades and related laws and regulations on cults," said
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Plans Vote in October</HD>
<DH>Asia: Military ruler Musharraf, who will remain president, says the
legislative elections will be free and fair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Signaling the end of more than two years of military rule in
Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf announced Thursday that legislative
elections will be held in October.</LD>
<LD>   Elections for national and provincial legislatures mean that laws will
subsequently be enacted by elected representatives rather than military
decree. Musharraf said the vote will be free, fair and impartial.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, which the president made at a human development
conference in Islamabad, complies with a Supreme Court ruling. The court
had ordered Musharraf, who took power in an October 1999 military coup,
to bring back civilian rule within three years of the date of the
takeover.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf will remain president and also commander of the military,
the dominant institution in the country. That does not violate the court
order, because the president is the head of state but a prime minister
will run the government.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has said he plans to remain in office for five years after
the new parliament takes office.</TE>
<TE>   The balloting will be held under a new electoral code announced last
week under which all of Pakistan's 140 million people, including
non-Muslims, will be allowed to vote for the same candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has also announced plans to increase the number of seats in
the national and provincial parliaments to stimulate democracy in a
country with a long history of authoritarian rule.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Raids Afghan Site, Seizes 27 Taliban Fighters</HD>
<DH>Asia: A skirmish north of Kandahar injures a Green Beret and kills
15 holdouts. Those targeted were 'not simply foot soldiers,' Rumsfeld
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. soldiers captured 27 Taliban fighters Thursday in a predawn
raid north of the Afghan city of Kandahar that left one Green Beret
injured and 15 Taliban holdouts dead, in the campaign's first hostile
action reported by the Pentagon in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The intense firefight highlighted the continued aggressive search by
U.S. special operations troops for pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda
resistance throughout Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The Army Special Forces soldier was hit in the ankle during a skirmish
that began when the U.S. troops attacked a building suspected of housing
Taliban or Al Qaeda leaders in the mountains 40 miles north of Kandahar,
the southern city that gave rise to the now-deposed Taliban regime.
Intelligence operatives had been monitoring the fighters, mostly Afghans
who probably "are not simply foot soldiers," Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said.</LD>
<TE>   Pentagon strategists continue to target groups of armed pro-Taliban
troops throughout Afghanistan, seeking to capture them alive in order to
interrogate them about the Al Qaeda network and the whereabouts of Osama
bin Laden and other fugitives, said Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   Operating alone or with Afghan or other coalition forces, U.S. troops
will "continue for some period of time" trailing dangerous, sometimes
large groups that remain largely confined to narrow, mountainous regions,
Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot more of these pockets," Rumsfeld said. "We are going
to pursue them. We are pursuing them now. We pursue them alone. We pursue
them with coalition forces. We pursue them with Afghan forces. And we're
going to keep at them until we get them."</TE>
<TE>   Tracking down the elusive Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts is likely to
keep U.S. forces in the Central Asian nation in significant numbers, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That takes presence. You can't do that from Chicago," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also suggested that another priority, helping to stabilize
the country as the interim Afghan government undertakes its six-month
tenure, is likely to keep U.S. forces in Afghanistan through at least the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We do feel--certainly the president of the United States feels and
the members of his government feel--that we want to do what is
appropriate for us to do to help them to get through what is clearly a
difficult period," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To further that aim, the Treasury Department said Thursday that it had
authorized the Federal Reserve to release about $217 million in Afghan
Central Bank assets. The assets, including $193 million in gold, had been
frozen under a 1999 order that blocked all assets of the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "These funds will now be available to help stabilize the Afghan
economy, strengthen the operations of the Central Bank and shape a better
future for the people of Afghanistan," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill
said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured American, whose name was withheld pending notification of
relatives, was taken to a nearby hospital and was in stable condition
Thursday. Soldiers who cleared the site after the raid destroyed a large
cache of weapons and ammunition, defense officials said. The captured
prisoners were moved to Kandahar for further questioning.</TE>
<TE>   The special operations soldiers work separately from the 3,600 U.S.
Army and Marine Corps troops stationed at Kandahar's airport.
Nevertheless, Army spokesman Ignatius Perez told reporters at the
airport, security there was increased after the Thursday raid.</TE>
<TE>   The last major clash between holdouts and U.S. forces came at the
airport about two weeks ago on the night the first group of detainees
from the Afghan campaign was being transported from a detention camp
there to a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to keep intelligence out of enemy hands, U.S. warplanes
Thursday dropped two precision-guided bombs on a helicopter that crashed
in Afghanistan over the weekend, killing two Marines and injuring five.
Troops usually retrieve downed planes and helicopters, but the
mountainous terrain prevented that, Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   As fighting continued in Afghanistan, warplanes struck another front.
After reports that coalition planes had been fired upon by surface-to-air
and other missiles while patrolling in the "no-fly" zone of southern
Iraq, bombers from the U.S.-led Operation Southern Watch struck radar and
other sites in Iraq on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   The last coalition strikes in Iraq hit antiaircraft artillery sites
Dec. 27. Thursday's bombing came after the latest of more than 630
incidents of Iraqi surface-to-air missile and antiaircraft artillery fire
directed against coalition pilots since December 1998, the Pentagon said.
Iraqi aircraft violated the no-fly zone more than 150 times during the
same period, defense officials said.</TE>

<HD>China Pledges More Afghan Aid</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing will add $150 million to the $4.6 million it has
already promised to its war-torn neighbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government Thursday pledged $150 million in aid to
war-ravaged Afghanistan, on top of the $4.5 billion that interim Afghan
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai won in international donations this week in
Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese President Jiang Zemin made the promise of more aid in a
meeting with Karzai, who wrapped up a two-day visit here that followed
his trip to Japan. At the Tokyo conference, China had promised $1
million, as well as $3.6 million in humanitarian assistance.</LD>
<LD>   It was not clear how the significantly expanded aid package, reported
by the official New China News Agency, would be constituted or delivered.</LD>
<TE>   As Karzai made a brisk climb up the Great Wall outside Beijing, he
told reporters that his top priorities in spending the funds will be
"security, education, health, road building."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Reconstruction Minister Mohammed Amin Farhang said that "the
international community did its duty, and now it is our turn to do what
we have to do to use this money efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Farhang said he thinks that China will resume projects it had begun in
Afghanistan but was forced to halt during the more than two decades of
war in his nation. "The Chinese have done a lot of projects in
Afghanistan," he said. "I hope that their help will be even more in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The two countries share a small border on China's western fringe. Not
long after the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Beijing sent
officials to inspect its abandoned embassy in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
The Chinese are expected to reopen the embassy soon, perhaps as early as
next month.</TE>
<TE>   The pumped-up aid package will help Beijing retain some influence over
its neighbor. The Communist government here is concerned that
Western--especially U.S.--influence in its backyard is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing also complains of problems with Islamic terrorists who it says
received training at bases in Afghanistan and elsewhere, then infiltrated
China to foment unrest and violence through a campaign of bombings,
assassinations and arson, with the goal of breaking off the western
Xinjiang region from Chinese rule.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Beijing directly linked separatist activity in Xinjiang
with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, interim Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah promised that
his country will cooperate fully with China in tracking down suspected

<HD>Question Is Answered: It's John Lindh</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is the name of the so-called American Talib?</LD>
<LD>   What to call the 20-year-old from Northern California has been a
persistent question since he was captured in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   He was born John Philip Walker Lindh, according to his father. As a
teenager, he chose to use the surname Walker, his mother's maiden name.
After graduating from high school, he moved to the Middle East to study
Islam and while there, he went by the names Suleyman al-Faris and Abdul
Hamid.</LD>
<TE>   When he was taken into custody in Afghanistan, he identified himself
to authorities as John Walker. An FBI affidavit filed in the case
identifies him that way, and the government, in its criminal complaint,
called him Walker. In public remarks about the case, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft also often refers to him as Walker.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, his chief defense attorney, James J. Brosnahan,
sought to put an end to the confusion. Hereafter, the lawyer said, his
client would be known as John Lindh.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
</DL>
<LD>Saudi officials warned Thursday that they would not allow U.S.
servicewomen to appear in public without a head-to-toe robe, and they
criticized Washington for lifting the requirement that its female
military personnel wear the garment when off base.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the Committee for the Preservation of Virtue and the
Prevention of Vice, a government agency for enforcing Islamic law, said
all women must wear the robe, or abaya, irrespective of religion,
nationality or profession.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command, issued an order
last week saying the abaya is no longer required for U.S. servicewomen in
Saudi Arabia "but is strongly encouraged." The requirement dates from the
1990-91 Gulf War, when U.S. forces were first stationed in Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<TE>   A Saudi military official on Thursday criticized Franks' move, saying
the United States should have consulted the kingdom beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. decision is a violation of Saudi sovereignty and of Islamic
law, the official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Embassy official in Riyadh declined to comment. A U.S. Army
spokesman in Saudi Arabia referred calls to Central Command headquarters
in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi women appear in public fully veiled, showing only their eyes,
hands and feet. Foreign women in the kingdom usually wear abayas at
malls, markets and other public places in accordance with religious
custom.</TE>

<HD>World Religious Leaders Join Pope in a Peace Prayer</HD>
<DH>Italy: About 200 clerics gather to denounce violence and pledge
tolerance. The event was organized as a response to the Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ASSISI, Italy
</DL>
<LD>Leaders of Islam, Christianity, Judaism and the world's other major
faiths joined Pope John Paul II here Thursday to pray for peace and
condemn "every recourse to violence and war in the name of God or
religion."</LD>
<LD>   The solemn, daylong retreat--called by the pope to answer last year's
terrorist attack on the United States and its aftermath--brought together
about 200 leaders of 12 religions for what is believed to have been the
most broadly representative encounter of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   Huddled in a tented arena on a cold, drizzly day, the polyglot
assembly of imams, patriarchs, monks, cardinals and rabbis lighted
candles and found common ground against what the Roman Catholic pontiff
called "the dark clouds of terrorism, hatred and armed conflict that . .
. have grown particularly ominous on humanity's horizon."</LD>
<TE>   Their 10-point communal pledge for peace avoided mention of the Sept.
11 attacks or the U.S. counterstrikes against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network and Afghanistan's Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the clerics called for attacking the root causes of
terrorism, siding with the poor and the helpless and urging leaders to
create "a world of solidarity and peace based on justice."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican-drafted appeal, read one point at a time by a succession
of clerics speaking different languages, committed the world's religions
to preach mutual tolerance and address their differences through "frank
and patient" dialogue. They pledged to forgive one another for "errors
and prejudices" that have fueled violence and terrorism, which they
called "incompatible with the authentic spirit of religion."</TE>
<TE>   "Violence never again! War never again! Terrorism never again!" John
Paul declared in a strong voice, reading the final section to the
spirited applause of more than 2,000 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   The 81-year-old pope met fellow clerics at the Vatican and rode with
them on the 110-mile trip to this hill town aboard a special seven-car
train provided by the Italian government. Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi met the train at Assisi and attended the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   The Day of Prayer for World Peace took place outside the Basilica of
St. Francis, the burial site of the 13th century Catholic pacifist. The
event was bigger than two previous worldwide religious gatherings
convened here by John Paul, who drew plaudits Thursday for pursuing
interfaith understanding more actively than any papal predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "Only you, John Paul, could make this happen," said Rabbi Israel
Singer, secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress, greeting the pope
with a salute.</TE>
<TE>   Along with about 50 Vatican and Catholic VIPs came an equal number of
other Christian delegates. More than 100 non-Christians came--Jews,
Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Shintoists, Confucianists,
Zoroastrians, Jainists, African animists and leaders of the Tenrikyo
faith-healing sect.</TE>
<TE>   They flanked the white-clad pontiff on the arena's stage in an amazing
array of robes and headgear that ranged from turbans and skullcaps to
loose-fitting hoods.</TE>
<TE>   Their speeches offered diverse inspirations for a common message. Didi
Talwalkar, one of just two female speakers, cited her Hindu belief in the
"divine essence" of every human being. Amadou Gasseto, high priest of the
Avelekete Vodou animist faith, cited a "key law of nature" that peace
brings abundant crops and multiplied herds.</TE>
<TE>   "The question before us is: Where is our ultimate loyalty?" said
Ishmael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. "How
can we bear witness first and foremost to a God who loves the whole
world, rather than to one who is bound to certain national, cultural or
political allegiances?"</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, John Paul convened a groundbreaking interfaith gathering here
to protest the nuclear arms race and returned in 1993 to lead a similar
appeal against ethnic bloodshed in the Balkans. Catholic conservatives
accused him of "syncretism"--the blending of different religions, as if
all were of equal value--but their criticism has faded.</TE>
<TE>   As at those gatherings, the pope took pains Thursday to stress that
religions were joining behind a goal but praying separately, respecting
their differences. Separate prayer services took place at midday, after a
round of speeches and before the peace pledge. Christians prayed together
in the lower basilica, while non-Christian groups gathered in separate
rooms of a convent from which crosses had been removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a simple fact that other religions exist, and we have to take
note of that," Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican's chief theologian
and a critic of the 1986 gathering, said on the train. He welcomed
Thursday's meeting as "a strong signal for peace" but added, "I don't
think we can expect a politically concrete result."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul called Thursday's gathering out of fear that the Sept. 11
attacks would doom his bridge-building between Christians and Muslims.
Aides say he is tormented by the attacks and distressed by calls from Bin
Laden, the accused mastermind, for an Islamic holy war against the West.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by reporters whether Bin Laden is a good Muslim, Mahmoud Hammad
Ibrahim Sheweitah of Italy's Islamic delegation said: "We don't know. We
know about him only from television."</TE>
<TE>   Just one speaker, Singer, acknowledged that members of his faith have
used religious teaching as a guide for battling enemies. Perhaps because
no one else was so forthcoming, the American Jewish leader skipped that
part of his prepared speech but said the audience could read it in the
text that had been distributed.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with an impassioned plea for the Middle East: "Peace
shouldn't be left to generals; it's too important. . . . You should tell
your people, and we should tell ours--all of us--to question whether land
or places are more important than people's lives. And until we learn to
do that, there will be no peace."</TE>

<HD>Suspected Terrorist Leader Is Questioned in Indonesia</HD>
<DH>Asia: Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir denies having ties to Al
Qaeda. But he praises Bin Laden and accuses the U.S. of being the
aggressor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARI SUDARSONO</AU>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>A Muslim cleric accused of heading a Southeast Asian terrorist
network was called in to police headquarters here Thursday to explain his
activities and used the occasion to applaud Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Mobbed by reporters as he arrived at the police station, the
white-robed Abu Bakar Bashir denied allegations that he is affiliated
with Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and accused the United States of being
the world's real terrorist.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement to the media, the 63-year-old Indonesian called Bin
Laden "a true Muslim fighter" and said Al Qaeda had been active in
promoting Muslims' rights.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not a member of Al Qaeda," he said. "However, I really praise
the fight of Osama bin Laden, who has dared to represent the Islamic
world to combat the arrogance of the United States terrorists and its
allies."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, who spent four years in custody in the early 1980s for alleged
anti-government activity, has been named by Singapore and Malaysia as a
top leader of a regional terrorist network called Jemaah Islamiah that
allegedly planned to attack American targets in Singapore, including the
U.S. Embassy and sailors on leave.</TE>
<TE>   Since December, Singapore has arrested 13 alleged members of the group
while Malaysia has detained 22 and the Philippines five. During
interrogation, some of the Singapore detainees identified Bashir as the
overall leader of the group, authorities said. Two other Indonesian
clerics also have been named as leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesian government has moved cautiously, however, apparently
fearful of a backlash if it arrested hard-line Muslims in the politically
volatile country, which has the world's largest Muslim population.</TE>
<TE>   The government's strongest action against Jemaah Islamiah has been to
ask Bashir to come to Jakarta, the capital, from his home in Central Java
province and meet with federal police investigators. He spent much of
Thursday answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is a prominent cleric in the Islamist heartland of Central
Java. He founded an Islamic school in the mid-1970s and was later
targeted by the government of former dictator Suharto. After his release
from custody, Bashir lived in self-imposed exile in Malaysia for 14
years, returning to Indonesia after Suharto was ousted in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is represented by 20 attorneys, although only half a dozen went
with him to the police station Thursday. One lawyer said much of the
police questioning focused on his activities during his years in
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence collected by the Singaporean authorities indicates that the
nucleus of Jemaah Islamiah was formed more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times last week, Bashir said Jemaah Islamiah
is merely a religious study group, not a terrorist organization. He said
he had not been to Singapore or Malaysia in more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement Thursday, Bashir charged that the United States was
the world's leading violator of human rights and that it is trying to
suppress Islam around the world. Members of Al Qaeda, he said, have not
been convicted by an international tribunal, yet the United States has
killed many of the group's members.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and its allies "have slaughtered innocent people in
Afghanistan and another million Muslims in other Islamic countries," he
said. He did not specify where besides Afghanistan the alleged slaughter
took place.</TE>
<TE>   He accused the Western media of spreading pro-U.S. propaganda and
charged that the United States had helped destroy the Indonesian economy
by supporting the independence of East Timor.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the security apparatus, Indonesian police and Indonesian
government, and also the elites of this country, will not be willing to
let themselves become the U.S. terrorists' slave, who will just obey and
follow the command of the U.S. terrorists," he said.</TE>

<HD>A New News Source in Kabul</HD>
<DH>Media: Afghanistan's first international paper begins publishing,
with articles in Dari, Pashto, English and French.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>This country's first international newspaper, Kabul Weekly, put out
its inaugural edition Thursday with 10 pages of articles in the local
languages Dari and Pashto as well as English and French.</LD>
<LD>   Financed by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, or UNESCO, it revived an earlier Kabul Weekly that
published from 1993 until 1996, when the government of the time closed it
down.</LD>
<LD>   "Second Coming, Year One, Issue Number 1" it said on the front page,
over articles in English about this week's Tokyo donors' conference,
rising opium output, the training of female teachers and the theater in
Kabul.</LD>
<TE>   Articles in local languages focused on how Kabul residents view the
foreign security forces pouring into the capital and rising crime in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-page weekly actually has two front pages. One, in English,
opens from the right. Turn the paper over, and there is another one in
Dari, opening from the left, because Afghan languages are written from
right to left.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to show the way toward democracy, human rights and women's
rights," said Editor Fahim Dashty, who was on the staff of the original
Kabul Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   UNESCO has put up five months of initial funding for the weekly while
the Paris-based press watchdog group Reporters Without Borders has sent
computers, printers and other equipment for the six journalists producing
the weekly. According to Dashty, 2,500 copies were printed and the first
edition was being given away for free.</TE>
<TE>   Dashty was an associate of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah
Masoud, who was assassinated by two suicide bombers Sept. 9. Dashty was
wounded in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "This is meant to encourage independent media in Afghanistan," said
Eric Davin, head of the French nongovernmental organization AINA, which
helped the Kabul Weekly staff get its project off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Weekly used to appear only in Dari and Pashto. But now that the
Taliban regime has been ousted, the editors expect an influx of
foreigners, Dashty said. So they added three pages in English and French
to the new edition.</TE>
<TE>   AINA has also set up a media center to help to train Afghan
journalists in print, video and photographic journalism.</TE>
<TE>   The table outside the media center offering free copies of Kabul
Weekly was a rare sight in the capital, where only two other publications
are printed regularly.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>First Lady Laura Bush swiftly dispensed with the eerie memory of
her Senate debut Thursday and delved into the dynamics of early childhood
learning.</LD>
<LD>   "The years between diapers and the first backpacks" will determine
whether a child will succeed in school and make it to college, Bush told
a half-dozen members of the Senate Education Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing was a return engagement for Bush. Her scheduled testimony
in the same Capitol Hill caucus room on Sept. 11 was abruptly called off,
and Secret Service agents rushed her to a secret bunker instead.</LD>
<TE>   The first lady discussed her experiences as a mother, grade-school
teacher and librarian. She recalled playing sing-songy word games with
her twin baby girls and said all parents need to know that such
activities in infancy are critical to developing children's reading and
language skills.</TE>

<HD>Leading Afghan Governor Vows Unity</HD>
<DH>Politics: At large rally, Kandahar official pledges to cooperate
with Kabul, easing fears that he might challenge the interim federal
government.</DH>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Easing concerns about a possible challenge to central government
rule, the leading political force in southern Afghanistan told a large
rally here Thursday that he will work to resolve regional differences
peacefully and in close consultation with leaders in Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   At the first major public event in the birthplace of the Taliban since
the regime's demise last month, Kandahar provincial Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai
made a very public pledge of loyalty to interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   His remarks were made to several thousand residents who had crowded
their way into Kandahar's main sports stadium for a series of rousing
political speeches, mainly in support of national unity and the return of
the former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, as a symbol of that unity.</LD>
<TE>   Shirzai and Karzai joined forces against the Taliban in the battle to
capture Kandahar late last year, but they were generally viewed as uneasy
allies, with both men maneuvering for U.S. support in the weeks that
followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since Karzai's appointment as interim prime minister, there has been
uncertainty about how Shirzai would respond. On Thursday, he appeared
eager to erase worries that he is trying to consolidate his power.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always ready to accept the decisions of Hamid Karzai's
government on all issues," he told the crowd. He also dismissed as
"propaganda" reports that he is preparing to dispatch a force of 20,000
troops west to take on Ismail Khan, the leader in Herat province,
following allegations that ethnic Pushtuns in the area are being
harassed.</TE>
<TE>   Khan is an ethnic Tajik; Kandahar's population is mainly ethnic
Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't take a single step against anyone without our [national]
leader's decision," Shirzai told the crowd. "We'll talk with Ismail Khan
to solve the problem of Pushtun treatment. We have come to power for
peace, not to fight."</TE>
<TE>   After the rally, Shirzai told reporters that he had spoken by
telephone to Khan four times about reports of Pushtun harassment in Herat
and that he had contacted officials in Kabul, the capital, about the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai's comments came as a welcome counterpoint to reports of heavy
fighting this week in the northern province of Kunduz, where troops loyal
to ethnic Uzbek commander Abdul Rashid Dostum are said to have wrested
one district from forces loyal to Burhanuddin Rabbani, the former Afghan
president and head of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. Dostum was
recently named deputy defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been reports of clashes between rival groups in
eastern Paktia province.</TE>
<TE>   The rally was the brainchild of eight wealthy expatriates from
Kandahar who now live in the United States and Europe. One of the
sponsors, a San Francisco day trader named Ayub Rafiqi, said the eight
decided to sponsor the rally as a way to reinforce their belief that a
loya jirga, or grand council, under the auspices of the former king would
give Afghanistan the best chance of maintaining unity.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided this was an important way to get this message out," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver Faces Kidnapping Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: More than a dozen schoolchildren from Pennsylvania end up in
Maryland, where a man is arrested after surrendering to police.</DH>

<DL>LANHAM, MD.
</DL>
<LD>A school bus driver carrying a loaded semiautomatic rifle took 13
Pennsylvania children on a bizarre, 160-mile trip Thursday before turning
himself in to police in Maryland. None of the children was harmed.</LD>
<LD>   Otto Nuss, 62, is scheduled to be arraigned today on federal
kidnapping charges, according to FBI officials. But apart from the driver
telling the children he wanted to show them Washington, officials said
they were unsure of a motive.</LD>
<LD>   All of the children, ranging in age from 7 to 15, "appear to be in
very good spirits," said Peter Gulotta, an FBI agent in Baltimore, noting
that the driver even stopped along the way to feed the kids.</LD>
<TE>   "But they have had psychological counseling provided by local
authorities here. And I'm sure some of the children were traumatized by
being taken from their homes and showing up near Washington, D.C. This
wasn't a scheduled trip."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 parents and siblings were reunited with the children Thursday
evening in Maryland. They had traveled from Pennsylvania in a yellow
school bus, arriving about five hours after Nuss turned himself in. They
prayed together as a group, were briefed by an FBI agent and had pizza
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "The children seemed not to be afraid," said Cpl. Robert Clark of the
Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland. "They were unsure
exactly what was going on--they seemed to think they were on a field
trip."</TE>
<TE>State Police, FBI Brought In</TE>
<TE>   The odyssey began shortly before 8 a.m., when an Oley Valley School
District bus failed to deliver students to Berks Christian School in
Birdsboro, Pa., a rural enclave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
Nuss, who has worked for Quigley Bus Service Co. since September, had
picked up the students from a nearby high school. He normally would have
completed the daily run to Birdsboro in 15 minutes, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   When he failed to show up by 9 a.m., school administrators tried
unsuccessfully to reach him on his two-way radio. At that point, local
and state police, aided by FBI agents, began an intensive search of the
area in rain and fog. Frantic parents gathered at police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The disappearance of Oley Valley School District Bus 22 quickly became
a national news story, with a flurry of bulletins on network and cable TV
news shows. Yet there was no trace of the bus for six hours, until the
vehicle pulled into a shopping center in Lanham near the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss got off the bus at 2 p.m. and approached an off-duty Prince
George's County police officer in a Family Dollar store, Gulotta said.
"He told the officer he had some kids on the bus from Oley, Pa., and he
had brought them to see Washington, D.C. He wanted the officer to know
that the children's parents should know that the children were OK,"
Gulotta said.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Milton Chabla began walking back to the bus with Nuss, but
when the driver told him there was a loaded gun in the vehicle, Chabla
arrested Nuss, putting him in handcuffs, according to Diane Richardson, a
public information officer for the county police. Chabla then boarded the
bus filled with children and found a loaded M1 Springfield rifle covered
by a coat and propped up behind the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   Other officers rushed to the scene and quickly determined that the
children were unharmed. Authorities notified police in Oley, and parents
boarded a bus several hours later to be reunited with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "This began as every parent's worst nightmare," Oley Police Chief
George Endy said. "And it ended with parents expressing elation, when
they finally learned their children were safe. You can imagine how they
felt."</TE>
<TE>   It was harder figuring out Nuss' motives.</TE>
<TE>   He had passed a basic background check before being allowed to drive a
school bus, and bus company officials had to screen him to make sure he
had no criminal record or record of child abuse before hiring him, Endy
said. Officials at Oley Valley School District, which contracted with the
bus company, remembered Nuss as a quiet man who seemed to genuinely enjoy
schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>News a Surprise to Neighbors</TE>
<TE>   Quigley Bus Service officials referred all inquiries to police, and
calls to Nuss' home in nearby Boyertown, Pa., seeking comment were not
returned. Neighbors told CNN that Nuss had lived with his mother in a
farmhouse for five years before moving to Boyertown. They, too, professed
surprise at his actions, remembering him as a low-key, private person who
never caused trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Before starting work last fall as a driver, Nuss worked at a local pie
company and held several other day laborer jobs, Endy said.</TE>
<TE>   Gulotta said Nuss was jailed in nearby Montgomery County Detention
Center and will be arraigned on kidnapping charges today in Prince
George's County. His case will be prosecuted by the U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia, but FBI agents said it was unclear when he would be
transferred.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Berks Christian School were visibly shaken by the day's
events, and said the school was plunged into a state of shock as the
vigil unfolded. As administrators called parents, "some were frantic,"
administrator Robert Becker said. "Making those calls is very, very
hard."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he said, "We all bonded together. We had a school-wide
prayer service, knowing that Christ is always with us and has a plan."
Still, Becker added: "I'm furious at what happened here today. I just
have no idea what was going on in the mind of the person who did this."</TE>

<HD>Federal Health Survey Finds Racial Gaps</HD>
<DH>Study: Disparities between whites and minorities narrow but persist
in many cases, researchers report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite a narrowing of the gap between the health of whites and
minority groups, "substantial" differences persist, according to a
federal study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1990, Americans overall have grown healthier, said the report
released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracked
health matters ranging from prenatal care to suicide rates from 1990 to
1998.</LD>
<LD>   But minorities, in many cases, did not keep pace with the improvements
enjoyed by white Americans.</LD>
<TE>   A related study also released Thursday showed that death rates for
lung, colon, rectal, breast and prostate cancers decreased during the
1990s, but gains were not shared equally among racial groups or between
men and women.</TE>
<TE>   The overall declines in cancer death rates were attributed to fewer
smokers, earlier detection, improved nutrition and more effective
treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said they believed that if those factors could be improved
for all groups, "more than half of cancer deaths could be prevented and
most racial and ethnic disparities in cancer death rates could be
eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   Gaps between the races when it comes to disease and death have long
concerned public health officials, many of whom believe access to quality
health care plays a large role in the disparities. And after a dip in
uninsured Americans during the boom years of the late 1990s, rising
unemployment and a reduction in employee benefits have recently boosted
the number of Americans without health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials had set ambitious goals to improve Americans'
health and greatly reduce the disparities between racial groups during
the 1990s under an initiative called "Healthy People 2000."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's report card showed mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that all but one of 17 "health indicators" had
improved from 1990 to 1998. Only the overall percentage of low-weight
babies climbed during that period--from 7% to 7.6%--despite special
efforts to target Latino and black women for improvement, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly every category, minority groups continued to show higher
rates of disease and death, a fact that "shows how far we still have to
go" to "eliminate disparities in health among all population groups by
2010," said Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   To cite just a few of the differences: Non-Latino black Americans were
eight times more likely than whites to contract tuberculosis and 10 times
more likely to be the victim of a homicide. That's even after the
tuberculosis rate for blacks dropped 50% and the homicide rate 34% during
the reporting period.</TE>
<TE>   Top federal health officials, however, noted that large gains were
made in areas where specific communities had been singled out for care.
For example, federal programs aimed at reducing the rate of syphilis in
black and Latino communities helped contribute to cutting the rate of the
disease in those communities by nearly 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, director of the Atlanta-based CDC, called the
reduction "a clear lesson for public health" that such efforts should be
"targeted and tailored to the needs of specific groups."</TE>
<TE>   But even where dramatic strides had been made, syphilis still occurs
dramatically more often in some minority populations. Blacks, for
instance, remain 34 times more likely to contract syphilis than whites.
Latinos are three times more likely to get the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Minorities also made far less progress in some areas where white
Americans reported significant gains. For instance, while the death rate
for breast cancer in white women dropped 19% over the course of the
study, the death rate for black women dropped 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Prenatal care is another area where stark differences remain.</TE>
<TE>   While 12% of white women in 1998 received no prenatal care during the
first three months of pregnancy--down from 16.7% in 1990--pregnant
minority women were far less likely to see a doctor early on.</TE>
<TE>   Although the figures represent significant reductions from the early
years of the study, nearly 27% of black women, nearly 26% of Latino women
and more than 30% of American Indians or Alaska natives still got no
prenatal care for the first three months of pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed about 17% of Asian women did not receive care in the
first trimester, down from nearly 25% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   And in a few areas--notably motor vehicle crash deaths, work-related
injuries and deaths, and suicide rates--the gap between rates reported by
whites and minorities increased by more than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing Surgeon General David Satcher said that in "many ways," the
study is good news for the health of all Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he said, "our work isn't done until all infants have the same
chance to thrive, all mothers have equal access to prenatal care and all
Americans are equally protected from cancer, heart disease and stroke."</TE>

<LD>Numbering freeway exits--A story in the Jan. 16 California section
about a plan to number state freeway exits included two errors: One of
the two Chapman Avenue exits on the Orange Freeway is in the city of
Orange, not Anaheim, as the story stated. The El Camino Real, Camino de

<HD>Clinton Backs Bush on Mideast</HD>
<DH>Policy: The former president defends the U.S. position at forum.
Critics say the approach is tilted in Israel's favor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton supported President Bush's handling of the
Israeli-Palestinian crisis and critiqued his own foreign policy in an
impromptu debate with panelists at a conference here Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Edging back into a public role, Clinton defended the broad thrust of
U.S. policy in the Middle East under his and Bush's administrations. But
Clinton also said he believed he had not done enough in office to push
Arab states toward democracy.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the most difficult things for us is to find a way to both work
with countries with whom we have common interests and continue to advance
democracy" in those nations, he said. "I didn't do as good a job at that
as I should have, but I couldn't figure out how to do it."</LD>
<TE>   Clinton disputed repeated charges made during the session that Bush
has given Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon an unrestricted green light
for military action in response to violence by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "It's . . . not fair to say President Bush has not done anything to
try to restrain excessive behavior by the Israeli government," Clinton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Clinton seemed to gently separate himself from his successor by
suggesting that Anthony C. Zinni, Bush's special envoy to the Mideast,
should be more active in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Gen. Zinni ought to go out there to stay; both sides seem to
like him and they have confidence in him, and I hope he will," Clinton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton made his comments at a daylong session on America and Islam
that brought together academics, diplomats and other experts--but no
major officials from his administration--for a high-minded, at times
abstract, seminar that saw panelists stress Arab grievances against the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The conference, at New York University, was the first sponsored by the
William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation, and it came a day after the
former president returned from a weeklong trip to the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel. Clinton established the
foundation to promote causes he hopes to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton made his most extensive comments after several panelists
argued that anti-American sentiment in Muslim countries was rooted not in
cultural hostility toward the United States but opposition to U.S.
foreign policy, particularly toward Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no wave of anti-Americanism" in the Arab world, insisted
Ahmed Kamal Aboulmagd, a law professor at Cairo University. "People love
the U.S. in the Arab-Muslim world; but this love is not being
reciprocated."</TE>
<TE>   Raghida Dergham, a senior correspondent at the London-based pan-Arab
Al Hayat newspaper, said anti-American sentiment was grounded in "the
many imperfections of [U.S.] foreign policy," especially regarding the
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton diplomatically but unequivocally rejected many of those
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to charges that the U.S. had not done enough to pressure
Israel toward peace, Clinton noted that it was the Palestinians who
rejected the peace accord he tried to broker in his administration's
final months. And it was the rejection of that agreement, Clinton argued,
that brought Sharon's hard-line government to power.</TE>
<TE>   "You may agree the Palestinians were right to say no," Clinton said.
"But there are consequences to all decisions. And the consequence of
their saying no was the election of Mr. Sharon, because . . . [Israelis]
thought the peace process was dead. . . . And now we are off to the
races."</TE>
<TE>   In his opening remarks, Clinton praised Bush's management of the war
in Afghanistan. But he also advised that to lastingly reduce the threat
of terror, developed countries must expand their efforts to promote
growth in the Arab world--while also pushing Arab countries to pursue
internal reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Building the world we want . . . will require much more of us than a
strategy rooted in military and law enforcement efforts, no matter how
successful they are," Clinton said.</TE>

<LD>Former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger has backed

Holocaust survivors for unpaid life insurance claims after negotiators

<LD>   The European insurance firms and Jewish groups participating in the
talks have been at odds over a number of issues. The friction came to a

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>School officials in the nation's capital expect to send thousands
of students home today to force compliance with a District of Columbia
immunization law.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just begging the parents to do what needs to be done," School
Board President Peggy Cooper Cafritz said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At 143 schools across the city, administrators were instructed to
compile lists of students who could not provide complete vaccination
records.</LD>
<TE>   Principals plan to call parents of those children and send them home
with 10 days' worth of course work and a list of locations where shots
can be obtained free of charge.</TE>
<TE>   "We are starting with the children because many of the health problems
in the district are absolutely preventable," Cafritz said.</TE>
<TE>   Local ordinances require that students be properly immunized against
diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus
influenza, hepatitis B, pneumococcal pneumonia and chickenpox.</TE>
<TE>   School officials began the push for immunization at the beginning of
the current school year after determining that shot records dating to
1993 were missing or incomplete for more than two-thirds of the 69,000
students enrolled in city schools.</TE>

<HD>Pilots at American Urge Airbus Jet Groundings</HD>
<DH>Safety: Visual inspections ordered by the FAA on A300 airliners
after the crash of Flight 587 in N.Y. are called inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several dozen American Airlines pilots have asked the airline to
ground 34 Airbus jetliners like the one that crashed in New York after
its tail broke off.</LD>
<LD>   The pilots contend that the visual inspections ordered after the crash
by the Federal Aviation Administration are inadequate to determine
whether the A300 airliners are safe.</LD>
<LD>   "Until a definitive cause for the crash of Flight 587 can be
determined, along with ways to prevent a similar occurrence, and/or a
definitive test can be developed to truly check the vertical stabilizers
of our remaining 34 A300s, [we] recommend that American Airlines fleet of
A300s be grounded," the pilots said in an e-mail that they planned to
forward to airline officials.</LD>
<TE>   But the Allied Pilots Assn., the union representing most of the
airline's 11,000 pilots, said Thursday that it has seen no reason to
ground the planes. Neither has the airline, the FAA, the National
Transportation Safety Board or Airbus Industrie, the company that built
the jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 587 crashed Nov. 12 when its nonmetallic, composite tail
snapped off moments after the twin-engine jumbo jet lifted off from New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. All 260 aboard the plane
and five people on the ground were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Questions arose immediately about the design of the vertical tail fin
and its carbon-fiber laminate material.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators said last week that several layers of the
laminate had peeled apart, but it was not known whether that delamination
occurred before or during the crash. The tail had a delamination flaw
that was fixed before the plane was put into service.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 2,400 Airbus jetliners with similar tails being flown
by 150 carriers around the world. If American decides to ground its
planes, other airlines might follow suit, creating a crisis at Airbus and
snarling international air transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "Grounding 34 wide-body airliners is nothing to take lightly," the
e-mail said. "Our company would surely feel the loss of revenue; Airbus
Industrie has already hinted that such a recommendation by American would
likely reverberate."</TE>
<TE>   But American said Thursday that it will keep its planes in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in the examination of the Airbus fleet, or in the tests
conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, by American
Airlines or by other Airbus operators suggests that there is a need to
ground this fleet," the Dallas-based carrier said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots union agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not advocating a grounding of that fleet," Greg Overman, a
spokesman for the pilots association, said Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus reacted sharply to the pilots' request.</TE>
<TE>   "Airbus looks at this as a small group of people who are expressing an
opinion, and that opinion is not based on anything more than opinion--it
is not based on fact," spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot union officials said the e-mail was a rare, grass-roots effort
that was not endorsed by the union.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not seen anything like this in my 12 years with the airline,"
said Robert Sproc, vice chairman of the union's Miami local and an
American first officer, flying DC-10s. Sproc said he has not signed the
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Frazer, an A300 captain for American and chairman of the Miami
local, said pilots are concerned about the plane, but, like Sproc, he
took no position on whether the A300 should be grounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been on that airplane as long as American has owned it and I
consider it a good airplane, quite airworthy and quite strong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus uses ultrasound to inspect composite materials before jetliners
leave the factory.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus officials said their own testing has shown that visual
inspection is more than adequate for routine maintenance checks because
damage that is not visible to the naked eye does not grow, and will not
compromise the structural integrity of the tail fin.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB is still looking at several possible explanations for the
Nov. 12 crash, including design flaws, structural problems, mechanical
issues and pilot error.</TE>

<HD>Sexual Abuse Cases Change Archdiocese Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law broke from long-standing church policy
Thursday and said he will now require clergy and officials of the
Archdiocese of Boston to report to authorities even past allegations of
sexual abuse by priests.</LD>
<LD>   Law also named a panel of medical experts and educators to look at the
archdiocese's policy on dealing with victims and preventing sexual abuse
of children.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a tall order and what I am sharing with you now is the
beginning of a process, the beginning of a journey," Law said, as he
again apologized to those victimized by priests.</LD>
<TE>   Law had announced this month that clergy and archdiocesan officials
would be required from now on to report allegations of sexual abuse to
authorities, not just to church officials, as the Vatican had ordered.
His policy, however, was not retroactive, meaning it did not apply to
past allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Law has said anything learned through confession or spiritual
counseling would not be revealed. He gave no indication whether that
would be changed.</TE>
<TE>   "If carried out, it seems to be an honest and forthright effort to
deal with a specific problem," said Tom Fox, publisher of the National
Catholic Reporter. "The larger question is, what is it within the
priesthood that's creating a problem that's allowing these problems to
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Law's announcement came at the close of a two-day archdiocese meeting
with 500 priests, and the same day 10,000 pages were released detailing
how Catholic leaders continued to support the former priest, John
Geoghan--and transferred him from parish to parish--even after warnings
from doctors and allegations of sexual abuse of children.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan, who has been accused of molesting 130 youngsters, was
convicted last week of fondling a 10-year-old boy in a swimming pool and
faces two more criminal trials. He is also named in 84 lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation under consideration by state lawmakers would require
clergy to report evidence of sexual abuse of children to the Department
of Social Services, as doctors, teachers and social workers are required
to do.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers released Thursday include transcripts of depositions
that show how even as colleagues became aware of accusations against
Geoghan, they failed to notify authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan, 66, was defrocked in 1998. More than 130 people have alleged
that Geoghan fondled or raped them between 1962 and 1995. Law has said he
knew about Geoghan's problems in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The papers show praise from Law for Geoghan's "effective life of
ministry, sadly impaired by illness," and little mention of the alleged
victims.</TE>

<HD>Texas Mother Pleads Guilty to Imprisoning Daughter in Closet</HD>

<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>A mother accused of starving her 8-year-old daughter and locking
the girl in a dark, lice-infested closet for months at a time pleaded
guilty Thursday to causing serious bodily injury to a child.</LD>
<LD>   The charges against Barbara Atkinson, 30, carried five years to life
in prison. The sentencing phase began in the afternoon and will continue
today.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise plea came on the third day of her trial, shortly after
arguments about whether some of the girl's five siblings would testify.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the girl weighed 25 pounds--the size of a
2-year-old--and was nearly dead when she was found last summer. They
showed the jury photos of the girl with a bloated stomach, bony limbs and
sunken eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The girl suffered brain atrophy, her muscles were wasting away and she
was so malnourished her body could no longer metabolize food, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   State workers said the girl is now in the care of a foster family, has
gained weight and is enrolled in kindergarten.</TE>

<HD>With the Theater or PACs, Texans Saw Kenneth Lay as 'On Top of the
World'</HD>
<DH>Influence: The former Enron chief 'was a guy with swagger and loot
who bought his way into whatever needed buying.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>For all his clout in Washington, Kenneth L. Lay's greatest
influence was back home in Texas where the mirror-sheathed Enron
headquarters building glimmers above the Houston skyline.</LD>
<LD>   Operating here in his home base, Lay--who resigned Wednesday night as
chairman of the once high-flying energy trading company he founded--was a
kingmaker who could create or crush political careers, spearhead
professional sports stadium drives, finance youth clubs and endow theater
troupes.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a man on top of the world. It was well known that if you
needed something done you went to Ken Lay," recalled Felix Fraga, a
former Houston city councilman who has known Lay more than 30 years. "He
could have run for mayor, governor, or done anything he wanted."</LD>
<TE>   As part of President Bush's celebrated "pioneers" club, Lay and his
wife, Linda, donated more than $145,000 to the national Republican Party
and the Bush campaign. The Lays also contributed $100,000 to the Bush
inaugural gala and $10,000 to the election recount fund.</TE>
<TE>   But in Texas, where his money was less diluted, state Ethics
Commission records show Lay gave $55,000 to one state Senate campaign
alone. Other large contributions graced the coffers of Gov. Rick Perry,
Atty. Gen. John Cornyn and Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown, for whom Lay
sponsored a $50,000 fund-raiser Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a sign that Enron fortunes were already on a slide, Brown
campaign finance director Sue Walden said Lay failed to show up for the
fund-raiser and never sent a check.</TE>
<TE>Always the Go-To Guy</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Texas officeholders ranging from Houston City Council
members to state railroad commissioners benefited from Lay's political
largess.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Lay was a guy with swagger and loot who bought his way into
whatever needed buying," said Texas populist politician and commentator
Jim Hightower. "He had this aura of being bulletproof, a corporate
superstar who was real connected to the Bushes."</TE>
<TE>   After Lay's spectacular fall from power and grace, the extent of Lay's
and Enron's insertion into Texas government only now is surfacing.</TE>
<TE>   The first casualty was Texas Public Utilities Commission chairman Max
Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive Lay helped get appointed as the
state's chief utility regulator. Yzaguirre, tainted by his Enron
connections, resigned his post Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Others caught in the backwash of the Enron collapse are Perry, who
received a $25,000 contribution from Lay the day after he appointed
Yzaguirre to direct the PUC; Cornyn, a U.S. Senate candidate who reversed
an earlier position and recused himself from the state Enron
investigation because of donations he received from Lay and Enron; and
Texas elected Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owens, whose appointment by
Bush to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals now is in jeopardy because
of Enron contributions she received beginning in 1995 and decisions she
made favoring the company.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, Lay
displayed a particular genius for picking out politicians on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "These were investments about where these guys were going, not
necessarily where they were at the time," Stein said. "Ken Lay was a big
supporter of Bush probably before Bush himself knew he was running for
president."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Austin-based watchdog group Texans for Public
Justice, the Lays personally donated $122,000 to Bush's two gubernatorial
campaigns. Similarly, Lay was an early backer of Cornyn, even before the
Republican attorney general announced his candidacy for the seat to be
vacated by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring after this year's
elections.</TE>
<TE>Payroll Deductions to the Company PAC</TE>
<TE>   Gramm, whose economist wife served as a paid member of the Enron board
of directors, is caught up in the vortex because of the tens of thousands
of dollars he received in contributions from Enron and Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's system for political contributions operated on two fronts.
Employees were encouraged to give money to candidates believed to be
supportive of company issues, particularly those involving market
deregulation central to the energy trading business.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, top executives were tapped for what amounted to a tithe
to the Enron Political Action Committee, one of the country's biggest
corporate political PACs. A percentage of each executive's paycheck was
withheld from every biweekly pay period. For example, Joe Allen, Enron
vice president for state government affairs, gave $83.34 every two weeks
to the Enron PAC, for an annual total of $2,166. Other executives gave
much more.</TE>
<TE>   The money primarily was used to fund campaigns of candidates for
Congress, particularly those with key energy-related positions. According
to documents on file with the Texas Ethics Commission, the Enron PAC
collected $336,000 from executives in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of Lay's and Enron's munificence was reserved for major
political offices, nor was it limited to politics.</TE>
<TE>Spreading Wealth Among Nonprofits</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest political contributions Lay made in 2001 was for a
state Senate race in the Piney Woods of rural East Texas. In that race,
one of the most expensive legislative races ever undertaken in Texas,
Democratic trial lawyer David Marsh was pitted against Republican
businessman/rancher Todd Staples.</TE>
<TE>   The race became a key contest for the Houston-based Texans for Lawsuit
Reform, a conservative movement Lay supports that seeks to limit
lawsuits. Staples won, backed by $55,000 in contributions from Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the grandest Texas tradition of alms giving and support for
the arts, few have surpassed Lay and his company.</TE>
<TE>   The Lays and Enron were prominent givers to virtually every important
Houston charity ranging from a new cancer ward at the city's famous M.D.
Anderson Hospital to support for the Houston Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Lay encouraged giving by offering matching funds for as much as
$15,000 for each employee. The results often were spectacular. Enron's
7,500 employees alone, led by Lay with a $100,000 pledge, accounted for
$5.5 million of the $75 million raised by the Houston United Way
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was a visible leader in the charity world," said Houston Ballet
managing director Cecil C. Conner, whose troupe received a $10,000 gift
from the Lays. "It helped make this city a vibrant, important city, not
just an oil town. We have lost a leading voice."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Lay's influence went beyond money.</TE>
<TE>   When former City Councilman Fraga, 72, a longtime social worker and
prominent leader in the Latino community, found himself snared in a 1997
FBI bribery sting operation that sent another councilman to jail, Lay was
one of the prominent Houstonians who wrote a letter in Fraga's support.</TE>
<TE>   After returning the $2,000 offered by two undercover agents, Fraga
never was charged.</TE>
<TE>   But Lay may be missed most as a civic leader. He served a term as
president of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's influential
super-chamber of commerce. Before that he served as head of the Board of
Regents at the University of Houston, where he received his graduate
education.</TE>
<TE>   According to political scientist Stein, Lay was instrumental in the
revival of Houston's historically moribund downtown, including the
successful referendums to build stadiums for baseball and
basketball/hockey, the building of a light rail line connecting Houston's
renowned medical center complex to downtown and development of the
theater district.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Lay was a great promoter of the city," Stein said. "His business
was based on attracting productive capital and labor, and when it worked,
it worked to make the city a more attractive place to live."</TE>
<TE>Scrambling for a New Look</TE>
<TE>   But even this legacy already is fading, as Lay's and Enron's woes
continue to deepen. On a recent afternoon in Houston's gritty 2nd Ward
District, the Enron Boys and Girls Club, renovated with $500,000 in Enron
donations, was busy changing its name. The Enron logo on the center of
the newly resurfaced basketball court was being sanded off and replaced
with the new sponsor's name: Holt House.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already got us a new sponsor," said club director Glen Sherrod,
showing a reporter a roomful of new computers donated by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Thursday, Mayor Brown made no mention of Lay's
role in rebuilding the city.</TE>
<TE>   "My fervent hope," Brown said, "is that Enron is able to hire a CEO
who can put the company back in a position to rehire its employees and
remain a viable part of the business community."</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Hears Cloning Arguments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A Senate subcommittee Thursday heard impassioned arguments for and
against a proposed ban on research involving human embryo clones, an
ethically charged topic that grew even more so this week with the release
of new scientific findings.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing highlighted the increasingly convoluted politics of human
embryo research, a field of science that proponents believe will lead to
an exciting era of regenerative medicine and opponents decry as
unethical.</LD>
<LD>   Traditional polarities of left and right began to break down last year
as some anti-abortion activists came out for the research and some
environmental and feminist groups supported a ban.</LD>
<TE>   Scientific and political currents collided again Thursday when
proponents of a ban touted new evidence that bone marrow cells taken from
adults might have the same curative potential as embryo cells--and as the
scientist who led that research countered that her work was being
misinterpreted to suit legislative agendas.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're excited about the fact that there seem to be cells
in adult tissue that seem to have greater potential than we thought, it's
too soon to say they have the same potential and capabilities as embryo
cells," said Catherine Verfaillie, the University of Minnesota biologist
who led the recent studies.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is scientists' desire to use cloning technology to create
5-day-old human embryos for research. Embryos contain stem cells, which
have the potential to grow into replacement tissues useful in treating
diseases. Scientists suspect stem cells from cloned embryos--grown from a
skin cell of an adult patient--would be especially useful, since they
would be genetically identical to the patient and would not be rejected
by the patient's immune system.</TE>

<HD>Snowmobile Phaseout Studied at Yellowstone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOZEMAN, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>The National Park Service has drafted four alternatives for cutting
snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, including
one that would require riders to hire guides, an internal copy obtained
by a Montana newspaper shows.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the alternatives still would include the eventual elimination
of snowmobiles within the two parks and on the John D. Rockefeller
Memorial Parkway, which connects them. The other two alternatives would
allow snowmobile use to continue, but with limits and conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The Park Service did not designate a preferred alternative among the
four.</LD>
<TE>   The internal draft of the Park Service's alternatives was obtained by
the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   The document was to have been released this week as a supplemental
environmental study of how the Park Service would manage snowmobile use
within Yellowstone and Grand Teton in the future. But the agency delayed
the release, saying it needed additional time to review it.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, agreed to
the supplemental review as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the
snowmobile industry.</TE>
<TE>   The industry sued when the Clinton administration proposed phasing out
snowmobile use in the parks, citing concerns over the machines' effects
on wildlife and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration backed away from that plan and the Park
Service has been reviewing other alternatives since.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration proposal, which called for phasing out
snowmobiles by the winter of 2003-2004, is included as one of the
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   But the study suggests its economic impact on the area would amount to
about $21.1 million and cost 471 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A second alternative also calls for phasing out snowmobiles, but
delaying the plan by at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   A third proposal would allow recreational snowmobiling to continue
within the parks, but would limit the number allowed in each day and
would require that all the machines be "clean and quiet" varieties
manufacturers are developing.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said that alternative still could have a big economic
effect, including the potential loss of 200 jobs in West Yellowstone
alone. Much of the community's winter economy is based on snowmobile
business.</TE>
<TE>   The final alternative suggests limiting the number of snowmobiles even
further, and requiring that those entering the park be accompanied by a
licensed guide.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is expected to make its study public Feb. 4. A 60-day
comment period would follow before the agency made its recommendation. A
final decision is expected in mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   Tim O'Hair, natural resources advisor to Montana Gov. Judy Martz, said
setting limits on snowmobile use in Yellowstone is reasonable, but should
be done gradually.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do something about the noise and the air pollution
created by the snowmobiles as they are now," he said. "But don't just
jerk the rug out from under the business owners and the general public."</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists maintain a complete phaseout of snowmobiles is
still the best option.</TE>

<HD>Dispute in Medical Community Over Mammograms</HD>
<DH>Health: Danish research suggests older studies were flawed, and
that the procedure may not really save lives as advertised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For years, doctors have told women that regular mammograms save
lives. Now a scientific dispute is seriously challenging that
assertion--and forcing the National Cancer Institute to review its
guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   For now, the advice hasn't changed: Women should begin getting
mammograms in their 40s, NCI cancer prevention chief Dr. Peter Greenwald
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   As to whether the controversy will discourage some women from
undergoing mammograms, he said, "I'm afraid that's true.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to take a look at this as efficiently as we can, but it
is complex and will take some time" to settle, Greenwald said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the government's main cancer Internet site may be updated by
spring to say it is not clear if mammograms save lives--an opinion that
promises to create confusion. A group of independent scientists that
advises the NCI and is responsible for updating scientific data on its
Web site is drafting the wording now.</TE>
<TE>   "That translates into, 'You should not make the decision lightly,' "
said Donald Berry of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Berry is
a member of the panel, called the PDQ editorial board. "It is something
that a woman can reasonably choose not to do and not feel that she's
harming her health."</TE>
<TE>   Women in the U.S. undergo about 30 million mammograms a year. The
breast X-ray long has been considered the best way to detect breast
cancer, particularly early tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Many cancer organizations--including the government's cancer Web
site--point to studies done in the 1970s and '80s that concluded
mammograms can cut deaths from breast cancer by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   But now two Danish scientists have reanalyzed those studies and have
concluded that they had so many flaws in the way they were conducted that
it's impossible to say if mammograms really reduce deaths or not.</TE>
<TE>   Their analyses--first published two years ago in the British medical
journal the Lancet with a final, more in-depth look published in
October--have sparked furious scientific debate. This week, the
government's cancer advisors took up the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is that the thing we've believed for so long--that
finding cancer early is good--may not be right," Berry said. "It may be
that when we find it either the cat's out of the bag or not, and if we
had delayed" the woman would have had the same outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts say that's far from certain.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulk of the evidence at this point continues to endorse
mammography as a useful tool in potentially reducing one's risk" of dying
of breast cancer, said Dr. Robert Young, president of the American Cancer
Society.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from death, finding tumors when they're smaller often can mean
the difference between breast-conserving surgery or a mastectomy, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the abnormalities mammograms uncover turn out to be benign,
causing unnecessary anxiety and additional testing. Also, better
mammograms are uncovering more tiny tumors called "ductal carcinoma in
situ" that aren't invasive cancer and don't always become
life-threatening. Many experts think DCIS patients are over-treated, but
there's no way to tell in advance who will be endangered.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most provocative mammogram studies were performed by
Swedish researchers who are being urged to release all their records so
independent reviewers can check their data.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain and some other countries where far fewer women get
mammograms, studies are underway that might help answer how beneficial
the testing is, Berry said.</TE>
<TE>   And "it is quite conceivable" that in 10 years or so, scientists will
have new tests that can tell if a mammogram-spotted tumor is truly
life-threatening or a slow-grower, he said.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hastens Utah Census Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Thursday to speed up consideration of
Utah's challenge to the counting method used in the 2000 census,
scheduling oral arguments for March 27.</LD>
<LD>   Utah, seeking to take one congressional seat from North Carolina, is
challenging the U.S. Census Bureau's use of statistical "imputation" to
come up with the number of residents at addresses where no one could be
contacted.</LD>
<LD>   In its order, the court granted the state's motion to set an expedited
schedule for considering the case, ensuring that it would be heard during
the current term, which ends in June.</LD>
<TE>   When census workers were unable to count people in a household despite
repeated visits, the Census Bureau assumed through imputation that the
same number of people lived there as in a neighboring dwelling.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 census, imputation accounted for less than 0.5% of the
total U.S. population. If it had not been used, Utah would have one more
seat in the House and North Carolina would have one less.</TE>
<TE>   Utah argued that the use of the process violated the Census Act
prohibition on statistical sampling and the constitutional requirement on
an actual enumeration.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department disagreed, saying use of imputation is not a
form of sampling within the meaning of the law and argued that Utah's
case "lacks merit."</TE>
<TE>   Utah sued, but a three-judge federal panel in November dismissed the
lawsuit, ruling that imputation is reasonably consistent with the
findings of actual enumeration.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Supreme Court rejected a separate argument by Utah
that Mormon missionaries who were out of the country in April 2000 should
have been included in the count.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former diplomat and journalist Strobe Talbott has been named
president of the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, one of the nation's
oldest political think tanks.</LD>
<LD>   Talbott, 55, is in charge of Yale University's center on globalization
studies.</LD>
<LD>   He served as deputy secretary of State during both terms of the
Clinton administration. Before his stint with the State Department, he
spent more than two decades as a reporter, editor and foreign policy
columnist for Time magazine.</LD>
<TE>   "In addition to his keen intellect and deep background in key public
policy issues, he will provide the energy, the judgment and the sense of
balance and fairness that our unique institution requires," Brookings
Chairman James Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sound policy depends on nonpartisan, independent research and
analysis of the kind that Brookings has generated for more than eight
decades," Talbott said.</TE>
<TE>   Talbott will succeed Brookings President Michael Armacost in
September. Armacost is retiring.</TE>

<HD>Judge's Gag Order Silences N.H. Town's Dealings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GROTON, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>The talk of the town in Groton is a judge's order barring the
town's three managers from speaking to one another.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors requested the ban at a bail hearing Tuesday for two
selectmen who are accused of illegally trying to get extra money for the
town from the federal government after a big snowstorm last winter.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jean Burling barred defendants Stephen Pilcher and Deb Johnson
from contacting each other or the town's third selectman, Frank Harris,
because prosecutors wanted to prevent any witness-tampering or collusion.</LD>
<TE>   While town attorneys ponder what to do, local government is in a fix.</TE>
<TE>   Most day-to-day business in this northern New Hampshire town of 456
people has continued, but anything handled by the selectmen is on hold.
Some bills have gone unpaid because checks need the signatures of two
selectmen.</TE>
<TE>   "The townspeople can't believe a judge would issue such an order,"
said resident Ken Martell. "She not only sealed their lips, she tied
their hands."</TE>
<TE>   A resolution could be on the way. County Atty. Ken Anderson said he
and the town's lawyer agreed Thursday to modify the ban to allow the
selectmen to conduct town business, but only if all meetings are public
and recorded, with no one discussing the case that prompted the ban.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences to the town and the innocent people in the town of
Groton were something I became convinced I can't overlook," Anderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said a motion modifying the ban would be presented to the judge
today.</TE>
<TE>   The selectmen are part-time elected officials who are paid $2,000 a
year to manage the town's finances.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is set for June, which could be a major problem for the
silenced selectmen if the ban isn't lifted or changed. The Board of
Selectmen must propose a town budget by Feb. 5 and present it to voters
at Town Meeting--a big Yankee tradition in New England--in March.</TE>
<TE>   A selectmen's meeting Tuesday night was canceled, and future meetings
have been postponed until further notice.</TE>
<TE>   Groton is a former mining town with no industry or businesses and no
full-time town employees. Town Hall is a four-room building that houses
the selectmen's office, the town clerk, the Police Department and the
library.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Pilcher could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted of
theft and conspiracy. They are accused of falsifying a federal aid
application by listing plow trucks that didn't exist and hours that
weren't worked. They have denied the charges.</TE>
