<HD>It's Time to Tear Down the Walls of Shame</HD>

<LD>Luz Maria Castellanos was in secondary school in El Sereno when she
first heard that someone had put up walls to divide her largely
Latino community from the overwhelmingly white, Anglo city of South
Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   She had never actually seen the barriers, and didn't know why they
were there, if they were there at all, but was told that the children
of El Sereno should never cross them. She buried the memory as she
grew, considering it an "urban legend" of her youth.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't.</LD>
<TE>   Castellanos, now 29 and living in New York, recently met a man who
had also been raised in El Sereno, and in the course of conversation
the subject of the barriers came up. Charles Erickson knew they were
real.</TE>
<TE>   He had lived on Alpha Street for years and remembered driving his
car up the street from El Sereno into South Pasadena without any
problem. He moved away for awhile, and when he returned years later,
the street was blocked off at the city line.</TE>
<TE>   "They said in South Pasadena the barriers were because of too many
speeding cars," Erickson recalled. "But we knew it was a racial
barrier, and it amazes me that they got away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Castellanos listened to Erickson's memories with wonder and
indignation. She knows now that the barriers are real and
humiliating, and she wants them down.</TE>
<TE>   Castellanos grew up near Van Horne Avenue. It's in a mixed
neighborhood of homes and apartments, some well-kept, some not.
Census figures tell us that El Sereno is a working-class community.
Of its 3,717 inhabitants, 3,032 are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Van Horne, like Alpha, ends at an adobe wall about 2 feet high. On
the other side, in South Pasadena, the street becomes Via del Rey.
Its homes are expensive and well-kept, its gardens immaculate.</TE>
<TE>   Once advertised as "a quiet home among the songbirds," South
Pasadena, with its population of 24,000 (62% white), considers itself
an island of stability in an ocean of change. It has consistently
fought the inroads of heavy traffic, including the proposed extension
of the 710 Freeway, which it battled to a quiet death.</TE>
<TE>   If the walls that mark the border on these two streets were
intended as traffic barriers when they were erected, they've always
been perceived as racial divisions. As recently as five years ago, an
activist group in El Sereno asked South Pasadena to reconnect Van
Horne and Via del Rey. The request was ignored.</TE>
<TE>   While a gap in the wall that separates Van Horne from Via del Rey,
and El Sereno from South Pasadena, permits foot traffic, few are
likely to venture from the Latino side of the barrier to the Anglo
side.</TE>
<TE>   An urban planner, discussing other barriers in Southern
California, said that walking patterns change when walls go up. They
become "symbolic gates." People feel they are trespassing by walking
through them.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, they become cultural barriers of humiliation that linger in
the memories of children, who grow up wondering why they weren't
wanted in a neighborhood on the other side of a wall.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong resident of the barrio, a woman of 58 who asks that her
name not be used, remembers when people rode horses through the hills
that join both communities. It was open land then, without the
political boundaries that would later create the first psychological
barriers.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they began building big, beautiful homes over there," she
says, "compared to our dumpy little houses over here. They decided
they didn't want trashy people going through their neighborhoods.
They didn't want Mexicans."</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt in the mind of Councilman Nick Pacheco,
whose district includes El Sereno, that the barriers erected by South
Pasadena along parts of its border with El Sereno are racial, and he
would like to see them removed and the streets rejoined.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to explain to children that they are being kept
out of a community because its residents don't want to be near you,"
Pacheco said after a walk along Van Horne Avenue to the wall. "You
can still see the asphalt of the street that used to go through.
Whether the barrier was the result of classism or racism, the bottom
line is that it wasn't done for positive reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of South Pasadena calls the perception of racism
"troublesome." David Rose says he can't imagine what the City Council
was thinking when it ordered Van Horne closed in the 1970s, but he's
willing to rethink the closing today.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand their feelings of racism," he said, referring to
Castellanos and Erickson. "In today's world, no one should keep
neighborhoods from melding."</TE>
<TE>   He's right. We live in an era of awareness that no longer
tolerates with impunity the slights and insults of an earlier time. I
can recall to a lesser degree being isolated because of a Latino
surname. I know how it hurts to be called "spic" and "wetback." I
know how it is to be omitted from social events because of my name.</TE>
<TE>   I still receive occasional hate mail, but the time is passing when
racial slurs are acceptable. Similarly, racial barriers, or the
perception of racial barriers, should no longer damage the self-image
of our children, whoever they are.</TE>
<TE>   A symbol is needed here. The elimination of that barrier between
two streets, two communities and two worlds would be a beginning. Mr.
Rose, take down those walls.</TE>

<HD>A Stretch in 'Heaven' for Richard Lewis</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Richard Lewis begins a five-episode, guest-starring role
tonight on "7th Heaven," the WB series about a minister and his
family. Lewis plays Rabbi Glass. It's a bit of a stretch for a
performer who has given his stand-up comedy tours titles such as "The
Magical Misery Tour" and "I'm in Pain," but Lewis says he'll try to
bring a little of himself to the role and feels he's in good hands.</LD>
<LD>   "This to me is like having a holiday in Utah, being with this
cast," Lewis said. "It's really quite an experience. I can't even
recognize half the food for lunch. I actually ran away from one of
the meals. It was a ham, but it had like a face on it. It was like an
anti-deli."</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, the son of a caterer, says Rabbi Glass is a Reform rabbi.
His wife is played by Laraine Newman, whom the WB's core teen
audience may not realize was a founding cast member on "Saturday
Night Live." In the story line, the Glasses' daughter, Sarah, falls
in love with the reverend's son, Matt.</LD>
<TE>   As a comedian, Lewis has spent decades mining his anxieties as a
single, Jewish, commitment-phobic male shuttling to and from therapy.
Onstage, everything in his life was "from hell." And now he's in
"Heaven." "I'm running out to comparison skullcap shop on Fairfax,"
Lewis said.</TE>

<HD>First-Class Plastic for Oscar Ballots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, with great fanfare, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences staged a photo op for the news media at which executives
displayed that year's Oscar ballots before they were mailed to
thousands of academy members throughout California, but when the
ballots didn't arrive, people got worried.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers had stuffed the
ballots in eight gray canvas mail sacks and delivered them to the
back loading dock of the Beverly Hills Post Office, but days passed,
and academy members began asking one another if they had received
their ballots. No, they were told, no one had.</LD>
<LD>   News of the missing ballots prompted an embarrassed U.S. Postal
Service to launch an investigation. What they discovered was that the
ballots, which all contained the proper first-class postage, had been
mistaken by postal employees for third-class mail because the sacks
were unlabeled. Third-class mail typically takes seven to eight days
to deliver.</LD>
<TE>   Academy spokesman John Pavlik says the Postal Service and the
academy have taken steps to see the mishap doesn't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now putting the ballots in plastic trays that the Postal
Service uses for first-class mail," Pavlik explained. "More
importantly, the Postal Service is watching the ballots from the
minute they leave [our headquarters]. The chances of that kind of
thing happening again are pretty remote."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday morning, Beverly Hills Postmaster Koula Fuller will
be on hand for this year's photo op of ballots being mailed. Also in
attendance will be academy executive director Bruce Davis and
PricewaterhouseCoopers' partners Greg Garrison and Rick Rosas.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The four-pronged Concert for Artists' Rights to be staged across Los
Angeles County on Tuesday night has come about because of complex
legislative issues facing the musicians and the music industry, but
the basic reason for the star-studded shows couldn't be simpler: "We
need a phone," says Jim Guerinot, manager of the Offspring, No Doubt
and Beck, and one of the key organizers of the pre-Grammy night
event. "Right now we don't have one. We don't have a mailbox, we
don't have an office, we don't have an executive director."</LD>
<LD>   The "we" Guerinot refers to is the fledgling Recording Artists
Coalition, a lobbying group set up to ensure that musicians' voices
are heard when laws concerning copyrights, digital distribution of
music and other matters are debated before Congress. RAC will get
proceeds from Tuesday's performances at the Inglewood Forum,
Universal Amphitheatre, Long Beach Arena and the Wiltern Theatre. One
source says the take for the RAC should top $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   RAC was formed last year largely at the behest of Don Henley and
Sheryl Crow, who will take part in the rock portion of the night at
the Forum along with the Eagles, Billy Joel, John Fogerty and Stevie
Nicks.</LD>
<TE>   The alt-rock show at Long Beach Arena features No Doubt, the
Offspring and Weezer, while Beck, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Social
Distortion's Mike Ness team up at the Wiltern. Country artists at
Universal will include the Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Trisha
Yearwood and Dwight Yoakam.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tuesday's event has been described in some quarters as a
protest against the multinational conglomerates that now control the
record industry, Guerinot insists that's not the case: "The most
important thing is that this is not anti-anything. It's definitely
pro, just making sure that the artist has a seat at the table."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at the House of Blues in West Hollywood the same night,
another issue-oriented concert will bring out even more stars. Nelly
Furtado, Goo Goo Dolls and Toronto R&amp;B singer Glenn Lewis will
perform for Rock the Vote's 2002 Patrick Lippert Awards, which will
be given to the Dave Matthews Band, Destiny's Child and "West Wing"
creator Aaron Sorkin.</TE>

<LD>In the wake of its Academy Award nominations for screenplay and
actress, let me register my profound distress at this latest in a
considerable line of accolades bestowed on the film "Monster's Ball."
Contrary to the consensus critical view that the film is a moving
story of the redemptive power of love, I found little to recommend
it.</LD>
<LD>   The story (stop here if you don't want the film "spoiled" for you)
is basically this: A rather matter-of-factly racist Georgia prison
guard (Billy Bob Thornton) assists in the very graphically depicted
(smoke rising from burning flesh) electrocution of a black prisoner.
Following a series of plot developments, this same guard becomes
acquainted with and then the lover of the widow (Halle Berry) of the
executed man. The widow, also African American, is shown as brazenly
seeking and initiating the intimacy.</LD>
<LD>   The film ends with the woman discovering her new lover's role in
her husband's death. Her reaction? She joins her "good ol' boy" in
sharing a bowl of chocolate ice cream (his favorite food) sitting on
the back stoop of his house where she has recently come to live with
him. And, one presumes, they lived happily ever after in their small
Georgia town.</LD>
<TE>   Now, to be fair, important plot elements that arguably
contextualize and shape the actions and motivations of the two main
characters are not part of my plot summary. Both characters are,
presumably, adrift, spiritually alone and in pain. They reach out to
one another for solace more than sex. Their union is a modern triumph
of love over circumstance, including traditional racial social
barriers. "Behold," say the critics, "the New South cometh, and it is
good!"</TE>
<TE>   That is as misleading, revisionist and reactionary a view of
black-white race relations in this country as has been put on the
screen in a long time. My reaction to "Monster's Ball" is as close as
I can imagine to my great-grandparents' likely reaction to "Birth of
a Nation" in 1915, assuming the unlikely availability of theater
seats for "colored people" like them to see it in their Mississippi
and Georgia hometowns at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Simply and bluntly, the film is a Ku Klux Klan fantasy: A poor
white racist gets to "legally lynch" a black man (conveniently
depicted as a triple murderer who proclaims himself a "bad man"),
then takes the dead man's dream woman, at her invitation (no rape
necessary), and, finally, gets her acquiescence if not outright
approval of his killing of her black man.</TE>
<TE>   Some people with whom I have discussed the film have accused me of
wanting any depiction of blacks in films or television to be
"positive" and "uplifting." "Monster's Ball," they argue, is a work
of dramatic art, and art has no dramatic "arc" if the main
protagonists are perfect people doing only good, smart things. This
argument is quite beside the point. I maintain that the greatest
black character in American fiction is Bigger Thomas in Richard
Wright's "Native Son," published in 1940. Bigger was also a murderer,
and not a nice person. He was also executed. But Bigger rang true;
his all-too-human failings had an authenticity borne of the reality
of black oppression in the rural South and urban North of this
country in the first half of the 20th century. Bigger still rings
true.</TE>
<TE>   My objection to "Monster's Ball" is not that the three main black
characters are deeply flawed people. (The decidedly dysfunctional
black couple has a son, a grossly obese, compulsive eater who is
treated very cruelly by his mother.) Rather, my problem with the film
is that the story doesn't ring true.</TE>
<TE>   I know the South is not as it was in my youth in the 1950s and
'60s, but even in 2002, the prison guard and the black woman in this
film would not, I believe, act as they do.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say interracial love, even white male-black female
love, is impossible in such a context. History clearly reports
otherwise. But this depiction of it, in my view, provides no
supporting context. The guard has had no life-changing experience
with blacks. The woman strips and offers herself to a poor,
powerless, Southern white man she barely knows while still,
supposedly, in deep grief over the sudden death of her son hard on
the death of the boy's father.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly and insultingly, the film argues that the woman sees
sudden, unprotected, nearly anonymous sex with a man who probably
questions her humanity as a "balm" for her grief. This is simply not
my experience of Southern black women, not in my youth and not now, a
half-century later.</TE>
<TE>   Why then, I ask myself, is this madness seen as Oscar material?
Perhaps its appeal to the motion picture academy is, indeed, its
bogus "reassurance" of American social reconciliation and harmony in
a time of national crisis, as some film critics have posited.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, what rankles most is that this film got made while so
many others, with depictions of people of color, women, the old, the
poor, the powerless, as they really are in this society, good and
bad, don't get made or, if somehow independently produced, barely see
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   As so many have said before me, censorship or insipid,
unconvincing "after school specialism" isn't what's needed. A
diversity of views is. Real diversity means diverse access to
mainstream film distribution and prime-time television programming
slots, not just festival screenings, obscure art house runs and
"boutique" cable exposure. Of course, power that could deliver such
results isn't given. It must be taken, or, at least, be alternatively
created.</TE>

book and featuring the late singer Aaliyah, opens at No. 1 with $15.2
million.</DH>

<LD>Audiences went vampire hunting as "Queen of the Damned," featuring
the late singer Aaliyah as an ancient bloodsucker, premiered  as the
top weekend movie with $15.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   "John Q.," last weekend's No. 1 film, dropped to second place with
$12.5 million, pushing its 10-day total to $39.9 million, according
to studio estimates Sunday. Kevin Costner's supernatural love story,
"Dragonfly," opened in third place with $10.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Though generally trashed by critics, "Queen of the Damned" got a
big boost from young fans of Aaliyah, who was killed in a plane crash
last summer. Women younger than 25 made up 30% to 40% of the film's
audience, said Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros.,
which released the movie.</LD>
<TE>   "I think [Aaliyah's fans] were drawn by their loyalty and
curiosity and desire to see her on the big screen," Fellman said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Anne Rice's book of the same name from her "Vampire
Chronicles," the movie stars Aaliyah as the mother of all
bloodsuckers and Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 2,511 locations, "Queen of the Damned" averaged a
healthy $6,035 a theater, compared with a $5,000 average in 2,505
theaters for "John Q." and $4,148 in 2,507 cinemas for "Dragonfly."</TE>
<TE>   Director Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding" had an impressive premiere
in limited release, grossing $66,000 at two New York City theaters.
The ensemble comedy follows the clash of tradition and modern times
during frenzied preparations for a wedding in New Delhi, India.
Distributor USA Films plans to expand the film to more cities,
including Los Angeles, over the next two weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the top 12 films grossed $85.5 million, up 14% from the
same weekend last year. For the first two months of the year,
Hollywood's revenues are running virtually even with the pace of last
year, when the industry grossed a record $8.35 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The early part of 2001 was dominated by "Hannibal," a February
release that grossed $165 million. This year has not yet produced a
major hit, but a string of new films has opened solidly, while
holdovers from last year drew strong audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Top Oscar nominees continue to benefit from the awards attention.
"A Beautiful Mind" grossed $5.2 million, raising its total to $132.6
million. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" took in
$3.6 million, climbing to $283.3 million overall.</TE>
<TE>   "I would characterize it as status quo, week in and week out,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor
Relations. "There hasn't been a runaway blockbuster so far like we
sometimes have at this point. But newcomers are generating interest,
holdovers and Oscar contenders are generating interest."</TE>
<TE>   The combat film "Black Hawk Down" took in $3.7 million, pushing
its total to $101.4 million. It was the 19th movie released in 2001
to cross the $100 million mark, compared with a record 22 films the
year before.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar nominees Denzel Washington and Halle Berry, along with the WB's
"The Steve Harvey Show" and Showtime's gritty drama "Soul Food," were
key winners Saturday at the 33rd annual NAACP Image Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Washington was named outstanding actor in a motion picture for his
portrayal of a corrupt cop in "Training Day," beating out fellow
Oscar nominee Will Smith for "Ali."</LD>
<LD>   Berry won the outstanding actress in a motion picture for her role
as the temptress in "Swordfish." She was not up for her
Oscar-nominated role as the wife of an executed killer who becomes
involved in an interracial affair in "Monster's Ball."</LD>
<TE>   Both Washington and Berry, who are working on films out of town,
were unable to attend the star-studded ceremony at the Universal
Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   Another no-show was Michael Jackson, who won for outstanding
performance in a variety series/special for CBS' "Michael Jackson:
30th Anniversary Celebration." The special was also honored for
outstanding variety series/special.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Smith's loss, "Ali" was still a big winner Saturday,
walking off with honors for outstanding motion picture and
outstanding supporting actor in a motion picture--Jamie Foxx.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Bassett won one of her two Image Awards for outstanding
supporting actress in a motion picture for "The Score." She was also
named outstanding actress in a television movie, miniseries or comedy
special for Showtime's supernatural "Ruby's Bucket of Blood."</TE>
<TE>   In the television category, most of the comedy awards were repeats
of last year. "The Steve Harvey Show," which just completed a
six-year run on WB, beat out Fox's popular newcomer "The Bernie Mac
Show" and ABC's crossover hit "My Wife and Kids" for outstanding
comedy series. Harvey won again for outstanding actor; his co-star
Terri J. Vaughn repeated last year's victory for outstanding
supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   Mo'Nique of UPN's "The Parkers" won her second consecutive
outstanding actress in a comedy series.</TE>

outstanding female artist; Alicia Keys beat out India.Arie  for
outstanding new artist and outstanding album ("Songs in A Minor").</TE>
<TE>   Aaron McGruder, creator of the comic strip "The Boondocks," was
given the Chairman's Award; National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice was honored with the President's Award.</TE>
<TE>   McGruder caused a stir among the audience during his acceptance
speech when he  voiced sentiments opposing President Bush and the war
on terrorism. He told the audience to challenge what the
administration says "because they are lying."</TE>
<TE>   Rock 'n' roll legend Little Richard received the Hall of Fame
award.</TE>

<HD>A Less Than Heroic Effort, on All Fronts</HD>
<DH>Hot playwright Kenneth Lonergan's 'Lobby Hero' is dragged
down by the weight of its words, with no rescue forthcoming from
either cast or director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember "it" girls? And "it" boys? Well, if there's such a thing as
an "it" writer these days, it could well be Kenneth Lonergan. Ever
since his "This Is Our Youth" hit off-Broadway in the late '90s, he's
been hotter than toast from coast to coast, enjoying a free ride on
the media bandwagon. And that Oscar nod for his film
writing-directing debut "You Can Count on Me"? It probably got him
more than his own parking spot, you can count on that.</LD>
<LD>   So it's easy to understand why South Coast Repertory must've
thought it had a big hairy deal on its hands with the West Coast
premiere of Lonergan's "Lobby Hero," which opened Friday. And well it
might have, if "Lobby Hero" wasn't a seriously flawed play. Or if
those flaws weren't exacerbated by an ill-conceived production.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of thinking would explain, for example, why it didn't
insist that the playwright slash, say, 90 minutes of verbal lard from
a play that begs for it. And it would explain why it put this
drone-on-athon on the football field of a main stage, instead of in
the chamber-sized Second Stage where it belongs. It bought the hype,
but you don't have to.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even whopper-size hubris can't explain why SCR gave Lonergan
director Olivia Honegger, who does the play and its four actors no
favors, delivering some of the least competent work I've ever seen in
this theater. The whole thing would be somnolent, if it weren't so
irritating.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake; Lonergan, unlike Honegger, is a major player. He
knows what made him chichi in the first place and doesn't mess with
the recipe. His breakthrough play, "This Is Our Youth," was a triumph
of well-timed Weltschmerz. It had the intelligentsia billing and
cooing--in vintage limousine liberal fashion--over its portrait of
the disaffected crack-peddling offspring of the Upper West Side, and
a star-making turn by Mark Ruffalo.</TE>
<TE>   A highly castable three-hander for 20-somethings, "This Is Our
Youth" should've gotten an L.A. production quicker than you can say
hot-young-stars-on-hiatus-from-TV-series. But there's a reason why it
hasn't: It's not that good a play. Look beneath the
slice-of-seedy-life veneer, and there isn't much more than hip
cynicism, couched in the kind of dialogue you can overhear at your
nearest slacker roost. Lonergan's subsequent play, "The Waverly
Gallery," is thankfully a bit richer. It will be staged at the
Pasadena Playhouse this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad, then, that "Lobby Hero," resembles "This Is Our Youth"
more than "The Waverly Gallery." While the characters here are older
and poorer than the Upper West Side brats of the first play, they're
clearly their existential and linguistic cousins.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups wallow in anomie. They dwell in the margins of
society, or at least the ones right under New Yorkers' noses.
Lonergan's dramatic universe is an East Coast version of the terrain
explored by writers from Sam Shepard to John Steppling, a low-rent
land of stasis and emotional inertia.</TE>
<TE>   Writing about stuck lives is arguably one of the toughest
enterprises in the theater. Think of Chekhov, or Beckett. It requires
a delicate balance of contempt and compassion. But Lonergan doesn't
convince us that there's a reason for us to care about his characters
for more than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This time out, the purgatory of the moment is the lobby of a
Manhattan high-rise, where two security guards and two cops cross
paths. The titular "Hero" is a trademark Lonergan type: a heedless
schlemiel, both damaged and damaging. He's an enervating jerk named
Jeff, a security guard who's been on the job only a few months, in a
flat, low-stakes turn by Kevin Corrigan, who'd do well to review his
stage, as opposed to film, acting techniques. As is, he's an arc-less
black hole where the central force of the play should be.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff's boss William (T.E. Russell, in a respectable if not
surprising performance) is an uptight by-the-book type who's just
found out his brother has been charged with a murder he may or may
not have committed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cops arrive. There's the macho pig Bill (the
usually better Simon Billig) who nightly does the deed with the sexy
divorcee upstairs, and his high-strung rookie partner Dawn (Tessa
Auberjonois), whom he's also been bedding.</TE>
<TE>   First, Jeff rats on Bill. Then it escalates to a four-way, as they
all start taking turns betraying and retaliating against each other.
Ultimately, Jeff rats on William, with seemingly no regard for the
fact he's sending the man's brother down the river. Then Dawn rats on
Bill, who pulled strings for William. Bill ruins Dawn's career. And
Dawn and Jeff get together in the end?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's as contrived and often senseless as it sounds. Somewhere
in this, there's a moral quandary. There may even be several. As is,
they're buried deep in a piece that's interminably talky and
repetitive.</TE>
<TE>   There's a better play here--not great, but better. Showing us that
should've been Honegger's job. It's the director's task to have a
vision of what the play is truly about, and to focus, shape and
orchestrate all the elements of the drama accordingly. Honegger not
only fails to do that, but seems to have cut class on Directing 101.</TE>
<TE>   Her staging is weak, but she's not an actors' director either. The
actors aren't speaking or listening to one another. They're allowed
to upstage themselves. Their performances are not modulated.</TE>
<TE>   In an intimate space like SCR's second stage, we might've had a
better chance of perceiving the tension and volatility inherent in
the play. These characters are stuck in a dirty fishbowl, and we
should have our noses pressed up against the glass, where we can feel
them seething at one another. Where it is, "Lobby Hero" is lost in
the vast unused acreage of Tony Fanning's wry and finely observed
set. (The gigantic blue and white Christmas wreath hanging behind
Jeff's desk is a masterly stroke.)</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Fanning isn't the only one with a sense of humor.
Lonergan does get in more than a few zingers. But like everything
else about this play that could be provocative, they're diluted by
the surrounding excess. We laugh easily when the jokes come, but
that's largely because it's such a welcome relief from the
overweening tedium.</TE>

<HD>Obscure Tune Rides Again at the Olympics</HD>
<DH>Television*  Theme from a short-lived western finds new
life as a rousing sports fanfare, as have several other works by
Randy Edelman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON BURLINGAME</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If one of the recurring musical themes in NBC's coverage of the
Winter Olympics seemed familiar to viewers, perhaps that's because
it's been around for a while.</LD>
<LD>   We're not talking about "Bugler's Dream," the 1958 Leo Arnaud
piece that has become the traditional Olympic fanfare, or the John
Williams themes that have become a staple of Olympic coverage
(particularly the 1984 fanfare, used extensively by NBC, along with
his new "Call of the Champions," written for the Salt Lake City
Games).</LD>
<LD>   The heroic music that NBC used to promo upcoming competitions
every night was originally the theme for a short-lived comedy-western
TV series called "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." Bruce
Campbell starred in the show, which ran for a single season on Fox
starting in the fall of 1993.</LD>
<TE>   According to composer Randy Edelman, who wrote the theme, NBC
several years ago began using excerpts from his film scores in its
sports coverage--notably his Americana-flavored "Gettysburg" theme
for its Breeders Cup event. They specifically commissioned a theme
from him for NFL games, and at one point he sent along some samples
of other music that he had written. The "Brisco County" theme was one
of those tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't from a movie, and it wasn't really something that
anybody knew," Edelman said. "It was original, and it seemed to have
the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant,
and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all
television things like this have, a 'button,' an ending flourish that
works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second
thing."</TE>
<TE>   The "Brisco" theme turned up in NBC's coverage of the Atlanta
Games in 1996 (along with "Gettysburg," which served as the closing
theme). So much of Edelman's music was regularly featured that he
received credit as a producer and wound up winning a sports Emmy. The
"Brisco" theme also became NBC's baseball signature for "a couple of
years," said Dan Suratt, NBC's director of business development.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Levy, NBC's senior creative producer for the Olympics, said
that Edelman "falls into that category of composers, like John
Williams, James Horner and Alan Silvestri, whose movies resemble the
Olympics in proportion and emotion. We reach out to those types of
artists [for our music]."</TE>
<TE>   Edelman's film scores have become popular even when the movies in
question weren't. He was a Golden Globe nominee for his music for
"The Last of the Mohicans," and his themes for "Come See the
Paradise" and "Dragonheart" have frequently been used in trailers and
TV spots for other films. The "Gettysburg" theme is now a fixture at
Independence Day celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian skater Elvis Stojko uses Edelman's music for "Dragon: The
Bruce Lee Story" in his routines. And ABC, CBS, ESPN, TBS, TNT and
Fox have all used Edelman compositions for sporting events ranging
from college basketball to golf, tennis and track.</TE>
<TE>   Edelman was reached in London, en route home from the Prague
locations of his next film, "XXX,"  actor Vin Diesel's follow-up to
"The Fast and the Furious." Asked if multiple 15- and 30-second
prime-time uses of a TV theme are lucrative, Edelman laughed and
said, "It's nice, but it's not something that you're going to live
for the rest of your life on."</TE>

<HD>In Cliburn's Hands, a Workhorse Still Pleases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer gangly, but still boyish, Van Cliburn at 67 remains the
charming pianistic icon from Texas, justifiably famous for his smile,
his personal magnetism, his Romantic repertory, the major
international piano competition he founded in 1962 and his unofficial
ambassadorship of all things musically American.</LD>
<LD>   Cliburn returned to Southern California Friday night, after an
absence of eight years, to play again  the same signature work--the
Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto--he had brought to Hollywood Bowl
and San Diego in 1994, and to Long Beach in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   He still plays it well, if not with the completely well-oiled
technique of his youth, but solidly and with panache. As a musical
veteran, Cliburn may never have realized the enormous promise of his
remembered talent and charisma, but he still gives pleasure from the
keyboard.</LD>
<TE>   His collaborators this time around were conductor Boris Brott and
the New West Symphony, an accomplished orchestra now in its seventh
season. Together, the soloist and his colleagues achieved a strong
and winning performance; solo contributions from flutist Paul Fried
and cellist Armand Ksajikian added to the event.</TE>
<TE>   Cliburn began nervously--the work itself is so legendary, it must
cause palpitations in anyone other than the most brazen of young
soloists--but settled in by the middle of the first movement, which
went well but never achieved its true spontaneity.</TE>
<TE>   The pianist created many beautiful moments in the treacherous and
complicated Andantino, then sailed through the finale in a blaze of
controlled speed, bravado and flying octaves.</TE>
<TE>   The full house in the Fred Kavli Theatre for the Performing Arts
at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza--this was a concert originally
scheduled to be a gala opening to the season, then postponed because
of the Sept. 11 tragedies--responded with a genuine standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Brott led the orchestra in impressive readings of other
Tchaikovsky pieces before intermission: The "Romeo and Juliet"
Fantasy-Overture began tentatively but grew in confidence and
decibels, and four excerpts from the "Swan Lake" ballet emerged
idiomatic, though every one of the talented and game soloists seemed
new to their assignments.</TE>

<HD>Introducing Audiences to the Next Generation</HD>
<DH>Pop music* Folk singer Joan Baez tours with Dave Carter,
Tracy Grammar and Richard Shindell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER CATLIN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joan Baez is striking a familiar pose--helping introduce her
audiences to new voices, just as she did 40 years ago, when the queen
of the folk world boosted the career of a young Bob Dylan.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an adventure," says Baez, 61, who, after similar tours with
Dar Williams and Eliza Carthy, is joined on a current tour of East
Coast venues by newcomers Dave Carter and Tracy Grammar. Richard
Shindell, who has toured with Baez before, rounds out the ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   The tour, she says, "changes as we go along and familiarize
ourselves with each other's material. If we're successful with it, it
will be a smooth sharing of stage. I'll take a lion's share, but not
that big a lion. For me, the fun is the exchange."</LD>
<TE>   It's a format that's helped her as well as the younger artists, as
Baez often borrows a song or two from her proteges to become part of
her repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   "We've managed to keep it fresh over these last 15 years," Baez
says of the shows. "That allows me to have something to look forward
to rather than groaning."</TE>
<TE>   Her groaning ended, she says, when she "entered a deep therapeutic
project that I had put off until I was 48. I got a hold of my demons
by the teeth. Now my phobia is gone; the panic attacks are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Part of her survival came in learning that even as a famous former
protest singer, "I didn't have to do everything in the world that
afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of flying around the world for benefits and rallies, when
she's not touring now, "I want to be home."</TE>
<TE>   There, she says, "I continue vocalizing, but I go over to my vocal
coach and have a week's input."</TE>
<TE>   What could the pro possibly still be learning?</TE>
<TE>   "How to keep the vocal cords functioning properly," she says. "And
to admit where they change, and to appreciate what I have now."</TE>
<TE>   Her voice, which startled with its pristine qualities in the
1960s, is "deeper in every sense," she reports. "The tonality is
deeper, and at a certain age, gravity takes over
everything--including what happened with my vocal cords. Plus, I've
lived a considerable amount since I first sang 'Barbara Allen.'"</TE>
<TE>   Baez can easily compare her current voice to her young one, with
the release of her early Vanguard albums in handsome packages with
extra tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they did a beautiful job," Baez says of the reissue
series, which continues next month with "In Concert" in two volumes.
The tale of her early career was retold in some detail in last year's
book "Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob
Dylan, Mimi Baez Farina and Richard Farina" (Farrar Strauss Giroux)
by David Hajdu, whose previous biography of Billy Strayhorn was an
award-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to me not terribly accurate," Baez says. But, she adds,
"maybe I just didn't like looking at it all again."</TE>
<TE>   Baez took off most of last year to be with her sister, Mimi
Farina, who died of cancer last July.</TE>
<TE>   A country at war brings her career full circle. A presence at many
a rally against the Vietnam War, Baez is uncomfortable with the U.S.
presence in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a feeling of impotence when we reacted so quickly
and so terribly to a hideous situation," she says. "They said, 'We
tried everything; we're going to war.' But we didn't try anything.
Let's put five or 10 Nobel Peace Prize winners on CNN for a couple of
days and see what they come up with.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an interesting time," she says. "It will be interesting to
see what will happen if we reinstitute the draft, if that affects the
general fervor of those between 18 and 24."</TE>

<HD>State Street Ballet's Dancers Got That Swing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many people don't expect a lot from ballet--just line, form and
mild-mannered but lively musicality--and this is what State Street
Ballet succeeded in bringing Saturday night to Cal State L.A.'s
Luckman Fine Arts Complex, with their "Ballroom: A Salute to the
Swing Era."</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company has steadily accumulated dancers
with strong technical and lyrical skills and seems to specialize in
bright, virtuosic, people-pleasing ballets. Its swing-era salute was
also a tribute to beautifully placed curves and far-flung limbs that
often came to rest in dramatic lighting (by Lloyd Sobel).</LD>
<LD>   In William Soleau's "Five by Gershwin," the intended breezy
romanticism was seriously curtailed by awkwardly styled, unflattering
costumes; whereas a certain amount of balletic tango got off the
ground in his "Nuevo Tango." In both pieces, performers wove in and
out of couple dances, with the women always on pointe and uplifted
elegance always on display. "Alley Cat," artistic director Rodney
Gustafson's detective solo (or was it for a criminal?) gave full rein
to Chauncey Hildestad's razor-sharp, feather-soft virtuosity (until a
slight injury midway muted the ending).</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the program, no contemporary perspective on the lush,
often naive--and even colonial--music of another time and place
emerged, nor did any choreographic innovations catch at the heart or
stimulate the brain. But several dancers with appealing dynamics and
personalities often caught the eye, especially Jennifer Batbouta,
Jean Sayeg and Olga Tcheckachova, all of whom showed striking skill
and attitude in Robert Sund's "B.A.N.D.," as well as in the tango
piece.</TE>
<TE>   In this way, whenever the evening relied too much on blithely
sailing the well-worn surface of swing-era optimism, talented
performers revived the mood by dancing up a storm.</TE>

<HD>Centuries of Religious Song Spanned by Estonian Choir</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearly, Estonians love to sing. Every few years, a famous singing
festival takes place in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, that
reportedly attracts thousands of participants. This country has also
produced the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, which periodically
reminds outsiders that it can hold its own with virtually any other
such group anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Though longtime chief conductor Tonu Kaljuste turned over the
reins of the choir to British early-music maven Paul Hillier last
September, Kaljuste was at the helm of both the choir and its
frequent recording partner, the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra, at UCLA's
Royce Hall on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   And he was able to procure some astonishing performances of
religious music from two composers separated by nearly three
centuries.</LD>
<TE>   The concert opened with a pair of off-the-beaten-path Vivaldi
choral works, the brief setting of Psalm 69, RV 8, and the Beatus Vir
in C, RV 597, written in the vigorous style familiar to listeners who
know any of Vivaldi's hundreds of concertos. Not only did the
antiphonally placed chorus and orchestra produce a solid, focused,
caressing blend (with attention to period bowing by the strings), the
soloists in the choir were outstanding, gliding through the rapid
figurations with an ease and accuracy  rarely heard even from more
noted singers.</TE>
<TE>   The chief drawing card, though, was the inevitable presence of a
piece by Arvo Part, Estonian expatriate and co-leader of the idiom
that an inspired wag labeled "holy minimalism."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, the choice was Part's "Te Deum," one of his most
impressive pieces, a work that ironically conjures a medieval
meditative mood through distinctly 20th century means: repeated
Stravinsky-like string passages, a prepared piano made to sound like
a harpsichord, and a prerecorded tape of a Norwegian instrument
called the wind harp that provides a recurring depth-charged drone.</TE>
<TE>   Kaljuste and these forces made the first recording of "Te Deum"
for the ECM label nine years ago--one of the highest peaks of the
label's ongoing Part project--and they perform it nowadays with even
greater extremes of urgency and magical stillness.</TE>

<DH>Hakim and Khaled blend modern and traditional genres on the
'Desert Roses and African Rhythms' tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Originally scheduled for September 2001, the "Desert Roses and
African Rhythms" tour was canceled in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks--in part because of travel complications, in part because of
fears of backlash against Middle Eastern performers.</LD>
<LD>   But the audience enthusiasm that has greeted Middle Eastern
superstars Khaled and Hakim on the rescheduled tour in cities such as
New York, Boston and Washington was amply present on Saturday at the
Orpheum in downtown Los Angeles as well.</LD>
<LD>   Hakim, opening the program, is a master of Egypt's shaabi genre, a
style that blends traditional melodies and rap-like lyrics with urban
dance rhythms. Accompanied by a 13-piece ensemble (including four
drummers and two backup singers), he was in high gear before he had
completed his first number, dramatically illustrating his songs with
a full catalog of physical movements.</LD>
<TE>   Swiveling his hips, shaking his shoulders, using his hands for
theatrical emphasis, Hakim offered a colorful visual connection with
the often irreverent qualities of the shaabi lyrics for the
non-Arabic speaking members of his audience. He topped off his set
with a number designed to break through musical and cultural
boundaries--an energetic duet with Puerto Rican merengue singer Olga
Tanon on "Ah Ya Albi."</TE>
<TE>   Khaled, known as the King of Rai--an Algerian melange of
traditional sounds, social and personal commentary and contemporary
rhythms--approached his performance with a charisma considerably
different from that of Hakim. Emphasizing the far-ranging versatility
of his voice, which moved easily from dark, basso sounds to a soaring
tenor, Khaled roved the stage in relaxed and easygoing fashion,
interacting in amiable fashion with his musicians and the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the language, Khaled's set owed far more to rock and
jazz than it did to traditional Arabic music. His horn section
knocked out jazz riffs reminiscent of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, and he
occasionally did some vigorous air guitar playing. Khaled's
performance vividly affirmed the fact the pop music has now become a
global phenomenon without boundaries.</TE>

<DH>Linkin Park has defied the odds to become one of pop
music's hottest new attractions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would you say the odds were of a rock band going from opening
act at a local club to having the biggest-selling album of 2001 to
making the cover of Rolling Stone to being up for three Grammys--all
in just over a year? Fifty thousand to one? Fifty million to one?</LD>
<LD>   Either way, you could quadruple the odds by adding one more
hurdle: having the band upset favorites U2 in the rock album category
and Alicia Keys as best new artist in Wednesday's Grammy ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   The only way that's going to happen is if most of the recording
academy's 13,000 voters handed their ballots over to their teenagers.</LD>
<TE>   Linkin Park, the Los Angeles-spawned band that has defied all the
other odds above to become the hottest new attraction in rock,
doesn't make music that appeals to parents, and that's a weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Great bands, even those as dark and defiant as Nirvana and Nine
Inch Nails, address themes of youthful discontent and desire in ways
that can strike an emotional chord in rock fans of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Linkin Park, which headlined a Long Beach Arena
concert on Friday, lacks the artfulness and distinctiveness to catch
the ear of those who see the hard-rock intensity and anger of the
last decade as one-dimensional and self-absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the band speaks so effectively to young people that its
"Hybrid Theory" album has sold more than 6 million copies and is
still in the top five a year after its release. And there is
something different and noteworthy about the band, which is named
after Lincoln Park in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Staind, its touring partner on last year's Family
Values tour, Linkin Park steps past the whining and blind rage that
have made so much hard rock predictable and uninvolving. Though
filled with the tensions and fears of adolescence, songs such as "One
Step Closer" and "In the End" aren't just endless diatribes against
anyone who blocks a teenager's path. They deal with frustration and
confusion, layered with such optimism and hope that Rolling Stone
refers to the band's sense of "brotherly compassion."</TE>
<TE>   If it's easy to miss that message in the grinding textures of the
album, the band's liberating approach is showcased powerfully in a
live show that has been honed by more than 300 performances over the
past year.</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park--whose music mixes elements of hip-hop with the basic
guitar-bass instrumentation of rock--played with enough force Friday
to turn the arena floor into a frenzy of emotion, complete with four
competing mosh pits.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Chester Bennington, whose howling vocals add a desperate
edge to some of the tunes, and rapper Mike Shinoda help build a
connection with the audience by spending almost as much time on the
arena floor as on stage. They slap hands with fans as they race
through the crowd and sing several numbers amid the audience.</TE>
<TE>   After the 80-minute set, the six members signed autographs for
hundreds of fan club members for more than an hour--a regular feature
of the band's arena tour. All this bonding could come across as
gimmicky, but the band members don't exhibit any trace of pandering.
Bennington, 25, still identifies strongly with the frustrations of
his audience.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers the time he didn't have enough money for an
engagement ring for his fiancee (a friend who owned a tattoo parlor
gave them tattoo "rings"). Today, Bennington and his wife, who are
expecting their first child, wear wedding rings over those tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   Bennington, who co-writes the lyrics with Shinoda, also speaks in
interviews about traumatic moments in his past, including sexual
abuse and cocaine addiction. He dropped out of high school and worked
for years at low-pay service jobs in Phoenix before his rock 'n' roll
dreams came true.</TE>
<TE>   "Our outlook is, 'There's always tomorrow and everything can be
better,'" he said backstage Friday before the concert. "We try to
urge people to believe in themselves and realize that if you really
want something, you can achieve it if you believe in yourself and you
work at it."</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park certainly worked at it. The band, with different
lineups and names, was turned down by record companies for years.
Even after Bennington joined them in 1999, they did dozens of label
showcases before Warner Bros. signed them.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when they were on the cover of Rolling Stone and
preparing to attend the Grammys, the band members--Bennington,
Shinoda, guitarist Brad Delson, DJ Joseph Hahn, drummer Rob Bourdon
and bassist Phoenix--could have easily stirred the hometown crowd
with rants against all the record executives who turned them down.
But it's not Linkin Park's style to raise a middle finger at the
world. The group's album is even expletive-free.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mike and I wrote the lyrics, there were a lot of expletives,
but they felt like a cop-out," Bennington explained. "Just an easy
way to express your anger. We wanted to go deeper than that."</TE>
<TE>   Delson, who went to Agoura High School with Shinoda, said the band
won't perform at the Grammys, but they will attend the ceremony at
Staples Center, where they have a good chance at winning in the
hard-rock category.</TE>
<TE>   He's more excited, however, about starting work soon on the band's
second album, which may be out by November. The odds on another hit
the size of "Hybrid Theory"? We're probably talking Lotto jumbo
jackpot odds this time, which puts pressure on the band.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there is a lot of pressure, but there was even more
pressure on the first album," the slender guitarist said. "When you
get signed to a label, if you don't do as well as people expect on
the first shot, you might not get a second shot, and it could have
all been over."</TE>

<LD>The Nielsens may not always show it (as if they can be trusted), but
this has been a fine season for TV comedies that are still wobbling
on toddler legs.</LD>
<LD>   I wheezed myself into an asthmatic fit Wednesday night in front of
"The Bernie Mac Show" on Fox. I began the evening watching the Winter
Olympics but couldn't take the slapstick. Instead, I opted for
prime-time newcomer Bernie Mac, a stand-up comic turned-sitcom star
who is almost criminally funny.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's new "Scrubs" still has juice, meanwhile. And the distinctive
humor of "Undeclared," Fox's half-hour about college freshmen,
remains a joy on Tuesday nights, even though its dicey ratings (less
than 7 million viewers last week) have it sweating out renewal for a
second season. Inventive series with original characters that elevate
TV shouldn't have to scratch and claw for survival, but that's the
business.</LD>
<TE>   On Showtime, "The Chris Isaak Show" remains as loosey-goosey smart
and funny as ever, by the way, while somehow operating below the
radar of most TV observers.</TE>
<TE>   And returning to the Family Channel for a second season Friday is
charming "State of Grace," the wittiest, most edifying slice of 1960s
culture this side of "The Wonder Years."</TE>
<TE>   Now bring on the higher-profile comedies that NBC's triple lutzes
relentlessly promoted during the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving Tuesday is the Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy that the
industry and "Seinfeld" fanatics (like yours truly) have been
awaiting after the failures of her former co-stars, Jason Alexander
and Michael Richards, to recapture the magic in shows of their own.</TE>
<TE>   And Thursday brings "Leap of Faith," a derivative comedy about
four friends in New York that, despite being taped at Universal
Studios in Los Angeles, tries desperately to be "Sex and the City."
That's the peerless HBO series on which "Leap of Faith" creator Jenny
Bicks worked as a producer and writer.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's version is Sex and the Back Lot.</TE>
<TE>   Skill notwithstanding, success in one series does not necessarily
translate to another. "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David is the only
one of its alumni to go on to a series even approaching that comedy's
luster--witness his often-hilarious "Curb Your Enthusiasm" on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you're sold on the gifted Louis-Dreyfus and her
impeccable comic timing and instincts--read brilliant--you'll
probably like "Watching Ellie." It's smooth and seductive, delivering
few huge laughs in its first two episodes but offering a world-class
romp compared with those earlier stinkers from Alexander and
Richards. They seemed to have no sense of what would work for them
once severed from their "Seinfeld" umbilical cord.</TE>
<TE>   Not Louis-Dreyfus. Her show ranges from broad (an overflowing
toilet has Ellie slipping and sliding while dressing for a club date
in the premiere) to the kind of subtle wit that a laugh track would
overwhelm. Good news: It doesn't have one.</TE>
<TE>   Created and written by her husband, Brad Hall, and directed
grandly by Ken Kwapis, the single-camera series has Louis-Dreyfus as
a Los Angeles lounge singer who is having a fling with her British
guitar player (Darren Boyd) while barely tolerating her irritating
ex-boyfriend (Steve Carell). She also has regular phone chats with
her sister (Louis-Dreyfus' real sister, Lauren Bowles).</TE>
<TE>   The show's second banana is her apartment super, a broad but funny
Swede named Ingvar (Peter Stormare, who played the stony, mute killer
in "Fargo").</TE>
<TE>   He plays big. When she runs to him in a panic about her toilet, he
assures her it's no problem. "Flood? Am I a plumber? Tool kit!" Then
he peeks at her as she puts on her dress.</TE>
<TE>   The second episode finds Ellie and Ingvar collaborating on some
appealing nonsense at a wedding when she misplaces a song the bride
is counting on her to sing.</TE>
<TE>   Each episode is supposed to represent 22 minutes in Ellie's life.
That's nice, but an ever-present clock on the side of the screen is a
gimmick that should be dropped. Otherwise, this show has a very nice
comfort level. Best of all, it feels fresh.</TE>
<TE>   "Leap of Faith" doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   The cutesy title is a play on the name of its main character,
Faith Wardwell (Sarah Paulson), who is inseparable from her
sleep-around ad agency colleague, Patty (Lisa Edelstein), her married
neighbor Cynthia (Regina King) and skirt-chasing Andy (Ken Marino), a
straight male whose raging libido is inexplicably immune to his
good-looking female pals. A guy who spends his time at a table
schmoozing about romance with these fetching women, and nothing is
stirring? What's his story?</TE>
<TE>   Fault NBC for scheduling something this bawdy at kiddie-accessible
8:30. There's a triple dose of "whore" talk in the premiere, and
Faith is under the sheets with a guy before the first commercial
break.</TE>
<TE>   This episode finds her getting cold feet about her strait-laced
fiance (Bradley White), then sleeping with an actor (Brad Rowe, a
near ringer for Brad Pitt, but even prettier) she auditioned for a
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   The males here are rather absurd. That's so even though Faith's
tryst leads to the premiere's only sharply written scene, when she
shocks the chirpy crowd at her wedding shower by guiltily blurting
out that she cheated on her fiance with an actor.</TE>
<TE>   Faith: "I carried my underwear home in my bag on the C train."</TE>
<TE>   A friend: "You slept with an actor?"</TE>
<TE>   Her socialite mother (Jill Clayburgh): "You rode the subway?"</TE>
<TE>   Faith begins returning her wedding gifts in the second episode,
which has fewer memorable moments even than the premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "Leap of Faith" offers no sense of Manhattan or urban life, in
contrast to New York-based "Sex and the City," whose nubby texture is
nearly as pleasurable as its comedy, and whose central character,
Carrie Bradshaw, also got the marriage jitters and dumped her more
conservative fiance. What's more, Carrie's friend, Samantha, beat
Faith's friend, Patty, to the Holy Grail of "great, mindless sex" by
several seasons. So much for originality.</TE>
<TE>   One break: No electronic laughter. In fact, not much laughter at
all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Watching Ellie" premieres Tuesday night at 8:30, and "Leap of
Faith" premieres Thursday night at 8:30, both on NBC. The network has
rated both programs TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<DH>Philadanco's pieces such as 'Hand Singing Song' explore the
'stylistic way' that African Americans communicate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the annual parade of Black History Month dance events, the
Philadanco modern dance company inevitably sets new standards for
breadth of vision and originality of expression.</LD>
<LD>   Showcasing choreographers passionately exploring African American
identity along with  provocative dance-makers who just happen to be
black, Joan Myers Brown's versatile Philadelphians are a magnet for
creative risk and innovation--qualities abundant in a four-part
program at El Camino College on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Not everything worked equally well, but in David Brown's visionary
"Labess II" and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's celebratory "Hand Singing
Song," Philadanco introduced imaginative, finely crafted ensemble
pieces of wide appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Setting evolving geometric corps patterns against airy a cappella
music by Zap Mama (like the dancing, a blend of African and Western
influences), "Labess II" managed to keep its formalism remarkably
fluid and free of rigidity.</TE>
<TE>   The piece began with Dawn Marie Watson being lowered from a lift
by a line (front to back) of six dancers. And as that line coiled and
spun out and splintered into a chain of duets, Watson served as the
fulcrum or focus of the dance's majestic spatial design.</TE>
<TE>   A supple and even sensual use of the body humanized Brown's
structuralism, not so much softening his emphasis on unison execution
and symmetrical formations as suggesting the harmony of motion that
might exist in a world of perfect order.</TE>
<TE>   Zollar's past work has often been stronger as theater than dance,
but "Hand Singing Song" carved forceful whole-body statements out of
the gestural material that she chose as her subject. Looking at
handshakes and other social actions through which African Americans
define themselves, she created a mime-based ensemble vehicle that
ranged from the playful (a hokeypokey sequence) to the political (the
upraised fist of Black Power solidarity).</TE>
<TE>   The flipped wrist, the ambling strut, the scolding finger, the
Voguing stance, the loose-limbed physicality of jazz musicians: Using
a score by Michael Wimberly, "Hand Singing Song" reshaped all these
movement artifacts into rhythmic dances expressing what Zollar's
spoken text called the inimitably "stylistic way" that African
Americans communicate.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, Western theater dance has a long tradition of
saturating dances with character or folk gesture. But it's usually an
outsider's game, and Zollar not only belongs to the people she
portrays but  also seeks to convey something more essential than
entertaining mannerisms: the deep creative impulse in the most
commonplace human interactions.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald K. Brown's "Exotica" offered its own sketches of African
American style, attempting to break down stereotypes by juxtaposing
images of violence and anguish to traditional affirmations of faith
such as the ballad "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."</TE>
<TE>   Brown built ensemble sequences inventively, highlighting the
density of the dancing with moments of stillness or documentary
motion (people wandering across the stage as if on a street). But
this excerpt from a full-evening work lurched uncomfortably from
pop-influenced divertissement to somber social portraiture, and back.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Wunmi's costumes proved curiously backdated, with
crushed velours and Afro wigs on view, as if what we saw somehow
needed to be placed in some other time than the present.</TE>
<TE>   Although the title and program note for Bebe Miller's "My Science"
encouraged you to think about "heavy water, the collision of matter
and the mechanics of relationship," the piece  used rock and
Bulgarian music to accompany another turbulent and ultimately
despairing Miller essay on contemporary sexual politics.</TE>
<TE>   Women watching and approaching men who refused to commit to
anything other than a defensive isolation opened and closed the
piece. In between came other facets of female frustration, male anger
and Miller's engulfing, flyaway physicality. The company danced with
great authority here, with Antonio Sisk and Tracy Vogt especially
prominent as the first couple to meet, tussle and part.</TE>

<HD>Listening Closely to the Sounds of 'Silence'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Silence is seldom golden. Neither is Michael Datcher's long one-act
play "Silence."</LD>
<LD>   Datcher's poetry, essays and a memoir have received acclaim. But
his bio reflects no previous theatrical experience. "Silence," which
he wrote and directed, played a single performance Friday in the
Harold M. Williams Auditorium at the Getty Center.</LD>
<LD>   The title character, Birmingham Silence (Jenoyne Adams), is a
famous performance artist who's conducting a brutal boot camp for
disciples who want to teach at her studio. She claims to have
narrowed the pool of candidates from thousands to just four--all,
like herself, African American women. She'll pick only two. The setup
sounds like "A Chorus Line" set in the performance art world.</LD>
<TE>   The contenders include two sisters: Addie Mae (Jennifer Bowens),
who can't find a good man, and Denise (Ramee Randall), who's a
married man's mistress.</TE>
<TE>   Also competing are Carole (Fumilayo Bankole), who has left her
twin sons in the hands of her white husband, and Cynthia (Yuri Hinson
Tabu).  Cynthia recently attempted to hang herself, after years of
sexual addiction and parental abuse. The other candidates are
relatively carefree.</TE>
<TE>   Datcher's text doesn't acknowledge this disparity with enough
detail. However, he has Silence requiring Cynthia to use an actual
noose in her art.</TE>
<TE>   Silence was also an abused child. Her minister father applied
pliers to her tongue and taped a pacifier into her mouth to keep her
quiet. How Silence overcame all that to become an artist who has been
profiled on "60 Minutes" is never explained.</TE>
<TE>   Silence now employs her father's pacifier technique on the
candidates and on Free (Jaha Zainabu), who appears to be her
secretary. These are the play's most dramatic moments.</TE>
<TE>   The women's monologues veer perilously close to the pretentious
and the impenetrable, and they show up too soon, before the audience
is oriented to what's going on. It's unclear if their style
represents an acerbic judgment on the performance art scene or if
Datcher hasn't translated his language well enough from the realm of
spoken poetry into that of a play.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the four job candidates are the same as those of the
four girls killed in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, and the play
is set in the basement of a Birmingham church. We're told all this in
a program note. The reference is unmentioned in the text and comes
off as more of a red herring than a metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Childs wrote a score that serves as a virtually constant,
mood-enhancing background, performed admirably by a live band. But
the music and the spoken words occasionally distract attention from
each other, unhinging the focus.</TE>

<HD>An Unforgettable Character in Animation</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During an interview in 1988, I asked Oscar-winning cartoon director
Chuck Jones how he got such convincing performances from his
characters. He replied, "I didn't think this out philosophically, but
every character I worked with came from inside: Daffy Duck is inside
me. Bugs is there too, in the sense that he's what I'd like to be.
But Daffy is what I know full well I am. You can dream about being
Bugs, but when you look in the mirror in the morning, you see Daffy."</LD>
<LD>   For millions of animation fans, Chuck's death Thursday at age 89
marked the end of the pageant of wonderful characters he and his
fellow artists at Warner Bros. created: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile
E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Pepe LePew, the Road
Runner, Sylvester and Tweety. For me, it also marked the end of a
friendship that had lasted almost 24 years.</LD>
<LD>   Like most baby boomers, I grew up watching Warner Bros. cartoons
on TV--and became a fan of Chuck Jones without realizing it. Even as
a kid, I liked some cartoons better than others because Bugs and
Daffy and Porky and Elmer were funnier in them. When I began to study
animation seriously, I learned to recognize the razor-sharp timing
and adroit balance of verbal and physical humor that marked Jones'
directorial style.</LD>
<TE>   But that was long after the Warner Bros. studio had closed, and
Chuck Jones seemed like an icon from a long-past cartoon golden age.
So I was dumbfounded when I walked into class at UCLA the day after
my first long article about animation was published in the Los
Angeles Times to find a message on the blackboard: "Charles, Chuck
Jones wants you to call him." He had liked my article and invited me
to his offices at Sunset and Vine to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I was in the right place when I saw the sign on the front
door: "Acme Company. We make superior Acmes." Chuck spent about an
hour with me and encouraged me to write more--heady praise for a
part-time writer and grad student. He presented me with a cel from
the special "A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court" and, best
of all, he invited me to visit again.</TE>
<TE>   Spending more time with Chuck, I realized that the director of
some of the funniest short films ever made--in animation or live
action--was also a gracious, generous and witty friend.</TE>
<TE>   If we talked about his films, he always praised the artists who
had worked with him. "Rabbit of Seville"? That cartoon succeeded
because writer Mike Maltese had given Bugs such wonderful lines as
"You're so next!" "A Bear for Punishment" owed its hilarity to Ken
Harris' brilliant animation of Mama Bear's high kicking tap dance,
executed with the frowsy elan of Edith Bunker auditioning for the
Ziegfeld Follies. Chuck spoke as if he'd just stayed out of the way
and let the artists do their work.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chuck took great pride in his films and the honors they
received ("I'm a modest man, but I have a lot to be modest about"),
there was a self-deprecating streak in his humor.</TE>
<TE>   He said that when he was a student at Chouinard Art Institute, his
dream was "to go to Paris and get a place among the chimney pots and
paint and die at some ancient age like 37. But I came to the horrid
realization that it costs money to die poor: You've got to get to
Paris, you've got to rent an apartment, you've got to buy all those
cobwebs .... " Poverty forced him to go into animation, and we're all
the richer for it.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck was an extremely erudite man who enjoyed discussing Damon
Runyon, Dorothy Parker and George Bernard Shaw--it's no wonder his
Bugs Bunny could flimflam Daffy and Elmer with his patter. He liked
to quote Santayana's definition of a fanatic, "One who redoubles his
effort after he loses sight of his goal," to describe Wile E.
Coyote's monomaniacal pursuit of the Road Runner. The juxtaposition
of the author of "Realms of Being" and the hapless consumer of Acme
Batman suits, earthquake pills and catapults sums up the breadth of
his interests.</TE>
<TE>   He had a special fondness for a well-turned phrase and liked to
cite Mark Twain: "The difference between the right word and the
almost-right word is the difference between the lightning bolt and
the lightning bug." When I described his hilarious Road Runner-Coyote
cartoons as "forming a vast fugue on the theme of The Chase," Chuck
smiled at me and said, "That's a good line. I may use it."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many old artists, Chuck was genuinely excited by the new
work being done in his field. He loved the art of animation and
wanted to see it continue. The Disney features of the early '90s,
from "The Little Mermaid" to "The Lion King," delighted him. When I
introduced some of the young artists to him, he complimented them and
asked to see their sketchbooks. "Every artist has 100,000 bad
drawings in him," he commented, "and the sooner you get through them,
the better it is for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   But Chuck had no patience for inferior work. He would scowl and
dismiss a bad cartoon as "about as funny as a sack of wet mice." He
complained with equal fervor about obtuse studio executives,
conservative Republicans, second-rate films--and old age. At his 80th
birthday party, someone asked him how it felt to be an old man; he
replied, "I don't feel like an old man, I feel like a young man with
something terribly wrong with him!" His quip hid a darker reality.
Over the last few years, he grew increasingly impatient with his
body's failure to stay as nimble as his mind. The last time I visited
Chuck at his home in Corona del Mar, he stayed seated the entire
time, rather than use the cane or the walker by his chair. Wile E.
Coyote could limp away from a disaster and be back to normal in the
next scene; Chuck couldn't, and he resented it.</TE>
<TE>   If all his characters did come from inside him, I'm hoping that
the mirrors in heaven are a little more accurate and that Chuck
finally gets to see he really was Bugs.</TE>

<HD>Contact Is Made With John Cage's Free Spirit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 90th anniversary of John Cage's birth, at Good Samaritan Hospital
in Los Angeles, is Sept. 5. August marks the 10th anniversary of his
death in New York. It is, in other words, a John Cage year.</LD>
<LD>   Cage's influence on music and musical thought, on visual artists
and poets and on critical thinking in general, has been incalculable;
he was provocative during 60 years of active art-making, and his work
provokes still. From Perth to Paris, in Bremen and Berlin and
Montreal and Milwaukee, at the alternative space Sushi in San Diego
and at Carnegie Hall in New York, Cage concerts and conferences and
festivals are being mounted this year.</LD>
<LD>   Germans in the town of Halberstadt have appropriated the largest
Renaissance organ ever built, and come up with the cockamamie idea of
taking the title of Cage's "ASLSP," which stands for "as slow as
possible," literally. The performance began on Cage's birthday last
September with a year-and-a-half rest; the first sound won't be heard
until next January; the piece will end in the year 2640.</LD>
<TE>   The hometown Cage celebration is at  California Institute of the
Arts, and it is extensive--if not that extensive. Eight concerts that
run through May began with a percussion evening Feb. 15. On Thursday
and Friday, at Roy O. Disney Music Hall, there was a survey of mostly
conventional early music from the '30s and '40s, as well as examples
of electronic works from the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   CalArts can be an agreeable place to encounter Cage (even though
the school has provided too little institutional support for the
festival and done an inadequate job in getting the word out).
Anti-institutional though he was, Cage had a fondness for this
one--it was the only school from which he was willing to accept an
honorary degree. The composer and pianist James Tenney, who teaches
at CalArts and who has mounted this festival, was a longtime Cage
colleague. Many of the performers are his students, and he will play
one of Cage's most famous works, the "Sonatas and Interludes for
Prepared Piano," on April 12.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere at the Thursday and Friday concerts was bracing.
The student performances were, if not always technically or
interpretatively expert, fresh and serious. And the first half of
Thursday's program provided a rare opportunity to hear little-known
early Cage works from the '30s, written in Los Angeles just before
and after he studied with Schoenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Cage's earliest extant music, three songs to Gertrude Stein texts,
was first sung in tremulous voice by the gay activist Harry Hay (for
the ladies at Santa Monica Women's Club in 1932), and so it was here
by a young singer, Tany Ling. The Clarinet Sonata was declared
unplayable in 1933 by the principal clarinetist of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, but it made a lively impact here in a stellar
performance by Sam Torrisi.</TE>
<TE>   Other early pieces demonstrated Cage's explorations of raw sounds
in a percussion Trio, as well as his more academic experiments with
dissonant counterpoint meant to impress Schoenberg in the
"Composition for Three Voices" and "Three Pieces for Flute Duet."</TE>
<TE>   "Music for Wind Instruments," which needed a more percussive
performance than it got, is Hindemith meets Varese.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, there were pleasing performances of some of Cage's
most accessible music from the '40s, especially Phala Tracy's of the
Satie-esque harp piece, "In a Landscape," Debby Penberthy's singing
of the sweet, solemn "Experiences No. 2," and Zachary Scott's
colorful playing of the "Suite for Toy Piano."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the program was "The Perilous Night" for prepared piano.
The response to it in 1943 made Cage question music's ability to
express emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Written in response to the loneliness and terror of his unhappy
marriage, it was heard only as woodpeckers in a belfry. Today,
pianists tend to emphasize the music's agitation. Trevor Berens,
however, was a cool Cage-ian.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's program included more vocal music from the '40s, securely
sung by Nina Sun Eidsheim, who also performed "Sonnekus2,"  monotone
chanting of a deconstructed biblical text interrupted by Satie
cabaret songs.</TE>
<TE>   But the main feature was electronic work of a very different
nature. These pieces require that performers creatively realize music
out of graphic notation. In "Cartridge Music," sound is produced by
inserting various objects into amplified phonograph cartridges.
"Variations II" is the most flexible music Cage wrote, with
performers deciding upon their own instruments and sounds, then
interpreting measurements taken from transparencies of lines and
dots.</TE>
<TE>   Modern electronics can make these works sound overly glitzy, and
so they did here. For "Variations II," several performers hovered
around laptop computers, a glowing Apple logo the main visual
stimulus. But nothing went on too long, and the sounds were generally
interesting ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Imaginary Landscape No. 5," realized by Bob Bellerue, was more
curious. It is a score for making a tape out of excerpts from any 42
phonograph records using chance operations. Cage's own tape, created
for a 1952 dance, used jazz recordings, and Bellerue did the same
with recordings from the era. But his was not a handmade tape, rather
the result of a modern computer's resources.</TE>
<TE>   Bellerue poses interpretative issues. To what extent are period
instruments and period practice relevant to electronic music of the
'50s? This "Imaginary Landscape" realization was schizophrenic.
Period recordings turned it into something that sounded like a
sparkling modern collage of old jazz. Still, at a quick two minutes,
it cooked. And in the best Cage tradition, it left us with questions,
not answers.</TE>

<HD>3 Projects Examined Bolt by Bolt</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Engineers can be a stubborn lot--tech-savvy dreamers whose passion
for a project may increase proportionately with the opposition to it.
And in tonight's Discovery Channel special, "Engineering the
Impossible" (9 p.m.), that "Damn the naysayers, full-speed ahead!"
spirit is in full bloom.</LD>
<LD>   Three projects of staggering scope, each still pretty much at the
drawing-board stage, are covered: the world's tallest building, the
biggest ship and the longest bridge.</LD>
<LD>   The world-class building is being planned for the harbor in Hong
Kong as a means of addressing the problem of too many people and too
little land. The cone-shaped, residential/commercial hybrid would
rise 170 stories and cost about $10 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed $11-billion ship, envisioned as a mile-long floating
city of 30,000 well-heeled, full-time residents, would cruise the
globe at a leisurely 10 knots. Those on board would take ferries to
various ports of call since the behemoth, with a working name of
Freedom Ship, wouldn't fit in most harbors.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-mile-long Gibraltar Bridge, meanwhile, with a cost estimated
at $15 billion, would link Spain with Morocco and be part of a road
system linking the continents.</TE>
<TE>   The projects' potential as terrorism magnets are not covered, but
possible construction problems and proposed solutions in "Engineering
the Impossible" are examined bolt by bolt, which eventually reveals
the most daunting challenge: keeping viewer interest afloat for the
two-hour running time. On this front, the program ventures into
troublesome waters.</TE>
<TE>   The projects are certainly interesting enough, but the slickly
produced program piles on the background information to the point of
diminishing returns. By the end, it feels like we've been watching
the world's longest special.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Peace Requires a Palestinian State</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yossi Klein Halevi's Feb. 21 commentary, "How Do We Cope? Less and
Less Every Day," was just another diatribe filled with convenient
viewpoints and selective memory.</LD>
<LD>   Halevi asks if "the Middle East will ever tolerate the lone
non-Arab state in its midst." An equally important question is, "Will
Israel ever let the Palestinians have their own state?"</LD>
<LD>   For years Palestinian towns were under Israeli military
occupation. Israeli soldiers walked the streets toting automatic and
semiautomatic weapons, leveling any home of a suspected "terrorist."
In most social circles, military occupation is considered a form of
terrorism in itself.</LD>
<TE>   So, why is Halevi surprised there still remains Palestinian
resentment toward Israel? Why would anyone expect the Palestinians to
cease aggression when no one is facilitating the formation of a
Palestinian state and Israel has built settlements in areas that were
designated as Palestinian? I could go on. But, who's listening
anyway?</TE>
<TE>   Todd Groves</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Halevi describes what it is like trying to live under terrorist
conditions: "Daily life has itself become the threat: a crowded
street corner, an outing at a pizza shop, a bat mitzvah celebration.
It is a war without limits: This month, terrorists broke into a house
in the Jordan Valley and killed a woman and her 11-year-old
handicapped daughter as the child tried to crawl away."</TE>
<TE>   To the Palestinian apologists who write to complain about the
Israeli responses to terrorism: The above, "killed an . . .
11-year-old . . . as the child tried to crawl away," is an example of
the heroic Palestinians efforts. Another example was the Palestinian
college girl who blew up herself and an 80-year-old Israeli man. A
pizza parlor and a disco full of kids?</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists attack and the Israelis respond. Don't you think
it's getting to the point that they just want to level a Palestinian
city and say enough is enough--stop the violence or else? Do you
think we would have their self-control?</TE>
<TE>   Norm Galston</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is refreshing to read "Palestinians Must Take Charge of Their
Own Destiny" (Commentary, Feb. 20), by Fawaz A. Gerges, who
recognizes the major source of the Palestinians' suffering: the
misguided policies of Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Intentionally or not, Arafat caused the shift of the majority of
Israeli public opinion from the peace camp to the right and helped
the election of Ariel Sharon. The peace camp still has many followers
in Israel, like soldiers refusing service in the occupied
territories.</TE>
<TE>   Let us hope that most Palestinians will soon get tired of the
reciprocal violence and make their voices heard. An agreement that
the majority of Israelis and Palestinians can accept with
self-respect and mutual recognition is the only way toward a fully
independent, economically viable Palestinian state. It is the best
guarantee for the security of Israelis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Parks Support Backs Blacks Into a Corner," Opinion, Feb. 17:
Kudos to Ed Boyer for his completely cogent, thoroughly readable
article. The resounding hue and cry arising from among certain black
leaders in support of LAPD Chief Bernard Parks is illogical and,
ultimately, ill-advised. While ensuring that Rep. Maxine Waters,
Councilman Nate Holden and Danny Bakewell, et al., retain their power
base, the rhetoric they now bandy about is little more than an
exercise in pandering to the worst fears of the black community. Most
important, as Boyer noted so eloquently, the inexplicable embrace of
Parks will only result in an additional minimalization and
marginalization of this shrinking segment of the electorate.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Bilingual Schooling Battle Flares Anew," Feb. 20: To
summarize, state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) has introduced
legislation that states: "The instruction shall be understandable to
the pupil and shall be integrated into the regular school day." The
article continues: "That, critics say, constitutes a return to
bilingual education."</LD>
<LD>   What can possibly be wrong with a bill that provides for
instruction that the pupil understands? When are we going to get it?
If the pupil is not understanding the instruction, it is not
instruction, it is noise. All pupils, even those who are not yet
proficient in English, deserve to be able to understand their
teachers and their lessons. Otherwise, what are we teaching, who are
we teaching and who are we systematically leaving behind?</LD>
<LD>   Marilyn Kessler</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is one piece of consistent, verified data that I seldom see
mentioned in articles regarding bilingual education: It may take a
child but a year or two to speak a second language, but it takes four
to seven years for that same child to develop what's known as
academic proficiency--the ability to understand demanding grade-level
content.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, thousands of students are sitting in
classrooms receiving instruction in a language they don't understand,
with texts they're unable to read, and are given work that makes no
sense to them. While their English-proficient classmates are moving
forward in math, reading, writing and critical thinking skills,
students in the process of acquiring English are falling behind at a
horrific rate. The only person helped by "the law that Ron Unz
bought" (Proposition 227) was Unz.</TE>

<LD>As a Medi-Cal eligibility worker in the El Monte district, I totally
agree with "County's Computer System Is Botching Medical Benefits"
(Feb. 17), regarding the problems facing workers and participants due
to the inability of the new computer system to fulfill its
expectations as being simpler, faster and more accurate. But I was
very much disappointed with the statement you quoted from officials
with the county Department of Public Social Services who "blame the
majority of continued errors on county workers."</LD>
<LD>   Even though I cannot speak for all of the workers in so many
county districts, I can tell you that Medi-Cal workers at El
Monte--in the approved section/Spanish-language cases only--have
under their responsibility an average of 700 cases each, a volume of
work that makes it humanly and practically impossible for us workers
to do either good, accurate or expeditious work. And if on top of
that you add a computer system that is not working as it is supposed
to, the results have to be catastrophic sooner or later.</LD>

<LD>As a medical oncologist, I would like to thank The Times for
encouraging women to continue to get annual mammograms ("Mammograms
and Hope," editorial, Feb. 16). A large majority of breast cancer
screening trials have shown about a 30% reduction in deaths from
breast cancer for those women who are routinely screened with
mammograms. Deaths from breast cancer have been falling since 1989 in
this country, and since 1995, breast cancer deaths have been reduced
by 3.4% per year. If we continue this trend, there will be a 74%
reduction in breast cancer deaths by 2015. Clearly, mammograms have
contributed to this result. I urge all women of average risk for
breast cancer, aged 40 and older, to continue to get annual
mammograms, just as I do.</LD>

<HD>Student-Run Classes Are UC's 'Dirty Little Secret'</HD>

<LD>Re "Students Fear Effects of Sex Class Scandal at Berkeley," Feb. 21:
The furor over the sex classes at UC Berkeley reveals the dirty
little secret of the UC system. It doesn't do a very good job of
undergraduate education. The prestigious reputation of the UC is
based on research programs, graduate schools and professional
schools. Undergraduates, on the other hand, make do with lecture
classes of over 100 students, seminars taught by graduate students
and, apparently, classes (for credit, no less) taught by each other.</LD>
<LD>   As the father of a college student and a high school senior, I
have spent some time over the past few years researching California's
public and private colleges and universities. My daughter attends Cal
State Long Beach. They keep her so busy there with required classes
and participation in the university choir and the music department
that she would not have time to take a sex class even if one were
offered. The CSU system emphasizes undergraduate education as a first
priority of professors.</LD>
<LD>   I would advise any parent involved in helping a son or daughter
choose a college to do some research. Visit the school's Web site,
get a catalog and take a campus tour. Don't choose a school based
just on its reputation. Your dream school could turn into a
nightmare.</LD>

<TE>   Sex can be a lot of fun, one-on-one or in groups. Sex is also a
valid field of study because it is something that affects many
people's personal and social lives. It seems that some administrators
at UC Berkeley feel that sex is invalid both for study and for
pleasure, considering that they suspended a course after finding out
that some of the students actually elected to enjoy sex together and
that some students chose to study stripping.</TE>
<TE>   Last year I spent a semester studying sexuality, gender and
identity in a specialized program set in Amsterdam. As part of that
program, I went to a peep show, saw a sex show and visited a sex
museum. I learned about migrant prostitutes, Dutch culture,
transsexual issues and much more.</TE>
<TE>   Since sex and sexuality affect so many of our lives in such deep
ways, we have to be open to studying them. If some of us elect to
participate in fun sexual activities in conjunction with or separate
from our course work, nobody should have the right to stop us or to
say that that makes the study of sex and sexuality invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Sakurai</TE>
<TE>   Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This is an outrage. If the repressive UC Berkeley officials can
suspend a class on male sexuality and its field trip to a gay strip
club, what's next? Will they no longer offer courses in "The Joy of
Garbage" or professional wrestling? What's to become of upper-level
Grateful Dead classes? If this dangerous trend continues, it's
entirely possible that students will be forced to study math, science
or business while they're in college.</TE>

<HD>Pearl's Killing Should Bring Clarity of Purpose</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Reporter Held Captive Is Dead, Videotape Shows," Feb. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, Daniel Pearl's murderers performed a salutary
function: Just in case--after Sept. 11--anyone was still unsure
exactly what civilization is up against, they have erased all doubt
by vividly showing how subhuman is the savagery we're at war with.
How else to describe reveling in the gratuitous murder of an innocent
hostage for the benefit of cameras?</LD>
<LD>   Should our response to these murderers and those directing them be
any less than the Allied response when the Axis evils of Nazism,
fascism and imperialism warred against civilization 60 years ago? Our
response then was--and again should be--to turn it back, hunt it
down, root it out, kill it. I hope our leaders will bring to this
task the same clarity of mission with which Churchill and Roosevelt
defended civilized values.</LD>
<TE>   Jodie Munden</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To say that Pearl was executed is a misuse of language. The
correct term for what was done is murder. Execution is defined,
according to my Webster's New World Dictionary, as "a putting to
death by a legal sentence." Please note: a legal sentence.</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Piracy Is Jeopardizing American Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</AU>
<BD>Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) is chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and the judiciary subcommittee on crime
and drugs.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To borrow a phrase, a mind is a terrible thing to steal. But that is
precisely what criminals do when they pirate the products of American
innovators and artists. When they reproduce the work of musicians,
actors, writers and directors, they not only steal thousands of U.S.
jobs and billions of dollars in profits, they steal the product of
American imagination and creativity.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has addressed this problem legislatively, but only
through more effective enforcement and aggressive bilateral and
international agreements and partnerships is there any chance of
combating it. And we must do more to persuade offending governments
that it is in our mutual interest for them to implement and enforce
intellectual property theft laws, and educate them about the
smothering impact piracy has on productivity and creativity.</LD>
<LD>   Theft of movies, software, music or books--whether a bootleg DVD
copy of "Monsters Inc." for sale from a street vendor or a computer
program, copied and redistributed--is a growing worldwide problem.
And the advent of broadband and other emerging technologies is making
theft and reproduction of intellectual property easier. Copies of
movies, albums and software can be copied seamlessly by inexpensive
portable CD and DVD factories around the world.</LD>
<TE>   Counterfeit products overwhelm international markets. The Business
Software Alliance estimates that 94% of China's software market is
pirated; In Ukraine, 89%; in Vietnam, 97%; and in Bolivia, 81%. Why?
Because it's easy.</TE>
<TE>   Full-length movies can be downloaded in less than 15 minutes. The
film "Lord of the Rings" hit the streets of Afghanistan as quickly as
it hit American theaters. Video games costing $50 in the U.S. are
sold for 75 cents in China. And with CDs and DVDs, the reproduction
is top quality.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, damage to our economy is growing, and piracy is
jeopardizing American jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. ought to be prepared to provide governments with the type
of law enforcement expertise and resources required to catch
intellectual property pirates operating within their borders. There
were promising signs at the recent World Economic Forum in New York
that many in the international community understand the depth of the
problem and agreement that we need to act now before the problem
worsens.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. demonstrated its leadership in 1997 when Congress passed
and President Clinton signed into law the No Electronic Theft and the
Digital Millennium Copyright acts. Together they have enabled law
enforcement authorities to shut down networks of pirates. A recent
raid of an illegal CD counterfeiting operation in Paramount, Calif.,
seized $56 million of equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the entertainment and software industries hold out hope
that their scientists and engineers can provide the answer by
developing technologies to make impossible the pirated reproduction
of their products. I'm optimistic that efforts underway in the
private sector can address this challenge, but if no industry
consensus develops in the near term, government may need to act.</TE>
<TE>   Let's protect American creative genius, and let those whose tools
and skills are their intellect and imagination reap the benefit of
their creations.</TE>

<HD>Mammography Doesn't Come Without Risk</HD>

<AU>SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Samuel S. Epstein, M.D., professor emeritus of
environmental medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago
School of Public Health, is chairman of the Cancer Prevention
Coalition.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The updated federal guidelines announced by Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson on Thursday strongly recommending annual
screening mammography for women over the age of 40 are unlikely to
resolve the current debate. The guidelines, surprisingly based on an
unpublished analysis by an independent advisory board, ignore
evidence on the risks of breast cancer from mammography.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, they dismiss evidence on the effectiveness of monthly
breast self-examination combined with annual clinical breast
examination by trained health care professionals. None of these
concerns are relevant to diagnostic mammography, the value of which
is unchallenged.</LD>
<LD>   Screening mammography poses significant and cumulative risks of
radiation, particularly for premenopausal women. The routine practice
of taking four films of each breast annually results in approximately
1 rad (radiation absorbed dose) exposure. This is about 1,000 times
greater than exposure from a chest X-ray, which is broadly focused on
the entire chest rather than narrowly on the breast. The
premenopausal breast is highly sensitive to radiation, each 1 rad
exposure increasing breast cancer risk by about 1%, with a cumulative
10% increased risk for each breast over a decade's screening.</LD>
<TE>   Radiation risks are further increased fourfold for the 1% to 2% of
women who are unknowing silent carriers of the A-T
(ataxia-telangiectasia) gene. By some estimates, this accounts for up
to 20% of all breast cancers diagnosed annually.</TE>
<TE>   All these risks are greater for women in their 30s, who are being
encouraged to undergo "baseline screening," for which there is no
evidence of any future relevance.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1928, physicians have been warned to handle cancerous
breasts with care, for fear of accidentally disseminating cells and
spreading the cancer. Mammography entails tight and often painful
breast compression, particularly in premenopausal women. This may
lead to the lethal spread of malignant cells by rupturing small blood
vessels in or around small undetected breast cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Another serious danger of mammography is the fact that mammography
centers are being overbooked as a result of the aggressive promotion
of premenopausal screening. Patients referred for diagnostic
mammography because of suspicious clinical or other findings are now
experiencing potentially life-threatening delays of up to several
months before they can be examined.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory panel's dismissal of self-examination and clinical
examination is inconsistent with the results of a September 2000
publication by leading University of Toronto epidemiologists. Based
on study of breast cancer mortality in 40,000 women, it was concluded
that monthly self-examinations following brief training coupled with
an annual examination by a trained health care professional is at
least as effective as screening mammography in detecting small
tumors.</TE>
<TE>   National networks of clinics staffed by nurses trained in teaching
monthly self-examination and conducting annual clinical examination
should be established to replace mammography screening. Apart from
their minimal costs, such clinics would empower women and free them
from increasing dependence on industrialized medicine and complicit
medical institutions.</TE>
<TE>   It should be further pointed out that the new federal guidelines
ignore the growing and inflationary costs of mammography. Screening
all premenopausal women, 20 million annually, would cost about $2.5
billion. That is equal to 14% of estimated Medicare spending on
prescription drugs. These costs would be increased fourfold if the
highly profitable machine and film industries succeed in replacing
film machines, which cost about $100,000 each, with the latest
high-tech digital machines, which cost about $400,000 each. The
latter have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
although there is no evidence of improved effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it may be noted that no nation other than the U.S.
recommends routine screening of premenopausal women.</TE>

<HD>Term Limits Fan Flames Between Officers and Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>XANDRA KAYDEN</AU>
<BD>Xandra Kayden is a senior fellow at the UCLA School of
Public Policy and Social Research.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years ago, the Police Protective League successfully fought to
oust Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams. The leadership of the
African American community came to the aid of the embattled African
American chief, and the community lost. We are replaying that
scenario, and all parties could lose.</LD>
<LD>   In an unexpected way, term limits may be undermining the capacity
of the Los Angeles Police Department to regain its former image as
the most professional, well-managed department in the country. This
very public and political campaign regarding the chief is fostered by
term limits and the possibility of a second term because it raises
expectation of influence by the league.</LD>
<LD>   Policing requires walking an extraordinarily political tightrope.
Any chief who tries to rein in the troops risks alienating them, as
has Bernard Parks. Any chief who bows to the demands of the union and
does not seek to discipline minor abuses is likely to lose the
support of a portion of the population, usually, but not always, the
poor and people of color.</LD>
<TE>   The union's most critical charge against Parks is that he
disciplined their behavior in inconsistent and small ways. His
approach is tough, but it can be compared to the "broken windows"
policing philosophy: going after the small offenses to stop the
development of greater crimes. Given a choice, the public is better
off with no offenses, not just punishment for the big ones.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits have been a popular solution to the problem of too
much power accruing in too few hands, although there are drawbacks
when they throw out the good guys with the bad. Some say that limited
terms at the state and local level are leaving too much of our public
policy in the hands of special interests and bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   However, limiting the term of an elected politician and limiting
the term of an appointed official is altogether different.
Politicians tend to get elected for the full number of terms allowed
because serious opponents prefer running for an open seat. In the
case of the post of police chief, the Police Protective League has
turned into a 24/7 opponent. No matter who the chief, there will be
conflicts and the league is there to protest.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League has an obligation to represent its
members' interests, but in this police department--the most
ethnically diverse in the nation--the union's leadership is
uncomfortably homogeneous. Minority groups and other unions within
the department support Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The low morale in the LAPD is a product of dissension as much as
it is the reality of a tough disciplinarian at the helm. The league
has run negative campaigns against the city in the past, and
doubtless the threat of a million-dollar television campaign that
trashes L.A. has had its effect, whether or not Parks is reappointed.
Those proposed ads must have been a factor in Mayor James K. Hahn's
mind as he faces the job of pulling the city out of recession and
building a case against Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   While term limits are not the cause of the hostility between the
chief and the league, they make the relationship so adversarial that
it is hard to imagine an effective police force in Los Angeles'
future.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best approach would be one seven-year term: There
would be no undue pressure on the incumbent and enough time to make
an imprint on the department. If the chief can't do the job, he or
she could be fired by the commission (with the appropriate approval
of the mayor and the City Council) at any time.</TE>

<BD>Larry McCarthy is president of the California
Taxpayers, a research and advocacy organization based in Sacramento.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without raising one dollar of additional tax, Proposition 42 on the
March 5 ballot would provide more stable, ongoing funding for
California highways, public transit and street maintenance. It would
help make our roads safer and relieve congestion by using the
existing gasoline sales tax to help solve the state's transportation
problems.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. is the nation's most congested urban area and has the highest
percentage of deteriorated roads in the U.S. To say the
transportation needs here are huge is an understatement. Proposition
42 would help deliver desperately needed revenue for fixing roads and
expediting projects such as rebuilding freeways, extending commuter
rail lines and improving bus service and operations. Speeding up
transportation projects would create thousands of jobs. The measure
would neither harm the economy nor slow its recovery by demanding
that government spend more. It would make use of existing
revenue--the gasoline sales tax. There would be no new tax or fee.</LD>
<LD>   Although Proposition 42 would provide badly needed relief for
commuters, it represents a modest 1% of the state budget. It also
would provide strong accountability. An annual audit of Proposition
42 funds would be required to guarantee that transportation projects
were delivered on time and on budget.</LD>
<TE>   This oversight would ensure that our taxes were used efficiently
to generate the greatest results.</TE>

<HD>False News Demeans the Sender As Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEONARD R. SUSSMAN</AU>
<BD>Leonard R. Sussman is the senior scholar in
international communications at Freedom House.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's pledge that the Defense Department
would tell only the truth in seeking to influence public opinion
overseas is a welcome answer to the controversy over the role of
Defense's new Office of Strategic Influence. Rumsfeld's statement was
necessary because the press had reported some unnamed subordinates
declaring that "false" or "black" news would be used along with the
"white" news or truth.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld's rejection of disinformation is in the national
interest. There must be a clear separation between the very limited
permissible use of black propaganda for a tactical military purpose
and a broad, year-round strategy of truth-telling as persuasion.
While it is appropriate to influence friends or foes, "hearts and
minds" cannot be favorably influenced when a democratic society
resorts to falsity in delivering news or information .</LD>
<LD>   We should learn from the sorry history of disinformation. The
Soviet Union first established Department D in the KGB security
services. D stood for dezinformatsia. It used forged documents, false
quotations, misleading rumors and other false claims of events,
policies or relationships.</LD>
<TE>   In 1980, the Soviet Union accused the United States of creating
the AIDS epidemic to depopulate developing countries. The story was
printed widely after Moscow coordinated its own and satellite media
systems with political pressure on authoritarian African regimes. In
the end, the truth prevailed and the campaign was exposed. The Soviet
Union's legacy is now that of a nation based on lies, rumors and
distortions.</TE>
<TE>   When the CIA in the Cold War used foreign journalists to convey
U.S. "news," that revelation left all U.S. journalists tainted under
the suspicion--widely circulated by adversaries of the U.S.--that all
American reporters overseas were in the pay of the government.</TE>
<TE>   A hapless American foray into black news backfired in 1981 when
the White House claimed that a Libyan hit squad had been dispatched
to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. This account was never
confirmed, and the FBI eventually acknowledged the absence of any
such evidence.</TE>
<TE>   American attempts to use disinformation are generally regarded as
an aberration.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one crucial exception: disinformation as a military
tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Military use of false news has been widely hailed as eminently
useful and appropriate. In the Persian Gulf War, the major assault on
massed enemy troops was hinted as coming from the sea. Troop-laden
ships were clearly visible to the Iraqi forces waiting on shore.
Instead, massed U.S. tanks skirted the flank of the Iraqis and
destroyed their effectiveness. By floating false news, the ships had
been used as decoys, a tactic as old as warfare itself.</TE>
<TE>   The prime example of the military use of deception preceded the
massive landing of allied troops on the coast of Normandy in World
War II. Prior to that action, rumors had been carefully floated,
backed by actual feints of allied forces, implying that the invasion
of Europe would take place far to the south. About 20 German
divisions were removed from the real landing areas, helping the
allied assault.</TE>
<TE>   Stringent limitation on the use of black information must be a
matter of principle in a democratic society. Lies conceived in an
open society are readily uncovered for what they are, and both the
argument and the nation itself are demeaned. Truth can be far more
persuasive than black "news"--based on lies--particularly when U.S.
enemies have a clear history of misdeeds more horrendous than a
Washington writer can concoct.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, I worked as an editor in the Foreign
Broadcast Intelligence Service of the FCC. We listened to the
then-Axis countries--Germany, Italy and Japan--employ disinformation
to serve Nazi and fascist objectives. For the most part, the attempts
were ludicrous and were so recognized by Americans who were their
targets.</TE>
<TE>   It is eminently appropriate to seek strategic influence abroad.
Winning the minds and hearts of other peoples should not be
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   But, today, such strategic influence should be built on exposing
the record of terrorism and repression by tyrants, and on the
democratic aspirations of the people.</TE>

<LD>In this age of managed care, many of us no longer have easy access to
the best and brightest in medicine. Unless, of course, money is no
object--or someone else is picking up the tab. If that's the case,
you might get to experience something called the "executive
physical."</LD>
<LD>   For $2,000 and up, you can spend two days getting poked and
prodded, undergoing a battery of tests and talking at length to a
top-notch doctor about your eating habits, family medical history and
exercise routine.</LD>
<LD>   Executive physicals--a type of red-carpet treatment for corporate
honchos, Hollywood celebrities and the like--have become popular at
some top-flight medical institutions, including UCLA Medical Center,
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio,
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and Rush-Presbyterian in Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   Executive physicals offer patients something increasingly rare in
our health system: time with a doctor who isn't rushing to get to the
next patient.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you have a good insurance plan, an executive physical
probably won't be covered. In some cases, people pay out of pocket
for these programs. In others, corporations will provide such
physicals as a perk for key executives.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a move among corporate America and among some wealthy
people to get what they see as the state-of-the-art physical exam,"
said Dr. Ben Ansell, who runs UCLA's Comprehensive Health Program,
which began just eight months ago. About 700 people are expected to
go through the program this year, but Ansell confidently predicts
that the patient count could jump to 2,000 next year.</TE>
<TE>   The price tag for UCLA's program is $2,000 to $3,000. For $3,500
to $4,800, you can get the "Executive Physical Plus," where the two
days of care will include an extra three to four hours of additional
consultations with expert specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors are skeptical, wondering if patients who undergo
extensive physicals are really getting better care than the rest of
us i get at our annual exam.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary folks can "obtain the same information from their
physicians at home," said Dr. Yank Coble, an endocrinologist and
professor of medicine at the University of Florida at Gainesville,
speaking on behalf of the American Medical Assn. Blood tests are
blood tests, mammograms are mammograms, no matter where you get them.
UCLA's Ansell acknowledges that CAT scans and cholesterol tests
aren't any better at an academic research center than an ordinary
medical clinic.</TE>
<TE>   What UCLA offers, he says, is a chance to talk to experts. Some
men find it reassuring to know that their prostate exam will be done
by a leading specialist. A woman with questions about
hormone-replacement therapy may prefer to discuss the issue with an
academic researcher who is leading an important national study of
women's health.</TE>
<TE>   From a business standpoint, executive physical programs are a
valued employee benefit that may also reduce the likelihood that a
company's chief executive will be knocked out of action by health
problems, said Kate Sullivan, director of health policy issues at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives, she noted, often are rushing from one appointment
to another, traveling to out-of-town business trips and attending
board meetings and charity events.</TE>
<TE>   "Operating at a top-level job generates a lot of stress," Sullivan
said.</TE>
<TE>   A major advantage of the executive physical is convenience. A
patient sees some doctors, lots of tests are run and the results come
back quickly, with minimal disruption to one's schedule. Specialists
are available right there and can handle any immediate problems that
come up.</TE>
<TE>   That contrasts with the delays and inconvenience that most of us
must put up with when we visit the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Our doctor gives a physical exam and orders some blood tests,
which must be performed at a laboratory at another location approved
by the HMO.</TE>
<TE>   Blood and urine samples are taken and then we wait to get a card
in the mail from the doctor--maybe a few weeks later--telling us to
come in to talk about the results.</TE>
<TE>   One big health-care company that is skeptical of the executive
physical concept is Kaiser Permanente, which pioneered the concept of
thrifty medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "Our philosophy is, we are going to provide the maximum health
outcomes to all our members within our resources," said Dr. Allen
Bredt, a Kaiser oncologist who explains that the big HMO does not
perform executive physicals.</TE>
<TE>   The procedures for a physical are identical for all Kaiser
patients "whether they are an executive, a farmer, a nurse, a doctor
or whatever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From a societal standpoint, Bredt argues, it is a waste of medical
resources to spend additional money on a group such as top corporate
executives, who already are among the healthiest groups of people.
That's because there is a correlation between economic status and
health: The wealthy are healthier.</TE>
<TE>   If an executive physical turns up any problems that can't be
handled quickly, the patient must go to his or her regular doctor and
rely on insurance coverage to pay for any further treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Even if there is no problem, the follow-up can be an added burden
for the regular doctor, who may have to check a fat sheaf of reports
generated by the executive physical.</TE>
<TE>   During his 32-year career, Bredt said he has seen a handful of
patients who had executive physicals outside the Kaiser system.</TE>
<TE>   "They would bring in reams of paper from their physicals. The only
thing I ever had were false positive results," he said. "I had to do
additional studies and track things down and the patient was always
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   There is no conclusive proof that people who get the executive
physicals stay healthier and live longer than the rest of us.
Nobody's done a scientifically controlled randomized study comparing
the results of the executive physical with the one for the rest of
us.</TE>
<TE>   It's a nice treat if you've got $2,000 to spare. But until
somebody proves it provides more years of life, a healthy dose of
skepticism is in order.</TE>

<LD>Scientists are always writing articles about mice. Reporting on their
genes. On how their limbs grow. Plying them with chemicals. Making
them run mazes. When the draft of the human genome was finished, the
mouse was the next mammal in line to have its genome decoded.</LD>
<LD>   What's so good about a mouse? If a scientist had forgotten his
seminar notes one day last century, could it have been a gerbil that
ended up being the focus of all this attention? A hamster? A
chinchilla? A rhino? ! Mouse maven Muriel Davisson obligingly agreed
to try to answer these questions.</LD>
<LD>   Happenstance, in part, was behind the giddy rise of the mouse in
science, says Davisson, a senior staff scientist at Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. (The Jackson lab is stuffed to the
gills with thousands of different breeds of mice--spotty, fat,
pink-eyed, short-eared, you name it.)</LD>
<TE>   At the start of the 20th century, a scientist named William Castle
decided mice would be just the ticket for testing that newfangled
science of genetics. Later, other scientists--such as Clarence Cook
Little, founder of Jackson lab, carried on where Castle left off,
amassing a slew of mouse information, and discovering all kinds of
genetically different mice.</TE>
<TE>   Later, it was only natural that scientists gravitated toward the
mouse instead of, say, another little critter, because mice were so
well-known. But Castle and Little did choose mice for a reason.</TE>
<TE>   "They're small, they're economical, they're easy to house," says
Davisson. And they are speedy. "In nine weeks you can go from a
female getting pregnant to a new male or female," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, should you be interested in studying old mice, you won't
have to wait around for eons like you would if you were working with
a rhino. (Old mice can be really useful; a scientist at USC recently
told me he'd employed them to study the effects of aging on saliva
flow.) "One year in a mouse is equivalent to about 30 years in a
human--so you can have an old, aged mouse in three years," Davisson
says.</TE>
<TE>   Mice are also a lot like us, even if we're big, clodhopping and
short on fur. Our genomes are 85% to 95% identical. Our kidneys,
hearts and other facets of our physiology are much the same as those
of mice. Our embryos develop much the same way.</TE>
<TE>   And these days, researchers have a plethora of mice tailor-made
for studying diseases. Some of the mice have mistakes in the mouse
version of genes involved in human diseases; some of the mice are
high-tech, designed by modern genetic tricks.</TE>
<TE>   There are "nude" mice, discovered in 1962, which not only lack fur
but can't make important cells of the immune system. Scientists have
used them to study human cancers that are grafted onto the mouse.
There are mice with genetic constitutions that make them especially
aggressive, fat, wrinkly skinned or big-boned. There are mice that
lose their fur in patches. There are mice with names like "weaver,"
"staggerer" and "reeler," thus named for their ungainly gaits because
they lack cells in a region of the brain involved in balance.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, deafness, blindness,
congenital heart problems and diabetes--all can be studied in mice,
Davisson says. And new possibilities are emerging. The other day we
read about a strain that could be useful for studying preeclampsia, a
complication of pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Davisson's group has even come up with a mouse made for studying
Down syndrome. In humans, the condition--which causes mental
retardation, among other things--is due to a single, extra copy of
chromosome 21. Her lab managed to create mice that have extra copies
of many of the equivalent mouse genes. The mice, too, have problems
with learning and memory.</TE>
<TE>   One of the hottest areas, Davisson says, is using mouse strains to
study various aspects of behavior. If they could solve the
procrastination problem in mice, I, for one, would be eternally
grateful.</TE>

<HD>The Big Brushoff: Latest Plaque Fighter Passes Test</HD>

<LD>Triclosan, a popular germ-killer used in deodorants and soaps for
decades, was added to toothpaste three years ago. A new technology
enabled the antimicrobial to stick to teeth and gums for hours,
killing the microbes that thrive in plaque. After two clinical trials
and safety studies, the Food and Drug Administration granted Colgate,
which holds the patent for the technology, the right to claim that
its triclosan-containing Total Toothpaste worked against gingivitis.
Now the powerful ingredient has been tested as the latest thing in
toothbrushing, a liquid tooth cleaner. The results are published in
the current issue of the Journal of the American Dental Assn.</LD>
<LD>   A study of 124 men and women who had at least moderate plaque
buildup showed that the triclosan-fortified liquid reduced plaque
three times more effectively than the placebo liquid. Co-author Dr.
Martin Giniger, director of diagnostic sciences at the New Jersey
Dental School in Newark, said that after six months, triclosan
diminished gingivitis, the earliest form of gum disease, twice as
well as the placebo.</LD>
<TE>   Liquid tooth cleansers have been available in Europe since 1994,
but have only recently debuted in the U.S. Crest, Rembrandt and
Colgate have liquids--sometimes called liquid gels--on drugstore
shelves now. No triclosan-containing liquid has yet been evaluated by
the American Dental Assn., and no such product has reached the market
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressant Studied as Hot-Flash Treatment Without Hormones</TE>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy relieves hot flashes in most
menopausal women, but those who can't take estrogen have to put up
with the troublesome and embarrassing symptom. A solution for them
may be the antidepressant venlafaxine (Effexor).</TE>
<TE>   A four-week study of 221 women showed that venlafaxine reduced the
frequency of hot flashes in the treated group by as much as 60%,
depending on the dosage. Those flashes that did occur were less
severe as well. All the women either had been treated for breast
cancer or thought they were at high risk of the disease and so did
not want to undergo the therapy. To see if the benefit of the
antidepressant would last and what dose worked best, the Mayo Clinic
researchers continued to follow 102 of the women taking the
non-hormonal treatment for another eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The results of this study were recently published in Oncology
Nursing Forum, a medical journal. The researchers found that the hot
flashes continued to decrease in frequency and severity during the
two-month study period. And, says investigator Charles Loprinzi, a
Mayo Clinic oncologist, "The women got significant relief from half
the dose that is usually given to treat depression." The advantage of
that low dose is fewer side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Late-Night Snacking Might Be Prompted by Hormonal Imbalance</TE>
<TE>   Habitual midnight snacking may signal a stressed-out hormone
system more than a stress-filled life. Night eating, scientists are
beginning to think, isn't about hunger, but more likely the result of
a hormonal imbalance. Norwegian researcher Grethe Birketvedt and her
colleagues have studied a group of five people who eat more than half
their daily calories after bedtime and found that the night eaters
all have a weak hormonal response to stress.</TE>
<TE>   Birketvedt reports in the American Journal of Physiology:
Endocrinology and Metabolism that the hormones produced by two glands
that regulate sleeping and eating, and a third that releases
cortisol, a stress hormone, may be slightly off-kilter in the night
eaters, compared to healthy study participants. Birketvedt explains
that the interplay of these off-balance chemical messengers causes
biological confusion. The person tends to wake up in the middle of
the night instead of sleeping through. And, sure enough, the appetite
clicks in then too.</TE>
<TE>   It's not known what causes a weakness in the trio of glands known
as the HPA axis (for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), but there
may be a genetic connection. "Night eating does run in families,"
says Birketvedt, a researcher at the Institute of Clinical Medicine
at the University of Tromso in Norway. Disturbances in the HPA axis
also have been linked to fatigue syndrome, anorexia and depression.</TE>
<TE>   New Vaccine Shows Promise as a Way to Ward Off Staph Infections</TE>
<TE>   Some unfortunate people with weakened immunity become even sicker
in the hospital. They cannot resist infection by the potentially
deadly staph organism, and the invading bacteria multiply unimpeded
in their blood. From the bloodstream, the bacteria may travel to the
bones, the lining of the heart, the lungs and other internal organs.
Staph infection is the 13th leading cause of death in hospitalized
patients. Making the threat even worse is the increasing resistance
of the bacteria to antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   The solution may be a vaccine that recognizes the coating on the
bacteria, alerts the body to the danger and stimulates the production
of antibodies to destroy the bacteria. The first vaccine to do this
was tested in 892 very sick patients undergoing kidney dialysis at 73
centers, mostly in California. A control group of 906 patients
received a placebo injection of saline.</TE>
<TE>   One shot of StaphVAX cut the number of infections by nearly 60%,
and immunity lasted about 10 months. During the course of the
yearlong study, 86% of those tested had a high level of staph-killing
antibodies in their blood. Next year, Nabi, the biotechnology firm
that developed the vaccine, will begin final testing to confirm these
results.</TE>
<TE>   Day-Care Toddlers' Frequent Colds Lead to Benefit Later,
Researchers Say</TE>
<TE>   Doctors often like to reassure parents that the frequent colds
that plague toddlers in day care will give the children immunity to
bugs when they get older. The problem is that the common-sense
assertion has never been proven. Studies have yielded conflicting
results. Now, the first long-term study of nearly 1,000 children
finally gives firm scientific credence to the adage that a cold is an
educational experience for a child's immune system.</TE>
<TE>   University of Arizona researchers report in the Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine that toddlers in large day-care
centers had twice as many colds as those cared for at home. The
payoff was that between ages 6 and 11, the kids from large day-care
centers had the fewest colds. During grade school years, stay-at-home
children and those who attended centers caring for fewer than five
children had colds with about the same frequency. By age 13, the
protective effect of early bouts with cold viruses disappeared, and
all children had about the same number of infections. But by then, at
least, a cold for the child doesn't always mean a sick day for a
parent.</TE>

<HD>There's Nothing Fishy About the Benefits of the Real Thing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We often don't acquire a taste for fish until adulthood--unless you
count fish sticks, which sometimes end up as a favorite toddler food.
But fish is an important part of a healthy diet, and a taste well
worth acquiring.</LD>
<LD>   The research on fish eaters is mixed. Some studies show that the
rate of heart disease is lower in countries where fish is a major
part of the diet. But research from Finland, where fish consumption
is high, shows that the rate of heart disease is also high. When all
is said and done, the consensus continues to be that adding a
moderate amount of fish to the diet is a good idea.</LD>
<LD>   The fat contained in fish is rich in a special form of
polyunsaturated fatty acid called omega-3. The fattier the fish, the
more omega-3 it contains. Omega-3 seems to work like aspirin and make
the blood less "sticky" and thus less likely to form clots that could
lead to fatal heart attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Somehow, omega-3 also seems to lower the heart's susceptibility to
arrhythmias, which can be extremely dangerous and even fatal. On top
of that, new research shows that fish oil may help with some
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and even psoriasis.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everybody likes fish, and it would be nice if fish
oil capsules did the trick just as well. However, like most
supplements that try to extract what are believed to be the "active"
ingredients in foods, fish oil supplements are not the same as the
oil eaten in the fish itself.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, we don't know with certainty that it is just the
oil in fish that seems to be most protective. It might be something
else in the fish, or it might be the oil in combination with other
substances in the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Fish oil capsules contain very large doses of fish oil, which may
be too much of a good thing when it comes to blood clotting. For
example, if your blood is unable to clot properly, you might be at a
higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke. You might also have a problem if
you need to undergo emergency surgery, especially if the surgeon and
anesthesiologist don't know what you're taking. The large quantities
of fish oil in the capsules have other side effects, such as nausea,
diarrhea, gas and can leave a bad taste in your mouth.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, they should not be taken without consulting your
physician. Apparently, people in this country have figured that out,
because the sale of these supplements has dropped considerably while
consumption of fish has risen.</TE>
<TE>   One warning about eating fish: In January 2001, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration warned women who were pregnant or who might
become pregnant to avoid some varieties of fish that might be
contaminated with mercury. The warning was issued because of the
possible effects that mercury may have on the brain and nervous
system of a developing fetus.</TE>
<TE>   Those fish most likely to contain mercury are shark, swordfish,
king mackerel or tilefish. As a general rule, pregnant women are
advised to eat no more than 12 ounces of fish a week and to vary the
types of fish consumed so as to lessen the possibility of exposure to
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sources of Omega-3</TE>
<TE>   So which seafoods are the richest in omega-3? This chart from the
April 2001 issue of the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter may be helpful.
Although there is no actual U.S. recommendation for omega-3 intake,
the Canadian Food and Drug Administration recommends 1 to 1.5 grams
per day. This table shows the number of grams of omega-3 in one
serving of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Type of fish -- Grams</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic mackerel -- 2.6</TE>
<TE>   Lake trout -- 2.0</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic salmon, farmed -- 1.9</TE>

<HD>Fertility in Reserve</HD>
<DH>After years of technical obstacles, scientists have found
ways to freeze eggs for later use, helping women whose ability to
have babies is threatened by disease or aging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>The bad news piled up on Shannon Lee faster than she could absorb it.
At 31, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Not only would she
need a double mastectomy, the subsequent radiation and chemotherapy
could leave her sterile, ending her dream of having a baby.</LD>
<LD>   But Lee's doctor also gave her hope. Confident that she would beat
the cancer, he urged her to undergo an experimental procedure in
which some of her eggs would be removed prior to chemotherapy, then
stored for fertilization at a later date, thereby preserving the
possibility that she could have a child. Heartened, Lee had 12 eggs
extracted and frozen at an infertility clinic.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something I had to do," the Buena Park woman said. "I may
not need the eggs, but it's nice to know they're there."</LD>
<TE>   Although the technology is in its early stages, egg
freezing--called egg cryopreservation--is now an option for women
like Lee who face an imminent loss of fertility. And soon, experts
say, the procedure should become a popular alternative for an even
larger pool of women, those who risk losing their eggs to normal
aging before getting the chance to have a baby.</TE>
<TE>   "There is growing optimism about egg freezing," says Dr. Patrick
Blohm, a Jacksonville, Fla., doctor who is among the most successful
U.S. researchers pursuing egg freezing. "We're still not there yet,
but we're getting close. There is momentum behind it now."</TE>
<TE>   At least a half-dozen reproductive health clinics nationwide have
established egg freezing programs, some of them as part of research
projects. Many other clinics perform egg freezing on a limited basis,
such as for young cancer patients.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have nothing to lose," Blohm says of women whose
fertility is threatened by illness. "We still have not opened up egg
freezing to the masses, but we're not too far away from doing that.
We are encouraged that some major hurdles have been overcome."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of infertility clinics nationwide are already touting
the service as an exciting new option for any woman who wants it. But
that kind of marketing, as well as highly publicized announcements of
a few births after egg freezing, has been criticized by some doctors
as premature. Published reports put the number of births worldwide
after egg freezing at 30, but some doctors say recent progress has
pushed that number closer to 100.</TE>
<TE>   "I think many of us are taking a wait-and-see attitude," says Dr.
Richard Paulson, an infertility specialist at USC who does not offer
egg freezing. "It's an unproven technology, and the success is hit or
miss as compared to embryo cryopreservation, which has an established
track record and for which national statistics are available."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. William Keye Jr., president of the American Society of
Reproductive Medicine, says perfecting the ability to freeze
unfertilized eggs will be a major milestone in reproductive health
care.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be the last group for whom we don't have good answers,"
Keye said. "I think we will finally have something to offer them."</TE>
<TE>   The Ability to Put Fertility on Hold</TE>
<TE>   Infertility doctors largely agree that egg freezing could have
vast medical and social implications.</TE>
<TE>   Men have long been able to freeze sperm, but preserving
oocytes--eggs--has proved to be a far different, and difficult, task.
Girls are born with 40,000 to 200,000 eggs, a supply that begins to
dwindle when menstruation begins. Medicines to treat cancer,
rheumatoid arthritis and some other diseases can destroy eggs. And an
estimated 3% of women have a genetic disorder called premature
ovarian failure, in which the ovaries shut down 10 to 20 years before
what is considered normal.</TE>
<TE>   Often, women who are about to lose their fertility undergo in
vitro fertilization, in which eggs are removed from the ovaries and
fertilized and the resulting embryos frozen. But many single women do
not have that option unless they agree to use sperm from an anonymous
donor or an acquaintance, and others do not want to create embryos
that may not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Besides providing hope to these women, routine egg freezing has
significant practical benefits. Women who wish to postpone
childbearing because of career demands could bank their eggs in their
20s or early 30s, when the eggs are healthier, for later use. Recent
research has found that egg quality begins to decline in the mid-30s.</TE>
<TE>   "There is massive interest among women who are around 38 and
haven't found their life partner and who want to lay down a few eggs
for later in life," says Michael Tucker, an Atlanta embryologist who
made headlines in 1997 when he announced the birth of twins after
freezing eggs and fertilizing them with a needle via intracytoplasmic
sperm injection. That development was considered a critical advance,
and Tucker says the announcement spurred thousands of inquiries from
single women.</TE>
<TE>   Karen, an unmarried businesswoman who asked to remain
unidentified, had eggs frozen at a Southern California infertility
clinic last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been so busy with my career," she says. "Relationships have
been there, but none where I wanted to have a baby with someone. But
family is very important to me, and all of a sudden I'm 37 years old.
I thought I had better stop time right now."</TE>
<TE>   Egg freezing also could eventually curb the use of donor eggs,
often required by older women who wish to become pregnant. For
couples who will still require donor eggs (if egg quality is poor,
for example), cryopreservation could reduce its expense and
inconvenience. Couples often pay about $20,000 for a single donor's
fresh eggs, but those costs could be reduced by as much as two-thirds
if the eggs could be frozen and divvied up among several couples,
says Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   And routine egg cryopreservation could help resolve the growing
dilemma of what to do with tens of thousands of unwanted frozen
embryos stored in infertility clinics worldwide. Some people consider
embryos human life and feel it's morally wrong to discard them.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, for example, was in a serious relationship when diagnosed
with cancer and could have had her eggs fertilized and frozen as
embryos. But both she and her boyfriend (they later married) were
uncomfortable with that option.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband didn't like it that we were basically creating a child
and then would be killing it if we didn't use it. An egg isn't a life
yet," says Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who completed cancer treatments a few months ago, still hopes
the cancer therapy did not destroy her fertility and that she and her
husband, Todd, can have a baby the natural way. But, she says, she
was willing to hedge her bet despite the $9,000 cost of egg freezing.</TE>
<TE>   Proper Thawing Is Critical to Egg Survival</TE>
<TE>   The growing enthusiasm for egg freezing rests largely on recent
progress in thawing eggs. In the past year, several researchers have
reported that 60% to 80% of eggs survive the critical thawing
process. That is comparable to the survival rate of thawed embryos,
says Blohm, who has produced several births from frozen eggs. Prior
to 1994, only 10% to 20% of eggs survived thawing.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike sperm, the egg is a large, fluid-filled cell that can
become riddled with damaging ice crystals when frozen. Now, however,
researchers are experimenting with a flash-freezing process, called
vitrification, that prevents ice crystal formation.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers are injecting sugar solutions into eggs before
freezing to better preserve them. A recent report in the journal
Fertility and Sterility showed that, in a study of 158 eggs, 63% of
eggs with a sugar solution survived freezing and subsequent thawing,
compared with only 13% in a control group.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have also been able to dramatically improve the
fertilization rate of thawed eggs by using intracytoplasmic sperm
injection, Tucker says. The outer shell of the egg, the zona, often
becomes impenetrable after freezing, but the procedure bypasses that
problem because the sperm is injected into the egg using a needle.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always known what the limitations of egg freezing were, but
we've now learned a lot more about how to circumvent the problems,"
says Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   Thawing and fertilizing frozen eggs is just half the battle,
however. Much less is known about the success of implanting the
ensuing embryos in the uterus and producing a baby. Only a portion of
thawed, fertilized eggs become viable embryos, says David Hill of the
ART Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a numbers game," Hill says. "The more eggs you have to start
with, the more likely you'll have a normal, healthy, cleaving embryo
by the time it's all done."</TE>
<TE>   Patients Should Note Procedure Is Still New</TE>
<TE>   Women interested in egg freezing should be aware of its unproven
track record, experts caution.</TE>
<TE>   People considering egg freezing should ask the doctor about his or
her thawing and fertilization success rates and if he or she has
produced any babies.</TE>
<TE>   "It does appear that there are some sites that do it better than
other sites," says Susan Lazendorf, an infertility specialist at the
Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va. "It should
be made clear to a patient that there are no real known success
rates. And the best bet is, if you have a partner identified, to go
ahead and make embryos."</TE>
<TE>   While predicting that egg freezing will become as useful as embryo
freezing "in the very near future," Blohm says the procedure should
still be considered experimental until data can show that birth
defects are not higher among children born from frozen eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have data that supports the safety of the process
before we open it up to wider use," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, cancer patients should be alerted to the option
despite the unknowns, says Dr. Beth Ary of the Reproductive Specialty
Center in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We have protocols involving males [with cancer] where they are
informed that they can store sperm," says Ary, who later this month
will freeze the eggs of a woman with colon cancer. "Most of these
[female] cancer patients would like to have known about egg
cryopreservation and IVF. Our big issue now is educating cancer
doctors about this."</TE>
<TE>   There is less agreement among infertility specialists on whether
egg freezing--as the technology stands now--should be encouraged
among single women who wish to store eggs as a way of putting
fertility on hold. Egg extraction is a low-risk procedure, although
it does involve minor surgery and temporary use of strong
medications. And it is expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Diaz, of West Coast Fertility Centers in Fountain
Valley, is one of the few doctors who now urge single women to
consider egg banking if they are concerned about advancing age. A
woman can have a blood test to determine if her ovaries are losing
function.</TE>
<TE>   "Age is very much a factor in what we do," Diaz says. "Women often
come in at 40 and want to freeze their eggs, but we really need to
see them much earlier."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, infertility doctors may accept these women for egg
freezing because the science is advancing and the demand is high,
says Lazendorf.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of patients are storing their eggs now and are
hoping for improvements in technology so they can use them," she
says. "They are waiting for the technology to catch up."</TE>

<HD>Making Final Days Peaceful</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE PANOSIAN DUNAVAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes a person's life ends quietly, sometimes amid a battery of
high-tech machinery and a bustling hospital staff. These days, the
choice is often beyond the control of patient or family. But not
always.</LD>
<LD>   I was reminded of these facts when I played an unwitting role in
the final chapter of a person I had never met.</LD>
<LD>   At a holiday party last year, a woman with a dark-haired bob
approached me with a warm greeting. "Thank you so much for your
advice on the phone," she said. "My mother died peacefully a few days
later."</LD>
<TE>   Initially, I didn't make the connection. Then I realized she was a
casual acquaintance who had called me weeks earlier in desperation.
After 15 months of spiraling downward, her mother, 89, lay dying in
an Orange County nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   First, the mother had fallen and fractured a spinal vertebra,
which limited her ability to walk. Over time, frailty and dementia
added to her plight. The last straw was a painful, blistering skin
disease called pemphigus for which she received periodic rounds of
high-dose cortisone medication. The cortisone, in turn, had triggered
high blood pressure and possibly heart disease. As a result of all
these miseries, the patient had gone from living in her own house to
assisted living to hospital to skilled nursing facility and back
again, her daughter explained to me.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the call, her mother's mouth, eyelids and skin were
actually healing, but her general status had taken a sudden, ominous
turn for the worse. Meanwhile, a conflict had arisen. The consulting
dermatologist was arguing for an aggressive rescue mission, including
transfer to a major hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The primary care physician, on the other hand, seemed content to
focus on mere comfort measures rather than one more temporary victory
in a losing war.</TE>
<TE>   By now, the patient could no longer voice her own wishes. However,
her views on end-of-life matters were well-known. Ten years earlier,
according to her daughter, she had even spelled them out in a letter.
Although she loved life, she wanted no heroic efforts if her medical
prospects were poor.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I sorted through these facts with my caller, I
realized I was in a delicate position. Strictly speaking, I was not
being asked for a professional opinion, but some fragment of insight
from years of working as a medical professional.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, there are many ways I could have responded. I could
have had the woman's mother transferred to the hospital where I work.
I could have found another doctor in Orange County to examine the
patient. Or I could have simply bowed out, which, honestly, was the
most tempting option.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, I asked myself: What did my caller really need? I decided
she needed help understanding and working with her mother's current
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Impulsively, I blurted out something like this: "You know, doctors
are people too. It's very common for specialists to offer aggressive
treatment. That's what will probably happen if she goes to the
hospital. That doesn't mean it's the right thing for your mother.
It's OK to question. It's OK to decline or stop treatments, if that's
what you think she would want."</TE>
<TE>   I guess it was the right thing to say. As I later learned, my
words furthered communication between the family and the primary care
doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Together they chose to keep the patient in the nursing home,
withhold further treatment except for pain medication and let nature
take its course.</TE>
<TE>   But when that holiday party conversation forced me to examine the
outcome of my uncensored remarks, I confess it gave me pause.</TE>
<TE>   After all, I have often stood on the other side of the fence,
engaged in long battles (along with other hospital specialists) to
preserve elderly, debilitated patients. I needed some reassurance
that my instinct that day had been right.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you have any regrets afterward?" I asked her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no regrets at all," she replied.</TE>

<HD>Let Common Sense Lead the Way</HD>
<DH>Marathon* Follow simple rules when training for and
participating in the race, including how to dress and what to
eat--and remember to listen to your body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between a third and a half of the 23,000 runners competing in
Sunday's L.A. Marathon will be first-timers, rookies bouncing along
on padded shoes, faith, and raw determination. After months of
obsessive training, no one wants to quit in front of friends, family
and the other million or so spectators.</LD>
<LD>   In all, it's a recipe for pushing oneself through the pain--to
worse pain and injury, doctors say. Over several hours of running, a
mild chafe can turn to a flaming rash. A blister can become a
crippling wound. And every marathon has its share of cramps, twisted
ankles and crashes to the pavement.</LD>
<LD>   Serious health problems are rare, but they do happen, said Dr.
Rudra Sabaratnam, a family physician at City of Angels Medical Center
and medical commissioner for the race.  In its 17 year,  the L.A.
Marathon has had no deaths, but there have been heart problems. Last
year, a man suffered a heart attack at mile 18 and was rushed to
Cedars Sinai Medical Center, where he was treated and released.</LD>
<TE>   "I tracked him down later and talked with him to find out what had
happened," Sabaratnam said. "He was a middle-aged guy who hadn't
really trained for the race. The most he had run was seven to eight
miles, and he just wasn't prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Sabaratnam said that runners who feel any unusual pain or
soreness--especially chest pain, in older people--should stop and
seek medical attention. Race officials have set up eight medical
stations along the course, starting at Mile 6, and several more
stations at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   The weather is usually the  biggest health concern. Two years ago,
huffing and puffing through a chilly rain, several runners developed
hypothermia, race officials said. Hypothermia occurs when the core
body temperature drops to 96 degrees or lower and cannot restore
itself. Metabolism slows, the heart beats irregularly, blood flow to
the brain decreases, and if the body isn't warmed there's a risk of
loss of consciousness and death. The runners who felt the chill in
2000 recovered soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if it looks cool or windy or wet out there, race officials
are adamant: Dress warmly. You can always peel off layers, if needed</TE>
<TE>   If it's sunny and hot, dehydration is the greater threat.
Sabaratnam recommends drinking eight to 16 ounces of water in the two
hours before the race starts (8:45 a.m.), and downing equal amounts
of water and sports drinks at fluid stations along the course.</TE>
<TE>   As for food, doctors advise carbo-loading in the days before the
race--eating more than your usual amount of pasta, bread and cereals
(the body stores carbohydrates for endurance activities)--and taking
some nourishment for the run itself.</TE>
<TE>   Distance runners often pack nutrition gels or bars, for example,
for lightweight snacks.</TE>
<TE>   "You're burning a lot of energy, and you need to replenish every
hour or so, I would say," Sabaratnam said.</TE>
<TE>   Resist the urge to collapse immediately after the race, doctors
advise. A sudden halt will not only cause muscles to stiffen (you sit
down and can't get up) but also cause a drop in blood pressure that
can make you dizzy or disoriented.</TE>
<TE>   A good, long walk of a quarter to half mile is a much better
transition to normal living. (Heart attacks can strike after the
race, but doctors say they are  rare.)</TE>
<TE>   For those who are inspired to shoot for 2003 by the spectacle of
this year's race, long-distance runners recommend setting aside seven
months for preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Start slowly, running or walking a half-hour to 45 minutes, three
or four times a week. Once a week, take a longer run, whatever's
comfortable at first, two miles or 10. Then extend that long run a
little at a time until you're doing at least 20 miles, once a week.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the few weeks preceding the marathon, cut down the
routine by half or more, and take it easy.</TE>
<TE>   "You're about to run 26 miles," Sabaratnam said. "Give yourself a
little break before that."</TE>

<LD>FEAR NO MORE: STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</LD>
<LD>   A Lifetime documentary co-produced by Susan Froemke and Doug
Graves, Maysles Films</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 10</LD>
<TE>   One hour</TE>
<TE>   Overview: This documentary addresses the nation's high rate of
physical and sexual violence against women. It explores how some
women become trapped in destructive relationships and ways in which
these women can regain their safety and self-dignity.</TE>
<TE>   What works: By telling the personal stories of five women who were
victims of violence, the producers create a picture of domestic abuse
as a problem that persists because it is steeped in secrecy and
shame. They also portray it as a problem that some segments of
society appear ambivalent to resolving.</TE>

<LD>Question: I swim three times a week, but my lower body still isn't
toned. Do you know of any pool exercises to firm my lower half,
specifically my legs and bottom?</LD>
<LD>   NANCY HEROLD</LD>
<LD>   Taos, N.M.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Swimming is great for overall fitness, but if you want to
tone those specific lower-body muscles, you'll have to focus your
exercises on that area--not for spot reduction, but for focused
toning. The next time you're in the pool, try these four exercises
(three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions per exercise).</TE>
<TE>   * Flutter kick: Using a float for your upper body, propel yourself
forward with only your legs. Alternate this lower body exercise with
the traditional upper body strokes, such as the butterfly,
breaststroke and crawl.</TE>
<TE>   * High-kick pull down: Standing in the pool, straighten your right
leg and kick it out in front of you. Then slowly pull your heel back
down using the resistance of the water. Repeat with the other leg.</TE>
<TE>   * Karate kicks: Kick your leg out to the side as high as you can,
bringing it back to the center of your body for each rep. Alternate
legs every 10 or 12 times.</TE>
<TE>   * Cross-country skiing: Just like you would ski over the snow,
drive your legs forward and backward in the water while floating in
one spot, using the resistance of the water to increase the
intensity. Beginners can use a float; the more advanced should use
their arms for resistance (as on a real cross-country trek).</TE>

<HD>When Pain Is Severe, Joint Replacement Can Be a Boon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine having so much arthritic pain in your knees that you can't
walk up or down a flight of stairs or even drive a car. Or so much
pain in your hip that you rarely leave your home, even to walk in the
yard. Now imagine the effect a new knee or a new hip would have on
your life.</LD>
<LD>   Such pain is the result of cartilage damage in the joints, and
though seen more frequently in older people, it's a problem faced by
individuals of all ages. The most common cause of this type of joint
damage is simple "wear and tear" (often referred to as
osteoarthritis).</LD>
<LD>   Normally, cartilage is very smooth, permitting the bones to slide
against each other with minimal friction (and without pain). In an
arthritic joint, the cartilage deteriorates and becomes rough,
causing pain, stiffness and swelling when the joint is moved and the
bones rub against each other.</LD>
<TE>   While everyone's cartilage gradually deteriorates with age, the
process is accelerated in some people. Individuals who are
overweight, for example, are at increased risk of osteoarthritis of
the knee because of the additional load on their joints. A traumatic
injury to a joint (such as a fracture or a ligament tear) and
rheumatoid arthritis (in which the lining around the joint becomes
inflamed) can also result in permanent cartilage damage.</TE>
<TE>   For many people with extensive joint damage, there is a solution:
surgical joint replacement. Every year, more than 250,000 Americans
replace painfully crippling knee joints; 150,000 more replace hip
joints. (Shoulders, elbows and ankles are replaced as well, but much
less frequently.)</TE>
<TE>   The majority of these procedures are done to relieve joint pain,
improve mobility and permit a return to relatively normal function.
The operation removes not only the damaged cartilage but also
adjacent bone, replacing them with smooth plastic and metal
substitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, joint replacement is recommended only after more
conservative measures are no longer effective at relieving pain.
Arthritic joint discomfort can often be adequately controlled with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen),
particularly before the joint becomes too badly damaged. Physical
therapy can be helpful at this stage as well. Nutritional supplements
chondroitin and glucosamine are effective in about 30% of users,
although it can take about 60 days before relief is noted. One recent
study demonstrated that this combination may help to rebuild and
restore cartilage.</TE>
<TE>   But these "conservative" therapies don't work for everyone. The
effectiveness and the side effects of anti-inflammatory medications,
for example, vary considerably from person to person. And even when
conservative therapies work, the relief they provide is often
short-lived. Although they may control pain initially, joint damage
can progress to the point where they are no longer adequate.</TE>
<TE>   That's when joint replacement should be considered, but experts
who treat arthritis say that many patients who could benefit greatly
from this operation are not taking advantage of it. Some people
choose to live with their disability instead of opting for joint
replacement surgery because it's a major operation, and several
months of physical therapy are required to recover full function.
They worry that the recovery will be prolonged and painful (which in
some cases it is), and fear that the procedure might fail and a
second surgery will be necessary. Also, it's a strange
notion--replacing living tissue with an artificial substitute; some
people with incapacitating joint pain have trouble accepting the
idea, in spite of the remarkable pain-relieving potential of these
operations and positive endorsements by their physicians.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is further complicated by concerns that the artificial
joint will wear out. In fact, artificial joints do wear out over
time, particularly in younger, active individuals. (The joints tend
to last longer in people who are relatively sedentary, such as the
elderly.) This usually doesn't happen very quickly, however. The
likelihood of a total knee replacement lasting 15 to 20 years is
about 95%; the chance of a total hip replacement lasting that long,
about 80%.</TE>
<TE>   So when should a person with arthritis consider joint replacement
surgery?</TE>
<TE>   Most arthritis specialists agree: When other, simpler measures
fail and the pain becomes so severe that it interferes with normal
activities like standing, walking and stair climbing, joint
replacement may be appropriate. Experts no longer believe that age
should be a barrier to having joint replacement surgery. In the worst
case, an individual might outlive the artificial joint and it, too,
will need replacement with another artificial joint (some people
would regard this as the best case).</TE>
<TE>   It's important to note that physical activities that place an
excessive load on the artificial joint are discouraged after a joint
replacement operation, to protect the longevity of the artificial
joint. Such activities include jogging or running, contact sports,
tennis and skiing. Activities like recreational walking or biking,
swimming and golfing are generally encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   Joint replacement operations are certainly no walk in the park,
but for some people they offer the only hope for being able to walk
in a park again. Any individual with severe arthritic pain that
limits normal function should discuss this option with physician
specialists who have experience with joint replacement procedures.</TE>

<HD>Little Risk in Vaccines, Panel Says</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Getting up to 20 vaccinations by the age of 2 does not
increase a child's risk of developing diabetes or various infections,
the Institute of Medicine reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   However, there is not enough evidence yet to decide if multiple
shots increase the risk of developing asthma, the panel of
independent scientists concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The report should reassure parents that "there's not a lot of
support for those risks" critics often cite, said the panel
chairwoman, Dr. Marie McCormick of the Harvard School of Public
Health. But "the diseases that their children are being protected
against are very real."</LD>
<TE>   The report is one of a series on the health effects of
immunization, compiled by an institute-appointed committee of medical
specialists who have no financial or advisory connections with
vaccine manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Medicine is an independent organization that does
research at the request of the government.</TE>
<TE>   Recent surveys suggest about 25% of parents worry that infants get
so many vaccines that the shots could overwhelm their immature immune
systems and cause infections or immune-related disorders such as Type
1 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, babies were immunized against four diseases. Today, by
age 2 most children have had up to 20 shots to protect against 11
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But babies actually are exposed to fewer antigens--foreign
substances that trigger an immune response--now than in previous
decades, the institute said. For example, pertussis vaccine given in
the 1980s contained about 3,000 potential antigens, while a safer
version introduced in the '90s has about five. Today's hepatitis B
vaccine has only one antigen; smallpox shots given until 1971 had
200.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, research suggests the capacity of the infant immune
system is at least 1,000 times greater than what is required to
respond to immunization.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is fully competent. It has to be--you're dealing with
all sorts of bugs" from birth, McCormick said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, numerous studies show multiple shots do not increase the
incidence of Type 1 diabetes or such infections as colds, ear
infections, pneumonia or meningitis, the panel concluded.</TE>
<TE>   However, some studies suggest certain vaccines might increase the
risk of allergic disorders such as asthma, while others find no link.
So the panel concluded there is insufficient evidence to decide if
asthma could be linked to multiple shots.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many other factors play a role in who gets asthma, so the
conflicting studies suggest that even if the shot risk is real, it's
not large, McCormick said. Thus, "on balance, we would recommend
immunization."</TE>
<TE>   But parents need more clear, scientific information about vaccine
risks and benefits, the panel said, urging the government to form a
task force to ensure that happens.</TE>
<TE>   There already is such a group, but health officials will consider
whether it needs improvement, said Health and Human Services
spokesman Bill Hall.</TE>

<LD>When a woman smiles at a man, what does it mean? Is the smile a
gesture of friendliness and warmth? Is it just a courtesy smile, the
kind expressed by greeters at Wal-Mart? Or is the smile a semaphore
of sexual interest, an invitation to explore carnal possibilities?</LD>
<LD>   "During the day, I smile at people in general because I am a
friendly person," said Kathleen Cahill, a 29-year-old West Los
Angeles production assistant who is single. "As far as smiling at men
in a bar or a nightclub, I am careful because even something like a
smile can give guys the wrong idea."</LD>
<LD>   Cahill's estimation of a smile's power and her description of its
ambiguous meaning is accurate.</LD>
<TE>   While most women seem to know that a smile is usually just a
smile, some men tend to translate a smile as "she wants me,"
according to a Princeton University study presented this month at the
annual conference of the Society for Personality and Social
Psychology.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers, Leif Nelson and Robyn LeBoeuf, both doctoral
candidates in psychology at Princeton, said that men generally
overestimate a woman's smile as a sign of sexual interest, especially
men who report that their sex lives are less than fulfilling.</TE>
<TE>   Women, by comparison, interpret gestures such as smiling displayed
by other women and themselves as neutral, devoid of sexual innuendo.</TE>
<TE>   "We theorize that what explains men's tendency to overestimate
women's sexual interest is that first, men are generally more
interested in sex than women," said Nelson, "and second, that people
tend to think that their own view is shared by others." Nelson and
LeBoeuf had 285 undergraduates read detailed descriptions of
behaviors attributed to a man, a woman and to themselves in four
different scenarios. After reading the scenarios, participants were
asked "how likely it was that the [man, woman or the participant] was
interested in sex" on a scale of 1 to 7. The scenarios included a
person smiling repeatedly over the course of an evening, touching the
arm of a date repeatedly, smiling at someone across a lecture hall
and a person being in a bar. Men's ratings of how interested they
thought a woman in the scenarios would be in having sex were higher
than both a woman's ratings of another woman's intent or of women's
ratings of their own intent, said Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   "On average, every man in our study is overestimating a woman's
sexual interest based on smiling, touching the arm and being in a
bar," he said. "Theoretically, men are cruising around out there
looking at women doing the most neutral thing--and it is hard to
think of anything more neutral than smiling--and men are saying,
'Yeah, she might be interested in having sex.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nelson and LeBoeuf's study replicated the findings of a 1982 study
conducted by psychologist Antonia Abbey of Detroit's Wayne State
University, in which she videotaped men and women interacting in
ordinary ways, such as talking and using hand gestures natural to
conversation. An impartial observer and the two participants were
then asked to rate the participants' sexual intent. "Even hand
gestures were interpreted by men as indicating that 'the woman is
coming on to me,'" said Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   But Nelson and his co-researcher speculated that men whose sex
lives were lacking would be more extreme in their over-perception of
women's sexual intent. To test their theory, the researchers
conducted a second study with 246 undergraduates who first rated how
satisfying their sex lives were and, subsequently, rated the sexual
intent of men, women and themselves in the scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   The results: Satisfied men were less apt to attribute sexual
intentions to a woman than unsatisfied men, said Nelson, and as a
consequence, perceived women smiling, touching their arm and being in
a bar as less sexually interested.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Goldberg, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist and expert on
male psychology, said the Princeton findings are not surprising. "Men
generally sexualize their relationships with women, and women
generally don't sexualize their relationships with men," said
Goldberg, author of the 1975 bestseller "The Hazards of Being Male"
and the 1991 book, "What Men Really Want." "When a man talks to a
woman, especially if she is attractive--unless it is goal oriented
like talking about business, asking her the time or selling her
insurance--he is going to have sexual thoughts," Goldberg said. Men
are used to women ignoring them, not initiating conversations with
them, not smiling at them, so when a woman does, it is an unusual
event and he will think she is coming on to him, he added.</TE>
<TE>   What drives men to sexualize a woman's smile can be more than
overactive libidos, argues Alon Gratch, a New York City clinical
psychologist and author of the new book, "If Men Could Talk ...
Translating the Secret Language of Men."</TE>
<TE>   "Many men are fundamentally insecure and always feel a need to
prove their masculinity," said Gratch. "In that sense, if a woman
smiles at them, they perceive it as an affirmation of their sexual
prowess and as a sign of a woman's interest."</TE>
<TE>   Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist, cautioned
against making sweeping generalizations about male behavior from a
study of college men, whom she describes as "wrapped in a cloak of
hormones for four years."</TE>
<TE>   Many men are married, working and busy minding a family, said
Schwartz. They don't have time to read sexual intent into every
woman's smile. Still, she added, "Many men do interpret a smile or
gesture of warmth as a come-on. "I don't think most women know how
much men misinterpret a little bit of friendliness."</TE>
<TE>   So, what is a man not gifted in the art of mind reading to do
when a strange woman smiles at him? Should he call a psychic hotline?
Should he send a soda water with a twist of lime?</TE>
<TE>   "Men who are sensitive [can] test their hypothesis that a woman
who smiles at them is coming on to them by saying hello and starting
a little conversation," said Schwartz. "Others can be boorish about
it."</TE>

<LD>THE LIFE BEFORE HER EYES</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Laura Kasischke</LD>
<TE>   Harcourt</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carol Kennicott chafed at the conventionality of "Main Street."
Nora couldn't wait to leave "A Doll's House." Jack Kerouac sought a
more authentic reality "On the Road" just as, a century earlier,
Richard Henry Dana ran off to sea to spend "Two Years Before the
Mast." While the questing heroes and heroines of previous eras strove
to burst through the dullness and limitations of mundane existence to
find something finer, nobler or merely more exciting, a surprising
number of fiction writers nowadays have been singing the praises of
ordinary life, which has certainly come to seem more precious than
ever in light of the recent terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This attachment to the quotidian was evident even before Sept. 11,
however. Already, in the wake of the excesses and disappointments
stemming from the sexual revolution, the drug culture and the pursuit
of extremes, a nostalgia for normality was seeping in. The world of
Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" was making a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "The Life Before Her Eyes" belongs to Diana McFee. It seems, for
the most part, an ordinary enough life, but as Diana sees it, it is
nothing short of a continual miracle. In the first few pages of this
novel by Michigan-based writer Laura Kasischke, teenage Diana and her
best friend, Maureen, are confronted by a deranged classmate with a
gun who asks them to choose which of them he should kill. The rest of
the book moves back and forth in time, alternating between scenes
from Diana's youth and scenes from her life as a 40-year-old wife and
mother. It's not absolutely clear whether the scenes from her later
life are real or simply what she imagines as her future in the
desperate moment when she is forced to contemplate the possibility of
her death. Intentional or not, the ambiguity in this case is not
particularly fruitful.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many people, Diana is acutely aware of the value of her
life, of the world around her and of her individual human
consciousness. No one could accuse her of taking the smallest detail
of the material world for granted: "She loved the sun on the side of
her face, the smell of warm vinyl filling the minivan. She loved
being herself in her forty-year-old body ... being a wife, a mother
... the bake sales and the field trips; the Band-Aids and the small
sweaters coming out of the washer soggy and smelling of rain....Now
as she thought of it, she realized that she loved all the material
details of her days...." Indeed, one might even venture to say that
in the case of this particular "material girl," consciousness seems
to have gotten the better of conscience.</TE>
<TE>   For Diana, the past is eminently erasable: "The time period in
which she'd been a teenager had led to indulgences and excesses no
other generation had ever known, and now millions of those teenage
girls were soccer moms. Diana had seen those soccer moms when they
were teenagers--when they'd been promiscuous, tattooed, pierced in
intimate places. She couldn't be the only one who'd grown up and
become a mother and found herself to be a complete stranger to the
girl she'd been--but haunted. Definitely haunted. That girl she'd
been was her now, although the woman she'd become wouldn't have
trusted that girl with her wedding china, with her car keys, let
alone her home, her child, her life."</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Diana's past include several affairs and an abortion
while still in high school. When cornered by their gun-toting
classmate, she begged him, "Kill her, not me," even after her friend
Maureen gallantly said, "If you're going to kill one of us, kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Diana's husband, a philosophy professor, is writing a
lecture on the theme "Conscience is the voice of God in the nature
and heart of man." Diana's conscience, however, only makes the
occasional cameo appearance: When a dim memory of the traumatic event
surfaces or when she sees a pretty student walking with her husband
and fears he may leave her for a younger woman, just as years before
he left his previous wife for Diana.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing that Kasischke's protagonist is not tormented
horribly by guilt: After all, she didn't fire the gun, nor can any
living creature really be blamed for clinging to its life. It's quite
another, however, that she is generally rather self-centered and
shallow--apart from her ability to cherish all the moments of her
unexceptional small-town life.</TE>
<TE>   For Kasischke, the author of two previous novels and three poetry
collections, her heroine's rapt attentiveness to life provides the
opportunity for poetic writing, but what we all too often get is
closer to banality. Here is Diana watching as her husband and small
daughter share a hug: "It was a picture of perfect father-daughter
familiarity. Family, Diana thought as she stood and watched their
embrace. Her daughter's small arms were flung around his neck. His
eyes were closed. A crack of light broke through the green leafiness
of their front yard, and it shone all over the two of them."</TE>
<TE>   Kasischke's attempts to get us to really see the beauty of
ordinary life fall flat after a while: Her writing becomes strained
and the people, places and things it describes and celebrates are too
generic to evoke genuine emotion. "The Life Before Her Eyes" is a
novel that takes on deep matters of life and death; conscience and
consciousness; family, love and friendship; but in the end, it only
scratches the surfaces.</TE>

<LD>Reptiles and salmonella</LD>
<LD>   Reptile ownership is on the increase, but many people do not know
that reptiles can carry salmonella, an infection that can make you
sick and can even cause death.</LD>
<LD>   Salmonella is a bacterial infection that generally infects the
intestinal tract and occasionally the bloodstream. Symptoms include
mild to severe diarrhea, fever and occasionally vomiting. Symptoms
generally appear one to three days after exposure. It is spread by
eating contaminated food or by contact with infected people, animals
and reptiles. Children younger than 5, pregnant women, the elderly
and those with weak immune systems are at risk of illness or even
death from salmonella.</LD>
<TE>   There is no known treatment for salmonella in iguanas or turtles.
Here are some tips for those who have reptiles as pets.</TE>
<TE>   * Wash your hands with hot, soapy water (preferably antibacterial
soap) after handling a reptile, its cage or cage accessories.</TE>
<TE>   * Wear gloves and face protection when cleaning a cage or changing
the water in a tank, pool or pond.</TE>
<TE>   * Children should be supervised when handling a reptile and
contact with reptiles should be minimized.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep reptiles away from the kitchen, dining room and food
preparation areas.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep other pets away from reptiles, including their cages and
water bowls.</TE>
<TE>   * Make regular reptile veterinary visits and have laboratory
screening tests done.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not use the bathroom sink or shower as a reptile soaking
area.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not eat, drink or smoke while handling the reptile or
cleaning its environment.</TE>
<TE>   * If your reptile injures you, clean the wound thoroughly and
consult a physician. Reptile injuries can become easily infected.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not kiss your reptile.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta publishes a free
brochure on salmonella. Write to CDC, MMWR MS (C-08), Atlanta, GA
30333. You can also visit www.xmission.com/~gastown/herpmed/salm.htm,
or contact American Tortoise Rescue at (800) 938-3553 or e-mail
turtleresq@aol.com.</TE>

turtles and tortoises.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On that depressing day that some choose to call Valentine's Day, I
greatly enjoyed reading "The Quest for Fire" by Roy Rivenburg (Feb.
14).</LD>
<LD>   As the single mother of two, my Valentine plans included:</LD>
<LD>   * Stationing myself at my front door to await the onslaught of
floral and candy deliveries from "your secret admirer" and "your
crazy lover Phil who is currently surrounded by nice men in their
clean, white coats."</LD>
<TE>   * Going to a posh candy store and looking pathetic until some kind
man asks me out.</TE>
<TE>   * Going to a florist shop and weeping until the owners fill my
arms with flowers and beg me to leave because I am making the other
customers uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   To add insult to injury, after spending one hour answering
personal questions, I was rejected from an online dating service
because technically I am not divorced, only separated. Picky, picky,
picky!</TE>
<TE>   LORI ARONSOHN</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, I went with a group to the Valentine's Day dance
on the Queen Mary that Roy Rivenburg aptly described. I was also one
of those who did not find my blind date: I don't know if she didn't
show, or if she did and saw me first.</TE>
<TE>   I wound up spending most of the evening (not the night) with a
female colleague whose desk sits above mine on another floor at work.
Sparks flew, but I didn't have the nerve to ask for her number.</TE>
<TE>   I called another colleague the next morning to get her number, but
she had misplaced it. I had to wait till the next workday to speak to
this enchantress, one of the longest weekends of my life. We went out
the next night and have been inseparable since. Shari and I got
married in 1998 on Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Hang on to that number and keep trying, it's worth it! We are in
our late 40s and early 50s, and I feel like life has started all over
again. It's never too late!</TE>

<TE>   There are a few single women in my office (myself included) who
would like to know more about Roy Rivenburg. We are free for drinks
(better a little late than never).</TE>

I've experienced similar moments.... Thanks for cheering me up on an
alone Valentine's Day.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Accounting: It's a Brave New World" (Feb. 6): I am a
retired accountant. Despite my serving as a sergeant in the infantry
during the Korean War, my image with my grandchildren has always
suffered due to my profession.</LD>
<LD>   To make matters worse, I'm bald and wear glasses. Also, I have to
admit that my wardrobe has always had a slightly worn look and I
still carry a 6-inch ruler and a fountain pen in my vest pocket.</LD>
<LD>   However, ever since [former Arthur Andersen auditor] David Duncan
and his fellows have begun appearing on TV and in newspapers, with
their custom-tailored suits and expensive haircuts, my stock with my
grandchildren has started to rise. The editorial comment that
accompanies their pictures has caused my grandchildren to start
thinking of me not as an old fud, but more as a New Age man on the
cutting edge of "where it's at now."</LD>
<TE>   However, there is a downside to all this acclaim. This evening I
went over to look at a tomato-red convertible with a V6 engine.
Fortunately, I caught myself before I spent $30,000 of my own money
on such frivolity.</TE>

<HD>Fathers' Presence as a Gift to Daughters</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was moved to tears by "Daddies' Girls" (Feb. 13). What could have
been a mushy, sentimental article was written in a straightforward
manner--for me, echoing the simplicity of the concept itself--about
fathers and daughters spending time together.</LD>
<LD>   I called my father immediately. He said he would have taken me [to
the dance described in the story] if they had it when I was a kid.
Instead, he took me to my first concert (Barry Manilow), my first
sports game (Dodgers versus Expos) and my first trip to New York
(where we saw two plays a day, for a week).</LD>
<LD>   I am one of the lucky ones who was raised by a loving and present
father. I hope enough fathers read the article and that attendance
doubles at the next dance.</LD>

<LD>In a bold attempt to keep its ratings sky-high after the conclusion
of the Winter Olympics, NBC has decided to extend the event
indefinitely. Unfortunately, because many of the participants are
busy taping an Olympics-themed episode of "The Weakest Link," the
network has had to make a few adjustments.</LD>
<LD>   For example, all judging will now be handled by an impartial panel
of jurists--the Dancing Itos from NBC's "The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno."</LD>
<LD>   The network is also introducing a bevy of new sports to its "Must
Ski TV" lineup:</LD>
<TE>   * The Moulin Luge: A combination sled race and dazzling musical in
which athletes descend into an icy bohemian underworld of sex, drugs
and bad Toulouse-Lautrec impersonations.</TE>
<TE>   * Freestyle Shredding: Contestants try to destroy incriminating
Enron documents as quickly yet creatively as possible.</TE>
<TE>   * Skating on Thin Ice: Iraq, North Korea and Iran are
the favorites in this race to incur the future wrath of President Bush
and the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   * The Other Skeleton: Not to be confused with the 90-mph sled race
in the real Games, this event entails hunting for actual human
skeletons inside a rural Georgia crematory.</TE>
<TE>   * Bobsled &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice: Can you say orgy on ice?</TE>
<TE>   * Speed Cloning: Racing against government crackdowns on the
duplication of human beings, mad scientists attempt to destroy
civilization as we know it by cloning Richard Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   * Skate and Leopold: A freak time portal brings a 19th century
gentleman to Salt Lake City, where he is forced to compete in figure
skating.</TE>
<TE>   * The Mormon Tabernacle Choir Jump: Chained together at the
ankles, the robed singing group is launched off a 394-foot-high ski
jump at 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   * Olympic Sniveling: To placate the hurt feelings of the Russians
and improve their gold medal chances, this event is specifically
matched to their newest talent--whining.</TE>
<TE>   * The New Biathlon: The original biathlon combined cross-country
skiing with target shooting, making it one of the most difficult
competitions. To spice things up, the new biathlon mixes skiing and
surgery. Athletes must race along a treacherous ski path, then
perform a delicate brain operation.</TE>

<HD>With Pen in Hand</HD>
<DH>Put it in writing? Wielding anything but a keyboard makes
some people nervous. Make peace--and practice, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The curator puzzles over quick black slashes on sky blue paper: Inky
zigzags erratic as a stock chart.</LD>
<LD>   "See, I don't quite know what that is," muses Pilar Perez,
director of exhibitions for Track 16 Gallery at Bergamot Station in
Santa Monica, leaning in for a better look. "Or that either." She
isn't taking in a canvas or framed watercolor. Rather she's flipping
through her check stubs. The few notes scattered on her neat desk
inspire a similar response: "I couldn't tell you what that was
supposed to remind me to do."</LD>
<LD>   That's why, Perez says, over the past few years, she's pretty much
weaned herself off pen, pencil and paper--at least when it comes to
the documented details of her personal life. Letters are e-mailed.
Most bills are paid online. Groceries? Well, that's why God created
the check card! If she has to leave a note for an office colleague,
she'll print it out from her laptop. Important handwritten
correspondence she might entrust to Laurie Steelink, one of the
artists employed there. And though she still relies, at times, on a
quick Post-it to help jog her memory, "I've found this computer
program that does the same thing. I can leave notes to myself 'stuck'
on screen. And I'll know what they say when I come back to them."</LD>
<TE>   She's not alone in squinting over hasty marks that may as well be
some dead language. Rather, she's one of the many people who are
confounded or shamed by the elusiveness of longhand and comforted by
the ease of the computer: The high-end stationery store owner who,
though surrounded by beautiful papers, filigreed pens and expensive
journals, suffers from performance anxiety. The lawyer who hires a
calligrapher to write out his marriage proposal to present as a gift.
Many a eulogy has been written on the demise of penmanship in
tech-savvy children, with the assumption that previous generations
would treasure and uphold the tradition. But after decades of
embarrassing struggles with the Palmer Method, many adults have given
up, too, and turned to the forgiving and equalizing keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   To people like Perez, the choice seems to offer instant
absolution--or, more precisely, a clean getaway. Until they hit an
unexpected bump: The note to the meter maid. The in-store credit card
application form. The quick "I stopped by ... " note to a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Love it or hate it, we still need it, and, say experts and
handwriting partisans, it's futile to pretend we don't. "Handwriting
isn't going away," says Margaret Shepherd, artist, calligrapher and
author of the just-published "The Art of the Handwritten Note: A
Guide To Reclaiming Civilized Communication" (Broadway Books, 2002).
"It's a basic of our lives." So, she and other experts counsel, it's
important for people to make peace with what they have. Even the inky
zigzags.</TE>
<TE>   Problem is, there are those who can't remember when their
penmanship wasn't perceived as a flaw, something they would hide by
perfecting, say, the signature, and cutting the rest free. Just the
thought of pen on paper--even for the tiniest correspondence--brings
it all back in a nightmarish rush: Weekly handwriting contests and
their rewards of foil stars. Writing pads with three blue lines: two
solid, the center broken. Laminated cards ringing grammar school
classroom walls with the Palmer Method's difficult-to-imitate upper
and lower-case loops, swirls and curlicues.</TE>
<TE>   For some, grammar school's end meant freedom to develop a personal
style; for others it only cemented frustration and insecurity. "The
realization of having bad handwriting happens in the mid- to
late-teen years," says Rosa Chandler, a Pasadena-based lettering
teacher and artist. It's about then that we become "very egocentric
... [concerned about] what we look like, what everyone thinks about
us ... including how we look on paper."</TE>
<TE>   Adulthood, she says, is often the traditional period for "repair
to poor handwriting." But as we find less need to write, we "repair"
less. The result: "We've become disgusted at the chicken scratch that
is left behind when we write a quick birthday card," says Chandler, "
... but don't know what to do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The impact of said chicken scratch isn't as frivolous as we might
think. The Detroit News reported in 2000 that "American businesses
lose an estimated $200 million a year to poor penmanship through
illegible checks, invoices and other paperwork, while the U.S. Postal
Service pays handwriting specialists $4 million a year to decipher
illegible addresses." And there's more at stake than lost mail. A
jury in 2000 awarded $450,000 to the family of a Texas man who died
after a pharmacist misread the doctor's handwritten prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the emotional costs, the queasiness about the
scribble that comes out of a pen's tip, no matter how hard we try.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like the sound of their voices, most people are
uncomfortable about the way their handwriting looks," Shepherd says.
"The Pilot pen company did a study and found that people are four or
five times more critical of their own handwriting than others'."</TE>
<TE>   Her tried-and-true advice: Lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfectionism is what adolescents do," says Shepherd, who likes
to point out that she flunked handwriting in third grade and felt
distanced from her longhand for quite some time--until she picked up
a broad nib pen. "Most people have to decide what they have is good
enough."</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually anyone can get back into it," she says. In the
beginning, "there might be an unevenness in it, a visual 'ahem'--like
the clearing of one's voice. But then it starts to flow." Her book is
full of blame-free optimism and sensual lures--hot tea, a good pen,
fine paper--writing as its own reward. "I felt like people need
encouragement," she says. The fact you that you handwrite shows that
you care. It's like preparing dinner for friends. It doesn't have to
be an award-winning meal. You are just conveying how you feel."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Kurtz, a New York-based graphologist, is more tough-love in
her approach. She doesn't blame the computer or lack of practice for
the sorry state of our writing skills. She faults our wiring. Kurtz,
the author of "Rewrite Your Life" (St. Martins Paperbacks) and
founder and president of Graphology Consulting Group, believes what
many a hesitant writer fears: "Whatever you are, whoever you are,
will come out on paper."</TE>
<TE>   Handwriting, she stresses, is really brainwriting. "It comes from
your cortex. And you can't change it until you find out why you are
writing a certain way. " That might strike a chill in people like
Perez, who might be wary of what Kurtz would find in a letter's "weak
looking end" or a "t-bar that floats" above the stem. And Kurtz has
heard the fears. "Sometimes at seminars these doctors say: When you
look at my writing you'll find out that I'm a serial killer or--fill
in the blank ... "</TE>
<TE>   Through something she calls, graphotherapy--handwriting exercises
designed specifically to "maximize desirable personality traits"--she
claims to be able increase concentration, raise self-esteem or
develop confidence by simply changing the shape, pressure or slope of
one's pen-strokes.</TE>
<TE>   But for many, the desire to change is far more basic--legibility.
And the prescription for that: practice.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Yasuda sees the longing all the time. Behind a work
table, she sits in the midst of creamy note cards, themed liner
paper, handmade invitations and thank-you notes--the tools of
aspiration. At her paper and gift store, Mimio in Old Town Pasadena,
she offers classes ranging from bookbinding to card-making. "We
encourage self-expression, ... and emphasize how easy it can be."</TE>
<TE>   Convincing students can take some doing, though, says Yasuda, a
graphic artist. "People are nervous. They think if it's not perfect,
they don't even want to try. But it's not going to be perfect, and
those imperfections are what make it special. You get a sense of
their personality."</TE>
<TE>   In our perfectionistic moments, we forget that many prefer the
recipe in grandmother's hesitant longhand, or the quick love note on
a Thai take-out menu--smudges, cramped hand and all.</TE>
<TE>   But Perez isn't so easily convinced: "Oh, dash this off and throw
this in and they are going to understand?" For her, not handwriting
it isn't an exercise in aesthetics, it's a way to be understood.</TE>
<TE>   Shepherd thinks both are possible, in our own idiosyncratic hands.
"I'm very wary of people looking at all of this like painting
flowerpots," she says. Handwriting isn't a trend, "it really is at
the core of what we do. The 'thank yous.' The 'I'm sorrys,' The 'come
overs.' They are fundamental. But the art is to elevate them into
something better. It's not going up on a gallery wall. "It's just ink
on paper. Between you and your reader."</TE>

<HD>With Pen in Hand</HD>
<DH>To aficionados, the pen is not only mightier than the sword
but finer than most other things in the modern world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The practice of putting pen to paper may be severely stunted, but
it's far from dead. People still use pens to take notes, write
letters and append signatures to documents of all sorts. Of course
the kind of pen used depends on the kind of person and the task at
hand. Can you imagine President Bush signing an important treaty with
a 79-cent ballpoint? Or the flashy Trump inking an artful deal with
less than an 18-karat-gold nib? Do corporate titans jot notes with
pens less distinctive than they imagine themselves to be?</LD>
<LD>   Of course not. You can tell there's a huge market for upscale and
vintage pens by scanning glossy pen publications, or the high-powered
pen activity on the Web--or by eavesdropping on the approximately
2,000 pen aficionados who packed the Manhattan Beach Marriott
ballroom at the recent 14th annual Los Angeles International Pen
Show.</LD>
<TE>   These are not the sort of men and women who'd ever buy
shrink-wrapped models at the market. They are collectors, folks who
started with one fine pen and suddenly found themselves stockpiling
as many as they could handle. If you're imagining a group of fusty
ink-stained codgers, you're way off base. The place was jumping with
technophiles so invested in the future that they seemed to have a
heightened appreciation for the fleeting present and the hallowed
past. Many say they have thought long and hard about civilization,
about the fact that knowledge has survived largely because it has
been passed directly by hand, via writing on stone, then parchment
and then paper. They are not about to let the tradition die.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 158 booths were showcases for top-of-the-line pen
firms, but the real draw, the reason collectors traveled from 15
countries to be there, was to meet and greet pen lovers as passionate
as themselves, with whom they could trade, sell and swap--or just
brag a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Odgers, a show co-sponsor, is the director of technology at
Warner Bros. He collects early Parker fountain pens, made in the
1890s to 1920s. His wife and little boy were with him at the table
where he displayed elegant examples, some of which he was willing to
sell or trade. Mostly, he was there to buy, he said. He kept his real
treasures hidden beneath the display table in a plastic tackle box,
each individually wrapped in cloth. Among them, a Parker "bullet pen"
from 1917, used by soldiers to write letters home during World War I.
It looks like a real bullet, but opens to reveal a nib.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers filled these with ink from eyedroppers before going into
battle, Odgers said, then attached the pens to their watch chains for
use in the trenches at quiet times. Just looking at the well-worn
metal casing makes you hear guns of war in your head, makes you
wonder whose hands held this pen, who its owner wrote to, and whether
he survived. This one was not for sale. For his daily writing
enjoyment, Odgers has a selection of more modern writing instruments,
he said. He pulled from his pocket the Agatha Christie, made by Mont
Blanc in about 1993. It's a reproduction of a 1920s model--a
full-bodied shape in gleaming black, with emerald eyes staring from
the head of a sterling silver serpent that coils down the cap to form
the clip.</TE>
<TE>   There are two kinds of pen people, it turns out: those who collect
to save, and those who collect to use. Many at the show were both
kinds rolled into one. They own valuable vintage pens that they
display but never use, and a different set they rotate for use on a
daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all little kids in this room," said Bert Hurlbut, a
construction manager for the new UCLA medical center building in
Westwood. He was carrying some vintage pens from his collection so he
could play a favorite game. "I go up to a guy and flop one of my pens
on the table. He flops down a better one of his. I flop down an even
better one of mine. We go on like this until he says, 'You've got
me.' At that point, I've won."</TE>
<TE>   Hurlbut opens his jacket to reveal a shirt pocket packed with pens
and two huge patch pockets sewn into the jacket on either side, each
of which is packed with pens. They are individually wrapped in
chamois and in little plastic bags. "I've got at least 30 in here, he
says, patting a huge pocket. I've got one that's astronomical--a
Parker ribbon pen from 1905. And a Waterman filigree, 1911." Pen
people never need to utter the word "pen" when referring to their
stash. It's always a specific make and style, as in: Parker "Big
Red," a Parker 51, a Pelikan Green, a Sheaffer Legacy. Hurlbut says
he's partial to Parkers.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Overbury, originally of Toronto, is a self-described
"expert dealer" in Japanese lacquer fountain pens. "These pens cannot
be forged," he said. "The art of lacquer is 9,000 years old. It takes
up to six months to make one pen. For an artist to learn lacquer, it
can take up to 30 years." He has written a self-published pen book,
"Namiki: The Art of Japanese Lacquer," and has even established
residence in Japan to be closer to the source.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most valuable lacquer pens were made in the '20s and
'30s for Alfred Dunhill, he said, and were known as the
Dunhill-Namikis. The costliest example he knows of sold for $500,000.
Overbury says he sold seven "very expensive vintage models to dealers
from Europe" who flew in for the show. But that was not a lacquer pen
sticking out of his pocket, however. It was Diamond Jim Brady's very
own hand-sculpted solid-gold scrollwork fountain pen, dotted with
diamonds, made at the turn of the century and taken on consignment by
Overbury from its current owner for possible sale at the show.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Overbury's table, in its original case, was a comfortingly
simple plastic Parker pen and pencil set. It was beige--as bland and
benign-looking as the man who allegedly once owned it: President
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Overbury and others at the show declined to
state prices for their most valuable vintage items. They all wheel
and trade--and no price is firm until a deal is made. In one
transaction, a French pen dealer who had flown in from Paris for the
show was seen handing over a stack of hundreds a few inches high.</TE>
<TE>   The Parisian, Christophe Larquemin, wasn't just buying. He was
also hawking his own innovation: a limited-edition fountain pen made
from a "genuine meteorite" mixed with powdered gold. "There will be
only 20 of these for the whole world. They will cost $6,000 each," he
said. To whom would he sell them? "Oh, there is no lack of buyers for
such things," he said. Scott Summerfield, a communications consultant
from Newark, Calif., brought his son Zachary, 6, to the show. "This
is my grandfather's Parker 51, from the 1940s, with his name engraved
on it," the elder Summerfield said. Then his little boy piped up: "I
have a Pelikan, a Parker, a Sheaffer and a Waterman." Yes, but you're
not allowed to use pens in school--only crayons, right? "I keep them
at my house and use them there. I never take them out, " Zachary
said. His father gives a fountain pen to all the children in
Zachary's and his older sister's class every year. "They've never
heard of fountain pens, never seen one, certainly never used one. I
want them to know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Fenton, a retired superior court judge, flew in from Tucson
with his 15-year-old grandson. "I use pens, I save pens, I enjoy it
all," Fenton said. "I wanted to give my grandson a taste of it."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Steinberg, who has homes in London and New York, hit
Manhattan Beach with what he called "the only pen like this at the
show." It is an Omega gold pierced and engraved safety pen from the
1920s, with extraordinary little cupids sculpted all along the
barrel. It is "signed by the artist and will sell for around $60,000
to $70,000," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Pfeiffer, a Houston medical and legal malpractice lawyer,
brought part of his eclectic collection, including an onyx and pearl
Parker from the 1920s and a modern Waterman roller ball that he uses
every day. The bulk of his collection is in a safety deposit box, he
says. An Parker Aztec, made in 1905, which is in pre-plastic days, is
made of hard rubber covered with gold overlay design. "The pens I
most treasure, like that one, are not really good writing implements.
Before 1915, everything was beautifully made by hand, but they hadn't
yet perfected the nibs. In 1915, they began adding iridium to the
top, so that the pen would write smoothly and not scratch the paper
any more."</TE>
<TE>   Holding court along the back wall was Susan Wirth of Milwaukee, a
collector, seller and specialist "in pens that write a certain way."
Although her vocation is market research--"everything from ovarian
cancer to lightweight concrete"--she says she's known in the pen
world as "an expert in nib extremes." She fits pens with needle-grade
nibs for super-tiny script, extra-broad nibs for more flamboyant
writing, knows all about nibs for italics and other specialized
tasks, she says. "This is a great postcard pen," Wirth told an
inveterate traveler. "This one's not a beauty queen, but it's a great
performer," she told a man who asked for "something dignified and
simple" for everyday use. She cares not a whit for the exotic or
unique--unless it really works. "Think how sad a little pen feels if
it's not doing what it was meant to do," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   One of dozens who flocked to her table was Dennis Lawton of Los
Angeles, whose sentiments echo her own.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton says he has 20 collectible pens and uses all of them all
the time. "I sell insurance, and every day I use a different great
pen. I wouldn't own one I couldn't use. I've already started my kids
using pens. That's because they use computers every day and they've
lost all connection with paper. I want them to connect."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever read "The Cat in the Hat," "Horton Hatches the Egg,"
"If I Ran the Zoo," or "And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street"?
These books, and many others, were written and illustrated by Theodor
Geisel. You know him as Dr. Seuss.</LD>
<LD>   Theodor Seuss Geisel, called "Ted" by his friends, was born in
Springfield, Mass., on March 2, 1904. His grandparents were from
Germany. They built a brewery that produced some of the best beer in
America. His father, Theodor, and mother, Henrietta (called Nettie),
settled near Nettie's parents with their new son and 2-year-old
daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Springfield was a wonderful place to grow up. Ted's home was
spacious and the city had a park, a zoo and an easy way of life. His
father rarely raised his voice, but if somebody did something that
got him angry, he might never speak to that person again. As Ted grew
older, his dad tried to interest him in sports, especially hunting,
but Ted preferred going to the zoo and drawing pictures of the
animals. One thing Ted valued that he learned from his father was,
"whatever you do, do it to perfection."</LD>
<TE>   His mother read to him and his sister, Marnie, each night. Ted
loved the sound of words and said that he gained from his mother a
feeling for the rhythm of language that later became part of his
writing style. He enjoyed books so much that she bribed him by
saying, "If you do well on your piano lesson you can buy any book you
want." He mostly bought the Rover Boys series when he was young.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Springfield made a big impression on Ted. Years
later he would use the names of people and places from his childhood
in his books.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Ted's school years.</TE>
<TE>   Kids, March is the fifth anniversary of the National Education
Assn.'s Read Across America project, which celebrates the joys of
reading and honors Dr. Seuss, whose birthday is Saturday. For more
information and a list of activities in your area, visit

<TE>   Gloria D. Miklowitz's biographies from the Kids' Reading Room will

making it difficult for the magnetic strip to be read. Wrapping
plastic film around it makes it thicker, so that it fits tightly into

<HD>'Aura' Migraines Are Hereditary, Scientists Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA geneticists have found that migraines with auras are a
hereditary condition. ''For the first time, we have proof of an
isolated genetic link to migraine,'' said Dr. Aarno Palotie. ''This
finding moves us one step closer to isolating the gene that
predisposes people to migraine headaches with auras.''</LD>
<LD>   Migraines affect about 12% of the U.S. population. Some are
preceded by an aura--neurological symptoms characterized by visual
disturbances up to an hour before the headache begins. Palotie's team
analyzed genetic markers in blood samples from 50 Finnish families
with a history of migraines and discovered three common markers
linked to chromosome 4.</LD>

<HD>El Nino Is Relatively Recent, Fossils Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Nino, the periodic warming of Pacific Ocean waters that affects
the weather worldwide, started about 6,000 years ago, according to a
study of ancient fish bones. Georgia researchers reported in the Feb.
22 issue of Science that fish bones from refuse left about 6,000
years ago by ancient peoples in Peru show that ocean catfish lived in
water that averaged 6 degrees to 7 degrees warmer than now and that
there was little variation in the temperature.</LD>
<LD>   C. Fred T. Andrus of the University of Georgia said that if El
Nino was occurring at the modern rate, once every two to seven years,
then the bones from the fish would have reflected the temperature
variation. ''We don't see that,'' said Andrus. ''Our data strengthen
the argument that El Nino, as we know it, began relatively
recently--since about 6,000 years ago.''</LD>

<HD>Scientists Map Genome of Fission Yeast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have mapped all the genes in the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which they hope will provide new insights
into basic cell biology and the development of cancer. An
international team led by Nobel laureate Sir Paul Nurse of Cancer
Research UK reported in the Feb. 21 issue of Nature that they had
sequenced the genome of the cousin of brewer's yeast, which had its
genome mapped in 1997. It is the sixth organism to have its genome
sequenced. The others include humans, the nematode worm, the fruit
fly and mustard weed.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty of the 4,824 genes in the fission yeast genome are linked to
human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hereditary deafness, diabetes
and cancer. By studying the smaller and easier genome of fission
yeast, scientists hope to discover new clues about cells and how
diseases like cancer develop in humans.</LD>

<HD>Stomach Bug May Help Track Human Migration</HD>
<DH>Discovery of Helicobacter pylori has helped doctors treat
ulcers and prevent stomach cancer. Now its great genetic variability
may aid in tracing movements of people across the globe.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last 20 years, research on a tiny, S-shaped stomach
bacterium has overturned doctors' notions about the origins and
history of diseases from ulcers to cancer of the stomach.</LD>
<LD>   Now, some scientists who study the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori,
say the tiny bug may help trace the migration of human populations
across the globe.</LD>
<LD>   Next week, enthusiasts from around the globe will gather in
Australia to celebrate the discovery of H. pylori. While the
discovery of a stomach bacterium may seem an odd thing to celebrate,
this one did something big.</LD>
<TE>   Two Australian scientists discovered H. pylori. Pathologist Robin
Warren had noticed tiny bacteria in stomach ulcer specimens and his
group managed to grow them where others had failed, in part because
the members left the cultures incubating for an extra long time
during their Easter vacation.</TE>
<TE>   When it later proved impossible to infect animals with the
microbes, colleague Barry Marshall swallowed some of the bacteria to
find out if they really induced stomach inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   A biopsy from his stomach showed they did.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, it was a little bit risky," recalls Marshall, now
a scientist at the University of Western Australia's department of
microbiology. "But at the time it was the only way I could see to
advance knowledge of the new bug."</TE>
<TE>   In the years that followed, doctors tossed out theories about
stress and salty food as the primary causes of ulcers. (At one time,
even "obsessional and dominant" mothers were blamed for the ulcers of
their children.)</TE>
<TE>   In came a new model of infectious disease--and new therapeutic
approaches with antibiotics to treat ulcers and prevent stomach
cancer, the world's second-leading cancer killer.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers now know far more about the bacterium. They know that
once inside the stomach, the bacterium uses a set of whip-like
tails--called flagella--to swim briskly toward the layer of mucus
that protects the lining of the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the mucus, H. pylori sticks to the cells lining the stomach
and uses an enzyme to neutralize the stomach's fierce acidity. While
there, the microbe produces proteins that cause changes in stomach
cells. Those changes, in turn, lead to inflammations that over time
can produce ulcers or cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers also have determined the precise structure of the
microbe's genome several times over. They're beginning to understand
how its genes function to help it survive in the stomach and trigger
disease.</TE>
<TE>   They've discovered that roughly half of all human beings are
infected with H. pylori--but that rates of infection vary enormously
from place to place. In countries and communities with impure water,
poor sanitation and crowding, infection rates are high--and higher,
too, are incidences of stomach cancer and ulcers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Microbe's DNA Varies Greatly</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also have snaked tubes into stomachs all over the world
to study H. pylori more closely--and, by doing so, have found great
genetic variability in the microbe's DNA. Even individual stomachs
can contain dozens of genetically distinct bacteria, as if H. pylori
is constantly reshaping its genome.</TE>
<TE>   But there are clear, more global patterns also. Strains sampled
from Asian stomachs, European stomachs and African stomachs differ
distinctly--and the differences persist in the stomachs of offspring,
even when they're now living in other parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me a bacterium and I can tell you generally where a person's
ancestors came from," says Dr. David Graham, chief of
gastroenterology at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston,
one of the scientists who has made a study of this florid
variability.</TE>
<TE>   These global genetic signatures offer much more than the chance to
perform a neat party trick: by comparing strains, scientists hope to
track where and when H. pylori first took up residence in humans, and
how it traveled to stomachs across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Though the details of H. pylori infection are unclear, it is
believed to occur via the mouth, possibly via water, during the early
years of life. And it clearly involves close community contact: in a
study recently reported at a conference at UCLA, Himalayan Buddhists
and Muslims who have lived in the same area for several hundred years
retained genetically distinguishable populations of the microbe. But
where did H. pylori come from? Is it a new or ancient resident in the
human body?</TE>
<TE>   Some researchers argue that H. pylori got into human stomachs
hundreds of thousands, even millions of years ago. Others believe
that the bug took up residence far more recently--perhaps caught from
close contact with animals after the advent of agriculture, says
Douglas Berg, professor of microbiology and genetics at Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Berg believes that H. pylori wasn't yet in people when they found
their way across the land bridge that crossed what is now the Bering
Strait separating Asia from Alaska. Human residents of North America
had no H. pylori in their stomachs until the advent of the Spanish
conquistadors in the 16th century, says Berg, who bases his belief on
studies of the stomachs of Peruvians. The H. pylori he found in
Peruvian stomachs looks Spanish, Berg says.</TE>
<TE>   Others disagree. Graham and Dr. Martin Blaser, chairman and
professor of the department of medicine at New York University, have
studied H. pylori taken from remote tribes in the Amazon basin.
They've compared these bugs with bacteria taken from Latin Americans
who have mixed European, African and Indian heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Those with mixed ancestry, Graham and Blaser say, have H. pylori
genetic patterns that look European. Those from the remote parts of
the Amazon, however, have patterns more closely related to Asian H.
pylori--as would be expected if the bacteria originated in people who
crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia thousands of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   However far back in human history H. pylori goes, the coexistence
is today drawing to an end. Scientists and companies are researching
vaccines and drugs that could eliminate H. pylori, potentially wiping
out most ulcers and stomach cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone thinks that is a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Blaser, for example, believes that the bacterium has been with us
for a long time--and that it may be part of the normal flora of the
human body: "If it's been present in humans for thousands or millions
of years and now it's gone, what's going to take its place?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, argues Blaser, while the bug is strongly linked to
ulcers and stomach cancer, it appears to offer protection against
diseases of the esophagus, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease
(in which the stomach's acidic contents flow back into the esophagus)
that can cause esophageal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scientists Disagree on Bug's Usefulness</TE>
<TE>   Other experts take strong issue with Blaser. Stomach cancers, they
say, are far more common than esophageal cancers, which also can
easily be prevented.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Martin very well, and I really do not agree," says Dr.
George Sachs, professor of medicine and physiology at UCLA's school
of medicine. "I can treat esophageal reflux disease--and provided I
prevent the acid reflux there won't be consequent esophageal cancer.
On the other hand, it's very hard to treat gastric cancer."</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, however, the issue of whether to eradicate the bug
is moot, says Dr. Julie Parsonnet, associate professor of medicine in
the division of infectious disease at Stanford University. H. pylori
infections still cause large problems in certain countries and ethnic
groups, but wherever sanitation, socioeconomic conditions and
crowding improve, rates of H. pylori infection--and stomach cancers
and ulcers--are dropping, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing it already," she says, "whether we're meant to be
doing it or not."</TE>

<HD>Four Submit Offers for Family Savings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Family Savings Bank, a long- standing black-owned financial
institution in South Los Angeles, has received at least four
acquisition offers--including one from FBOP Corp., an Illinois-based
holding company that has aggressively expanded into Southern
California by snapping up community banks, bank officials confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   But the possible sale to a nonminority-controlled company such as
FBOP has become an issue among local African American leaders, who
fear the loss of a central pillar in the black business community.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to keep the ownership," said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles), who plans to send a letter today to Gov. Gray Davis
expressing the concerns of many leaders of the black community. "That
way we'll know that the bank won't be closed or merged into a bigger
institution."</LD>
<TE>   Bank officials declined to reveal any details of the offers, but
an official with Family Savings described them as "competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Family Savings, which has about $190 million in assets, was pushed
onto the auction block by financial problems that befell WattsHealth
Systems, a network of businesses and community services with
controlling interest in Family Savings.</TE>
<TE>   The bidders include Los Angeles-based Founders Bank of Commerce,
which last year merged with Boston Bank of Commerce to form the
nation's first bicoastal African American bank. Controlling interest
in Founders Bank is held by an investor group that includes Earvin
"Magic" Johnson, pop star Janet Jackson and record industry executive
Jheryl Busby.</TE>
<TE>   Also bidding is FBOP, which, as of Sept. 30, 2001, had banks and
thrifts with combined assets of $8.148 billion, according to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TE>
<TE>   FBOP Chairman Michael E. Kelly confirmed that the Oak Park,
Ill.-based holding company has made a bid for Family Savings but
declined to discuss the terms. Over the last decade the company has
acquired a number of local banks, including Beverly Hills-based
California National Bank, Fidelity Federal Bank parent Bank Plus of
Los Angeles and San Diego National Bank, among others. It also owns
banks in Illinois and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly instead referred comments to Greg Mitchell, president and
chief executive of FBOP subsidiary California National Bank, who
until last year was an investment banker at Founders Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, ironically, we're competing against him," said Founders CEO
Kevin Cohee, adding that as its investment banker, Mitchell is
familiar with Founder's finances and strategic plan, which included
attempting to buy Family.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he signed a confidentiality pact  with Founders. He
said that if FBOP acquires Family Savings, the bank would continue as
a minority-run institution under proposed FDIC guidelines, with the
existing board and management team remaining in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We very much like, trust and respect the management and the board
of directors and believe that teaming up with them we can do great
things for the customers,'' Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers champion, said Founders is
prepared to "match any offer" for Family Savings. "It's our hope and
desire that the people who are going to make this decision are
equally as committed to maintaining the integrity of minority
ownership as we are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the talks  said a third bid came from another
African American-run financial institution.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1948, Family Savings Bank--which began as the Watts Savings
&amp; Loan Assn.--has been a central part of Los Angeles' African
American community, providing mortgage loans to low- and
moderate-income consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were providing mortgages when this community was redlined by
many of the big banks," Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   A combined Founders-Family Savings bank would have about $450
million in assets, which would put it in the running for the nation's
largest black-owned financial institution. Founders and Family
Savings are two of about three-dozen African American-owned financial
institutions in the U.S. today, down from about 50 in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne-Kent Bradshaw, president of Family Savings, said that
keeping the bank in minority hands will be just one factor the
seven-member board considers as it comes to its decision. He wouldn't
say when a decision would be made.</TE>
<TE>   Family Savings is majority-controlled by WattsHealth Systems. In
1995, WattsHealth borrowed $3 million from one of its businesses, a
health maintenance organization called UHP Healthcare, to buy a
controlling stake in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, state regulators seized control of the nonprofit
foundation that operates UHP Healthcare after the HMO fell more than
$20 million into debt .</TE>
<TE>   The state wants the loan repaid and is urging WattsHealth to
separate the bank from its healthcare business.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel: an Empire Built on Deregulation</HD>
<DH>Media: CEO L. Lowry Mays went shopping after Congress eased
ownership limits. Now the company's size is drawing complaints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To see how deregulation can turn an obscure businessman into a sudden
power broker, look no farther than Texas radio billionaire L. Lowry
Mays.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, his modest San Antonio-based chain Clear Channel
Communications Inc. owned 36 radio stations, four under the legal
limit. Then Congress did away with most radio station ownership
limits and Mays went on a frantic shopping spree.</LD>
<LD>   Today, his sprawling empire covers all 50 states, with 1,225 radio
stations, about 10% of the nation's total, plus the country's biggest
live-concert promotions firm, 19 television stations and 770,000
billboards. In a decade, Clear Channel's sales have jumped from $74
million to about $8 billion last year, a stunning 100-fold increase.</LD>
<TE>   But Clear Channel's rapid expansion is provoking allegations that
the radio giant is bullying recording artists and skirting station
ownership rules. Consumer advocates point to the conglomerate as a
symbol of the results of media deregulation--one that should be
examined after a federal court ruling last week that could open the
door to more consolidation in the television and cable industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Our worst fears have been realized," Andrew Jay Schwartzman,
president of the watchdog organization Media Access Project, said
Friday. "A lot of the things Clear Channel is doing are the
traditionally questionable industry practices, now on steroids."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's executives say they have done nothing improper and
tout the benefits of continued deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) urged the
Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to probe
reports that Clear Channel punished stars, such as Britney Spears, by
refusing to play their songs on Clear Channel radio stations because
the musicians declined to hire the company as their tour promoter.</TE>
<TE>   If the allegations are true, such acts would "exacerbate the
negative effects consolidation has had on recording artists,
copyright owners, advertisers and consumers," wrote Berman, a senior
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about Clear Channel's vast size also has spread to Wall
Street. Struggling under $9billion in debt, Clear Channel has racked
up four straight unprofitable quarters. It will report its annual
results Tuesday. Meanwhile, the company's stock closed Friday at
$48.39, about half its record high of two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel says that cost cutting will cushion the company as
it slogs through the advertising slump and that it eventually will
see increased profit.</TE>
<TE>   One cost-cutting strategy Clear Channel is betting on is
repackaging radio shows across the country. The conglomerate is using
so-called voice tracking on a scale that would have been unthinkable
before deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In 48 cities, millions of radio listeners each week tune in to a
station in their market calling itself Kiss FM. Many of the deejays
are in Los Angeles, working for Clear Channel's pop powerhouse
KIIS-FM, but listeners in smaller markets across the country may hear
Rick Dees joking about their local news or Sean Valentine trumpeting
upcoming concerts at their local amphitheater, as well as a similar
playlist laden with bands such as 'N Sync and Linkin Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Kiss" programming recorded in Los Angeles is exported to Des
Moines and Jacksonville, Fla., as a series of taped moments, from
phone calls to song intros, that are spliced together to sound as if
the deejays are chatting from a studio down the street.</TE>
<TE>   The voice-tracked segments, music and commercials can be whisked
from one station to another on a digital network that is potentially
available to 80% of Clear Channel's stations. Producers cut and paste
the segments to  create the appearance of deejays taking live
requests and calls from listeners, or even record half of a
conversation for a live deejay to interact with.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel touts this as a technique that delivers big-city
deejay talent to small markets that couldn't otherwise afford it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Controversy Over Radio Program Repackaging</TE>
<TE>   "Our Kiss brand is like McDonald's," said Todd Shannon, a Clear
Channel brand manager overseeing many of the stations. "When you see
the Kiss ball logo, there's no mistaking what you're going to get.
It's a Top 40 product, but they're all localized inside."</TE>
<TE>   But competitors say the Kiss format doesn't benefit Clear Channel,
listeners or the radio industry.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, Clear Channel converted an oldies station to a Kiss
outlet that now only offers a local deejay during the afternoon and
evening shifts, company officials said. "Everything else is the
robot," said Todd Cavanah, program director of competing pop station
WBBM-FM.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making radio into spoon-fed generic" junk, said Mike
Spencer, who programs rival pop station KLUC-FM in Las Vegas, where
Clear Channel introduced a Kiss station. "They're turning listeners
off. It gives listeners one more reason not to listen to radio but to
turn on their computer or use CDs," Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's campaign so far has yielded mixed results--newly
branded Kiss stations have upset dominant pop stations in such
markets as Cincinnati and Boise, Idaho, but failed to gain much share
in some bigger markets, including Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Voice tracking also has prompted some concern among authorities in
the past. Two years ago, Clear Channel was fined $80,000 by the
Florida attorney general for misleading radio listeners into thinking
that a national contest was local, in part because the company dubbed
a local deejay's voice into an interview with a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel touts the benefits of cross-promotion, or leveraging
one asset to benefit another. Yet critics say Clear Channel's idea of
synergy essentially means it hoards radio programming, concert
tickets, access to stars and concert advertising dollars for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel owns Premiere Radio Networks, which has been
shifting its syndicated radio shows, such as Jim Rome's sports talk
fest and Rush Limbaugh's political program, from competitors' to
Clear Channel's stations.</TE>
<TE>   Artist managers also are nervously eyeing Clear Channel's
expansion of station-sanctioned concerts, commonly known as radio
shows.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of various artists have said for years that
broadcasters coerce acts into playing the shows for little or no fee
by refusing to air their latest songs unless they appear.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have said the practice of trading airplay for an
artist's appearance without disclosing the deal is a violation of
federal anti-payola laws. Since 1960, federal law has forbidden
broadcasters from accepting money or anything of value in exchange
for airplay without disclosing the payment.</TE>
<TE>   But Clear Channel executives say their events, such as KYSR-FM's
annual "Not so Silent Night" concert, fairly compensate acts and
aren't forced upon them with threats.</TE>
<TE>   Running a radio powerhouse is a far cry from Mays' early days,
when he studied petroleum engineering in college. People who know
Mays say the 65-year-old former investment banker never imagined he
would control such a sweeping empire.</TE>
<TE>   Salesmanship always has been his forte, said John Barger, a former
executive of the company, who helped Mays and partner B.J. "Red"
McCombs, run their first small radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Before building a radio empire, Mays worked for a local investment
house and commuted to New York. The first stock he pitched was that
of a small photo processing company, Barger recalls.</TE>
<TE>   To identify prospective investors, Mays paid a neighborhood youth
$10 to copy license plate numbers from cars parked in front of the
company's local store, then paid another youth to visit the
Department of Motor Vehicles to pull addresses for each of the cars,
Barger said. Each one received a letter from Mays suggesting they
invest in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Mays got into the radio business almost by accident.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Mays and McCombs purchased an unprofitable FM station
after a local furniture dealer convinced Mays of its potential,
Barger said. Two years later, Mays purchased San Antonio's
WOAI-AM--one of about 25 designated "clear channel" stations, granted
a frequency free from interference. He turned it into a news-talk
station and slowly added more properties.</TE>
<TE>   Mays took the company public in 1984 and started to buy up
stations, developing a reputation as a cost cutter. Even now, critics
deride the company as "Cheap Channel."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong Ties to the Bush Administration</TE>
<TE>   Mays also has a long-standing interest in politics, backing
candidates seeking everything from the San Antonio mayor's office to
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   While governor of Texas, President Bush appointed Mays to a state
technology council in 1996. Mays contributed $51,000 to Bush's 1998
gubernatorial campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel also contributed $106,000 to the Republican National
Committee during the presidential election cycle, with Mays and his
wife, Peggy, donating an additional $37,000 to the party.</TE>
<TE>   And the Justice Department's current antitrust chief, Charles
James, formerly headed the antitrust department at the Washington law
firm that represented Clear Channel when the company sought
regulatory approval of its purchase of radio broadcaster AMFM Inc. in
2000, when it also purchased concert promoter SFX.</TE>
<TE>   Buying entertainment giant SFX cost Clear Channel $4.4 billion,
making it instantly the nation's biggest promoter with $2 billion in
live-event revenue a year.</TE>
<TE>   Among the thousands of concerts, family events, Broadway shows and
other events it took on after the SFX deal, Clear Channel also found
itself putting on Supercross motorcycle races. But last year Clear
Channel and the motorcycle industry's trade association began
exchanging blows after contract renewal talks broke down.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials at the American Motorcyclist Assn., which
sanctions Supercross races, say Clear Channel has sought to undermine

<HD>Fees Cut Deeply in Immigrant Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Halving fees immigrants pay to send money to relatives in Mexico, El
Salvador and other Latin American countries would pump about $1.5
billion in extra cash into the region, a study released Sunday
showed.</LD>
<LD>   The Inter-American Development Bank, which commissioned the study,
says getting more immigrants to use traditional banking institutions
rather than transfer services such as First Data Corp.'s Western
Union Financial Services Inc. and Viad Corp.'s MoneyGram Payment
Systems Inc., would unleash more money for Latin American
development.</LD>
<LD>   ''Only banks, credit unions and regulated micro-finance
institutions in recipient countries can leverage the economic impact
of remittances,'' the IDB said.</LD>
<TE>   About 5% of the U.S. population was born in Latin America. Along
with immigrants from the region in Japan, Spain and other countries,
they sent about $23.1 billion to relatives in their countries of
origin, according to the IDB.</TE>
<TE>   It costs about $3 billion to get this money to its destination
because many immigrants lack bank accounts, as do many of their
home-country relatives.</TE>
<TE>   That means wire transfer companies such as Western Union and
MoneyGram Systems, which charge more than banks to wire money abroad,
get a bigger share of the business.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting service fees would mean an extra $98.6 million for El
Salvador, $90.4 million in the Dominican Republic and $48 million for
Jamaica, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   ''We welcome the competition,'' said Wendy Carver-Herbert, a
Western Union spokeswoman. ''Competition benefits consumers and makes
us a better competitor.''</TE>
<TE>   Western Union last year began allowing customers to pay $9.99 to
send as much as $300 to Mexico, compared with $14.99 to wire money
within minutes, Carver-Herbert said. Western Union sets its own
exchange rate, which can translate into an additional fee.</TE>
<TE>   Viad declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans remitted about $9.3 billion in 2001. The U.S. Treasury
Department is discussing with Mexican officials ways to reduce
payments on those transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Seven out of 10 Latin American immigrants living in the U.S. send
money home, with those earning $20,000 or less more likely to do so
than workers earning incomes in excess of $40,000, the IDB found.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of these immigrants use Western Union to send money to
their relatives and 11% use MoneyGram, while only 20% use banks or
credit unions, according to an IDB survey conducted by Bendixen &amp;
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-six percent of the poll's respondents said that just the
fees they pay in the U.S. for MoneyGram and Western Union totaled $10
to $30. Only 25% of respondents said that fees paid to banks for
remittances were in that range.</TE>
<TE>   Bendixen conducted the survey by telephone and said its findings
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Only 56% of the
immigrants polled said they have bank accounts in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Northwest Air Opens Doors at New Terminal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Northwest Airlines Corp. opened its $1.2-billion terminal at
Detroit's Metropolitan Wayne County Airport on Sunday, expanding the
fourth-largest U.S. airline's gate and ticketing capacity by 50%.</LD>
<LD>   The airline, based in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan, Minn.,
began working with Wayne County in 1994 on the development of the new
terminal, said Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara, after whom the
terminal was named. It has 97 gates and 106 ticket counters.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest Chief Executive Richard Anderson declined to reduce
planned spending on the new terminal when the recession and lower
business travel led the carrier to cut 1,500 jobs last year. He also
maintained the plans after terrorist attacks damped travel demand and
resulted in Northwest reducing flight and seating capacity 20% and
laying off 10,000 employees.</LD>
<TE>   Anderson has said that the airport expansion at Detroit, its
biggest hub, and at its other large bases in Minneapolis and Memphis,
will be the key to increasing sales and profitability.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said it will determine flight and seat capacity growth
for this year, if there is any, as it gets a better view of demand.
For the second quarter, capacity will still be 12.5% lower than it
was for the period last year, spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said.</TE>

<HD>NBC Expects an Olympian Profit</HD>
<DH>TV: The network posts a 15% ratings jump over the 1998
Winter Games on CBS and says it should clear $75 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC parlayed the nation's Winter Games medal avalanche, a
controversial skating protest and the bitter international backlash
against the U.S. into a 15% ratings jump over the 1998 Nagano Games
on CBS. The strong performance enabled NBC to sell an additional $20
million in advertising after the Olympic torch was lit and
underscored the boost a network gets when the Games are staged in the
country's backyard.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 184 million Americans, or 84% of all households with
television sets, tuned in for Olympic action during the last two
weeks. The network that paid $545 million for broadcast rights from
Salt Lake City sold $740 million in advertising and expects to clear
a $75-million profit.</LD>
<LD>   NBC was the top-rated broadcast network during each prime-time
broadcast from Salt Lake City, according to Nielsen Media Research.
NBC also registered a 23% ratings increase among hard-to-reach but
highly desirable viewers ages 18 to 34.</LD>
<TE>   NBC, which holds broadcast rights for Games to be held through
2008, and the U.S. Olympic Committee knew going into Salt Lake City
that the Olympic movement was falling from favor among younger
Americans. Unlike their parents, who viewed the Olympic Games through
the prism of the Cold War, media-savvy youngsters are more likely to
treat the Olympic Games as just another media-driven event akin to
the Oscars and the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Olympic audience was split almost evenly between viewers
over and under 50. But the number of men ages 18 to 34 watching rose
by 26%, the highest increase of any single demographic.</TE>
<TE>   Younger viewers remain "the most difficult audience in television,
it doesn't matter what [program] it is," said Dick Ebersol, chairman
of NBC Sports &amp; Olympics. "They have the most other opportunities,
and, obviously, they take advantage of them."</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol might well have been talking about Robert Talbert, 34, of
Huntington Beach. Talbert, who works in the security industry, said
he was turned off by NBC commentator Bob Costas' style. What's more,
Talbert said, "I wouldn't let the Olympics change my schedule." On
Sunday, Talbert ignored the gold medal hockey match and instead rode
bicycles along the Huntington Beach coastline with Nedra Bradshaw,
30, of Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of indifference NBC hoped to counter with an
extensive advertising and marketing campaign that began months before
the Games. NBC hosted opening ceremony viewing parties in bars,
crisscrossed the country in two Winnebagos loaded with Olympic
paraphernalia and capped nightly broadcasts with live performances
from Salt Lake City by Sheryl Crow, Dave Matthews and other popular
acts.</TE>
<TE>   NBC benefited from a decision to concentrate on edgy sports action
instead of the softer human-interest pieces that aired during the
2000 Summer Games in Sydney. NBC also cut back on tape-delayed
broadcasts that caused NBC's ratings to plummet during the distant
Sydney Games.</TE>
<TE>   Also helping the network was the fact that Salt Lake City is just
a time zone or two away from most American viewers. The network drew
criticism before the Games began for a 21/2-hour delay in nightly
broadcasts in the Pacific time zone, but West Coast ratings
consistently were stronger than the national average.</TE>
<TE>   News, both on and off the ice rinks and ski slopes, clearly drove
viewers to NBC.</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented U.S. medal bonanza ignited interest. So did the
pairs skating scandal. The action continued on Sunday when Canada
beat the U.S. hockey team, 5 to 2, in the gold medal match. And
Olympic officials stripped medals from cross-country skiers suspected
of using performance-enhancing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "People tune in to where the news is being made, and that's
translated into a terrific Olympics for NBC," said Stephen Greyser, a
sports marketing expert at Harvard University. "Viewers have been
tuning in and staying with NBC." Though much is made of the steady
splintering of mass media, the Olympics proved that network coverage
of the Games is still a powerful force. Ratings for NBC broadcasts
through Saturday were 147% higher than the current television
season's prime time average among ABC, CBS and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's broadcasts delivered what the network's promotion arm
promised. "The Salt Lake City Games will go down as one of the most
significant games of our times," said Denver-based sports marketing
executive Dean Bonham.</TE>
<TE>   "They've unquestionably been the healing games for the U.S. in the
aftermath of Sept. 11. But there have also been more compelling
stories about athletes than in any Games I can remember."</TE>
<TE>   The wealth of attractive story lines ranged from that of Vonetta
Flowers, the first African American to win Winter gold, to Jim Shea,
a third-generation Olympian whose family is being described as "the
first family" of the U.S. Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also recognized that most Americans have limited time. The
network cut back its nightly Olympic broadcast to 31/2 hours from
Sydney's five-hour schedule.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will stick with the slimmed-down schedule for broadcasts
during the Athens Summer Games in 2004, the Torino Winter Games in
2006 and Beijing Summer Games in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   NBC wasn't alone in breathing a sigh of relief at public interest
in this year's Winter Games. The medal avalanche that buried American
athletes in gold, silver and bronze and strong television ratings
materialized at a key juncture for the USOC, which has used the Games
to court potential corporate sponsors needed to pay for training of
future Olympic teams.</TE>
<TE>   Early on in the Winter Games, the USOC's marketing team wined and
dined corporate executives with elaborate tours that included stops
at the Olympic Village, the international media center and the nearby
USA House, where athletes sporting Olympic medals mingled with
potential sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   At first, corporate executives "were giving me an earful about how
all the other events have caught up with and passed the Olympics,"
said Robert Prazmark, an executive with IMG, the Cleveland sports
marketing firm that recruits corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   But with the U.S. team awash in medals and NBC's ratings high,
"potential customers are asking how do we get involved," Prazmark
said. "I'd love to say it's skill, that we could have predicted this
swell in interest. But everything has just fallen into place."</TE>

<HD>Firms Easing Restrictions on 401(k)s</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Many employers had been considering changes to
stock sale rules before Enron's fall. For others, event was a wake-up
call.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies already are loosening restrictions on workers selling
company stock in their 401(k) plans as scrutiny of retirement plans
increases after the Enron Corp. debacle.</LD>
<LD>   International Paper Co. and newspaper publisher Gannett Co.
recently said they will allow employees to sell company stock in
their 401(k) accounts much more quickly than has been allowed. San
Francisco-based ChevronTexaco Corp., the nation's second-largest oil
company, said it will make similar changes in April.</LD>
<LD>   Pension experts said they expect these companies to be the first
among many to revise rules related to selling company stock within
401(k) plans.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you without question that there are going to be more
companies like Gannett that will loosen the restrictions in their
plans," said Michael Scarborough, chief executive of Scarborough
Group, an Annapolis, Md., savings plan management firm.</TE>
<TE>   The changes come as more than a dozen bills are being proposed in
Congress that would limit holdings of employer stock in employees'
401(k) plans, provide employees with greater rights to sell company
stock and increase employer liability for retirement plan losses of
workers whose assets are invested in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies want to do what's right before the government tells
them what to do," said Robyn Credico, defined-contribution plan
practice leader for the Eastern division of Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
"They want to do it when they believe it's the right time, rather
than being told."</TE>
<TE>   International Paper had been considering its changes for more than
a year--long before the Enron failure prompted a wave of proposals
for reforming 401(k)s, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But a Gannett spokeswoman said changes to the company's plan were
directly related to Enron's situation.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that employees were hurt so badly at Enron caused
everyone to look up and say, 'Gee, maybe we'd better fix this,'" said
Tara Connell, Gannett's director of communications. "Nobody really
thought about it before. All of a sudden, it was just there."</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 employers offer company stock through their 401(k)
plans, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in
Washington. About 60% of those firms have some sort of restriction on
when employees can sell company stock they received as a matching
contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Companies usually allow employees wide latitude in selling company
stock purchased with their own 401(k) contributions.</TE>
<TE>   However, company stock given by an employer as a matching
contribution usually can't be sold until employees reach a certain
age or are with the company a certain number of years.</TE>
<TE>   The most common restriction bars employees from selling until
they're 50 or 55, said Paul Heller, head of the defined-contribution
business at mutual fund company Vanguard.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit of that provision was that companies were giving the
employees stock for retirement and they wanted them to keep it for
retirement," Heller said.</TE>
<TE>   Gannett said last week that it would allow employees to sell the
company stock they receive through matching contributions
immediately, instead of making them wait until age 55. ChevronTexaco
will do the same when its new plan is implemented.</TE>
<TE>   International Paper, which contributes to its 401(k) solely in
company stock, said that its matching contributions will be made only
half in company stock and that workers will be able to sell half the
stock they get through the match immediately, if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms had been contemplating changes before the Enron crisis,
in part because they are trying to incorporate financial advice for
workers into their 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   "When you add financial advice into your plan, the company stock
issue hits you right in the face," Heller said. "Everyone will tell
you it's a bad idea to have too much of your assets in one company's
stock."</TE>
<TE>   The Enron meltdown--which cost employees as much as $1 billion in
retirement savings when the company's stock collapsed--may have
stepped up the pace, however, said Dallas Salisbury, president and
chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "What an Enron situation tends to do is take an issue that may
have been on the back burner for years and suddenly move it from the
14th priority to the highest priority for review," Salisbury said.</TE>
<TE>   Heller said at least 10 of Vanguard's big 401(k) clients have
started to remove restrictions on selling company stock and many more
are discussing it. "It's a definitive trend," Heller said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though some companies are taking the initiative on 401(k)
reform, backers of pension legislation said Congress still needs to
take action.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron is not the first case like this," said David Sandretti,
communications director for Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has
submitted a bill that would bar workers from investing more than 20%
of their 401(k) assets in their own company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to see it again, unless we do something," Sandretti
said. "People should be encouraged to invest and save their own
resources for retirement, but some responsibility needs to be imposed
on the system."</TE>

<HD>Skilling Faces Legal Risks With Testimony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling's decision to
testify before Congress a second time carries new risks of possible
criminal charges against him, legal experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee will ask Skilling on
Tuesday to explain what they say are contradictions between his
testimony to a House panel on Feb. 7 and that of other Enron
executives, who say he knew details of the partnerships that
triggered the energy trader's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   "To testify a second time can compound the original danger," said
Robert Plotkin, a lawyer with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker who
specializes in securities fraud cases. "He runs the risk of saying
something contradictory to something he's already testified about."</LD>
<TE>   The testimony comes as Congress is broadening Enron hearings to
examine the role of Wall Street analysts who kept "buy" ratings on
Enron while the company's finances fell apart. Analysts from J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Lehman Bros. Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston and
Citigroup Inc. will testify before the Senate Government Affairs
Committee on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey McMahon, president and chief operating officer, and
Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president, will testify at the same Senate
Commerce Committee hearing where Skilling will appear. They've said
he knew about the partnerships that helped hide $1 billion in losses
while enriching senior executives who managed them.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, who resigned Aug. 14, three months before Enron filed
the largest bankruptcy in history, denied wrongdoing and testified
that he left oversight of the partnerships to others.</TE>

<LD>IPO investors can welcome the brave new, post-Sept. 11 world by
buying shares of a company that makes surface-threat electronic
warfare systems and command-destruct transmitters.</LD>
<LD>   Integrated Defense Technologies Inc., a defense electronics
company, plans a $136.5-million initial public offering for Tuesday
that will benefit from heightened interest in all things military as
well as from an absence of other IPOs. Integrated Defense "looks like
a very solid company," said Adam Friedman, senior portfolio manager
for the Armada Large and Small Cap Value Funds, which have $1.5
billion of assets.</LD>
<LD>   The Huntsville, Ala., company makes electronic combat systems,
diagnostic and power systems, and communications and surveillance
systems that are used in fighter aircraft, naval vessels and combat
vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue grew to $264 million in 2001 from $102.2 million in 1999;
the company earned a small profit in 2001 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse First Boston is leading underwriter in the IPO.

<HD>Investors Await Revised GDP Figures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signs this week that the U.S. economy is making a comeback could
offer the stock market a pick-me-up with a slew of economic data set
for release and a speech on the economy by the nation's top central
banker on tap.</LD>
<LD>   Investors will be awaiting confirmation that the U.S. economy grew
faster than previously reported at the end of last year, with revised
fourth-quarter gross domestic product data due Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings news is likely to take a back seat to other issues,
although investors will be tuned in for results from retailers Gap
Inc., Home Depot Inc., Lowe's Cos., Target Corp. and Federated
Department Stores Inc.</LD>
<TE>   High-speed communications company Global Crossing Ltd., which
filed for bankruptcy protection in January and whose accounting
practices are under review by federal regulators, also is set to
report results this week.</TE>
<TE>   After months of fretting about recession, economists have been
scrambling to raise their forecasts for U.S. growth, convinced by
signs such as improved retail sales and a narrower trade gap. These
signals have raised hopes that the recession that began last March
will be short and shallow.</TE>
<TE>   The GDP data, along with reports on personal income and spending,
consumer confidence, the manufacturing sector, durable goods,
existing and new-home sales and construction spending could underpin
stocks, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will grab the spotlight
when he gives his twice-yearly testimony on the economy to Congress,
speaking before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday
and later before the Senate Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   This week's schedule of economic data:</TE>
<TE>   Today, the National Assn. of Realtors issues its January report on
sales of previously owned homes.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, the Conference Board issues its index of consumer
confidence for February.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, the Commerce Department reports on factory orders for
durable goods new-home sales during January.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the Commerce Department issues revised figures for GDP
from October to December. The report is expected to show a rise of
0.8% to 0.9% annual rate, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   A report is expected from Chicago-area purchasing managers on
business at factories during January.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the Commerce Department reports on construction spending
during January.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan releases a separate confidence measure
for January.</TE>
<TE>   Also, The Institute for Supply Management, formerly known as the
National Assn. of Purchasing Management, issues its closely watched
manufacturing index for February.</TE>

<HD>Hiring May Improve Slightly in Spring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hiring will improve slightly nationwide this spring, but enough to
mark a recovery from recessionary levels, according to a forecast
coming today.</LD>
<LD>   About 21% of the companies interviewed said they planned to add
jobs in April through June, while 10% said they anticipated cutting
staff during that time, according to Manpower Inc.'s quarterly survey
of 16,000 American businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the companies said they either expected to maintain
their staffing levels or were uncertain about hiring activities in
the second quarter.</LD>
<TE>   When seasonally adjusted, the findings reflect a 1% increase in
hiring activity during the first three months of the year. The survey
found a flat hiring trend in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the survey's second-quarter findings are down from the same
time last year, when 28% of the firms said they planned to hire more
people and 8% intended to cut staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are going to be hesitating for some time yet, but the
trend could turn into something more positive in the next two or
three quarters," said Jeffrey Joerres, chairman and chief executive
of Glendale-based Manpower, the nation's largest staffing company.</TE>
<TE>   The increase was the survey's first in more than a year. Manpower
expects the increase to continue in the next few quarters, which
could signal a recovery, Joerres said.</TE>

<HD>Record Sales in U.S. Take Tumble in 2001</HD>
<DH>Music: Data point to worst slump in decades; factors
include online piracy, sluggish economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of recorded music and music videos in the U.S. plunged 4.1% to
$13.7 billion last year, according to figures from the Recording
Industry of America.</LD>
<LD>   The data confirm earlier statistics showing the music industry has
fallen into the worst sales slump in at least a decade. Record
executives say they are being crushed by a combination of spiraling
marketing and radio promotion costs, online piracy and economic
sluggishness.</LD>
<LD>   RIAA officials also said shipments of music products plummeted
10.3% in 2001, compared with a decline of 7% a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The trade organization's statistics are based on record-label
shipments of 968.6 million compact discs, cassettes, vinyl recordings
and music videos, down from 1.08 billion last year. The data measure
products shipped to retailers--not actually sold to customers--and
distributed through record clubs and mail-order catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   RIAA officials cited online piracy and CD-burning as a major
factor in the dropoff. Recent RIAA surveys of music fans 12 to 54
years old found that 23% said they didn't buy more music last year
because they downloaded or copied most of their music for free.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 50% of those who have downloaded music for free said
they had made copies of it, up from 13% two years ago, the RIAA said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We cannot ignore the impact on the marketplace,'' said Hilary
Rosen, the RIAA's chief executive.</TE>

<HD>Agents, SAG in Tentative Agreement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for the Screen Actors Guild this weekend reached a
tentative agreement with the Assn. of Talent Agents that would allow
agencies to make and receive investments in companies involved in
production, sources said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed three-year contract would significantly change the
ground rules of Hollywood that have been in operation since 1939--the
same year  "Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz" hit the silver
screen.</LD>
<LD>   The rules were drafted to curb conflicts of interest and protect
actors from being exploited by unscrupulous talent agents by
forbidding agents from representing actors while also working on
behalf of producers or movie studios.</LD>
<TE>   Agents have pushed for more than two years to loosen the rules,
saying the provisions were outdated and prevented agencies from
attracting much-needed capital from companies that have only marginal
interest in film production such as advertising agencies or
investment bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new proposal, independent production companies and large
advertisers would be allowed to invest as much as 20% in a talent
agency, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Movie studios and television networks still would be forbidden
from owning or investing in a talent agency. The prohibition would
extend to a studio's parent company, such as Viacom Inc., AOL Time
Warner Inc., Walt Disney Co., Vivendi Universal, News Corp., Sony
Corp. or Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., or any subsidiary of those
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Under no circumstances will the agents become the employer of the
actors they represent or become a producer,'' said a SAG source
involved in the negotiations, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, which would take effect July 1, still must be
approved by SAG's board of directors and membership, and be ratified
by talent agencies. The SAG board will meet on March 11 to consider
the proposed new pact, which amends and modifies portions of the 1939
"master franchise agreement'' while leaving conflict of interest and
many other provisions intact.</TE>
<TE>   The entire agreement, including the provisions first drafted
during the Depression and those agreed to this weekend, would then
expire in July 2005, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   SAG and the Assn. of Talent Agents plan to announce the agreement
today. The two sides imposed a news blackout during the contract
talks, but sources said Sunday that both sides won important
concessions during five weeks of arduous negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The previous agreement expired Jan. 20, but the two sides
continued to work under the old rules while they continued
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement would represent a sea change for Hollywood. The 1939
agreement had no termination date and the rules--called
evergreens--extended into perpetuity. However, that structure made it
impossible for talent agents to make changes since those representing
SAG members must agree to abide by the "master franchise agreement''
before securing an actor client.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the agreement to one that expires in three years paves
the way for agents--and actors--to forge new rules.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vast difference and gives both sides an opportunity to
make changes,'' said one executive close to talent agencies who asked
not to be identified. "But this is more than just an agreement, it's
a new partnership between the actors and the agents.''</TE>
<TE>   The talent agents have tentatively pledged to become more involved
in SAG's efforts to stem runaway production that has become a drain
on the local economy as well as other regions around the country. New
York, Chicago, North Carolina and other areas have watched their
bustling business of movie or commercial production pack up and head
north to Vancouver and Toronto and halfway around the world to
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Although the details have not been worked out, the talent agents
will assist SAG members in making sure that their jobs fall under the
provisions of SAG labor agreements--no matter where the movie or TV
production is shot. There has been some confusion whether SAG
contracts could be enforced when a production is moved to a foreign
location.</TE>
<TE>   SAG's national board has established May 1 as the date for the
guild to begin enforcing the provisions of SAG agreements for all
productions that involve SAG members, no matter where a production is
filmed.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed new agreement with agents, according to sources, also
will set up a "bond'' to protect actors should a talent agency go out
of business. During the last two years, two or three smaller firms
have shuttered, and actors have gone without their paychecks, which
producers often send directly to the actor's talent agent or manager.
Now, the Assn. of Talent Agents will contribute an undisclosed sum to
start a SAG fund that actors can tap if an agency defaults on
payments.</TE>
<TE>   SAG also would be granted legal standing to represent actors if an
agency files for bankruptcy. The proposed agreement also would set up
an "Actor Benefit Fund," to accept contributions to SAG's health plan
by talent agents.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed provision would allow agents to receive commissions
on an actor's residuals for works on home video--for as long as three
years after the initial release of a theatrical motion picture.
However, for an agent to qualify for a commission, the actor would
have had to receive salaries that exceeded union scale. The provision
would not apply retroactively, meaning video commissions would not be
owed on work negotiated or shot before July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agreement would allow some production companies to
invest in an agency, SAG sources say performers would be protected
because of a proposed provision that would require full disclosure
when an agent has made or received an investment in or from an
industry-related company.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement will empower SAG members to make informed choices
about who their franchised agent will be,'' said a SAG source who
asked not to be identified.</TE>

<HD>Decision Not to Hire Applicant Because of Smoking Is Legal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Can an employer refuse to hire someone because the
applicant smokes?</LD>
<LD>   During a lengthy interview for a mechanic's position at a major
company, I had a cigarette on a break. After the interview, I was
told the company decided to hire someone else because I would be
leaving the buildings too much to smoke.</LD>
<LD>   If the employer acted illegally, what are my options?</LD>
<TE>   --H.H., Hawthorne</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes. There is no state or federal law protecting employees
who smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, California law requires employers to take significant
steps to ensure their employees are not subjected to smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Section 6404.5 of the California Labor Code, which was enacted
into law in 1994, states that the regulation of smoking in the
workplace is a matter of statewide interest and concern. This section
specifically notes that an employer is not obligated to provide
reasonable accommodation to smokers or to provide break rooms for
smokers.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, this employer did not act illegally.</TE>

<TE>   Jobless Benefits May Not Be Awarded for Move</TE>
<TE>   Q: If I quit my part-time job in order to move to another state,
can I collect unemployment benefits? If I need a reason why I moved,
could I use air quality as a valid reason? Would I need a physician's
statement?</TE>
<TE>   --R.M., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: If you apply for unemployment benefits under these
circumstances, your application is likely to be denied.</TE>
<TE>   A mere desire to move to another state is not considered "good
cause" to justify payment of benefits. Nor will a mere concern about
one's general health as a result of air quality in a particular
geographical area suffice.</TE>
<TE>   Only where the nature of the work involved causes an undue risk of
injury or illness--and such risk is documented by medical
evidence--would an employee be deemed by the Employment Development
Department as having "good cause" to leave employment for health
reasons.</TE>

<TE>   Manager Might Be Entitled to Layoff Notice</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is a 10-year employee working as a warehouse manager for a
California corporation entitled to a layoff notice or severance pay,
or both?</TE>
<TE>   --D.C., Buena Park</TE>
<TE>   A: An employer generally is under no obligation to provide an
employee with severance pay. However, some companies have written
policies providing such pay in the event of a layoff. You should
check to see if your employer has such a severance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding a notice, employers with more than 100 workers are
required by federal law to provide 60 days' notice when there will be
closure of a plant or a department within a plant that will result in
at least 50 employees losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The notice period also is required when there will be a mass
layoff--one that involves at least one-third of the work force and at
least 50 employees.</TE>

<TE>   Firm May Have to Pay Worker for Stolen Tools</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am a carpenter with a construction company that specializes
in remodeling homes.</TE>
<TE>   My employer requires me to provide my own tools, which are kept in
a locked storage cabinet inside a locked garage on the employer's job
site.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the job site was burglarized and my tools, worth about
$4,000, were stolen. Is my employer responsible for this loss?</TE>
<TE>   --B.S., Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   A: It is not unusual for certain employers, such as construction
companies, to ask employees to use some of their own tools.</TE>
<TE>   But the employer would be responsible for the loss of those tools
when it sets conditions that you describe--requiring you to provide
your tools as well as storing them in the employer's garage. An
employer is responsible for employee expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The employer might have been able to circumvent its responsibility
for the losses by providing a "disclaimer of its liability" in the
employee handbook or posting such a notice at the storage cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of such a statement, the company would be
responsible as the owner of the cabinet in which it required you to
store your tools.</TE>
<TE>   If the company is responsible, its obligation probably would be
limited to the value of the stolen tools in their used condition,
rather than the cost of replacing them with new tools.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the company might be receptive to reimbursing you for the
full cost of replacing your tools, particularly if the loss is
covered by insurance.</TE>
<TE>   If you were working as an independent contractor, however, you
might be responsible for replacing the tools.</TE>

<HD>Songwriters File Lawsuit Against Music Companies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of successful songwriters filed a class-action lawsuit Friday
against the world's largest music corporations, contending they were
cheated out of millions of dollars in royalty payments for albums
sold through record clubs.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which echoes accusations voiced in recent lawsuits by
pop stars Courtney Love and the Dixie Chicks, was filed in Los
Angeles Superior Court by the estates of songwriter Tim Hardin and
four other composers. Among those named as defendants in the suit:
Columbia House Music Club, BMG Direct, Universal Music Group and Sony
Music Entertainment, as well as Capitol, Virgin, Interscope, Elektra,
Warner Bros. and Atlantic.</LD>
<LD>   The suit accuses the clubs and the music corporations that own
them of conspiring to pay reduced royalties to songwriters for more
than three decades. It also contends that music companies do not
allow songwriters to audit record club sales, making it impossible to
determine how much money composers may be owed.</LD>

<LD>Intel Corp. is expected today to unveil a new line of Pentium 4-based
chips for the $55-billion U.S. server market.</LD>
<LD>   The chips, called Xeon, run 30% to 80% faster than the current
Intel crop and feature a new technology called hyperthreading, which
boosts performance by allowing each chip to manage two separate
streams of data simultaneously.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement is part of the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor
giant's ongoing effort to diversify its business beyond consumer
desktop computers.</LD>

<LD>What does $60,000 buy in the transportation world these days? A
Porsche Boxster convertible sports car, for one, but if that's a
yawner, there's always a self-balancing scooter.</LD>
<LD>   Amazon.com Inc. is auctioning the first three consumer Segway
Human Transporters, the motorized scooters unveiled by inventor Dean
Kamen late last year.</LD>
<LD>   The machines went on the block at midnight Tuesday with a first
bid of $1.75, and by late Friday had attracted hundreds of bids, with
the top ones ranging from $86,000 to $106,000. Since the auctions
won't close until March 28, those prices are sure to climb.</LD>
<TE>   All auction proceeds will go to FIRST, a nonprofit group run by
Kamen to popularize science and technology.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chief Technology Officer Craig Mundie said making
consumer and corporate data completely secure as they pass over
computer networks will take a decade or more and will require
stepped-up efforts from software writers.</LD>
<LD>   Though some of the largest software maker's products have been the
victim of hacker attacks in the last few years, the entire industry
must devote more programmers to combat computer viruses and other
security vulnerabilities, Mundie said in a speech at a security
conference in San Jose last week.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing that we or anybody else can do that fires a
silver bullet at this problem and it all gets better overnight, or
even in a small number of years," he said.</LD>

<DH>Apple's latest desktop or Gateway's 500SE: Which wins?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apple Computer's new iMac is the most stylish personal computer you
can buy. But is it the best entry-level computer?</LD>
<LD>   To answer that question, I've spent the last couple of weeks using
a new iMac alongside another new, low-cost computer: Gateway's 500SE,
which runs Microsoft Windows XP.</LD>
<LD>   Basics. I tested an 800-megahertz iMac with 256 megabytes of
memory, a 60-gigabyte hard drive and Apple's SuperDrive, which can
read and burn both CDs and DVDs. At $1,799, this iMac is the
costliest; next month, Apple will ship a $1,299 model that runs at
700 MHz and has a standard CD burner and less memory and hard drive
space. All iMacs have 15-inch, flat-panel screens.</LD>
<TE>   The Gateway 500SE sells for $999 and includes a 1.6-GHz Pentium 4
processor, an inadequate 128 MB of memory, a 20-GB hard drive and a
CD burner. It too has a 15-inch flat-panel screen.</TE>
<TE>   Both computers also include modems, Ethernet networking jacks,
speakers and Universal Serial Bus connectors (three in the iMac, four
in the Gateway).</TE>
<TE>   The iMac also contains two FireWire jacks.</TE>
<TE>   So the Gateway is initially less expensive, but its price
approaches the iMac's if you add a DVD burner, FireWire, more memory
and a bigger hard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Looks. You've seen the iMac: it's a futuristic white dome topped
by the display, which pivots and swivels at the touch of a finger.
The round speakers look like two clear, acrylic eyeballs. The entire
system is unique, and you either love it or hate it.</TE>
<TE>   You've seen the Gateway, too, or at least you've seen a dozen
similar computers. It's a basic beige tower, with a display and
speakers to match. From a design and engineering perspective, it's as
unique as a Quarter Pounder.</TE>
<TE>   The iMac is larger than it looks in Apple's advertisements. Its
circular base is about 10 inches in diameter, and the display and
chrome arm protrude several more inches. I had to push the iMac
partway off the back of my desk to get the display to a comfortable
viewing distance.</TE>
<TE>   I lost less desktop space to the Gateway, whose display is only
about five inches deep. (Of course, the beige tower sat on the floor
alongside my desk.) You can adjust the Gateway's display only
slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Setup. A single cable powers the iMac and its speakers. The
Gateway requires one outlet for the tower, one for the display and a
third for the speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Most Windows PCs have similar outlet appetites.</TE>
<TE>   Boot the iMac for the first time, and a program helps you set up
the computer and optionally register with Apple.</TE>
<TE>   When I booted the Gateway, I saw an odd Windows XP error message
recommending that I try booting again. The second time was the charm,
and Windows XP's setup and "activation" screen appeared. You can skip
activation, but only for 30 days, at which point Windows XP stops
working until you register with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Both the iMac and the Gateway have fans, but the iMac's is
significantly quieter.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion and speed. No contest here: The Gateway has three
general-purpose expansion slots; the iMac none. The Gateway can
accommodate a second internal hard drive or a removable-media drive;
the iMac can't.</TE>
<TE>   On my test track, the Gateway was faster in most tests, but it
wasn't twice as fast--proving that performance isn't determined by
processor speed alone.</TE>
<TE>   Verdict. From the hardware perspective, neither computer cleaned
the other's clock. The iMac has style and setup advantages; the
Gateway is marginally cheaper and far more expandable. Both are fine
for home and business users. The biggest differences between them lie
in the software they include and the operating systems they run.</TE>
<TE>   I'll talk about that next week.</TE>

<HD>She's Still a Believer</HD>
<DH>Former Exodus CEO Ellen Hancock sees a future for Web
hosting and dot-coms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From her perch at the helm of Exodus Communications Inc., Ellen
Hancock had a front-row seat for the high-tech boom and subsequent
meltdown that transformed Silicon Valley twice in a few short years.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara, Calif., company, which manages Internet systems
and hosts Web sites for businesses, seemed perfectly positioned to
take advantage of the sudden demand for all things dot-com.</LD>
<LD>   Just days after Hancock took over as president, Exodus made an
initial public offering and saw its stock rise 84% in its first day
of trading. After six months of explosive growth, Hancock was
promoted to chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike many of her Silicon Valley counterparts, Hancock came to
her assignment with copious experience in the technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   She spent 29 years at IBM Corp., where she rose from programmer to
senior vice president for networking hardware and software and
software solutions. She then jumped to National Semiconductor Corp.,
where she served as chief operating officer, then became chief
technology officer for Apple Computer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough to protect Exodus from the dot-com implosion,
which wiped out a sizable chunk of the company's customer base.</TE>
<TE>   With losses and debts mounting, Hancock resigned Sept. 4, two
weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy protection. British
telecommunications giant Cable &amp; Wireless agreed in November to buy a
large part of the company for $850 million.</TE>
<TE>   After gaining some perspective, Hancock is eager to rejoin the
Silicon Valley fray. She spoke with The Times about what she has
learned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: What went wrong with the Web hosting sector? Why did it
collapse?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I wouldn't say it collapsed. It certainly got damaged, but
I believe there's still a future for the Web hosting business.</TE>
<TE>   Customer demand diminished in two very significant places.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the original Web hosting was with dot-coms and start-ups.
They ran into some serious issues, and many of them collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The second impact, which unfortunately hit right around the same
time, is that enterprises [large corporations] got cautious. They
weren't buying as much. That hit the hosting business because that's
pure outsourcing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How can the business recover?</TE>
<TE>   A: These Web hosting companies have expertise in building data
centers. They have power experts, security experts and networking
experts, and they have massive Internet networks. Once we all
stabilize from the effect of the dot-coms and we start to see
enterprise growing again, you'll see Web hosting survive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was the dot-com meltdown enough to force Exodus into
bankruptcy, or could the company have made it if the enterprise
market had held steady?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's hard to say. Clearly the company would have been in a much
better position if we had seen in 2001 the growth in enterprise we
had seen in 2000. That would have been a tremendous safeguard.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no question the dot-coms were the bigger problem. They
wound up to be about 40% of the business, but they were more than 50%
of the failures. Some people just literally couldn't pay you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Looking back, did the industry expand too rapidly and build too
much capacity?</TE>
<TE>   A: Even as we were going into 2001, we were out of space in
several cities. Our salespeople were legitimately concerned that
customers would say, "We want more space."</TE>
<TE>   The construction we had underway at the end of 2000 matched the
demand we saw. We felt we were still responding to real customer
demand. Practically everyone in the industry had construction
underway.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, there's a choice, and one could choose not to do
that much buildup and give up market share.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there still a future for dot-coms?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe so. I happen to still be an optimist.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the promises of the Internet were over-hyped, and there
were many business cases that were not appropriate. Some of the
business plans were way too early. Some of them didn't really
consider the distribution system.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone just assumed there was going to be hyper-growth on the
Internet and they didn't pay attention to the costs of selling or
marketing. But the Internet still has an amazing ability to improve
supply chain management and to improve customer support.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Everyone recognizes now that the expectations and stock prices
for tech companies were overheated during the boom. Do you think
people are being too hard on the tech sector now?</TE>
<TE>   A: Many investors--individuals as well as venture
capitalists--were so burned that they got very cautious. Hopefully
they'll start investing again in some of the companies that in fact
deserve investment. Now some companies are getting hurt by that
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you mean by "hurt"? Are you afraid that good ideas will
die from lack of funding?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think that's happening in some cases. We probably have lost
some technology as we went through 2001 and into 2002 in the form of
companies that did not get funded and had to shut down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How are things different in a downturn for a young company like
Exodus compared with a stalwart like IBM?</TE>
<TE>   A: IBM had built up a lot of processes over the years. Although
they felt the pain of it, at least they had been through this before.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these Silicon Valley companies had never seen a layoff
before. They had no procedures for how to do it. They also didn't
know about severance or medical benefits, or how to help their
employees find new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A company like IBM can put the brakes on in a very clear fashion a
little faster than others, whereas the start-ups don't even have
procedures for putting the brakes on. It was also harder for the
start-ups because they depended so much on their stock, and once the
stock declines, the economic situation becomes harsher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: After you left Exodus, pundits were predicting that women
executives would become a casualty of the tech meltdown. Do you think
women are more vulnerable than men?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think so. I did my own look at how many CEOs made it
out of a bankruptcy, male or female, and the number's not too good.
What will be interesting to see is whether women bounce back as fast
as some of the men seem to. There's still a concern as to whether a
board would be more sensitive to a female running the company than a
male.</TE>

<HD>Blind Gain New Site for Literature</HD>
<DH>Internet: Bookshare.org offers electronic books for the
visually impaired that people have scanned in and donated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An online service launched last week is expected to provide the
largest electronic library for the blind and visually impaired on the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Bookshare.org features more than 8,000 books--from New York Times
bestsellers to the classics--that individuals can download and print
in Braille or listen to using software that reads text aloud.</LD>
<LD>   As its name suggests, the site's collection is maintained by
individuals who donate electronic copies of books they have scanned.</LD>
<TE>   "[We're] trying to make it no more difficult to get your hands on
a book if you're a blind person than if you're a sighted person,"
said Jim Fruchterman, chief executive of Benetech, a Palo Alto
nonprofit enterprise that launched the site.</TE>
<TE>   As few as 3% of published materials are available in Braille or
audiotape, said Penny Reeder, editor of the American Council of the
Blind's monthly Braille Forum.</TE>
<TE>   To read most books, the blind must scan works into a computer that
has character-recognition software, hire someone to read to them or
wait--sometimes more than a year--for the Library of Congress to
produce an audio version.</TE>
<TE>   For individuals unable to keep up with the latest books that their
friends or co-workers are reading, Bookshare.org will be liberating,
Reeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most blind people who have access to computers or note-taking
devices are very, very excited about this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped offers Web-Braille, an Internet service that provides
electronic versions of some Braille books and magazines produced by
the NLS.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few hundred older titles are available, most of the
books on Web-Braille were published after 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Only magazines published since May 2001 are available through the
service.</TE>
<TE>   Bookshare.org allows individual readers to make decisions about
what gets added to the database, in much the same way Napster.com
allowed music buffs to share their collections.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Fruchterman, who also created a talking reading machine
for the blind, developed the service shortly after he discovered his
13-year-old son downloading music through Napster.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Napster, which led to massive copyright infringement,
Bookshare.org is legal.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 amendment to U.S. copyright law permits the reproduction of
copyrighted works for the blind and people with disabilities without
seeking permission from each publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the amendment, books on the site are only available to
individuals who have visual impairments, reading disabilities or
physical impairments that prevent them from reading printed books.
Individuals must submit proof of disability, such as a doctor's note,
before accessing the service.</TE>
<TE>   There is a set-up fee of $25 and an annual fee of $50.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent individuals from unauthorized sharing, each book is
encrypted and contains digital fingerprints. The Assn. of American
Publishers, which worked closely with Fruchterman in developing the
site, also will continue to monitor distribution, said Allan Adler,
the association's vice president for legal and government affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the books are only available to people with disabilities,
anyone can donate.</TE>
<TE>   Benetech stores books on its own server. The database is expected
to grow by a few thousand books a month initially.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, it could become the largest full-text electronic
library in the world, Fruchterman said.</TE>
<TE>   That would make reading a lot easier--and enjoyable--for Jennifer
Sutton, a 35-year freelance writer and consultant in Silver Spring,
Md.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton, who is blind, must scan a book into her computer to listen
to an electronic reading. Scanning at the rate of about 50 pages an
hour, it can take her up to four hours to scan an average paperback.</TE>
<TE>   "I can do it for myself, but it's not very much fun," Sutton said.
"It's so much more fun to think of other people benefiting when
you're sitting there for hour after hour trying to get a good copy."</TE>

<HD>Analysts Predict More Bids for TRW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp.'s offer Friday to acquire TRW Inc. for $47 a
share, or about $5.9 billion, is just the first round of what could
become a protracted bidding war that could see competing suitors
offering as much as $58 a share, analysts and investment bankers
said.</LD>
<LD>   TRW, one of the last major arms contractors to avoid the defense
consolidation trend of the last decade, became a prime acquisition
target immediately after its chief executive abruptly resigned early
last week to take the top job at aerospace rival Honeywell
International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   With reports that two major defense companies and a third
non-defense-related conglomerate had contacted TRW about a possible
merger, Northrop quickly put together the $47-a-share offer that
analysts immediately derided as too low. Investors seemed to agree
and drove up TRW shares to $50.30, or a 26% increase, Friday in
anticipation of competing bids.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said Sunday that the U.S. unit of British-based BAE
Systems is considering a bid for TRW, joining a growing list that
already includes Lockheed Martin Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. BAE
officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. BAE, with its
recent acquisition of Lockheed Martin's defense electronics business,
now is one of the nation's largest defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers said merger and acquisition departments at
several aerospace companies were scrambling over the weekend to
assess TRW's value. In some cases, such as that of Lockheed Martin,
which already has a large military satellite business, antitrust
concerns are being reviewed. TRW runs one of the nation's top
classified spy satellite businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a deal will get done at $50 to $55 a share," Ken
Blaschke, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in San Francisco, said in his
note to investors Sunday. "We do not see any logical reasons for
TRW's management or board not to sell the company."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Northrop appeared to be anticipating a competing bid
and left open the possibility of revising the offer for the company
in its letter to TRW executives.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, dated Feb. 21 and addressed to Philip A. Odeen, a
former TRW executive who was brought in last week to run the company
while he helps find a chief executive, and to Kenneth W. Freeman, the
company's lead director, Northrop said the current offer of $47
represented a 22% premium over TRW's average trading price for the
last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   But it added that "we would welcome the opportunity to consider
nonpublic information concerning TRW, and we are prepared to consider
in our offer any enhanced values that may be demonstrated by such
information."</TE>
<TE>   The letter, signed by Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa, said the
company was looking forward to a response to the offer by Wednesday
with the hopes of completing the deal by the end of the third
quarter, an unusually tight deadline that may have been prompted by
fears of a bidding war.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several industry officials said Northrop may have an edge
over other competing bids. Odeen is familiar with Ronald Sugar,
Northrop's president and chief operating officer, having worked with
him while both were at TRW. Sugar is seen as taking over the top post
at Northrop upon Kresa's retirement, expected in the next year or
two.</TE>
<TE>   One issue that puzzled analysts was Northrop's apparent confidence
that it can sell or spin off TRW's automotive business, which has
been saddled with debt and has been a drag on earnings. For the last
year, the problems in the auto parts business kept potential suitors
at bay.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's automotive business, which included the production of air
bag systems, brakes and steering systems, accounts for $10billion in
sales annually, representing 60% of the company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But a company source said that the auto business appears to have
made dramatic improvements in recent months and thus is more
palatable to potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Byron K. Callan, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, said in a report
this month that though he did not believe "TRW's automotive business
will turn into an engine of growth and profitability" in the next
year, "we do think the downside risk from these businesses has
decreased."</TE>

<HD>Xbox Success in Japan Crucial for Microsoft</HD>

<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Emboldened by the strong launch of its Xbox console in the United
States last year, Microsoft Corp. over the weekend rolled out the
device in Japan, where the computing giant faces intense pressure to
prove itself in the ferociously fickle fight for the hearts of video
gamers.</LD>
<LD>   Although it represents less than one-third of the global
$20-billion market for video games, Japan is disproportionately
important for Microsoft because the country is the center of the
gaming universe.</LD>
<LD>   The three titans of video games for the last two decades--Nintendo
Co., Sega Corp. and Sony Corp.--all are Japanese companies, as are
many of the industry's top developers.</LD>
<TE>   If Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft can gain acceptance in Japan's
quirky $6-billion game market, it may have an easier time selling
Xbox around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Cognizant of the country's strategic value, Microsoft has invested
heavily in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company won't say how much it has spent, Microsoft
established a 200-person Tokyo studio to develop games dedicated to
Japanese players. It blitzed the Japanese public with television ads
over the last few months to build awareness.</TE>
<TE>   And Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was in Tokyo's trendy Shibuya
district to personally sell the first Japanese Xbox. At earlier
retailer meetings, Gates even played a traditional shamisan stringed
instrument in a nod to Japanese sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, Japan is their biggest challenge," said P.J. McNealy, an
analyst with Gartner Inc., a market consulting firm in San Jose.
"They are considered outsiders."</TE>
<TE>   Even Microsoft is sober about its prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "We are cautiously optimistic," said John O'Rourke, vice president
of sales and marketing for Xbox. "You've got Sony and Nintendo there,
both Japanese companies. But we think we've got great games, a very
reliable system and very reliable partners."</TE>
<TE>   Sony enjoys a commanding lead in Japan with 60% of the game
hardware market. Nintendo has 30% and Sega has 10%. Microsoft shipped
an initial 250,000 units to Japan, a fraction of the 1 million
PlayStation 2s Sony sold in the system's debut weekend two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Skepticism runs deep among Japanese analysts and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some still question the extent of their long-term ambitions,"
said Masashi Morita, a video game analyst with Okasan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's reputation among some is seen as technically
proficient but a bit stodgy, in an industry where 15-year-olds can
drive the market. Nor has the company been helped by the first 12
software titles released with the machine. These include auto racing
and conventional sports themes geared more toward buyers in their
mid-20s--near-senior citizens in the video game market. In addition,
the absence of a role-playing game--an ultra-popular genre in
Japan--could hamper sales.</TE>
<TE>   One such game is "Final Fantasy X," whose popularity has helped
drive sales of Sony's PlayStation 2, currently installed in 10
million Japanese households. The game, the 10th incarnation of the
Final Fantasy series, was developed by Square Co., a powerhouse
developer partially owned by Sony and, therefore, unlikely to make
games for Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The game's success is partly due to the Japanese preference for
sequels, which will take Microsoft time to develop. Most Japanese
like the assurance of knowing what they're getting, and that it's
probably a better version than its predecessor, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I like games in series," said Hidetoshi Hirota, a 21-year-old man
who was hanging out in Shibuya, Tokyo's trendy youth-oriented
neighborhood. "Without these, the Xbox might not do well."</TE>
<TE>   Though clearly the underdog, Microsoft has strengths. It has been
able to recruit dozens of Japanese developers, including Konami Co.,
Koei Co., Capcom Co., Namco Co. and, significantly, Sega, whose
stable of game developers and franchises has acquired legendary
status in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft boasts the most powerful game machine on the market. The
Xbox also has a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet adapter, which
must be purchased separately for the PlayStation 2 and are not yet
options for Nintendo's GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the differences in graphics quality among the three
consoles thus far are minor.</TE>
<TE>   "Only maniacs will notice," said Asuka Yazaki, a video game writer
with Weekly Ascii magazine. "Most mere mortals won't know the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also is hoping to distinguish itself with an ambitious
plan to bring Xbox gamers online this year via the device's built-in
Ethernet adapter, which lets users access high-speed Internet
connections. But the company is likely to meet with resistance from
Sony, which is developing its own strategy for delivering online
entertainment via the PS2. Sony, which also owns Japanese Internet
service provider So-Net, plans to launch its network in late March or
early April.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one of Microsoft's biggest challenges is the size of its
console. Bulked up by an internal 8-gigabyte hard drive, the Xbox is
larger and heavier than the PS2 and the GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bigger than a coffee table in most Japanese houses," said
Daryl Pitts, a game designer and consultant who has worked for
numerous Japanese developers. "It's an eyesore and will never be
accepted like that. Microsoft needs to hire a Japanese manufacturer
to completely redesign it."</TE>
<TE>   The console's steep price may also keep Japanese consumers away.
At $268, it is about $37 more than the PS2 and $73 more than the
GameCube. (It's still about $39 cheaper than the system's $299 price
in the U.S.) Exacerbating the situation in Japan is an economy in its
fourth recession in a decade, a banking sector on the verge of
collapse, weak consumer spending and the highest unemployment rate
since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "The pricing disparity seems high to me," said Shawn Milne, game
industry analyst with Soundview Technology Group in San Francisco.
"Initial demand among hard-core gamers may be there, but Microsoft
may need to evaluate their price shortly thereafter."</TE>
<TE>   A random sampling of the curious in Shibuya found people
interested by the buzz but not in any hurry to fork over $260 unless
and until it becomes more of a force to be reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   Riena Ise, a 19-year-old college student, owns five hardware
systems--the Nintendo Famicon and Super Famicon machines, the Sony
PS1 and PS2 and the Sega Dreamcast. And that's about enough, she
reckons. "I don't think I'll buy an Xbox," she says. "It's quite
expensive."</TE>

<HD>Eckstein Hopes He's Still the Answer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>If the Angels did not believe they could win this season, they would
not bother with the discussion. David Eckstein would play shortstop,
Adam Kennedy would play second base, and the team would stand pat
until one of their infield prospects forced its hand.</LD>
<LD>   But, with the acquisition of pitchers Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele
and designated hitter Brad Fullmer, the Angels consider themselves
contenders. Their discussion of whether to pursue veteran free-agent
shortstop Rey Sanchez reflects a more fundamental question: Can they
win with Eckstein at shortstop?</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein, a second baseman throughout his minor league career, has
sure hands and an accurate arm. The limited range he displayed at
shortstop during his rookie season last year suggests second base is
his best position.</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein and Sanchez each had 333 assists as American League
shortstops last season, but Eckstein played 1,051 innings there for
the Angels and Sanchez 851 innings for the Kansas City Royals. Angel
coach Alfredo Griffin, a Gold Glove shortstop in 1985 with Oakland,
said the team can win a championship with Eckstein at shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "He played all his [minor league] years at second base, so you
have to assume he is a better second baseman than shortstop," Griffin
said. "He played there because of the need we had. But he did great."</TE>
<TE>   Range is difficult to improve. Eckstein said he included quickness
exercises in his off-season workouts, the better to get that crucial
first step needed to stop a ground ball up the middle or in the hole
between shortstop and third base.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin noted that Hall of Fame-bound shortstop Cal Ripken made up
for below-average range with superior positioning, studying hitters
well enough to anticipate where the ball would be hit.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have no doubt that Eckstein has the work ethic and the
intelligence--he was an academic All-American at the University of
Florida--to emulate Ripken in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   "You can position yourself to show you have range, because you're
playing the hitter right," Griffin said. "You can take that question
away if you're always in the right position."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein said he feels comfortable at shortstop but would return
to second base if the team asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I will play wherever they want me to play," he said. "I'm just
happy to be on the field. And that's no lie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels welcomed an old friend to training camp Sunday. Bobby
Grich, the second baseman on all three of the Angels' division
championship teams in 1979, '82 and '86, joined the team as a spring
training instructor and immediately went to work.</TE>
<TE>   He held two post-practice tutoring sessions, one with the middle
infielders and another with Kennedy alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard not to listen to a guy who had a career like that,"
Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Grich, 53, the inaugural member of the Angels' Hall of Fame,
returned to the team this season in a part-time position.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to coaching in spring training and in the fall
instructional league, he'll make appearances on behalf of the team
before community groups and corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels put a renewed emphasis on their history, Grich said
he hopes to recruit other former players living in Southern
California--including Jim Abbott, Rod Carew, Doug DeCinces, Mark
Langston, Kirk McCaskill and Mike Witt--to get involved with the
organization. Abbott has expressed interest in working as a spring
training instructor next season, and Grich and Jim Fregosi are
expected to be among those on hand when the Angels hold their first
adult fantasy camp here next February.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will distribute Grich bobblehead dolls April 27.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the pinnacle," he said, laughing. "You know you've made it
when you're a model for a bobblehead doll.</TE>
<TE>   "Seriously, I'm flattered they would do that, and I'm honored they
would invite me back."</TE>

<HD>Cruz Has New-Age Explanation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortstop Deivi Cruz reported Sunday to the San Diego Padres' spring
training camp at Peoria, Ariz., insisting he is 26 years old.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioner's office informed team officials Friday that
Cruz's original birth certificate shows he is 29.</LD>
<LD>   "If I show you my license, everything, it says 26 years old," Cruz
said. "I've got 26 on one paper; I've got 29 on another paper. That's
the problem. I had to go back to the Dominican and find out how old I
really am."</LD>
<TE>   So, how old is he?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 26," Cruz said. "But they say I was born in '72."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz is among several major league players from the Dominican
Republic who have suffered age inflation with more stringent
record-checking on visa applications.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, who spent his first five major league seasons with the
Detroit Tigers, became a free agent last winter and signed with the
Padres for $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to pull anything on anybody," Cruz said. "When
you go out there and play, it doesn't matter how old you are. You
don't think about how old you are. You just go out and do your job."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz batted .256 with seven home runs and 52 runs batted in last
year but probably will be a backup to rookie Ramon Vazquez, who has
drawn praise in early workouts.</TE>

<TE>   Toronto Blue Jay right-hander Esteban Loaiza won't throw for 15
days because of a lesion in the labrum of his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Loaiza was Toronto's opening day starter in 2001 but moved to the
bullpen in midseason, finishing with an 11-11 record and 5.02
earned-run average.</TE>

<LD>Stanford slugger Carlos Quentin got into the record books the hard
way.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent game against Florida State in Tallahassee, he was hit
five times by pitches--a Division I record--by five different
pitchers. The major league record is three, held by many.</LD>
<LD>   Quentin didn't think the Florida State pitchers were aiming at
him. "I think it was just bad luck," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Wrote Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "If he ever

<TE>   Arriving in style: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Barry Bonds reported to camp in a chauffeured stretch limo, which
stretches more than Barry does.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's good to see him putting his new money to use. With the
energy Bonds saves by not driving himself to work, the man might hit

<TE>   Alternate desperation plan: What would the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
have done if Jon Gruden had turned down their offer or if Al Davis
suddenly decided the compensation package wasn't good enough? Wrote
David Whitley of the Orlando Sentinel: "The next stop on the Glazers
Over America tour was probably Barry Switzer's front porch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Whitley: Commenting on Gruden: "You've got to like a guy who
looks like Dennis the Menace, sounds like John Wayne, quips like
David Letterman and doesn't think offense is a dirty word."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eclectic list: Before Tampa Bay hired Gruden, freelance writer
Norman Chad commented: "My Tampa Bay sources tell me the Glazer
family has narrowed its latest list of Buccaneer coaching candidates
to four--Steve Mariucci, the late Vince Lombardi, Red Klotz and the
kid who played Screech on 'Saved by the Bell.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good thinking: Tubby Raymond, 75, who recently retired after 36
years as University of Delaware football coach, was asked why his
team didn't have a booster club: "I don't want to organize my own
lynching mob," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boo hoo: Sacramento's Gerald Wallace, beaten in the NBA All-Star
slam-dunk finals by Jason Richardson of the Golden Sate Warriors,
vowed never to return. "It's all politics," Wallace said. "I'm not
doing it anymore."</TE>

<TE>   And finally: Andrew Bagnato of the Chicago Tribune recalled how
the late Jim Murray used to ridicule unsophisticated fans of Big Ten
teams when they visited the Rose Bowl: "One year he described (Iowa)
Hawkeye fans as 'thousands of people in calico and John Deere caps in
Winnebagos with their pacemakers and potato salad looking around for
Bob Hope.'''</TE>

<LD>Josh Howard sat in front of his locker, sobbing uncontrollably with
his head buried in a towel.</LD>
<LD>   Playing with a painful sprained left ankle, Howard had 18 points
and 15 rebounds in 25 minutes for No. 20 Wake Forest on Sunday. But
the junior forward also made a mistake that cost his team a possible
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Dixon made a technical free throw with 1.3 seconds left after
Howard called a timeout that Wake Forest didn't have to cap
Maryland's 90-89 victory at College Park, Md.</LD>
<TE>   Lonny Baxter scored 25 points and Dixon had 20 for the Terrapins
(23-3, 13-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), who trailed by 12 points
shortly after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins led, 89-87, before Howard scored and was fouled with
10.1 seconds left. He missed the free throw, and after Dixon missed a
jump shot, Howard grabbed the rebound and quickly formed a "T" with
his hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons (18-10, 8-6) received an automatic technical
foul. Dixon made the first shot, missed the second, and Wake Forest's
Broderick Hicks came up short on a long field-goal attempt as time
expired.</TE>
<TE>   "It was instinct. I could make a million excuses, but I just
messed up," Howard said. "A lot of people have done it. I'm just one
of them. The worst thing is that I let down my team."</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Duke 97, St. John's 55--Jason Williams and Carlos Boozer
each had 12 points in Duke's 35-1 run to close the first half at
Durham, N.C., and the Blue Devils (25-2) handed the Red Storm its
fourth-worst loss ever.</TE>
<TE>   Williams finished with 26 points and Boozer had 20 and 11
rebounds. Eric King had 16 points for the Red Storm (18-9).</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 57, No. 23 Indiana 54--Marcus Taylor scored 16

deficit at East Lansing, Mich.</TE>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry started Darius Miles in Corey Maggette's place at
small forward Saturday against the Indiana Pacers. Miles scored four
points, making only one of six shots and two of six free throws in 36
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   So, Gentry will probably turn to Tremaine Fowlkes tonight against
the Memphis Grizzlies, the fourth game on the Clippers' five-game
trip. Miles, only 20, simply is more comfortable playing in a reserve
role.</LD>
<LD>   Fowlkes, a rookie from Fresno State who was signed Saturday to a
10-day contract, gave the Clippers seven points and six rebounds in
17 minutes in his NBA debut against the Pacers.</LD>
<TE>   "Looking back at the times I've started him, he hasn't played that
well," Gentry said of Miles, who often enters games with guard
Quentin Richardson late in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes the combination of players he plays with. There's a good
chance I'll start Tremaine and bring Darius in off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, sidelined because of a dislocated fourth and fifth
metacarpals on his right hand, did not attend the team's practice
Sunday at Rhodes College.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered a concussion in Wednesday's victory over the Miami
Heat and was troubled by a headache Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry attempted to lighten the team's mood by ending practice
with a series of shooting games. After Saturday's loss, the
ninth-place Clippers fell three games behind eighth-place Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't give anyone messages at this point," Gentry told
reporters. "Obviously, everybody understands the importance of these
games. The Knute Rockne speeches are over. We understand the position
we're in."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Memphis, 5 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site--Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>

<TE>   Update--Memphis has lost five of six, including a 78-72 defeat
Thursday against the Phoenix Suns. The Grizzlies scored only six
points in the fourth quarter after leading most of the way.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</LD>
<TE>   One of the segments on this edition of "Real Sports" deals with
dodge ball, the schoolyard game that has been around for generations.
"Real Sports" is known for tackling controversial topics, so one
might wonder: Why dodge ball?</TE>
<TE>   It's no joke, even though the segment opens with Adam Sandler, as
overgrown kid Billy Madison, playing dodge ball in the movie "Billy
Madison." Although Bernard Goldberg's report might cause some
chuckles along the way, the people he interviews are very serious,
and very passionate.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who believe the game, in which the object is to
hit other kids with a rubber ball, teaches excessive violence and
should be banned. And there are those who believe such a ban would
result in an over-sensitized world where kids aren't allowed to be
kids.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Williams, a physical education scholar from Eastern
Connecticut State, is a proponent of banning the game. "Dodge ball is
a game that brings out the worst in kids," he tells Goldberg. "It
eliminates kids from games. Kids get hit in the head. Kids are human
targets. It's just not a game that has values that we should be
teaching our children."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Labash, a writer for the Weekly Standard, bashes such
thinking. "It's the wussification of America," he calls it.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg asks, "You think we're getting soft?"</TE>
<TE>   Labash: "It seems like we are more and more raising our kids like
little veal chops, tenderized little medallions that we need to
guard, we need to sort of plane all the edges off of life."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg: "What does that tell you about America?"</TE>
<TE>   Labash: "It tells me that we're prepared to mollycoddle our
children to any extent. Anything to eliminate the possibility of
pain, degradation, humiliation, second-place finishes, we'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   Another one of the four segments on this edition of "Real Sports"
is about a junior high school basketball coach in Alexandria, La. The
school has a winning tradition, but what sets this coach apart is
that he is also the school janitor who has a ninth-grade education.
It's quite a story.</TE>

<HD>Sutherland Goes Unmatched</HD>
<DH>Golf: The No. 62-seeded player wins match play event as
McCarron falters for second week in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>It remains to be seen how bright a future a $5.5-million match play
tournament will have, especially when Tiger Woods, David Duval and
Phil Mickelson check out before they get their mints on their
pillows.</LD>
<LD>   If throwing around hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money
is what it takes to create a buzz, then that's just about all the
Accenture Match Play Championship had going for it Sunday at La
Costa. That is, unless you consider it compelling to send out the
45th- and 62nd-seeded players and watch them do battle over 36 holes.</LD>
<LD>   It certainly wasn't the fault of Kevin Sutherland (No. 62) that he
won $1 million by edging Scott McCarron, 1-up, in a match that began
at 7:30 a.m. and lasted until just after 3 p.m., about the time one
last McCarron putt failed to go in. After all, Sutherland did what he
was supposed to do--beat everyone in his path and score his first PGA
Tour victory at age 37.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe they should have called it the California Cup, since the
final involved two guys from Sacramento who played junior golf
together. Meanwhile, McCarron finished a Sunday unfulfilled for the
second consecutive week. At Riviera last Sunday, he lost a lead,
bogeyed two of the last three holes and lost the Nissan Open.</TE>
<TE>   At La Costa, he found out he isn't even the best player from
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever I said last Sunday, ditto," McCarron said about coming
up short two weeks in a row. "Brutal."</TE>
<TE>   The winning player from Sacramento didn't play that well from the
tee, which can happen when you play six matches in five days, but he
was terrific everywhere else, especially out of the rough and on the
green using his new 'claw' putting grip.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Sutherland hit only 11 of 28 fairways. Actually, you
can say he hit 12, if you count the fifth fairway, which Sutherland
hit while playing the second hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so bad," Sutherland said. "I just forgot about even trying
to hit the fairway. I was deciding what rough it would be better to
be in, left or right."</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland did not take a lead until the 33rd hole. McCarron's
seven-foot putt rimmed out and Sutherland won the hole with a
four-foot putt for par.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's best chance to get even was at the closing hole.
Sutherland drove into the right rough, then into a greenside bunker.
McCarron's second shot landed about eight feet to the left of the
flag. But Sutherland blasted out of the bunker to two feet, which
meant that McCarron would have to roll in his putt to stay in the
match. Instead, it rolled just to the left, missing by inches.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I hit it perfectly," McCarron said. "That's just the
way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland made one birdie over the back nine in the afternoon and
so did McCarron, but McCarron lost the 32nd and 33rd holes with
bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's problem was that despite how well he felt he was
hitting his putts, not enough of them went in. He missed a
seven-footer for par at No. 14, the 33rd hole, had a seven-footer rim
out for par at the 15th, missed a 12-footer at the 16th and then the
eight-footer at the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have won, but he was just a buzz saw out there,"
McCarron said. For his troubles, McCarron earned $550,000 as
runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   The morning round ended just as it had begun--even.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron could have had an edge after the first 18 holes, but
three times he followed a birdie with a bogey that enabled Sutherland
to remain close.</TE>
<TE>   After he made a birdie at the 17th to go 1-up for the fifth time,
McCarron missed the green at the 18th, ran his chip shot six feet
past the hole and missed the putt coming back. Sutherland, who never
led the first 18 holes, hit the center of the green and his two-putt
par evened the match.</TE>
<TE>   The week didn't get off to a smooth start, when the top three
ranked players in the world--Wood, Mickelson and Duval--lost on the
first day. For ABC, which televised the event, and for the players'
sponsors, it was downright bad news. In fact, at Nike, which endorses
both Woods and Duval, their ouster became known around the campus at
Beaverton, Ore., as "Black Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   However, it didn't come close to being the worst start, although
Woods' demise represented the first time in the four years of the
event that the No. 1-seeded player had failed to advance to the round
of 16.</TE>
<TE>   After two days, only Sergio Garcia and David Toms were left from
the ranks of the top 10. Woods was the lone top-10 player remaining
after two rounds in 1999, the event's low-water point.</TE>
<TE>   Accenture announced Sunday that it had agreed to a four-year
contract with the International Federation of PGA Tours to continue
as title sponsor through 2006. While PGA Tour Commissioner Tim
Finchem said the match-play event will be held in the U.S., it was
uncertain if it would remain at La Costa because there are new owners
at La Costa Resort and Spa. KSL Resorts, which owns Doral, La Quinta
Resort and PGA West, bought the La Costa property in November.</TE>
<TE>   In the consolation match, Paul Azinger bogeyed the first extra
hole and Brad Faxon scored a 1-up victory. Faxon made $450,000 and
Azinger made $360,000.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ian Leggatt ended a decade of frustration Sunday, carving out a
two-shot victory over Loren Roberts and David Peoples in the Tucson
Open for his first victory on the PGA Tour.</LD>
<LD>   The 36-year-old Canadian, who attended PGA qualifying school last
year after failing to keep his card after his rookie season, tied his
career-low with a final-round eight-under-par 64. He had a 72-hole
total of 20-under-par 268, the lowest score at Tucson since David
Frost's 266 in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The $540,000 winner's purse is more than Leggatt's combined
earnings since turning pro in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   Heath Slocum, who had the lead after shooting 64 on Saturday, shot
72 for a 272 total.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Lietzke had three birdies on the back nine and shot a
five-under-par 67 to win the Audi Senior Classic on the Capultepec
course at Naucalpan, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Lietzke, who opened the final round five shots off the lead,
recovered from an opening round 75 and finished at eight-under-par
208 on the tree-lined, 7,119-yard course at an altitude of 7,800
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Gary McCord and Hale Irwin shared second place at 207. Ed
Dougherty, who held a two-stroke lead after Saturday, shot a
three-over 75 and finished tied for fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam ended Karrie Webb's hope to win the Australian
Ladies Masters for the fifth consecutive year when Webb bogeyed the
fourth playoff hole at Royal Pines in Gold Coast. Sorenstam shot a
final-round 69.</TE>

<LD>Chick Hearn's recovery from a broken hip is progressing ahead of
schedule and he may be back announcing Laker games sooner than
expected, his orthopedic surgeon said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's doing just great," said Herbert Huddleston of the Southern
California Orthopedic Institute. "He's remarkably strong and his
clarity of mind is amazing."</LD>
<LD>   Huddleston, who performed hip surgery on Hearn at Valley
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys Tuesday, said Hearn still wants to
go back to work Friday, the original date scheduled for his return
from heart surgery.</LD>
<TE>   "I really don't think that's a possibility, but March 10 might
be," the doctor said. "Realistically, though, he's probably a month
away."</TE>
<TE>   After the surgery, Huddleston predicted Hearn would return to work
in late April.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was transferred to the hospital's acute rehab department on
Friday, where he has been undergoing physical and occupational
therapy three hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "He is walking 50 to 100 feet a day and making steady progress,"
said Tim Tavanbakhsh, the hospital director of acute rehab services.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn is expected to go home next weekend after finishing his
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker announcer broke his hip when he fell at a service
station in Encino on Feb. 17. Hearn was about to begin pumping gas
when his car began rolling forward. He fell when he tried to jump
back into the car.</TE>

<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Despite being only five for 28 from three-point range this season,
Kansas freshman Keith Langford wasn't afraid to put it up one more
time.</LD>
<LD>   It turned out to be the biggest shot of his career.</LD>
<LD>   Langford made a three-point shot with 33 seconds to play and the
No. 1-ranked Jayhawks rallied to defeat Nebraska, 88-87, Sunday to
clinch the Big 12 Conference regular-season title for the first time
in four years.</LD>
<TE>   "I figured if it was coming my way I was going to go up and shoot
it," said Langford, who finished with seven points. "You play
basketball to be in that type of situation."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas (25-2, 14-0) overcame a 12-point deficit in the second half
to win their 12th in a row, trailing for nearly all of the final 15
minutes. The Jayhawks' Drew Gooden had 26 points and 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   John Robinson and Cary Cochran each scored 22 points to lead the
Cornhuskers (12-13, 5-9), who had a school-record 18 three-point
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   In the final seconds, Robinson missed a shot inside the
three-point line.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jackson Gets Their Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Before Sunday's game, Laker Coach Phil Jackson said he was no longer
giving his team days off from practice.</LD>
<LD>   Not after long overtime games the day before. Not after long
trips. Never.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't afford it until they show me they deserve it," Jackson
said. "Their focus is not very good. They would end up getting
disintegrated. They don't have a long attention span."</LD>
<TE>   Will Jackson stick to his edict?</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers themselves will decide that by their attention span in
the days ahead. It's another motivational tool by Jackson to try and
keep a two-time defending NBA champion interested during the dog days
of a seemingly endless regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, figure the Lakers' attention span will significantly
increase the day the postseason begins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It sounded as if it came as a revelation to the New York Knicks'
Kurt Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a big fella," he said of Shaquille O'Neal after Sunday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Especially if you are a converted center giving away four inches
and about 100 pounds to the man you are defending.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough out there," said Thomas, a natural forward filling
in for injured center Marcus Camby. "I just tried to go out there and
do the best that I could. My teammates came down and tried to help me
out, double-team him as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hitting the turnaround shots. That is pretty much what we
wanted him to do, shoot the turnaround."</TE>
<TE>   But not to make 12 of 22 from the field as O'Neal did Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are reluctant to overextend themselves out on the ball for
fear of getting beat," said Knick Coach Don Chaney, the frustration
obvious in his voice. "And there's no help behind them. Once again we
come to the trust factor. We've always as a team had a problem
guarding the ball defensively. We've always relied on help behind us,
and Marcus was the key."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten through three games on this trip, the Lakers still have
the two toughest teams ahead, the Milwaukee Bucks Tuesday and the
Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Enjoy Life in Lifeless Garden</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal (30 points and 15 rebounds) keys
third win in a row, 107-91, before dazed Knicks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>They were getting $1,500 a seat Sunday to watch a hockey match in
Salt Lake City between the U.S. and Canada for the Olympic gold
medal.</LD>
<LD>   Expensive? It's a bargain compared to Madison Square Garden, where
they get $1,650 for a courtside seat to watch the New York Knicks
play.</LD>
<LD>   Do you believe in mediocrity?</LD>
<TE>   The only reason to come to the Garden these days is to watch the
high-profile stars of visiting teams flash a few moves for
"SportsCenter" and hang another loss on the hapless Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   So in they came Sunday, a sellout crowd of 19,763 to watch the
Lakers, to see Shaquille O'Neal get his thunderous dunks, to watch
Kobe Bryant beat another buzzer, to watch the two-time defending
champions stretch their muscles.</TE>
<TE>   They came, they saw and they sat on their hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won easily, 107-91, their third consecutive victory
after a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a less-than-inspired performance by the Lakers as they
were the first to concede.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Count the reasons: 1.) The game began at noon, that's 9 a.m.
PST, 2.) The once-vibrant Garden was so quiet it sounded like the
18th tee at Augusta and 3.) The adrenaline was lacking in a clear
mismatch.</TE>
<TE>   The mismatch was obvious from the start when the 7-foot-1 O'Neal
lined up for the tipoff against 6-9 Kurt Thomas, a true forward only
at center because the Knicks' true center, Marcus Camby, is sidelined
indefinitely because of a torn hip muscle.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't a whole lot of energy in the arena today," said
Laker Coach Phil Jackson, who remembers when there was high voltage
surging through the crowd when he was a member of a Knick team that
won an NBA title "It was a surprise to come here and not see that
energetic crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Laker forward Mark Madsen also noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little flat," Madsen said. "Last year when I was here,
the place was full of excitement and loud music. Maybe it was just
because it was Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming into the building," he said, "it had a different feel. It
is usually a very hostile arena, but today, it was kind of dead out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Did Madsen, a reserve, find himself dozing off?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe just a little bit," he said, tongue in cheek, "before the
first time I went in."</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of playing time for nearly every Laker in a game
they led at one point by 21 and never appeared in danger of losing.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, taking advantage of Thomas and Clarence Weatherspoon and
anyone else given the unenviable task of defending him, led in
scoring with 30 points (12 for 22 from the field, six for 10 from the
free-throw line) and rebounding with 15.</TE>
<TE>   Right behind him was Bryant with 27 points, and yes, even in this
game, yet another buzzer beater. That has become a Bryant specialty
lately. He had one Tuesday night at Staples Center that nearly beat
the Boston Celtics, the officials ruling properly that, when time
expired, he still had a fingertip on the ball. He had one Friday
night in Charlotte to beat the Hornets as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   And Bryant had one Sunday. As the first-quarter buzzer sounded, he
connected on a 16-foot jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm enjoying it so much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also having more fun is forward Robert Horry, enjoying his role as
a starter with the elbow injury to Samaki Walker. Horry scored 20
points in 33 minutes Sunday, making eight of 13 from the field,
including four of seven from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed us what versatility we have when he's in our lineup,"
said Jackson of Horry.</TE>
<TE>   "You warm up, so you go out there and feel loose," said Horry of
being in the starting lineup. "It's a bad thing when you sit on the
bench because you can't feel as loose."</TE>
<TE>   For the Knicks, their two big guns put up their expected numbers.
Latrell Sprewell and Alan Houston, who had averaged a combined 48
points in New York's two-game sweep of the Lakers last season,
accounted for 43 of the Knicks' points Sunday. Sprewell had 22,
Houston 21.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell made only eight of 19 from the field, Houston eight of
21.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to find some positives," Knick Coach Don Chaney said.</TE>
<TE>   "But when you lose like this, you can't see any positives."</TE>

<HD>Head Injury Worries Murray</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Post-concussion syndrome from auto accident has
added a major hurdle in King coach's recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARIBAULT, Minn.</DL>
<LD>To better understand how close the Kings came to losing Coach Andy
Murray, all one has to do is look at the truck he was driving when he
crashed off a Wisconsin highway the morning after Valentine's Day.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt sick to my stomach," said Murray's wife, Ruth, about the
feeling she had when she first saw the demolished truck. "The
passenger side was just totally crushed down. The person who towed it
in said he's surprised the person that was in it got out."</LD>
<LD>   Murray, 50, not only survived the single-car accident but the
strong-willed coach is still hoping to be behind the King bench when
they play at Columbus on Tuesday night even though doctors have told
him it's not likely because of the injuries he suffered.</LD>
<TE>   If Murray only had to deal with the four broken ribs, separated
left shoulder, fractured left wrist and numerous cuts, it would be a
good bet that he'd be back with the team by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the accident has had a more lasting effect. For the last six
days, Murray has been suffering from post-concussion syndrome and the
head injury has knocked him off his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first few days after the accident, it was all about my
ribs and shoulder. My head wasn't really part of the equation,"
Murray said Sunday night at his home. "My head seemed OK at first. I
was able to hold normal conversations and talk to people. I was able
to make phone calls and stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday night, that all changed. Murray began to experience
severe headaches and vomiting, and that's the way it has been since.
It got so bad Friday that his wife took him to a local emergency room
and he spent the night in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   When Murray was sent home Saturday, doctors told him to avoid
interaction with people as much as possible and to stay in bed over
the weekend. Murray did exactly that and even missed most of Sunday's
Olympic gold-medal hockey game between the U.S. and Canada despite
being one of the proudest Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   With his left arm and wrist in a sling, Murray was able to greet
visitors later in the evening but he had a slight shakiness when he
spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel kind of blase, like I'm in a little bit of an ozone
layer," he said. "I'm hoping that I won't feel this way too much
longer."</TE>
<TE>   Murray knows that he's fortunate to be alive.</TE>
<TE>   While driving a late-model Ford truck he had given his older son,
Braden, Murray left his home at 4 a.m. on Feb. 15. He was headed to
Madison, Wis., to watch the 17-year-old play in a high school hockey
tournament when he lost control while traveling about 65 mph and
skidded off icy Interstate 90 outside of Sparta, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's truck slid off the highway, crashed through a wire fence
and rolled several times down an embankment through a wooded area.
The vehicle landed on its roof after a tree stopped it only a few
feet before it would have plunged into a shallow trout stream. Murray
suffered a deep cut on his right wrist when he crawled out the
driver's side window, which also was crushed.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe County Sheriff Chuck Amundson said Murray was in one of
about "four or five" cars that slid off the road within a 15-minute
span after an early morning storm slightly iced over the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so quick that I'm not sure if I lost any
consciousness," Murray said. "I remember a truck driver telling the
police that he saw my truck roll four or five times."</TE>
<TE>   What amazed Amundson was how Murray climbed up the embankment back
to the highway. With so many injuries, Murray left a noticeable path
of blood up the hill.</TE>
<TE>   King General Manager Dave Taylor called to check on Murray's
progress Sunday night and the coach told him that he's still
optimistic that he'll be able to return soon. How soon is anyone's
guess.</TE>
<TE>   "We're relying on [Murray] to determine whether he's ready to
return based on the advice he gets from doctors," Taylor said. "We
certainly are hoping that he's able to join [the Kings in Ohio
today]. He said that he feels that he's made some progress."</TE>
<TE>   Murray, who has dealt with concussions as a youth playing  hockey
and football, will be examined by doctors today and remains
optimistic that the worst is behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are going to check me out pretty closely," Murray
said. "They've been very concerned about slow bleeding on the brain.
That's one thing that has to be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Determining whether Murray has recovered enough to join the team
will be difficult. Although Murray isn't a player, he probably will
face some of the same problems that NHL players Paul Kariya and Eric
Lindros dealt with during their post-concussion syndrome battles.</TE>
<TE>   "A post-concussion syndrome is not deadly but it does make people
miserable," said Dr. Assibi Abudu, who has treated hundreds of head
injuries as an emergency room physician in the Los Angeles-area over
the last 12 years. "It can really lead to emotional problems later
from depression, nervousness and anger. But the worst is memory
impairment.... Every neurologist will tell you that time is the best
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Defeating long odds, however, is nothing new to Murray, who made
the jump from coaching at Shattuck-St. Mary's, a prep school in
Faribault, to taking over the Kings three seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fortitude has always been Murray's trademark.</TE>
<TE>   It's been such a strong trait that Braden Murray told his father
that he was surprised that after his accident, he didn't hitchhike
and still make the game.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said that if Murray is unable to join the Kings on their
first trip after the league's Olympic break, assistant coaches Dave
Tippett, Mark Hardy and Ray Bennett will continue to run the team in
his absence.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's doubt, we want to make sure that he's ready to
return," Taylor said. "But as of now, we expect him to be with us."</TE>
<TE>   Murray wouldn't want it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be at the game but I don't want to be a hindrance at
all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm feeling the way that I've been feeling right now, I don't
know if I could, but I'm hoping that I will feel better."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Could Be the Latest Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan limped to the bench midway through the fourth quarter
and might stay there awhile.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan sat out the final 6:27 of the Washington Wizards' 92-80
loss to Miami because of a bruised right knee Sunday night and said
he might go on the injured list, which would force him to miss at
least five games.</LD>
<LD>   ''This needs more than just two days' rest,'' he said. ''I'm going
to take the necessary time to get better. I may have to sit out a few
games.''</LD>
<TE>   The Wizards blew a fourth-quarter lead to Miami for the second
game in a row and lost their fifth consecutive game to drop below
.500 (27-28) for the first time since Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who missed Wednesday's loss at Detroit because of his
knee, had fluid drained from it before the game. He played 30 minutes
before leaving for good with Miami leading, 78-74.</TE>
<TE>   ''The game was on the line and I was sitting on the bench. That
should tell you something was wrong,'' Jordan said. ''It got to the
point in the fourth quarter where I couldn't move.''</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a 37-point performance Saturday, Jordan made four of 13
shots and finished with nine points, six assists and five rebounds.
It was only his second single-digit scoring total of the season--he
had six points Dec. 27 against Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who turned 39 on Feb. 17, has missed only two games but
has had the knee drained at least three times.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm getting old,'' he said with a smile. ''It's a sign that this
might be coming to a closure as to where my career is heading. The
body sends you messages, and tonight my body won.''</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 95, Charlotte 93--Lucious Harris made a go-ahead layup
with 46 seconds to play, and the Nets rallied from a 23-point deficit
in the second half at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets held the Hornets to 11 points in the fourth quarter to
win their sixth in a row and end Charlotte's winning streak on the
road at five.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis had 29 points to lead the Hornets, but he missed a
three-point shot with about three seconds left. Teammate Elden
Campbell got the rebound, but instead of putting the ball back up, he
passed back out to Davis as the final horn went off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a mental mistake on my part, thinking we needed a
three [-point basket]," said Campbell, whose face dropped at the
final horn when teammate Jamal Mashburn walked up to him and pointed
out his gaffe.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why when I caught the ball under the hoop and threw it
back out. I was right there wide open for a layup and I just blew
it."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd had 21 points and 15 assists for New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 92, San Antonio 83--Stephon Marbury scored a season-high
36 points at Phoenix, helping hand the weary Spurs their second road
defeat in as many days. The victory was the 1500th in the Suns'
history and made them the 12th NBA franchise to reach that total.</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson led the Spurs in scoring for only the second time
with 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 89, Detroit 82--Sam Cassell scored 27 points and Ray
Allen had 21 at Milwaukee as the Bucks ended the Pistons'
franchise-record road winning streak at seven. Milwaukee moved into
sole possession of first place in the Central Division, one game
ahead of the Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse led Detroit with 19 points on eight-for-27
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 101, Toronto 92--Brent Barry scored 23 points, Gary Payton
had 22 and Rashard Lewis 21 as the SuperSonics won their sixth in a
row on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter, limping because of a strained left quadriceps,
scored 28 points in his first game back from the injured list. The
Raptors, who went 0-7 without Carter, have fallen to 29-29.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 111, Orlando 96--Ricky Davis scored 27 points in a rare
start as the Cavaliers took advantage of a Magic team playing without
All-Star Tracy McGrady at Cleveland. McGrady, the Magic's leading
scorer, was a scratch just before the game because of a sore right
foot.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic got 24 points from reserve Troy Hudson, and Mike Miller
had 23. But Orlando was outrebounded, 55-28.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 89, Denver 84--Jason Terry scored 25 points at Denver to
help the Hawks hand the Nuggets their fifth consecutive loss. Newly
acquired Juwan Howard had 28 points for the Nuggets.</TE>

<HD>Kenseth Gets Past Doubts, Rivals to Win Subway 400</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Kenseth admitted he wasn't too sure he would ever win again.</LD>
<LD>   A charge from fourth to first late in the race gave Kenseth the
victory Sunday in the Subway 400 at North Carolina Speedway at
Rockingham--the second NASCAR victory of his career and first in 60
races.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt like 160 races, like forever," the 29-year-old driver
said after taking the checkered flag for the first time since winning
the Coca-Cola 600 in May 2000 at Charlotte.</LD>
<TE>   Kenseth's Roush Racing Ford was among the fastest cars throughout
Sunday's 393-lap event and his crew, which won the annual pit crew
contest at the same track in October in record time, kept him in
front of the pack most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were slamming and banging out there and we just got real
lucky," Kenseth said.</TE>
<TE>   The race was completed under yellow when NASCAR officials threw a
caution flag for debris with five laps remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth built leads of more than four seconds after taking the top
spot during a stop under caution on Lap 257. He remained in front
until pole-winner Rick Craven, who had fallen behind after leading
the first 104 laps, regained the lead on Lap 365 by staying on the
1.017-mile oval while the other leaders pitted under the eighth of
nine cautions.</TE>
<TE>   Craven, whose tires were 14 laps older than the other leaders,
started to give up ground quickly on the rough asphalt surface.
Sterling Marlin, Bobby Labonte and Kenseth, all with fresh tires,
passed his struggling Ford by Lap 378.</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth pulled into the lead on the first turn of Lap 387 and one
lap later the final yellow flag came out because pieces from Robby
Gordon's blown tire littered the track.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin, who finished second, took over the series lead by 18
points over Daytona 500 winner Ward Burton, who finished 13th on
Sunday. Labonte finished third, followed by Tony Stewart, Craven,
Jeff Burton, defending series champion Jeff Gordon and Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Del Worsham denied John Force his 100th career victory by winning
the Funny Car final in the Checker Schuck's Kragen Nationals at
Firebird International Raceway at Chandler, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Worsham drove a Pontiac Firebird to a 4.940-second run at 312.86
mph to beat Force's Castrol GTX Ford Mustang, which lost traction at
midtrack and finished in 7.749 at 114.25 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Schumacher and Bruce Allen also were winners of the
$1.8-million race, the second of 23 events in the $50-million NHRA
Drag Racing Series.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher won the Top Fuel final over Larry Dixon, finishing in
4.946 at 299.40 mph, and Allen beat Warren Johnson in Pro Stock,
finishing in 6.904 at 199.02 mph in a Pontiac GrandAm.</TE>

<TE>   Tim Dwight's playmaking ability impressed the San Diego Chargers
so much that they signed the receiver and punt returner to a
$15-million, five-year contract even though he's not a starter.</TE>
<TE>   The contract includes a $5-million signing bonus, and Dwight can
make an additional $1 million per season in incentives.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will be announced Tuesday at a news conference, General
Manager John Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Dwight had 25 catches for 406 yards and returned 24
punts for 271 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Svetlana Feofanova broke the pole vault indoor world record for
the fourth time this month, clearing 15 feet 6 inches in the Gaz de
France meet at Lievin.</TE>
<TE>   Feofanova added a quarter of an inch to the mark she established
two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Dragila of the United States, the Olympic and world
champion, was fourth with a top effort of 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Feofanova was paid $43,795 for breaking the world record and
collected about $17,500 for winning all four events in the Energizer
EuroSeries.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Ten men's track and field indoor championships were called
off at Minneapolis, one day after Penn State pole vaulter Kevin Dare
died in competition.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches, athletes and fans gathered around the track Sunday
afternoon to honor Dare.</TE>
<TE>   Teary-eyed Penn State athletes led the teams in a lap around the
track. Some stopped and knelt at the pit where Dare had fallen, and
others threw flowers on the spot where he landed.</TE>
<TE>   The women's championships at Penn State held a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, life is not as good as it was yesterday," Penn State Coach
Harry Groves said to the crowd gathered for the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Dare, who was a 19-year-old sophomore, fell during a pole vault
attempt Saturday and hit his head. He was treated by emergency
medical technicians at the University of Minnesota Field House and
transported to Hennepin County Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   He never regained consciousness, and was pronounced dead shortly
after arriving at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Horse Racing</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two horses died in a barn fire blamed on an electrical
problem at a thoroughbred stud farm at Ocala, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started Saturday evening at Ocala Stud Farm. The 2- and
3-year-old horses didn't belong to the farm, but were being trained
there.</TE>
<TE>   Marion County Fire Rescue Capt. Deborah Karst said the loss,
including the value of the horses, was estimated at $1.5 million to
$2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Northern baseball Coach Herb Strayer, who skipped the team's
trip to Florida last week after being diagnosed with flu, died at his
home. He was 61.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death wasn't immediately determined.</TE>
<TE>   Strayer was 630-424-6 in 31 years at Ohio Northern, his alma
mater, and was the winningest coach in school history.</TE>

<HD>Roddick Outlasts Blake for Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ATP Tour finals between American players have been rare in recent
years. That may be about to change.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Roddick defeated Davis Cup teammate James Blake, 6-4, 3-6,
7-5, Sunday in the Kroger St. Jude tournament championship at
Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   The match was only the 11th all-American ATP Tour title match
since 1997, and the third time that one of the players wasn't Andre
Agassi or Pete Sampras.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope those rumors of American tennis dying are starting to
quiet down a little more," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy can bear that load on his own, I think. With me improving
and all of us improving and seeing how he's done, it's helping the
whole depth of American tennis. I'm doing better. You see how Andy's
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, who became the first teenager to win the tournament since
Agassi in 1988, pointed out that he and Blake are not alone.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some other great players coming up. I'm definitely
excited to be a part of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, 19, and Blake, 22, put on a thrilling display that had
fans on the edge of their seats and prompted a standing ovation
during a third-set changeover. Roddick showed up with his booming
serve and Blake mixed speeds, angles and shots.</TE>
<TE>   Blake was trying to become the first African American player to
win an ATP men's singles title since MaliVai Washington in April
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo's Mike and Bob Bryan fell in the doubles final to Brian
MacPhie and Nenad Zimonjic, 6-3, 3-6, 10-4 (tiebreak). The twins,
runners-up for a fourth time, were attempting to win their first
tournament in 2002 after capturing four in 2001. They will next play
events in Acapulco, Scottsdale and Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Escude defeated Tim Henman, 3-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, to win the
$713,000 ABN Amro indoor tournament at Rotterdam, Netherlands, for
the second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Henman has lost in the final three of the last four years. The
match lasted longer than two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "When the [match] is longer it's better for me," Escude said. "I
can stay on the court like a marathon man, but I can't run the 100
meters."</TE>
<TE>   Escude, who earned $128,400, is the third player in the 29-year
history of the event to win consecutive titles, after Arthur Ashe
(1976-77) and Stefan Edberg (1987-88).</TE>

<LD>Capturing a share of the Pacific 10 Conference regular-season
championship is unlikely for UCLA, and not because the Bruins haven't
won two games in a weekend for nearly two months.</LD>
<LD>   They would need a big assist from USC, which is busy with its own
title quest and not inclined to do its neighbor any favors.</LD>
<LD>   For UCLA (10-6), USC (11-5) and Oregon (12-4) to finish in a knot
at 12-6, the Bruins must beat Oregon State and Oregon, and the
Trojans would have to defeat Oregon and lose to lowly Oregon State
(4-12).</LD>
<TE>   But that's not all. California (11-5) and Stanford (10-6) visit
Arizona (11-5) and Arizona State (7-9). A sweep by either Cal or
Arizona eliminates UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The only practical value of winning the regular-season title is
gaining a No. 1 seed in the Pac-10 tournament and drawing the No.
8-seeded team, probably Washington (10-17, 4-13). The No. 2-seeded
team will play No. 7 Arizona State and Nos. 3 through 6 are assured
of tough draws.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Casey Jacobsen isn't a senior, but he felt like one during
Stanford's senior day ceremony that preceded the game against UCLA on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   As his teammates were introduced, he looked around Maples
Pavilion, knowing that in all likelihood he too was about to play his
last home game.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, an all-state player at Glendora High and the leading
scorer in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 22.6 average, is expected
to make himself available for the NBA draft. "I tried to treat the
games this weekend as though they were my last so I don't regret
anything," he said. "It had been going through my mind a lot lately,
not just before the game."</TE>

<LD>Sure, there was a sense of disappointment in USC's locker room after
the Trojans' lackluster showing in an 83-64 loss Saturday at
California.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no sense of impending doom. Rather, there was
optimism among the 20th-ranked Trojans, who had dropped out of a
first-place tie in the Pacific 10 Conference and into a three-way tie
for second.</LD>
<LD>   "We've lost before and bounced back with a win," senior power
forward Sam Clancy said. "And that's what I expect against Oregon
this week."</LD>
<TE>   Win their final two regular-season games this week at
home--against the first-place Ducks and eighth-place Oregon
State--and the Trojans win at least a share of the Pac-10 title for
the first time since 1985. USC is 10-1 at home this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby surprised many on the Bay Area trip when he
started seldom-used Gregg Guenther at center against Stanford and
California. With starting center Kostas Charissis out at least three
more weeks with a broken bone in his left ankle, Bibby leaned on the
6-foot-8, 250-pound Guenther, an oft-injured tight end on the USC
football team, for quality minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave us what we needed," Bibby said of Guenther's 17 minutes
of play, in which he had three rebounds and an assist but missed both
of his shots. "He's a nice big body that we can put in there."</TE>
<TE>   Guenther said that playing football in front of 70,000-plus crowds
prepared him for the raucous atmospheres of Maples and Haas
pavilions.</TE>
<TE>   "Plus, I've been playing [basketball] in summer leagues against
pros so I wasn't really nervous," he said.</TE>

<HD>Cajon Player Triumphs Over a Tragedy</HD>

<LD>Donovan Morris always had two fathers.</LD>
<LD>   There was the one he lived with growing up in San Bernardino--the
one who nurtured him from childhood and showed him how to play
basketball.</LD>
<LD>   "He was like my real dad," said Morris, a senior guard on the San
Bernardino Cajon High basketball team. "He took care of me."</LD>
<TE>   And there was the one in Chicago, the man who was listed on
Morris' birth certificate. Father and son never lost touch, though
distance made it difficult for them to see much of each other.</TE>
<TE>   Then, without warning, one of Morris' fathers was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Sanders, Morris' stepfather, had not been feeling well the
week before Thanksgiving. When Morris' mother, Patricia Cox-Sanders,
brought him dinner one evening, she noticed he was unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   The woman frantically called for her son , and the boy held his
step dad while his mother administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
It was too late. Sanders had already died of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Morris was devastated, but he has slowly moved on--thanks in part
to  support from his other father.</TE>
<TE>   David Morris arrived in Southern California two weeks ago on a
Greyhound bus to watch his son's team compete in the Southern Section
Division I-A playoffs. It was a win-win situation. David was thrilled
to finally see Donovan play high school basketball, and Donovan was
glad to have his father around.</TE>
<TE>   And Donovan didn't disappoint, scoring 24 of his 26 points in the
first half of Cajon's first-round romp over Indio.</TE>
<TE>   David, who had only seen his son play on tape, was impressed.
"Seeing the tape and seeing him play in person is very different,"
David Morris said. "He is very unselfish and plays very aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan scored 32 points in Cajon's second-round victory against
Riverside North. Then came a 31-point performance in a losing effort
against fourth-seeded Los Angeles Loyola in the quarterfinals.
Donovan made 13 of 18 shots in the packed gym, which David had to
talk his way into after convincing a security guard that he had come
all the way from Chicago to see his son play.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's season may be over, but David is sticking around to help
tutor his son for the upcoming SAT. The mother of Rialto Eisenhower
forward Sean Marshall is also tutoring Donovan, who needs a
qualifying test score to gain college eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3 Donovan's on-court credentials are impeccable. He
averaged 25.8 points, 9.7 rebounds and 5.9 assists this season while
shooting 54% from the field and making 84% of his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Odds and tip-ins: Beverly Hills Coach Jason Sanders said he will
present the Crenshaw Christian Center with a check for his coaching
salary, of roughly $3,000, next month after his team failed to reach
the playoffs. Sanders put his salary on the line before the season as
a motivational ploy to get his team to qualify for its first playoff
berth in five seasons. The Normans needed 11 victories to gain entry
into the playoffs as a wild-card team, and had nine victories with
two games to go. But Beverly Hills lost to Hawthorne by two points
and was routed by South Torrance in its season finale....Tarzana
Stoneridge Prep defeated Palm Springs Desert Chapel, 72-57, in a
Division V-A semifinal to advance to the finals for the first time.
The Wildcats play top-seeded Price  Friday at Loyola Marymount. ...
La Puente Bishop Amat played its last game in Tate Duff gym when it
defeated Irvine Northwood, 69-59, Tuesday in a Division III-AA
quarterfinal. The school will build a larger multi-purpose facility
in its place.... Twentynine Palms, which plays top-seeded El Segundo
Tuesday in Division IV-AA, has advanced to the semifinals seven out
of the last eight years.</TE>

<HD>Shelby's Thoughts With Son</HD>

<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>First base coach John Shelby, absent for the first week and a half of
spring training, joined the Dodgers on Sunday, nine days after his
14-year-old son, Jeremy, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Shelby and his wife, Trina, who live in Lexington, Ky., became
concerned when they found a lump on the side of Jeremy's neck and
noticed he was experiencing a shortness of breath when he played
basketball.</LD>
<LD>   They took Jeremy, the second oldest of their six children, to a
doctor in early February, and several tests and a chest X-ray
revealed the presence of two cancerous masses, in his neck and chest.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it; none of us could believe it," Shelby said.
"Every time you hear the word cancer, it's not real good. It hit us
hard. It shook us all up."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy has the Stage II form of the disease, which is not as
advanced or considered as life-threatening as the Stage III and Stage
IV forms. The cancer is localized in the neck and chest and has not
spread to other organs. Jeremy began chemotherapy almost
immediately--he'll undergo treatments twice a month--and the disease
has an 80% cure rate.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear the 80% cure rate, and in the back of your mind, you
start thinking about the other 20%," said Shelby, who lost an uncle
to cancer last year and has an aunt who was recently diagnosed with
lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "But he was back at school a couple of days after his first chemo,
and they say the way you respond after the first one or two
treatments is a good indication of how you do."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby, who played parts of 11 major league seasons for the
Baltimore Orioles, Dodgers and Detroit Tigers and is entering his
fifth season as a Dodger coach, remained home when the Dodgers opened
spring training on Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans told Shelby to take all the time he
needed, but Shelby felt comfortable enough with Jeremy's condition to
join the Dodgers for Sunday's workout.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have come down here if I didn't think God had it under
control," Shelby said. "Jeremy is doing better. He's progressing. A
lot of prayers have been going out, and a lot of prayers have been
answered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby threw about 12 minutes of batting practice Sunday, the
first time the Dodger right-hander faced a hitter since last April
12, when he struck out Arizona's Luis Gonzalez to end the fifth
inning of his second start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I got [Gonzalez] on a cutter up and in," Ashby said. "I remember
the pitch ... because it hurt ..."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby did not throw another pitch all season. He underwent surgery
to repair a torn flexor muscle in his right elbow in June but cleared
another hurdle in the recovery process when he threw about 40 pitches
to teammates Paul Lo Duca, Shawn Green, Adrian Beltre and Dave
Hansen.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time I've seen a hitter in the box for what
seems like five years," Ashby said. "Overall, I was happy with it. I
was a little inconsistent, but it was definitely a good day."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ashby experienced some control problems, Lo Duca was
impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He had good, late life on his fastball, some good sink, and he
threw some good curves," Lo Duca said. "He was throwing as hard at
the end of the session as he was at the beginning. To me, he looks
100% right now."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn wouldn't go as far as Lo Duca, but he
did see some progress.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy who came off surgery and threw his first batting
practice, he looked pretty good," Colborn said. "Compared to how
Ashby can be, his timing was off a bit. But his arm looked very
live."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby also threw his curve, but he still hasn't thrown his cut
fastball, the pitch that can be most taxing on the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "That's up to [the medical staff]," Ashby said. "First, we have to
see if anything is going to aggravate the surgery."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Bournigal, a former shortstop who played parts of seven
major league seasons (1992-99) for the Dodgers, Oakland A's and
Seattle Mariners, has been hired by the Dodgers, though his exact
title has not yet been determined. Bournigal, who has strong ties to
the Dominican Republic, will be very involved in the Dodgers' Latin
American scouting program, and he will also have minor league
responsibilities.</TE>

<HD>Chouinard More Than a 'Throw-In'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Teemu Selanne trade keeps paying off for the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Not the last one, mind you, that's still to be seen. But when the
Ducks acquired Selanne from the then Winnipeg Jets in 1996, he helped
them make the playoffs twice.</LD>
<LD>   Selanne's gone to San Jose, but Marc Chouinard, the "throw-in" in
the deal, remains.</LD>
<TE>   Chouinard, an unknown junior player when he was shipped to the
Ducks, has developed into a solid contributor. He centers the fourth
line, the team's most consistent, and is a key contributor on the
penalty-killing unit. Offensively, he has only four goals, but three
have helped the Ducks to victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He has become a very responsible role player," Coach Bryan Murray
said. "He skates well. He forechecks. He's really strong in the
face-off circle. Can he be a top line player? Probably not. But he's
not limited to the role he is in now."</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard has already come a long way with the Ducks. He was
playing with Halifax of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1996
when he was fine-print addition in the Selanne deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks reaped immediate benefits from picking up Selanne, as
they made the playoffs in 1996-97 and 1998-99. Chouinard spent three
seasons at minor league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "Teemu was a superstar and I was just a kid back in 1996,"
Chouinard said. "I was called a throw-in. But I had yet to play in
the NHL. I got a chance to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard saw his first extended NHL action last season, playing
in 44 of the Ducks' last 49 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I look to create more on the ice," Chouinard said.
"Obviously it has helped me to play every day."</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard's strengths have been on penalty kills and in the
face-off circle. He ranks 14th in the league among players with 500
or more face offs at 55%.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously his face-off ability makes him valuable," said Dan
Bylmsa, who skates on Chouinard's line and has been paired with him
on penalty kills. "If you're trying to kill a penalty and have a face
off in your own end, it's a big asset to have a guy like Marc."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck players came up with key goals for their countries in the
final games of the Olympics over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya's first-period goal pulled Canada even, 1-1, Sunday.
Canada defeated the United States, 5-2, to win the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Tverdovsky's power-play goal gave Russia a 3-2 lead against
Belarus on Saturday. Russia went on to win, 7-2, in the bronze-medal
game.</TE>

<LD>Mizzen Mast, who would have been favored in next Saturday's
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap, will not run because of a hoof
injury.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Bobby Frankel said Sunday that Mizzen Mast was unable to
work Saturday at Hollywood Park because of a crack in the 4-year-old
colt's left front hoof. Mizzen Mast, who has a history of foot
problems, will have the crack patched and resume training, Frankel
said.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel, the Eclipse Award-winning trainer the last two years,
will still try to break his winless streak in the Big 'Cap with
Euchre and Milwaukee Brew. Both horses are owned by Frank Stronach,
whose Magna Entertainment owns Santa Anita, and will be coupled in
the betting.</LD>
<TE>   Garrett Gomez will ride Euchre and Kent Desormeaux, who would have
ridden Mizzen Mast, gets the assignment on Milwaukee Brew.</TE>
<TE>   At 120 pounds, Mizzen Mast would have been the high weight for the
65th Big 'Cap. Now the co-high weights will be Euchre and Futural, at
118 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Big 'Cap hasn't had a starting high weight under 120 pounds
since Terrang, at 116 pounds, upset Hillsdale to win the 1959
running.</TE>
<TE>   Other weights for horses expected to run Saturday include Freedom
Crest and Irisheyesareflying (116); Cagney and Kudos (115); Fancy As
and Giant Gentleman (114); and Last Parade and Milwaukee Brew (113).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainers in California and their owners are facing enormous
increases in their workers' compensation insurance, beginning Friday,
as the result of all companies but one being unwilling to underwrite
the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The California Horse Racing Board was told at its meeting last
Thursday that the increases could force many trainers out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a crisis," Ed Halpern, a trainer and executive director
of the California Thoroughbred Trainers, said Sunday. Halpern said
that "maybe a few" trainers might decline to enter horses this week
in order to bring attention to their plight.</TE>
<TE>   Because jockeys have historically been considered independent
contractors in California, they must be insured by trainers on the
day they ride, and that part of the insurance will increase the most.
Halpern said that beginning Friday, it will cost $73 a race to insure
a jockey, compared to the old rate of $29.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Landsburg, chairman of the racing board, said that he would
assist a cross-section of the industry in approaching the State
Insurance Commission for help. Landsburg referred to the insurance
increases as an "emergency situation."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Liebau, president of Santa Anita, said that the long-term
approach to the insurance increases would be a "legislative
solution."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shuffling Kid, a British import that successfully made his U.S.
debut at the same down-the-hill distance on Feb. 3, held off several
challengers to win the $114,400 Baldwin Stakes at 61/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   The first five finishers were separated by less than a length. The
win was the second in a stake in as many days for jockey Pat
Valenzuela and added to an already successful meet for trainer Mike
Machowsky. Valenzuela won Saturday's Ken Maddy Handicap with Echo
Eddie at Golden Gate Fields. Shuffling Kid, paying $26.20, hit the
wire in 1:13 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Presenting the award in the winner's circle was trainer Noble
Threewitt, who turned 91 Sunday. Threewitt, who has five horses now,
was training at Santa Anita when the track opened in 1934; he saddled
his first winner on the fifth day of the inaugural season.</TE>

<LD>The Kings open the post-Olympic portion of their season with five of
their first seven games on the road, starting Tuesday night at
Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   For the Kings, that's good news.</LD>
<LD>   They have been tremendous on the road, earning points in nine of
their last 10 games away from Staples Center and posting an 11-2-2-1
record on the road since Dec. 8, when they lost to the St. Louis
Blues, 2-0.</LD>
<TE>   Only the Philadelphia Flyers, Detroit Red Wings and New York
Islanders have accumulated more points on the road than the Kings,
who are 14-9-4-2 away from home and have outscored their opponents,
82-72.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who have scored on only 15.6% of their power-play
opportunities at Staples Center, have converted a league-leading 25%
on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it's just keeping it simple," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "I think on the road we tend to just shoot the puck
to the net and crash the net, get the rebounds. At home, we tend to
make more plays, get more fancy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cliche in hockey, but teams talk about playing a road
game, which is really a simple game. At home, sometimes you're
excited, you're trying to impress your fans. You want to make that
little extra fancy play.</TE>
<TE>   "At this level, it doesn't work. There are too many good players
here and simple is often better. And it's easy to play simple on the
road."</TE>
<TE>   Captain Mattias Norstrom echoed Schneider's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, less is more," he said, "and that seems to be our
approach on the road--that we don't have to overpass, we don't have
to do anything extra or fancy to win the game. We do it through blue
collar--just work hard."</TE>
<TE>   Of the Kings' remaining 24 games, 12 are on the road.</TE>

<HD>Now It's Athens' Deadline</HD>
<DH>Greeks Confident, but Much to Do to Recoup Time Lost</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>They turned out the lights in Salt Lake Sunday, which means only one
thing in Olympic circles--in 900 days the Athens Summer Games of 2004
are due to open.</LD>
<LD>   Will everything in Greece be ready? No one can offer a definitive
answer.</LD>
<LD>   The Greek government and local organizers are, as they candidly
admit, engaged in a race against time. They are racing to make up
years that were wasted in the planning and construction of roads,
rail links and hotels and in such operational concerns as ticketing
and test events for the 28 sports on the Summer Olympic program.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, security remains a concern. A domestic terror group,
called 17 November, has operated within Greece since 1975 with
impunity, killing 22 people, four of them American. No one has been
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, many of those involved in readying Athens for
the Games--scheduled to run from Aug. 13-29, 2004--express
considerable anxiety. The IOC is due in Athens in early April for the
latest in a series of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   When speaking publicly, the tone runs to confidence that the Games
will be safe, the venues ready, the roads paved, the hotel minibars
stocked.</TE>
<TE>   "They have now a good cruising speed," International Olympic
Committee President Jacques Rogge said Sunday. "If they can keep
their commitments, they can keep the deadlines--which have been kept
the last months--we'll have good Games, there's no problem."</TE>
<TE>   Denis Oswald, a Swiss lawyer who heads a 44-member IOC team called
a "coordination commission" that serves both as liaison and
inspection crew for the Athens Games, said: "Construction has started
nearly everywhere where they are supposed to start. Now we have to
monitor how it progresses."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis "is really aware
now of the magnitude of the task, and he's really pushing the
[cabinet-level] ministers."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, tension between the government--which builds the
infrastructure--and the local organizing committee, Athens
2004--which runs the Games--remains evident. The relationship has
improved, Oswald said, but is still "not ideal."</TE>
<TE>   Construction at some sites has, in the past few weeks, inched
ahead of schedule--at the Olympic village northwest of central
Athens, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, and even though the IOC has issued repeated warnings over
the past two years, construction at other sites remains inexplicably
slow.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, at Hellenikon, site of the old Athens airport--the
new one opened a few months ago--planes were still flying a few weeks
ago onto the runways at what, come 2004, is supposed to be the site
of a canoe slalom course as well as some basketball games.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials "confirmed" that construction on the canoe
and basketball venues would begin in September, Oswald said.</TE>
<TE>   Athens is still shy about 2,500 needed hotel rooms. Gianna
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, head of Athens 2004, said a few days ago that
organizers are considering a plan by which tourists would be
encouraged to stay on one of Greece's celebrated islands and take a
short-hop airline flight into Athens for a day or two at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Road and rail construction remains problematic.</TE>
<TE>   A light-rail system is designed to connect central Athens with
venues to the south. The problem that has surfaced in recent weeks is
that officials are not sure that even if the tracks are laid on
time--and that remains a big if--the rail cars themselves will be in
Athens. They haven't been ordered yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the main issue we are facing, the suburban light-rail
train," Oswald said. "I'm not yet sure they will get the rolling
stock on time, which would be ridiculous if other things are ready."</TE>
<TE>   On Kifissias Avenue, a busy thoroughfare that leads directly to
the main Olympic complex from the center of town, the original plan
was to have five interchanges. Then that was cut to three. At the
IOC's most recent visit, a few weeks ago, it was cut again, to one.</TE>
<TE>   "They will put in place 'strict traffic management measures,'"
Oswald said he has been told. He went on, "This is done at every
Olympic Games, so we are not sure it will be suitable. But they are
studying solutions to make sure traffic is OK."</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 12, Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's culture minister, just
back from a visit to the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, angrily
accused the IOC of mistreating Athens. He rejected warnings over
infrastructure delays, declaring that Greece was not obliged to build
roads just to please the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC, he said, "acts differently toward a country with 10
million people, which thinks it has to defend itself, and it acts
differently toward a superpower ... that controls the world. We have
to act with greater dignity and efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   IOC Director General Francois Carrard responded at a news
conference by saying that the IOC treats all Olympic organizers the
same. "We don't have different rules for superpowers and small
countries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oswald said Venizelos was "playing with words."</TE>
<TE>   "You can [express] their commitment in different ways. For
example, you can say, 'We didn't promise to build a media village.'
But Greece committed to accommodate people from the media. And they
have to find a way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   As for security, the Greek government has promised to spend $600
million securing the Athens Games. Security costs in Salt Lake
totaled $310 million. The Greek plan relies extensively on the use of
soldiers and security cameras and on extensive cooperation with U.S.,
British, Israeli and other security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 40 security officials connected to the Greek delegation,
including a key deputy to Michalis Chrysohoidis, Greece's minister
for public order, were here in Salt Lake, observing the presence of
F-16s in the sky overhead on routine patrol and of National Guard
troops at Olympic venues.</TE>
<TE>   In all, about 80 Greeks were here to study the Salt Lake Games--in
effect, a crash course in what amounts to a university of the
Olympics, albeit one that is about one-fourth the size. The Winter
Games feature about 2,500 athletes, the Summer Games roughly 10,500.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what Greek organizers took to heart as they prepare today to
leave Salt Lake City, Spyros Capralos, a senior executive with the
Athens 2004 organizing committee, answered: "You learn about crisis,
and how the IOC deals with crisis."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Do you believe in miracles!?</LD>
<LD>   Now I do.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. men's Nordic ski team didn't win a medal, but it came
closer than it has in 26 years with a fourth place in the team
combined, a fifth in the cross-country relay and a fifth in the
individual combined sprint by Todd Lodwick. The men predict a medal
in four years. The women predict one in eight years. Al Michaels is
on call.</LD>
<TE>   Other highs and lows from the Winter Olympics:</TE>
<TE>   Baron Pierre de Coubertin spins in his grave once more before the
closing ceremony: Nina Kemppel, the four-time U.S. Olympian whose
best finish was her 15th in Sunday's 30k cross-country ski race,
tried hard to think of how many elite skiers in her sport aren't on
drugs. She named two, a Norwegian and an Italian.</TE>
<TE>   The undisputed world champion, ja: The medal standings recorded
another victory for Germany with 35 medals, including 12 gold. The
United States won 34 medals, 10 gold. But in my book--the World
Almanac--Norway wins.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegians won 24 medals (11 gold), which is one medal for every
175,862 people in the country. Per capita, Germany won one medal for
every 2,372,257 citizens and the United States won one for every
8,371,176. Norway's national anthem, one more time: "Ja, Vi Elsker
Dette Landet."</TE>
<TE>   Best non-story: Security. Federal, state and local officials
combined in an unprecedented effort to prevent a terrorist attack.
They went about their jobs unobtrusively and courteously. Until Feb.
14, I had never been wished a Happy Valentine's Day by someone
patting me down.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly Canadian Award: Wayne Gretzky. When the Canadian hockey team
lost its opening game, he blamed it on American propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Response: One of his kids called from home in Westlake Village and
said, "Hey, Dad, we're American."</TE>
<TE>   Desperately seeking scandal: It became a huge local media story
when Mitt Romney, the Peter Ueberroth of these Games, allegedly used
the "f" word. He denied it. He said he used the "h" word. In either
case, a reader wrote a letter to the Salt Lake Tribune declaring that
Romney is going to "h."</TE>
<TE>   Clearest crystal ball: Four years ago, after finishing second to
Tara Lipinski at Nagano, Michelle Kwan acknowledged that she might
not win in Salt Lake City, either. "Maybe there's another 13-year-old
coming up," she said. "You never know." She was almost right. In
1998, cheering for Kwan on television from her home in Great Neck,
N.Y., was 12-year-old Sarah Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of the fall of the Russian sports empire: When
Russia's most decorated winter athlete, cross-country skier Larissa
Lazutina, was disqualified from starting a race because of an
elevated hemoglobin level, officials from the country blamed it on
the start of her "monthly."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Sovietologists recall when Russian doctors did whatever
was necessary to prevent their women athletes from having their
"monthlies" during competitions. Most women gymnasts weren't allowed
to have them until their 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly Russian Award: When a series of judgment calls began going
against them, Russian sports officials threatened to boycott the
closing ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Response: Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his sports
officials not to boycott, then sent them a message Sunday
congratulating them for making the correct decision.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto Tomba impersonator: Bode Miller of New Hampshire skis like
Tomba, going through the gates instead of around them. Miller's style
earned him silver medals here in the giant slalom and combined but
probably cost him a gold in the slalom. He vows to do better in four
years. Now if he can get a date with Katarina Witt....</TE>
<TE>   Best trend: To increase the talent pool in sports such as
snowboarding, speedskating and short-track speedskating, officials
from those sports are combing the sunshine states for skateboarders
and in-line skaters. Who would have thought a Latina from Miami such
as Jennifer Rodriguez or a Latino from San Bernardino such as Derek
Parra would each win two medals in speedskating?</TE>
<TE>   Second best trend: Sarah Hughes doesn't have an agent.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly Spaniard Award: Francisco Fernando Ochoa, a native Spaniard
who won the country's first winter gold medal in 1972, wasn't filled
with national pride when Johann Muehlegg, a German native, won three
gold medals for Spain here. "Now he is almost Spanish," Ochoa said.
"If he had really been Spanish, I would have gotten drunk to
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Response: "I'm sure that if the positive test is confirmed, there
will be jerks who will say that he isn't Spanish," Ochoa said when
rumors circulated that Muehlegg had failed a drug test.</TE>
<TE>   Best comeback: Chris Klug, from a liver transplant, to win a
bronze medal in snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   Second best comeback: United States, from Atlanta in 1996. "The
last Games in Atlanta were not good Games," IOC President Jacques
Rogge said Sunday. "This has been corrected here."</TE>
<TE>   Spirit Award: Finding a misplaced box of the popular Roots USA
berets at a Salt Lake recycling plant where he was working for $1 an
hour, Larry Redmond enthused, "You feel like now you've been in the
Olympics." He plans to celebrate as soon as he is released from
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly American Award: Unclaimed, but wait until 2004.</TE>

<HD>It's Canada's Game Again</HD>
<DH>Offensive Depth Is the Key to Ending a 50-Year Gold Drought</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>In the end, the magic of Herb Brooks and the comfort of home ice were
no match for the depth of Canadian talent.</LD>
<LD>   The United States men's hockey team came close to repeating its
gold-medal performance from 1980, the last time the Winter Olympics
were held in the United States. But after a string of solid
performances, the United States lost the final game, 5-2, Sunday
afternoon to a determined Canadian team that peaked at just the right
moment.</LD>
<LD>   And Team Canada's peaks are higher than anything in the Wasatch
Range.</LD>
<TE>   Canada is so good, one of hockey's all-time greats can let a pass
float by him because he knows one of the game's top threats is
waiting to his left.</TE>
<TE>   Canada is so good it got four goals from its second-best line, one
that happens to feature the NHL's reigning most valuable player and
its current goal-scoring leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have liked the gold medal," U.S. forward Jeremy Roenick
said. "But it didn't work out that way for us. We lost to a great
opponent tonight. We lost to a lot of great hockey players. We lost
to a great nation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing to hang our heads about. We did what we set here
to do. We came here and we battled."</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended the United States' 24-game unbeaten string (21-0-3)
in Olympic Games on home ice. But maybe it wasn't quite home ice.</TE>
<TE>   There were enough Canadians among the 8,599 fans to make their
flags seen and voices heard throughout the game, especially when they
sang "O Canada" in the final minute. And Team Canada executive
director Wayne Gretzky revealed afterward that some Canadian-born ice
maintenance crew members at the E Center had placed a Canadian dollar
coin (known as a "loonie") under center ice for good luck.</TE>
<TE>   That explains why members of the Canadian women's hockey team were
rubbing center ice and kissing it after they won the gold medal
against the Americans Thursday night. And it might explain why the
American men couldn't get that one lucky bounce that might have made
a difference in the men's final.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans led, 1-0, after Doug Weight lunged to knock the puck
out of the Canadian zone and ahead to Tony Amonte, who beat Canadian
goalie Martin Brodeur at 8:49 of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Roenick had the puck on an odd-man rush and took a shot
that somehow slipped under a sliding Brodeur. But it went wide right.</TE>
<TE>   Canada came back and Chris Pronger brought the puck along the
right side, then passed to the middle, where Mario Lemieux and Paul
Kariya were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [Kariya] was there," Lemieux said. "I just let it go."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya took the puck and tied the score with 5:10 to go in the
period.</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting that Kariya got a chance to help Canada win after
coming up short the last time Canada came this close. In 1994, he was
stopped by Sweden's Tommy Salo in a shootout, allowing Sweden to take
the gold medal. In 1998 Kariya had to miss the Olympics because of a
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," Kariya said. "But I'm happy that I finally got an
opportunity to play with so many great players and on such a great
team."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Kariya was a good representative of the 50 years
Canada spent waiting for this gold medal. And after eight years,
Kariya had to wait just a little longer than everyone else to join
the celebration after the game. The other players tossed their gloves
and helmets toward the ceiling and let them land where they may, but
Kariya--ever the neat freak--carefully removed his equipment before
leaving the bench and reveling with his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unbelievable feeling," Kariya said. "It's something that
I dreamed about as a kid. It's something that I had to let sink in a
little bit to know what it means."</TE>
<TE>   Canada went ahead late in the first period when Joe Sakic (the
2000-01 Hart Trophy Winner) whipped a pass to a hard-charging Jarome
Iginla on the right side. Iginla did what he has done more than any
NHL player this season: put the puck in the net.</TE>
<TE>   The United States tied the score in the second period when a Brian
Rafalski shot caromed off Pronger's stick and into the net. But
Roenick was sent to the penalty box for tripping Kariya two minutes
later, and Sakic scored on the Canadian power play.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians didn't sit on their 3-2 lead in the third period.
They kept on attacking and pushing the Americans back toward their
end of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was clear that we wanted to use our size and strength
against a smaller U.S. team," forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. "I just
think our size really wore their defense down."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans also couldn't generate good scoring opportunities
for their top line of Brett Hull, Mike Modano and John LeClair. They
finished with four shots on goal (Hull had averaged 4.6 shots himself
in the first five games).</TE>
<TE>   "They were the key line," Toronto Coach Pat Quinn said. "I wanted
either Mario's or Joe's line on them as often as I could, and I think
it had a good effect."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. could not come back in the third period, despite a
two-minute power play that began 13:43 into the period. And only 18
seconds after Canada returned to full strength, Iginla fired a shot
that slipped out of Mike Richter's glove and crossed the goal line
with four minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   Sakic's second goal, with 1:20 left, finished off the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks probably would like to think of this game as a beginning.
One of the reasons he came back to reprise his role as the 1980 U.S.
coach was to further the advancement of American hockey. This team
generated a buzz, with two heavily hyped games against Russia,
including a semifinal meeting on the 22nd anniversary of the "Miracle
on Ice" victory over the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans hope this silver medal will inspire another
generation of kids to play hockey, much the way the 1980 gold spurred
on most of the members of this current team.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen our country come a long way," said Brooks, who played
on the 1964 and '68 Olympic teams. "A lot of us went from being
apprentices to journeymen to master of the trade. Now the American
hockey movement's alive and it's good and it's moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   It has already left the bad memories of Nagano far behind. In the
1998 Olympics, the United States went 1-3 and several players trashed
a room in the Olympic Village. This time the Americans played at
their best and--with the exception of a couple of Hull whacks at a
penalty-box camera--behaved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this time we did well," Richter said. "We were honest
about our effort and conducted ourselves well on and off the ice, and
for that we are proud."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians got their gold, the Americans got their dignity back
and these often contentious, litigious and even outrageous Olympics
finished on a graceful note.</TE>
<TE>   The team that played better won the game. Both sides acknowledged
it and there weren't any judges around to say otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   This will probably be the last Olympics for U.S. defenseman Chris
Chelios, 40. And it could be the last time the Olympics feature NHL
players because of the logistical problems of playing in the middle
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   As Chelios said as he looked at the silver medal in his right hand
and considered his future: "If this is the way it ends, it's a great
way to end it."</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>A Toast to a Host With the Most</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike Penner</AU>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>While waiting for duplicate gold medals to be minted for the 1972
U.S. basketball team (victimized by non-objective timekeepers in
Munich) and the 1980 Soviet hockey team (victimized by non-objective
American hockey players in Lake Placid), we raise a crumpled McFlurry
cup filled with 3.2% beer to toast the people and things that made
the Salt Lake Winter Olympics what they were--the only place to be if
you wanted to wait six hours in line to buy an overpriced blue beret:</LD>
<LD>   Chris Klug: The living, breathing rebuttal to the "X Games are way
more rad than the Olympics" line you often hear from the kids. As
part of his preparation for winning a snowboarding bronze medal here,
Klug received a liver transplant 18 months ago. It doesn't get any
more extreme than that.</LD>
<LD>   Ross Powers: The Olympic king of big air. Got so high on his
winning halfpipe run, flight attendants instructed the audience to
return to their seats and stay there 30 minutes before he landed.</LD>
<TE>   Pandora's Box: Not the name of a Greek bobsled. As we were all
unlucky to learn once Olympic officials decided the best way to
resolve a figure skating controversy was to treat it like a unruly
pub crowd: Gold medals all around!</TE>
<TE>   Apolo Anton Ohno: The Sports Illustrated pre-Games cover boy made
fake soul patches the second biggest must-have souvenirs of the Salt
Lake Olympics. But if you want to see him cross the finish line first
at the Olympics, you'll have to go to Turin in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes: Time magazine put her on its cover before the Games
even though conventional wisdom held that if Michelle Kwan or Irina
Slutskaya didn't win the gold medal, Sasha Cohen would. Next time
they come calling, I tell you, I'm taking the Time cover over the SI
cover.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan: Remember how dominant she was in 1996, rolling
through the sport of women's figure skating the same way Martina
Navratilova terrorized women's tennis in the '80s? Who back then
would have dared to make this prediction: Kwan will skate in two
Olympics and two other Americans will win the gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating coaches: Judging from the evidence at the women's
competition, apparently you need them.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Sale and David Pelletier: Went from silver to gold faster
than Kwan went from gold to bronze. Pioneers of the quad gold-medal
ceremony in pairs figure skating. Yet I ask you: Which pair of
skaters had the most significant performance for Canada--Sale and
Pelletier, or Bezic and Hamilton?</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic Medals Plaza: Where else can you see winning Olympians
receive their medals for a second time, followed by international pop
music stars jumping hysterically around the stage in order to keep
warm? "Who's that guy bundled up in the parka, mittens, ski mask,
scarf and earmuffs up there?" "She's the lead singer of your favorite
band."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Bradbury: A mastermind in the sport of short-track
speedskating, he was well-positioned in the men's 1,000 final, way
behind the pack, waiting patiently for the other four competitors to
wipe out so he could cruise home for the gold. My kind of Olympic
champion. The wily Aussie is now forever a part of the sporting
lexicon: Whenever an athlete succeeds through nothing more than dumb
luck, it's now called "pulling a Bradbury."</TE>
<TE>   Olympic hockey: If Gary Bettman really wanted to save his league,
he'd schedule six months of Olympic hockey every season, then hold a
12-day break every fourth year for NHL hockey. Gary, the choice is
yours: USA versus Russia, or the Columbus Blue Jackets against the
Nashville Predators.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Brooks: Amazing to report, the old disciplinarian got a
little lax here. Won it all with much lesser players the last time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky: He snubbed Patrick Roy, he left Joe Thornton off
the roster, he acted like a crazy man during Team Canada news
conferences, he wound up winning the gold medal. He pulled a
Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus over Sweden in hockey: It shouldn't happen, here or
anywhere, but that's why they play the games. A nice moment for
Mighty Duck Ruslan Salei, the lone NHL player on the Belarus roster,
but far too fleeting. For Ruslan, it's now back to the Arrowhead
Gulag of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton: Competitors say it's not nearly as dangerous as it
looks. Right. They say the same thing about Jell-O salad here.</TE>
<TE>   Ottavio Cinquanta: The Big O, as figure skating reporters called
him here. Had the perpetual look of someone in desperate need of
something a whole lot stronger than 3.2% beer. But the next Winter
Olympics are on his turf, in Turin, Italy. As another embattled ice
sport official named Gretzky warned us, there's payback in this game.
And it isn't going to be pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Picabo Street, Todd Eldredge, Elvis Stojko: Competed here in the
Ex-Games.</TE>
<TE>   Apolo, Creed: Two acts who headlined the second week at the Medals
Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Swiss ski jumper Simon
Ammann takes up curling.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Kwan's new nightmare. Replacing her old one:
Tara! Tara! Tara!</TE>
<TE>   Downtown proselytizing: On every other corner, you'd find
red-cheeked volunteers handing out political or religious pamphlets
of some kind. On the others, you'd find Bill Plaschke asking
sportswriters for money.</TE>
<TE>   American medal count: An all-time record 34. And it will keep
growing as long as they keep adding winter sports Americans dominate.
Up for approval in 2006: parallel giant slalom Play Station, men's
4x5k relay fast-food drive-thru, moguls freestyle corporate
downsizing and the Nordic combined couch potato.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City: It wasn't Sydney, Nagano, Lillehammer, Barcelona,
Albertville, Seoul or Los Angeles. But it wasn't Atlanta, either. In
other words, better than any of us arriving here three weeks ago ever
could have hoped.</TE>

Right Time</HD>

<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>They were singing in Saskatchewan, howling in Halifax, waltzing in
Winnipeg.</LD>
<LD>   OK, maybe not waltzing in Winnipeg.</LD>
<LD>   But oh, Canada was partying Sunday night, dancing all over its
home and native land, true patriot love flowing from the taps in
celebration of a group of brave and hearty souls that just busted a
50-year losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   The men's hockey team?</TE>
<TE>   No, silly, the E Center ice-making crew.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Canada defeated the United States, 5-2, in the
Winter Olympic gold medal hockey game, team boss Wayne Gretzky
admitted that the hero was not Joe Sakic, but a couple of Joe
Schmoes.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky reached into the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled
out a Canadian one-dollar coin known as a "loonie."</TE>
<TE>   For the last two weeks here, it had been secretly buried under
center ice.</TE>
<TE>   Because--you guessed it--the guys on the ice-making crew were
Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   "And they thought it would bring us good luck," Gretzky said.</TE>
<TE>   When the Canadian women defeated the U.S. women for their Olympic
gold medal Thursday, the winners kissed and pawed at center ice as if
paying homage to the coin.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky tried to call the women from the stands on his cell phone
to warn them to knock it off before somebody figured it out.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually quit, the coin remained buried, and, Sunday, the
Canadian men took full advantage.</TE>
<TE>   After which, Gretzky and his guys pulled out the drill.</TE>
<TE>   "We took it out tonight and we're going to present it to the Hall
of Fame," Gretzky said, holding the loonie aloft as if it were a
religious artifact.</TE>
<TE>   And what of the ice-making crew?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if the guy's going to get fired now or what,"
Gretzky said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well.</TE>
<TE>   All's fair in love and desperation.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you are American or Canadian or both, you had to love
Sunday that the desperate team won.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people singing and dancing in Canada right now,"
Jeremy Roenick said. "I'm just proud to be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, Roenick is American. But, yeah, he's serious. And yeah, it
makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   Canada invented hockey. The United States just borrowed it.</TE>
<TE>   Canada hasn't won an Olympic gold medal in men's hockey in 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   The United States won one 22 years ago that should be good for
another 220 years.</TE>
<TE>   Canada needed this game more than the United States.</TE>
<TE>   So, even at the end of these most patriotic American Olympics,
that song arising from the cramped E Center stands late in the third
period sounded perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Canada, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The best team won. The right team won.</TE>
<TE>   "A great day for hockey," U.S. defenseman Brian Leetch said.
"Looking back years from now, we'll say it was nice to be part of
this."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Americans wanted to win. But they understood when
they lost that maybe, at least for these 60 minutes, it was about
something bigger than them.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Canadians] have a certain pride about their hockey,"
American Chris Chelios said, later adding with a smile, "It might be
the only game they're good at."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, they certainly wanted it more than the Americans,
showing more speed, more stamina, more life.</TE>
<TE>   On any other day, you would rip the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, fighting the good-luck charm and hard-luck
history, perhaps nobody would have had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day to watch The Great One grind in the seats, Super
Mario spin on the ice, Martin Brodeur contort in the net.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day when sitting Duck Paul Kariya finally had a shining
moment, new kid Jarome Iginla had a breakthrough moment, and Canadian
veteran Brendan Shanahan had a funny family moment.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the game ended, I was looking up in the stands for my
wife," he said with a grin. "My American wife."</TE>
<TE>   It was like that for everyone here, the line between countries
growing ever blurry, nine NHL teams featuring teammates on opposite
sides here, families born in one country and living in another,
everyone understanding the stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone playing hard, then realized that it ended as it</TE>
<TE>   should.</TE>
<TE>   "The emotions were different on our side than on their side,"
Leetch said. "We wanted to bring home a gold medal. But it was like
they were playing for everyone in their country."</TE>
<TE>   So the Canadians began, as they have this entire tournament, by
playing tight.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a lot of pressure on us," Joe Nieuwendyk said. "A lot
of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   There was the diving poke by American Doug Weight that skidded the
puck down the ice and on to the stick of Tony Amonte, who scored the
Americans' first goal.</TE>
<TE>   There was Brodeur diving to barely stop Brett Hull on a
three-on-one break that could have made it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "That was our big chance," Chelios said. "But they got away with
it."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the final minutes of the first period, the Canadians
settled.</TE>
<TE>   There was the wonderful fake by Mario Lemieux on the pass by Chris
Pronger that slid past Lemieux's stick and landed directly on the
stick of Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   The Duck stuck the puck into the corner of the net to tie the game
at 1-all</TE>
<TE>   "[Lemieux] is sneaky," Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians took the lead on Iginla's punch-in, the Americans
tied it up, then, late in the second period, Sakic stuck the puck
past two defenders and Richter for the eventual game-winning goal.</TE>
<TE>   "They won as a team, but sometimes it takes one individual,"
Richter said. "Joe Sakic really stepped it up."</TE>
<TE>   As if he had a choice.</TE>
<TE>   As if anyone in this game had a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our country ... we desperately needed to win this tournament,"
Gretzky said.</TE>
<TE>   As loonie as that sounds, he's right.</TE>

<HD>Their Greatest Gift</HD>
<DH>A pair of Jack Shea's skates are presented to his son and
grandson, providing fitting coda to family's inspiring story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Add one more goose bump to the story of gold medalist Jim Shea,
already among the most heartwarming and inspiring of these Olympic
Games.</LD>
<LD>   Shea is the Lake Placid, N.Y., slider who won the gold medal in
skeleton Wednesday, carrying a funeral card of his grandfather in his
helmet as he sped down the course. His grandfather, Jack, had won two
gold medals in speedskating in the 1932 Olympics at Lake Placid and
his father, James, was also an Olympian, competing in Nordic skiing
in the '64 Games in Innsbruck.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the Games began, before Jim slid to his skeleton gold,
the story line was in place: three generations of Olympians in Salt
Lake, grandfather and father watching Jim go for the gold.</LD>
<TE>   But three weeks before the Games were to begin, Jack Shea, 91,
died after suffering injuries in a car crash. So the story took
another twist.</TE>
<TE>   And Sunday, yet another.</TE>
<TE>   Jim and James were summoned to the main press center here, where
the managing editor of the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun
presented them with a gift so special that, when James saw it, tears
welled in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper had recently been contacted by a man named Kozo
Yoshida. Yoshida, 62, had read accounts of Jack Shea's death and how
it cost him an opportunity to watch his grandson compete in the
Olympics. Yoshida also remembered that a pair of speedskates he had
used for years, and was still using occasionally, had been given to
him by a man who said they had been a gift from an American named
Jack Shea.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshida was a young speedskating enthusiast. His father worked at
city hall in Sapporo, where the '72 Winter Olympics were held. A
co-worker, Katsumi Yamada, who had been in the Nordic combined in the
same Lake Placid Olympics in which Jack Shea competed, heard that
young Yoshida was a speedskater and gave a pair of skates to his
father for his son's use. He told the elder Yoshida that the skates
had been the gift of an American, Jack Shea, from the '32 Olympics,
and that, in return, he had given Shea a pair of his cross-country
skis.</TE>
<TE>   Young Yoshida was told the story of where the skates came from,
then used them the rest of his life, including as recently as just
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "With these skates," Yoshida said, in a recent story in the
Japanese media, "I have competed in the Japanese inter-high school
championships for three straight years."</TE>
<TE>   He said that he was famous among his friends because his skates
were an American brand, Spalding, and he got a lot of attention from
other skaters because of that.</TE>
<TE>   When Jack Shea died after the car crash, Yoshida heard the story
on the news, and the story of his grandson. So he contacted the
Japanese newspaper and said he wanted the Sheas to have the skates
back.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheas, despite knowing why they were there when they arrived
for the presentation Sunday, were still unprepared for this new
emotional wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   The box was opened and the skates handed to them, as a dozen
photographers clicked away. And it was quickly pointed out to them
what was written on the bottom of one skate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my dad's signature, see right there," said James Shea, about
to break down. "This is unbelievable. I'm not sure I really believed
it until I saw that."</TE>
<TE>   The memories flooded back.</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago when I was a kid, I was in the basement of our house
and a couple of us were looking for wood to bust up and make into a
sled," James Shea said. "And my dad came down and he said to not
touch those [skis], that they were special. But he never said why."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Shea also was clearly taken by the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what the Olympics are all about," he said. "My
grandfather loved the friendships. He loved to do nice things for the
other athletes. Today, we've been shown great kindness. I'm
overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   James Shea said he expected that the skis that were traded for the
skates are still hanging in a basement in Lake Placid, but he and his
son didn't wait to look for them to make a return gift.</TE>
<TE>   So they unwrapped the gift to be sent off to Kozo Yoshida,
Hayakita Town, Japan, who felt the Olympic spirit an ocean and
thousands of miles away and did something because of it.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime soon, he will be receiving one of the two rails from the
skeleton used by Jim Shea on Feb. 20, 2002, to win an Olympic gold
medal.</TE>

<HD>View From Turin Is Impressive</HD>
<DH>Organizers in northwest Italy are 'almost astonishingly
ahead of schedule' for the 2006 Winter Games.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>No less an authority than Jean-Claude Killy says that the Winter
Games of 2006, in Turin, Italy--the city Italians call Torino--ought
to be fantastic.</LD>
<LD>   Killy was the skiing star of the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games. He
ran the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France.</LD>
<LD>   He was the IOC's No. 2 official in charge of monitoring progress
for the Salt Lake Games. Now he's the IOC's chief liaison to the
Turin Games.</LD>
<TE>   "Italy and Torino have the roots, l'histoire, to organize
something very special," Killy said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Very Mediterranean. Very culturistic. It will be very different,"
not better, not worse, just different, he later emphasized, "from
here."</TE>
<TE>   If the six-minute Torino segment in Sunday night's closing
ceremony is any indication, expect a distinctly Italian but
thoroughly up-to-date take on the Olympics featuring sport,
technology and, of course, style.</TE>
<TE>   No matter that it was freezing cold Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   In what was billed as a "celebration of Italian fashion," models
wearing Valentino, Versace and Dolce &amp; Gabbana outfits sashayed along
stages in the Stadium, as if Salt Lake City were a natural place to
show off haute couture.</TE>
<TE>   The Italians also trotted out the musical standard "Volare"--but
it was sung by pop diva Irene Grandi.</TE>
<TE>   The after-show invite for selected guests read, "See you in Torino
2006. The adventure begins. With a party."</TE>
<TE>   One of the key differences between Turin and Salt Lake is that,
unlike here, there are no plans there to take over a downtown parking
lot and make it an Olympics medals plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Turin, in northwest Italy, capital of the country's Piedmont
region, already offers scores of arcades and plazas where people
naturally gather "to make celebrations," said the former mayor of the
city, Valentino Castellani, now president of the Torino 2006
organizing committee.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the venues for 2006 need construction work. But
Castellani and others said plans are on schedule--as long as the work
starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos was recently discovered at the proposed site of the
bobsled run; a decision on whether to move it will be made next
month.</TE>
<TE>   The organizing committee's other priorities include a make-over of
the figure skating arena, an architectural "masterpiece" from 1961 in
need now of renovation, Castellani said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on tap for this year are the signing of various marketing
deals. Castellani said deals are ready--simply waiting for the end of
the Salt Lake Games. Torino 2006 expects an operating budget surplus
of about $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Capital costs are projected to total about $1.4 billion, with
considerable funding provided by national and local government.</TE>
<TE>   Castellani expressed hope that security at the Games may not need
to be as tight in four years. Perhaps, he said, "The world will not
be in an emergency, let's say better than it is now."</TE>
<TE>   David Neal, a senior NBC producer who has visited Turin within
recent months and is one of the few Americans with an insider's
knowledge of preparations for the 2006 Games, said the organizing
committee is "almost astonishingly ahead of schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Also impressive, he and others said, is the level of organization
within the committee. In large measure, that's due to stability.
Unlike the Athens 2004 Summer Games organizing committee, which has
seen considerable turnover, Castellani, deputy president Evelina
Christillin and others have been working together toward 2006 for
years--before Turin even was awarded the Games, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Being the same for four years means something," Christillin said.</TE>
<TE>   Turin has a reputation as something akin to the Detroit of
Italy--a city known more for its considerable manufacturing and
industrial concerns than as an internationally renowned tourist
destination.</TE>
<TE>   With the 2006 Games, Castellani said, "Our goal is to be one of
the important cities in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Christillin said: "We can never pretend to be Florence or Rome.
But when a [visitor] comes, they are surprised."</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</KH>
<HD>Quietly, Koch Makes His Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Koch earned the only medal ever won by a U.S. athlete in Nordic
skiing at the 1976 Winter Games in Innsbruck.</LD>
<LD>   A bearded 20-year-old from Vermont, Koch won the silver medal in
the 30-kilometer cross-country race, finishing just 28 seconds behind
Sergei Savelyev of the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   And according to news reports, there was not a single American fan
or journalist in attendance.</LD>
<TE>   Koch is still rather anonymous--and hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Koch starts with the U.S. Ski Federation, then on
to the father of one of Koch's U.S. teammates, then to an official in
the International Ski Federation, and finally to Koch's mother, Nancy
Ragle.</TE>
<TE>   Ragle, who lives in Vermont, said her son lives in Ashland, Ore.,
with his second wife, Kate, and their 11/2-year-old daughter, Mehana.
Koch, who also is the father of two grown daughters, became a father
for the fourth time Friday when his son, William Oliver, weighed in
at 10 pounds 2 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Ragle was about to recount the highlights of Koch's life
since the 1976 performance, she stopped and said, "I'd better not say
anything because I don't want to make Bill mad. He is a very private
person."</TE>
<TE>   And Koch agreed that he is. It is his nature.</TE>
<TE>   Koch took up the Nordic combined--an event that combines skiing
and ski jumping--as a teenager. But when he didn't make the 1972 U.S.
Olympic team, Koch decided to put all his efforts into cross-country.
When he was 18, Koch became the first American to win a cross-country
medal in international competition.</TE>
<TE>   After his shocking performance in 1976, Koch's progress was slowed
by severe exercise-induced asthma. He finished 15th at the 1980 Lake
Placid Olympics in the 50-kilometer race and began concentrating on
longer distances. Koch also pioneered a controversial technique that
resembled speedskating on skis. In the mid-1980s, after trying to ban
the technique, officials decided to hold races in two
disciplines--classical and freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Koch became the first American to medal in the world championships
with a bronze at the 1982 30-kilometer race in Oslo, Norway, and he
also won the overall Nordic World Cup title that year. Koch skied in
four events at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics but didn't come near a
medal and retired for nearly five years until coming back to make the
1992 Albertville team. There, he wasn't a medal threat but he did
carry the U.S. flag in the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Koch has spent significant time living in Hawaii,
where he was again a pioneer, using sand skiing as a way to train for
cross-country.</TE>
<TE>   He said he loved living in Hawaii but that Kate found living on an
island too confining. So the couple have found a place they both love
in Oregon.</TE>

<HD>Two Stripped of Gold Medals</HD>
<DH>Scandal mars final day as Russia's Lazutina and Spain's
Muehlegg test positive for blood doping substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>In a surreal combination of circumstances Sunday, Russian Larissa
Lazutina accepted congratulations for winning the gold medal in the
women's 30k cross-country ski race at Soldier Hollow, while 60 miles
away the International Olympic Committee was voting to strip her of
the medal for a blood doping violation.</LD>
<LD>   Lazutina, 36, whose victory would have given her 10 medals in the
Winter Games, became the central focus of a breathtaking scandal
infecting the sport and staining the final day of the 19th Winter
Olympics. Lazutina's expulsion from the Games was announced only a
few hours after she claimed Sunday's triumph was revenge for being
forced out of the women's relay on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The IOC also stripped Spanish skier Johann Muehlegg of his gold
medal in the men's 50k--one of three golds he won--and expelled him,
and also expelled Lazutina's Russian teammate Olga Danilova from the
Games, without taking away her medals, all for testing positive for a
new drug that is similar to previously known blood doping substances
used to enhance performance.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to conduct this fight," said Arne Ljungqvist, acting
chairman of the IOC medical commission. "They should know we are on
their heels. This is a very important message to those who claim we
are always far behind."</TE>
<TE>   The harsh afternoon revelations in Salt Lake City were set against
a morning backdrop of cheer at the final individual event of the
Games. Thousands of fans rang cowbells and waved flags at Soldier
Hollow as Lazutina crushed the field and Nina Kemppel of Anchorage,
Alaska, the best female American cross-country skier ever, completed
her Olympic career with the finest U.S. result ever.</TE>
<TE>   After Lazutina, who defiantly called the almost sure-thing-gold
Russian relay team ejection from Thursday's race "a tragedy," was
removed, Italian Gabriella Paruzzi was awarded the gold medal, her
countrywoman Stefania Belmondo was elevated to silver, and Norwegian
Bente Skari was raised from fourth place to bronze. Danilova raced
and finished eighth, but was removed from the final standings.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg, 31, is German, but competes with a Spanish passport. He
moved to Madrid when he couldn't break into the top echelon of German
skiers. At the Games he won the men's 30k and 10k, and passed drug
tests. However, Muehlegg was given an out-of-competition drug test
Thursday. He won the 50k on Saturday before the positive result came
back.</TE>
<TE>   Lazutina and Danilova were tested Thursday, but results did not
come back and hearings on the cases were not completed before
Sunday's race.</TE>
<TE>   During the Games, the medical staff conducted more than 1,200
blood tests, according to Patrick Schamasch of the IOC's medical
commission. Athletes with elevated rates of hemoglobin, exceeding
17.5 units for men and 16.0 for women, were subsequently given urine
tests.</TE>
<TE>   In these three cases, according to an IOC report, the athletes
tested positive for darbepoetin, a substance that is so new that it
is not on the IOC's banned list. But it is regarded as the equivalent
of EPO, or erythropoetin, which stimulates the production of red
blood cells "and can therefore enhance performance in endurance
sports." Athletes are given a blanket warning not to ingest any
performance-enhancing agent.</TE>
<TE>   Ljungqvist, who is from Sweden, defended the organization's severe
sanctions even though the drug is not on the banned list. Ljungqvist
said the product has only been on the market a few months--created to
treat anemia--but said IOC policy allows for penalizing athletes who
use drugs similar to banned substances.</TE>
<TE>   "This enables us to keep up with new production of drugs around
the world," Ljungqvist said. "This is a very strong message the IOC
is sending. We are very saddened, but we had to act."</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg attended his own hearing, and according to the IOC
report, pointed out he had passed other drug tests. He suggested
failing this one might be related to a change in diet.</TE>
<TE>   At another hearing, Russian delegation officials representing the
skiers challenged the validity of the testing. IOC Director-General
Francois Carrard said they have the right to appeal to the Court of
Arbitration for Sport.</TE>
<TE>   It was a world of contrasts for Olympic cross-country skiers
Sunday. At Soldier Hollow, in Midway, snow fell in thick flakes and
obscured the Wasatch Mountains as skiers battled the hilly and high
terrain at 5,600 feet. Fans in the stands and sprinkled around the
course roared. Polka music played over a loudspeaker and horse-drawn
sleigh rides were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Lazutina's time of 1 hour, 29.09 seconds, was 1:48 faster than
Paruzzi. Kemppel, 15th after the disqualification of the Russians,
bested Martha Rockwell's 16th in 1972 and finished in 1:37:08. Wendy
Wagner, also of Anchorage, Alaska, was 23rd. Barb Jones of Bozeman,
Mont. was 35th.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the hardest race of my life," Kemppel said. "I didn't
have much more left."</TE>

<LD>Much of the Southern Section Masters meet focused on the 140-pound
semifinal match between Buck Barger of Villa Park and Jeff Bristol of
Temecula Valley, and for good reason. It was one of the most exciting
matches of this season.</LD>
<LD>   Lost in the hype over that match, which featured four lead changes
in the third period, was the performance of Cypress Brethren
Christian's Danny Cadwallader, who won the weight class.</LD>
<LD>   Cadwallader, ranked No. 3 in the state behind Bristol and Barger,
marched through his half of the bracket with a 21-6 technical fall in
the second round, a 15-7 decision in the quarterfinals and a pin in 2
minutes 45 seconds in the semifinals. He dominated Barger in the
final, scoring an early takedown, another one early in the second and
had a 6-2 lead with another takedown at the second-period buzzer.</LD>
<TE>   He frustrated Barger, who was nearly disqualified after throwing
elbows during the third period and shoving Cadwallader on a break.
Cadwallader eventually won, 8-2, though referees said Barger had to
take a forfeit rather than face disqualification. Cadwallader
benefited from drawing the opposite bracket from Bristol and Barger.</TE>
<TE>   "This weight class was anyone's game," Cadwallader said. "I was
fortunate to be on the opposite side of the bracket from [Bristol and
Barger], but it means a lot to me to win it."</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Cadwallader again will be on the opposite side
of the bracket from Bristol and Barger at the state meet.</TE>
<TE>   City champions: San Fernando won its second consecutive City
Section championship on Saturday in their gym with weight-class
victories from Jason Paez at 112 pounds, Raphael Reynolds at 125,
Will German at 171 and Julian Martinez at 215.</TE>
<TE>   German became the third wrestler to win four consecutive City
championships. He advances to the state championships with a chance
to become the first City Section wrestler to place twice at the state
meet. Other City weight-class winners were: Juan Alvarado (Canoga
Park) at 103; Edward Randolph (Canoga Park) at 119; David Ardi
(Granada Hills) at 130; Androk Dermejian (Birmingham) at 135; Rhett
Whitaker (Granada Hills) at 140; Gevor Atimizyan (Birmingham) at 145;
Jimmy Matamoros (Bell) at 150; Omar DeLaTorre (Chatsworth) at 160;
John Vargas (Chatsworth) at 189; Mike Kushnitzyan (Birmingham) at
heavyweight.</TE>

<HD>Minority of One</HD>
<DH>Her Ascent to No. 1 Finally Realized, Venus Williams
Definitely Followed Her Own Path</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer wisdom finally caught up with conventional wisdom in women's
tennis today.</LD>
<LD>   This is why the news that Venus Williams officially became No. 1
isn't more of a blockbuster announcement. If you walked into any
sports bar last week--managing to pull fans away from curling and
hockey--and quizzed people about the top-ranked player in the world,
undoubtedly, the answer would have been Williams, not Jennifer
Capriati.</LD>
<LD>   Surely, hadn't Williams been No. 1 already after winning Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open the last two years? And, if not, why had it taken
so long?</LD>
<TE>   The computer is the partial culprit, much-maligned and all, but of
course, not as much as Olympic figure skating judges or the bowl
championship series. It artificially propped up Martina Hingis, who
benefited by playing more and winning smaller, less prestigious
events. Even Lindsay Davenport seemed slightly embarrassed by
finishing last year ranked No. 1, admitting Williams was the true top
player.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, too, had something to do with the strangeness. She
played a limited schedule last year, and no events after the U.S.
Open because of the terrorist attacks and an injured wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Just as quixotically, she took a different approach in 2002.
Having been criticized for playing too little, she flipped that
notion and has been in five tournaments the first eight weeks of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams left her Florida home on Dec. 27 for Australia and has
been on the road since, starting at Gold Coast, Queensland, winding
through Paris and Antwerp, Belgium, and finishing in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Call it coincidence or providence, but, in a larger sense, the
timing couldn't have worked out better. Williams has become the first
African-American, male or female, to be ranked No. 1 by their
professional tennis association. Arthur Ashe reached No. 2 on the
ATP's computer rankings in 1975, and Althea Gibson was ranked No. 1
in 1957 by a world panel, long before the WTA computer rankings
started in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The historic moment arrived near the end of February, Black
History Month. It came two days after another African-American
player, Alexandra Stevenson--a childhood friend of Williams from
their Southern California days--reached the tour final in Memphis,
losing to Lisa Raymond. And it dawned only a day after another
African-American, James Blake, played in the Memphis final against
his Davis Cup teammate, Andy Roddick, also losing.</TE>
<TE>   There were more than thoughts of Ashe and Gibson when Williams
spoke about her latest accomplishment on a ragged phone line on
Saturday from Dubai. An associate of Gibson's got on the conference
call, warmly congratulated Williams, and said that Gibson wanted to
personally offer kudos but was unable to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be foolish to forget Althea Gibson," Williams said. "She
was the first. And more than anything, I just feel proud to represent
America in my sport."</TE>
<TE>   The dream--of winning Grand Slams and reaching No. 1--was not hers
at the start. Richard Williams, her father, had the notion first when
Venus and her younger sister Serena were growing up in Compton. He
boldly predicted Venus would become No. 1. He even said Serena would
be better than Venus, which did happen, briefly, when Serena won the
U.S. Open in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was telling the truth," Venus said of the No. 1
prediction. "I was just being the daughter of a proud father. And
more than anything, I think he knew he put the work in and that we
were listening to him, and I think that's why he had that confidence
to say that myself and Serena would be Grand Slam champions.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we are some of the best players in the game, I guess,
in history, and I just think that I give a lot of credit to my dad
for that."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother and coach, Oracene, should receive just as much credit.
She has been with her daughter since the start of this final
determined charge toward No. 1. Increasingly, Williams has taken
charge of her career as she has matured. At the Australian Open, she
played through the pain of an injured knee, hinting she didn't
consult her parents, and fought her way to the quarterfinals though
hampered, losing to a resurgent Monica Seles.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, she found support from her Italian boyfriend,
Davide, who was with her in Australia as well as the European stretch
and final stop in Dubai. It hasn't been easy. She played three
consecutive weeks, the first time she had done so since October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In the Paris final, Williams defeated local favorite Amelie
Mauresmo and took on another local favorite, Justine Henin, a week
later in the Antwerp final. Williams has won three titles this year
and lost in the semifinals to Sandrine Testud of France on Friday in
Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   "I did intend to be on the road," said Williams, who added the
Antwerp tournament when she realized how close she was to No. 1. "I
gave my full commitment for the first two months of the year. I knew
it would be really tough, and mentally I've prepared to not be at
home. But I really miss my dog ... and I miss Serena too. I miss the
States more than anything. I haven't really had a chance to watch the
Olympics, so I missed out on a few things."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the reigns at No. 1 have been short. Williams is the
fourth player in the last five months to reach No. 1. Capriati,
Davenport and Hingis are the others. Williams and her sister Serena
will not be playing at Indian Wells next week, not surprising after
last year's controversy, in which they were booed by the crowd. Venus
pulled out of a scheduled semifinal against Serena because of an
injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, all in all, it was just basically an incredible scene last
year in Indian Wells, but that's part of sports, playing with the
good and the bad," Venus said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether she is passed by Capriati this week in Scottsdale or by
not playing at Indian Wells, Williams doesn't appear overly
concerned. She reached No. 1 her special way, and why be any
different now?</TE>
<TE>   "I think the best part is that I've enjoyed myself along the way
and that I have not limited myself just to playing tennis or made
myself believe that that's the only thing in life," she said. "I've
always been doing things at the same time and having a career; for me
that's the best part."</TE>

<LD>The international peacekeepers in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, have
enabled people to leave their homes without fear. The streets are
becoming crowded again. More and more markets are open. Kidnappings,
car thefts and assaults are fewer.</LD>
<LD>   What's good for Kabul would be just as good for Kandahar and Herat
and Jalalabad, where the warlords of old are back in power or trying
to get there.</LD>
<LD>   History gives reason to fear this development.</LD>
<TE>   After Russian occupiers were forced out in 1989, the warlords took
control and wreaked so much havoc on Afghanistan that the Taliban
were welcomed for ending the violence. That started the march to Al
Qaeda and last September's terror.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has resisted pleas by Afghanistan's interim
prime minister, Hamid Karzai, and some U.N. officials to increase the
number of peacekeepers and send them to other cities. Currently they
number only 4,000 and patrol only in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has declined to put its own troops into the
international peacekeeping force. That's reasonable. Other nations
have sent soldiers, and U.S. forces are still fighting a war,
searching for Al Qaeda and Taliban forces.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should take the lead at the United Nations to persuade
the Security Council to expand the peacekeeping force and push other
countries to help pay. President Bush told Karzai during his visit to
Washington last month that the U.S. will help train an Afghan army,
but that task may well take a year or longer.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the new soldiers are ready, and a German-trained
civilian police force is on the streets, the warlords may well be
operating regional fiefdoms outside the reach of the central
government.</TE>
<TE>   Britain has taken the lead in supplying the peacekeepers, but it
says it wants to relinquish command of the force to Turkey next
month. Fair enough, but Britain should join Washington in pushing
other nations to supply troops. The British foreign secretary said
Karzai made "a very strong case" for thousands more peacekeepers when
they met.</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, there are now 60,000 peacekeepers in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghanistan peacekeepers are not seen as an occupying army.
They have proven popular, and why shouldn't they be? Who doesn't want
the freedom to walk the streets, talk with neighbors, shop and work
or attend school without fearing thugs?</TE>
<TE>   Additional peacekeepers will be a barrier against Afghanistan
slipping back into chaos. They are needed now.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey, kids. Want to skip a year of school?</LD>
<LD>   It's easy. Attend classes on a multi-track, year-round calendar
and lose up to 17 days per school year. Over the course of
elementary, middle and high school, the loss adds up to nearly a
year, although the time is theoretically made up by a longer school
day.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, year-round students on average lag others in
test scores.</LD>
<TE>   No one wants to do this to students or teachers. But critically
overcrowded school districts, like Los Angeles, have no other choice
until they build scores of new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the Los Angeles Unified School District failed miserably
at school-building for a generation. even as enrollment rose
dramatically. Now, finally, the district is on track to build at
least dozens of schools, but it needs more money to get there.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature is expected this week to consider putting
$25billion in two school bonds before voters in November of this year
and March 2003. It's only fair that those bond measures include extra
assistance for districts that suffer the worst crowding.</TE>
<TE>   When the school facilities conference committee, co-chaired by
state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) and Assemblywoman Virginia
Strom-Martin (D-Duncans Mills), takes up this proposal, which is not
yet in bill form, some members will push to reduce the planned
overcrowding set-aside, currently pegged at $4.5billion.</TE>
<TE>   Districts that most needed new schools often lost out until
recently on state school construction funds. That's because they were
handed out on a first-come, first-served basis after a district
secured the land and received all required state approvals. This
formula made it more difficult for urban districts because they lack
large, available tracts of unsullied land.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed on behalf of students cheated by the state formula
resulted in giving those districts more time to complete their
applications. That has helped, but the affected districts need more.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed $4.5-billion reserve would help districts such as Los
Angeles, Long Beach, Compton, Montebello and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Getting schools built efficiently, on time and in budget is matter
of more than money. But without money, the process can't even get
started.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature should hold out for the full $4.5billion for
crowded districts rather than add to the years that students will be
handed a get-out-of-school-free card.</TE>

<KH>ELECTION RECOMMENDATION</KH>
<HD>No on Proposition 44</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the 1960s, Californians have been asked to vote on increasingly
numerous, complex and often inscrutable voter initiatives. Nine
statewide propositions made it to the ballot in the 1960s, and 62 in
the 1990s. Some have been models of direct democracy. Far too many
have been a waste of voters' time. A case in point is Proposition 44,
on the March 5 ballot, which would stiffen professional penalties
against chiropractors convicted of insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The measure nips at a real problem, but in a way that's ultimately
corrosive of democracy and good government. Voters should not have to
regulate medical professions. We recommend a "no" vote on Proposition
44.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 44 has its origin in a state Senate hearing two years
ago in which a number of witnesses, including one disguised by a
hood, testified about how lawyers, doctors and chiropractors create
and process hundreds of millions of dollars in phony auto insurance
injury claims every year, driving up insurance rates and sometimes
causing serious actual injury when the fraud rings orchestrate
crashes.</LD>
<TE>   After the hearing, legislators beefed up penalties against doctors
and lawyers who hire ambulance chasers and others to hawk services to
recent accident victims. They tried to tighten the reins on
chiropractors too, but couldn't because in 1922 chiropractors had
persuaded Californians to pass a constitutional amendment requiring
voters to approve changes in state oversight of their profession.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, physicians skeptical of chiropractors had indeed
tried to prevent legislators from licensing the profession. Today,
however, chiropractic medicine is accepted, and the 1922 law is an
anachronism.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 44, by curing a small problem, allows the Legislature
to ignore the big one. It requires voters, most of whom do not know a
solar plexus from a sacroiliac, to decide ''professional''
chiropractic behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is also written in inscrutable legalisms.</TE>
<TE>   Voters will have to face the issue once more to cure it.
Legislators must put on the ballot, as soon as feasible, an
initiative changing the state Constitution so that chiropractors are
regulated like doctors, lawyers and other professionals by experts in
their field.</TE>
<TE>   Vote "no" on Proposition 44, then demand that state lawmakers act
to remove chiropractic regulation from the Constitution.</TE>

<LD>   California's highway system is bad and getting worse. No
politician or professor needs to tell you that. Just get out and
drive.</LD>
<LD>   Too many new people. Not enough new pavement. More's being poured,
but not fast enough to keep up.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has been working at it and is sensitive to public
griping. To underscore his efforts, the governor--like some county
supervisor--even attends formal openings of carpool lanes, as he did
Friday on the southbound 405 through the Sepulveda Pass in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Davis signed a $6.8-billion "Transportation Congestion
Relief Program," which temporarily required all state sales taxes
paid by motorists on gasoline to be spent for major highways, local
roads and public transit. It's a six-year program that Davis
suspended after one year because of the recession, grabbing back the
money for non-transportation purposes. The program is supposed to
resume in 2003 and run five more years.</TE>
<TE>   Now Davis is supporting Proposition 42, which would permanently
require that the state sales tax paid at the pump be used for
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   You may have thought it already was required. Most people do. But
that 6% tax is deposited into the state general fund for other
purposes such as prisons, parks and politicians' pork projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked an audience of tow-truck drivers, 'How many think this
sales tax is going to transportation?'" says Assemblyman John Dutra
(D-Fremont), who authored the bill placing Prop. 42 on the ballot.
"Essentially everybody raised their hand.</TE>
<TE>   "'How many think it should?' Everybody's hand popped up."</TE>
<TE>   They, like most people, confused the gasoline sales tax with the
18-cents-per-gallon state fuel tax that does go directly to
transportation. Some county sales taxes also are used for local roads
and transit.</TE>
<TE>   Prop. 42 is projected to deliver $36 billion over a 20-year period
for highways, streets and transit, $7.7 billion of it in L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   "A massive long-term investment that's sorely needed," Davis said
last August in announcing his endorsement at a freeway opening in
Fontana. The major Republican gubernatorial candidates also support
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, this proposition goes down easy because it's not a
tax increase. It's a spending shift.</TE>
<TE>   The rub is it would mean less money for other programs, maybe even
schools. But K-14 schools are guaranteed roughly 40% of the general
fund by Prop. 98, approved 14 years ago. Prop. 42 money would amount
to only about 1.5% of the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Any hit to schools by Prop. 42 would be to the extra money they
sometimes receive above their Prop. 98 guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. opposes Prop. 42 but decided not to
mount an opposition campaign. The union is saving its millions to
promote a massive school construction bond in November.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the CTA was not eager to pick a fight with the governor or a
wide coalition of business and labor interests whose backing it will
need for the bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   "We have other fish to fry--bonds," says Gale Kaufman, a CTA
political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   One argument against Prop. 42 is that voters today can't be
certain what the state's spending priorities will be six years from
now. But they can be certain that traffic will continue to worsen if
we stay on the same course.</TE>
<TE>   Some complain about "ballot-box budgeting"--voters tying the hands
of future governors and legislatures. (Actually, lawmakers could
suspend Prop. 42 with a two-thirds vote.)</TE>
<TE>   These complaints seem specious. Nobody's demanding the repeal of
Prop. 98, the behemoth of ballot-box budgeting.</TE>
<TE>   The key point, however, is that this tax-spend nexus is logical.
It's fair, like a user fee. Pay at the pump to pour pavement. Add
lanes. Fill holes. Extend rail.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce,
says it's hard to persuade out-of-state corporations to invest
long-term here--and treat us as a community, not just a market--if
Californians themselves won't invest in better transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show a slight majority of voters favoring the measure. Many
are undecided. Sponsors--basically road builders--have kicked in
around $3.5 million for TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Davis winces when he sees one spot that begins: "It's official,
folks. California now has the worst, most congested roads in the
nation."</TE>
<TE>   That's the finding of a Washington D.C. highway group, using data
collected by a Texas think tank from each state's transportation
department. The study was paid for by a group pushing Prop. 42.</TE>
<TE>   So don't believe it. Believe your eyes. And your increasingly
longer commute.</TE>
<TE>   Worst in the nation is not the preferred message of a governor
running for reelection. But traffic's bad and Davis can't truthfully
say it's getting better. Someday he may if Prop. 42 passes.</TE>

<DH>Protest: Animal advocates picket a Canoga Park shelter,
saying conditions are unhealthful. The action prompts a counterrally.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The claws were out and the fur was flying Sunday as animal rights
activists picketed the Canoga Park shelter of a fellow rescuer,
saying she confines sick cats in cramped, filthy cages.</LD>
<LD>   As police and off-duty officers looked on, about 30 dueling
activists accused each other of a litter of crimes and videotaped
everybody for protection, they said, as a group supporting the
shelter responded by bringing out competing signs. There were no
arrests.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the dispute is Marge Weems, who runs Angel Puss &amp;
Pooch Rescue shelters in Canoga Park and Eagle Rock. Weems has
pleaded innocent to animal abuse charges of keeping too many cats at
her West Hills home.</LD>
<TE>   Her husband and two other men face battery charges for a scuffle
during a protest at the Canoga Park shelter in October. Because of
that fracas, the protesters and Weems' supporters kept at least six
video cameras trained on each other Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Weems has operated Angel Puss since 1992 and says she finds new
homes for as many as 4,000 cats and dogs a year--animals she says
would be euthanized at other shelters "if they blinked, looked wrong
or had a cold." Weems maintains she's being targeted by other animal
rescuers and animal control officials because she has filed a federal
lawsuit accusing them of colluding to put her nonprofit humane
society out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the protesters outside Weems' shelter Sunday acknowledged
they want to shut it down--but only to rescue the hundreds of cats
inside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not collusion," protest organizer Jim Cross said. "We are
united out here against animal abuse, and that's all we have in
common."</TE>
<TE>   Some said they had volunteered at the shelter over the years and
witnessed sickly cats wasting away in tiny cages stacked like shoe
boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions were just so depressing and appalling," said a
woman who gave her name only as Dawn.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Weems and several volunteers offered tours of the
3,200-square-foot Canoga Park shelter, where she says she keeps about
300 cats and a few dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, cats were sleeping in car carriers, clawing multitiered
posts, lounging in baskets and hissing at each other over bowls of
food.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, as picketers held signs saying "The Abuse Must Stop" and
"Save the Cats," Angel Puss volunteer Greg Raffetto said he has never
seen the poor conditions described by the protesters. He said animals
often arrive at shelters because they are sick, and "most of them can
be nursed back to health and found good homes."</TE>
<TE>   The longtime bickering among Weems and other rescuers "results in
all this extra time and energy being spent away from the animals, and
it hurts the animals," said Raffetto, whose sweatpants were covered
in cat fur.</TE>
<TE>   Another of Weems' supporters, Bill Girolamo, credited her
operation for nursing his cat Spikey back to health.</TE>
<TE>   "Any other shelter probably would have put him to sleep.... I
think these people are saints," said the Venice geologist. His
T-shirt proclaimed, "All I Need to Know I Learned From My Cat."</TE>

<HD>No Easy Way Seen to Cut Creek's Salt</HD>
<DH>Farming: Plan to clean Ventura County watershed would cost
millions but may not work, study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spending millions of dollars in taxpayer money to cut salt levels in
troubled Calleguas Creek will not solve water pollution woes facing
local farmers, a new analysis shows.</LD>
<LD>   The report, prepared for a coalition of Ventura County cities and
water districts, is in response to a proposal by regional water
quality regulators that opponents say will double the average east
county water bill.</LD>
<LD>   "We're talking about cost with no benefit here," said Robert
Westdyke, Camarillo's public works director. "It doesn't make sense
to spend money and get nothing out of it."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board officials have proposed a
stricter standard for chloride in certain areas of the Calleguas
Creek watershed, which stretches across the east county from Simi
Valley to Mugu Lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   The chloride is actually a medley of salty pollutants that gives
drinking water a chalky taste and attacks the roots of sensitive
crops. Chloride damage results in lower yields, especially in
strawberry fields and avocado groves.</TE>
<TE>   A water board meeting on the issue that had been scheduled for
this Thursday has been postponed for a few months. But the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency intends to adopt the new standard by
March 22--a deadline imposed by a 1999 lawsuit settlement with
environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear what the ramifications of such an action would
be, although cities and water districts indicate that another lawsuit
against the EPA is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators say it is their job to make sure that the creek, some
of which trickles into ground-water basins and is then pumped for
irrigation, is not polluted to the point that it becomes unusable for
downstream farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Chloride concentrations have increased steadily since the 1970s,
and there's no reason to believe that trend won't continue unless we
do something," said Melinda Becker, who handles the program for the
water board.</TE>
<TE>   Because waste-water plants from Simi Valley to Camarillo are the
source of most of the water in Calleguas Creek, the burden is being
placed on them to cut the concentrations of chloride.</TE>
<TE>   Current regulations allow Calleguas to contain up to 190 parts per
million of chloride. But that interim limit, in place since the early
1990s, will expire next month.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the regional board proposed cutting the level for the
entire basin to 110 ppm--considered to be the optimal level for the
growing of avocados.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have since revised the plan so that only the uppermost
stretches of the creek would have to comply with the strict standard,
while the rest of the watershed could stay at 150 ppm.</TE>
<TE>   But even that has not satisfied anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of whether the proposal is totally outrageous or
just mostly outrageous," said Don Nelson, public works director in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to comply with any standard lower than 190 ppm,
officials say, is through a process called reverse osmosis, which
forces out the salty particles through a system of synthetic
membranes.</TE>
<TE>   Cities would have to spend up to $70 million each to build the
treatment facilities, translating into monthly rate hikes ranging
from $20 to $40 per household.</TE>
<TE>   To fight the proposal, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, Simi Valley, the
Camrosa Water District and the Ventura County Water District in
Moorpark have joined forces. Together, they have spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on lawyers and scientific experts.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrologist Timothy J. Durbin, former chief of the water resources
division for the U.S. Geological Survey, prepared the latest report .</TE>
<TE>   Using computer-simulation models of the watershed over a 40-year
period, Durbin determined that imposing the 110-ppm standard would
not significantly cut chloride levels in the area's ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, he concluded, is that agriculture irrigation causes
most of the salt buildup underground. As salty water is applied to
crops, the water evaporates but the salt remains in the soil,
eventually trickling back into the ground water, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Smith, a team leader at the EPA, said officials will "take a
hard look" at the study before making a decision. But he also said
the EPA would not miss the court-ordered deadline and did not know
whether altering the plan now was possible under public-notice laws.</TE>
<TE>   Becker, of the regional board, stressed that the new standard is
only intended to protect surface water and some of the shallow
ground-water basins alongside the creek.</TE>
<TE>   That approach, however, is the crux of the frustration for cities
and water districts, who say the regional board is operating in a
vacuum. They are urging a more holistic solution, as are the farmers
the action is meant to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Ann DeMartini, general manager of two Somis water companies ,
disputes that farmers are the source of the increased chlorides.</TE>
<TE>   But she does agree that the proposed water-board action will not
sufficiently reduce the irrigation water's salt content--a need that
is becoming more critical for many growers.</TE>

crops. Chloride damage results in lower yields, especially in
strawberry fields and avocado groves.</TE>
<TE>   A water board meeting on the issue that had been scheduled for
this Thursday has been postponed for a few months. But the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency intends to adopt the new standard by
March 22--a deadline imposed by a 1999 lawsuit settlement with
environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear what the ramifications of such an action would
be, although cities and water districts indicate that another lawsuit
against the EPA is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators say it is their job to make sure that the creek, some
of which trickles into ground-water basins and is then pumped for
irrigation, is not polluted to the point that it becomes unusable for
downstream farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Chloride concentrations have increased steadily since the 1970s,
and there's no reason to believe that trend won't continue unless we
do something," said Melinda Becker, who handles the program for the
water board.</TE>
<TE>   Because waste-water plants from Simi Valley to Camarillo are the
source of most of the water in Calleguas Creek, the burden is being
placed on them to cut the concentrations of chloride.</TE>
<TE>   Current regulations allow Calleguas to contain up to 190 parts per
million of chloride. But that interim limit, in place since the early
1990s, will expire next month.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the regional board proposed cutting the level for the
entire basin to 110 ppm--considered to be the optimal level for the
growing of avocados.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have since revised the plan so that only the uppermost
stretches of the creek would have to comply with the strict standard,
while the rest of the watershed could stay at 150 ppm.</TE>
<TE>   But even that has not satisfied anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of whether the proposal is totally outrageous or
just mostly outrageous," said Don Nelson, public works director in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to comply with any standard lower than 190 ppm,
officials say, is through a process called reverse osmosis, which
forces out the salty particles through a system of synthetic
membranes.</TE>
<TE>   Cities would have to spend up to $70 million each to build the
treatment facilities, translating into monthly rate hikes ranging
from $20 to $40 per household.</TE>
<TE>   To fight the proposal, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, Simi Valley, the
Camrosa Water District and the Ventura County Water District in
Moorpark have joined forces. Together, they have spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on lawyers and scientific experts.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrologist Timothy J. Durbin, former chief of the water resources
division for the U.S. Geological Survey, prepared the latest report
sent to the water board and the EPA. Using computer models of the
watershed over a 40-year period, Durbin determined that imposing the
110-ppm standard would not significantly cut chloride levels in
ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, he concluded, is that agriculture irrigation causes
most of the salt buildup underground. As salty water is applied to
crops, the water evaporates but the salt remains in the soil,
eventually trickling back into the ground water, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essentially futile to regulate waste-water chloride as a
means to controlling ground water chloride," Durbin's report said.
"So long as agricultural irrigation continues in the Calleguas Creek
watershed, ground water chloride will increase with or without
advanced waste-water treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Smith, a team leader at the EPA, said officials will "take a
hard look" at the study before making a decision. But he also said
the EPA would not miss the court-ordered deadline and did not know
whether altering the plan now was possible under public-notice laws.</TE>
<TE>   Becker, of the regional board, stressed that the new standard is
only intended to protect surface water and some of the shallow
ground-water basins alongside the creek. "The scope of this action is
limited," she said. "We are not going to solve the basin-wide problem
of increasing chlorides in the ground water."</TE>
<TE>   That approach, however, is the crux of the frustration for cities
and water districts, who say the regional board is operating in a
vacuum. They are urging a more holistic solution, as are the farmers
the action is meant to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Ann DeMartini, general manager of two Somis water companies that
provide ground water to Las Posas growers, disputes that farmers are
the source of the increased chlorides in the watershed.</TE>
<TE>   But she does agree that the proposed water-board action will not
sufficiently reduce the irrigation water's salt content--a a critical
need for many growers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the controversy has made it difficult for farmers to
work with the agencies to come up with other, less costly solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to put a giant Band-Aid on a problem that just needs a
little Band-Aid," DeMartini said. "It's really not going to help."</TE>

<HD>Coad Running Against Rival--and Her Record</HD>

<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a full house at Mama Cozza's Italian restaurant in Anaheim.
Still, Cynthia and Tom Coad are easy to spot. They're the ones who
don't sit.</LD>
<LD>   Their eyes, honed from years in politics, scan the room looking
for a friendly face. On a Friday evening, they're all friendly.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh hi, how have you been?" Cynthia Coad says, warming to a couple
eating pasta. "You know I'm running for reelection."</LD>
<TE>   Coad, who is seeking reelection March 5 to the Board of
Supervisors, is in a tough battle. She's finding that her voting
record and role as part of a pro-airport board majority has given her
opponent, Fullerton Councilman and fellow Republican Chris Norby,
plenty to vent about.</TE>
<TE>   At Cozza's--friendly territory, where her campaign T-shirt is
encased in glass alongside photos of celebrities such as former Ram
players Jack Youngblood and Jackie Slater--Coad is, as always, with
her campaign manager and husband of 47 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Cynthia! Tom!" bellowed restaurant owner Frank Cozza as he
strode over to them. "How are you today? You know you have our
support."</TE>
<TE>   Coad has lived in the area--actually an unincorporated county
island--for 40 years, since her husband left the Marine Corps and set
up a dental practice in nearby Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Lately her schedule has been jammed with campaign appearances as
she runs against Norby, who is heavily supported by South County
residents for his opposition to a controversial plan to build an
international airport at the abandoned El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   Coad strongly favors the airport, saying it will mean more jobs
and long-term economic vitality. It's a stance that critics say makes
her a poster child for jet aircraft, noise and pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Coad handily defeated a popular Latino Republican
challenger. But after four years on the board, Coad, now in her
second year as chairman, is on the defensive. She's having to explain
her airport position, why she voted for the county's pro-union labor
agreement, and opposed Measure H, a countywide initiative to use
tobacco settlement money on health care that was overwhelmingly
approved by 65% of county voters in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Coad also is running in a very different district than the one to
which she was elected in 1998. Redrawn to reflect 2000 census
figures, the 4th District gained Fullerton, where Norby's voting
strength lies. It lost parts of Coad's strongholds in Anaheim Hills,
Orange and Anaheim to the neighboring 3rd District, now represented
by Supervisor Todd Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with the help of her husband, she has locked up
endorsements from nearly every elected official in her district,
including most of Norby's colleagues on the Fullerton City Council.
However, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, running for county clerk-recorder,
recently switched his backing to Norby.</TE>
<TE>   The defection surprised her, Coad said, especially after Daly said
she'd done a great job at her recent state of the county speech.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is a steadfast airport supporter along with Supervisors Jim
Silva and Chuck Smith, who make up the board majority planning for an
airport that would serve 18.8-million passengers a year by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have faith an airport is needed," Coad said in an
interview. "It's safe and it will attract the high-paying jobs that
we need. Is it politically viable? We're going to find out March 5."</TE>
<TE>   That's when county voters decide Measure W, an initiative that
would rezone the former El Toro base from an airport to a park. The
proposed zoning would permit a large-scale park with academic
campuses, light industrial use and other development.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls suggest an airport at El Toro is unpopular with
county voters--though less so in north Orange County. Still, Coad
says she and other supervisors are duty-bound to carry out Measure A,
a 1994 countywide initiative that narrowly passed, zoning the former
base for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Especially after Measure F, an anti-airport initiative approved by
voters in 2000, was ruled unconstitutional. "They say I don't listen
to the will of the people. Well, the legal thing we're following is
Measure A. That's the will of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters like David Ellis have praised Coad, saying,
"She's only carrying through her belief, that's what we elect people
to do. It's called leadership, taking a stand."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent speech at a Republican women's club in Fullerton,
Coad was grilled about her support for a landmark union pact
requiring that union workers make up at least 85% of the workers on
any new major county public works projects.</TE>
<TE>   A deal struck when the board majority sought labor alliances to
fight Measure F, the union pact raises hackles within the county's
Republican ranks. And after Coad dodged a question from the audience
on her support for the agreement, club president Patricia Lochrie
grabbed the microphone and insisted on an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted her to clarify her position on that because she didn't
answer the question," Lochrie said.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said she could have provided a better answer, but she didn't
want to spend time answering a negative question instead of sharing
her views on other issues.</TE>
<TE>   The union labor deal is costing her dearly. Already, predominantly
nonunion contractors have raised an estimated $15,000 for Norby.</TE>
<TE>   "This is on a very visceral level, retribution," said Eric
Christen, a spokesman for the Southern California Coalition for Fair
Employment in Construction.</TE>
<TE>   "From a political and economic level, it's people exercising their
right to replace [the agreement] sought by unions and developers
trying to get the airport built, which obviously the county doesn't
want," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another campaign issue is Measure H, an initiative that pitted the
same three-member board majority against health care and community
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   It would have the county spend most of the $750 million in tobacco
settlement funds over the next 25 years on health care, not
bankruptcy debt and jail beds as Coad and colleagues Silva and Smith
had wanted.</TE>
<TE>   After it was approved by 65% of the voters in 2000, the same three
supervisors voted to sue to block the measure's implementation,
listing as a defendant Dr. J. Brennan Cassidy, a private Newport
Beach physician whose name appeared on the initiative's petitions.</TE>
<TE>   Coad recently sought Cassidy's support.</TE>
<TE>   "I said thank you very much for the endorsement list [Tom Coad]
handed me, and that's all I said," said Cassidy. "I did not give her
my endorsement."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Coad nor Norby got a nod from the 3,000-member Orange
County Medical Assn. The association interviewed both candidates, but
there was no strong sentiment for either candidate, even though Coad
did win praise on health care programs she has supported, said Dr.
William Callahan, the association's legislative committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, now 68, was raised in Iowa and put her husband through
dental school. Then, after raising seven children, she decided to
carve her own niche as a college instructor. She also ran for a seat
on the North Orange County Community College District Board of
Trustees, serving six years. Then in 1998, she easily defeated former
Anaheim Councilman Lou Lopez for the open 4th District seat.</TE>
<TE>   The Coads spent $600,000, mostly personal funds, to win a job that
pays about $107,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Coads' wealth, estimated at more than $10 million, came from
Tom Coad's success as a dentist-turned-investor who bought Qualcomm
stock before it went public in 1991. It has allowed her to make a
loan to her current campaign against Norby for $90,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hate her for other things, she says, but not the fact that she and
her husband are living the "Orange County dream."</TE>
<TE>   "Look, my first three kids were born in a free clinic," she said.
"I put my husband through dental school and we had to borrow money to
get out here when my husband was stationed as a Marine at El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Coad said her motivation to seek higher office came while working
as a volunteer at an Anaheim barrio called La Colonia Independencia,
teaching English to Spanish-speaking residents in a run-down area
plagued with high unemployment and other social problems.</TE>
<TE>   "These are poor areas, hardly bastions with a lot of money. It was
the pits. I told myself I'm going to become elected and try and fix
these things," Coad said. "I asked myself, 'Who else would do it?' "</TE>

<HD>Undecideds Key in Tight Race for D.A.</HD>
<DH>Twenty percent of those responding to a poll for The Times
favor incumbent Rackauckas and 19% choose challenger Wade, but the
majority don't know.</DH>

<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas appears to be neck and neck
with veteran prosecutor Wallace Wade in his bid for reelection, but a
majority of voters still don't know which way they'll vote in the
March 5 election, a poll conducted for The Times found.</LD>
<LD>   In a survey of 582 likely voters, Rackauckas took 20% of the vote
to Wade's 19%, with the remaining voters undecided, according to the
Baldassare Associates poll, which has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.</LD>
<LD>   "It's still anybody's race," said Cheryl Katz, the poll's
director. "It could go either way."</LD>
<TE>   Wade, who received 41% of the vote in a 1998 loss to Rackauckas,
said the poll results are encouraging. No challenger has defeated an
incumbent district attorney in Orange County in more than five
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great news," Wade said. "The knock has always been that you
can't beat an incumbent. Clearly, he has not established a good
reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas supporters also found the results encouraging. They
predicted that the majority of undecided voters will go with the
incumbent, particularly because crime has declined during his term.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised by the numbers," said Michael Schroeder, the
former state Republican Party leader who is managing Rackauckas'
campaign. "Wally Wade is deluding himself if he believes that
trailing even narrowly at this point is good news."</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll was conducted Feb. 14 through 18, before a blitz of
campaign mailers hit Orange County homes. It found that among likely
voters, 32% approve of Rackauckas' job performance, while 19%
disapprove and nearly half don't have an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Wade has made Rackauckas' ethics a central theme of his campaign,
questioning the first-term district attorney's handling of several
cases involving political contributors. But the issue has not
resonated among voters, the poll found. Just 7% of voters rated
Rackauckas' ethics as poor, while 29% thought the district attorney
has done a good or excellent job of maintaining a high ethical
standard in office, the poll found.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jimenez, a San Juan Capistrano businessman who responded to the
poll, said he is familiar with the criticism of Rackauckas but blames
it on disgruntled workers. He said he'll vote for the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony started out trying to clean house. That element thought they
owned the department," Jimenez said. "If he didn't have friction,
he's not doing his job."</TE>
<TE>   Wade has said that if voters research the issues, he's confident
they'll support him. He's won the support of the deputy prosecutors'
association as well as several Orange County police unions.</TE>
<TE>   But even those who said they'll vote for Wade had a hard time
identifying issues that led them to stray from the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "I know [Rackauckas] has had a lot of conflict down there," said
Bill Regniak, 42, a salesman from La Habra. "That's why I was going
to vote for the other gentleman. It seems everything he does is a
conflict of interest.... I can't specifically name any."</TE>
<TE>   Wade's backers hoped he would win support from south Orange County
voters expected to favor Measure W, which would zone the closed El
Toro Marine base for a regional park instead of an airport. Wade also
hoped to get political mileage out of Rackauckas' close link to
George L. Argyros, the wealthy developer who is a leading advocate
for an El Toro airport. .</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that voters who oppose an airport favor Rackauckas
by the same margin as the rest of the population.</TE>
<TE>   With nine days until the election, Wade supporters said they
expect news of the tie to energize their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That this is neck and neck is consistent with what I've been
hearing in the community," said Christopher Evans, a Wade supporter
and former top assistant to Rackauckas. "This county has a long
tradition of keeping political corruption in check, and there's been
a lot of bad news coming out of the district attorney's office for
three years. That doesn't play well here."</TE>

<HD>San Diego's D.A. Faces 3 Foes in Reelection Bid</HD>
<DH>Politics: Clashes with his prosecutors and the police union
prompt one of the nastiest campaigns in recent local history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Four years ago, Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst was unopposed in his bid for
a second term.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as he seeks a third, Pfingst is in a political free-for-all
with three opponents who are drawing strength from an open rebellion
among Pfingst's deputies and from an angry police officers union.</LD>
<LD>   Rivals for the job include a deputy district attorney, a Superior
Court judge and a former federal prosecutor turned civil litigator
and civic activist.</LD>
<TE>   His critics claim Pfingst has an ethical blind spot and a mean
streak. They say he refuses to recognize the transgressions of a
favored few in his office while severely punishing even minor
slip-ups by the majority of prosecutors on his staff.</TE>
<TE>   His deputies point to Pfingst's alleged refusal to investigate
reports that a high-ranking deputy was selling real estate on county
time.</TE>
<TE>   They also say he was reluctant to investigate the conduct of
another high-ranking deputy who may have helped a jailhouse informant
get special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy in the real estate case later pleaded guilty to a
charge of misusing funds.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst replies that, in the real estate case, his trust in his
deputy was betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   But in the case of the informant, he notes that an outside
evaluation by a former U.S. attorney cleared the deputy of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to back down, the 50-year-old Pfingst said the campaign
against him is the work of malcontents who have never accepted the
fact that he toppled a six-term incumbent in 1994 and then brought
wholesale change to the office through demotions, reassignments and
policy changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a demanding boss," Pfingst said. "I have little tolerance for
people who don't work hard, and that causes some distress among
employees within the office."</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst would have voters focus on statistics showing that San
Diego's crime rate has fallen at twice the rate of the national level
and that the district attorney's office has run up the highest
conviction rate of any such office in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst also cites nationally recognized improvements in welfare
fraud prosecutions, child support collections and computer crime
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   And he points to frequent use of the three-strikes law and the
voter-approved measure allowing minors to be tried as adults in
violent crime cases.</TE>
<TE>   His critics claim Pfingst is taking undue credit for the drop in
crime, and that the conviction rate is misleading because it does not
take into account cases in which charges were not filed.</TE>
<TE>   Harping on the theme of ethical deficiency, the San Diego Police
Officers Assn. is backing Superior Court Judge Bonnie Dumanis.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said the police are angry at his criticism of their
tactics in several officer-involved shootings and out to get him
because he filed criminal charges against an officer in one case, a
first for San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes between Pfingst and his prosecutors--who gave him a
vote of no-confidence--and between Pfingst and the police have led to
one of the nastiest political campaigns in recent San Diego history.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pettine, the deputy district attorney who is running against
his boss, said Pfingst's disdain for his employees and his "bunker
mentality" have caused an irreparable rift with his prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The third opponent, former federal prosecutor Michael Aguirre, has
launched a massive television advertising campaign with his own
funds.</TE>
<TE>   If Pfingst cares about the criticism, he isn't letting on.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to represent the voters and make sure they're safe," he
said. "The other three [candidates] want to be student body
presidents of the [Deputy] District Attorneys Assn."</TE>
<TE>   If none of the candidates gets 50% in the March 5 primary, the two
top vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in November.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the race, so far, was captured in a newspaper picture
of a recent campaign event. At a candidates forum, the three
challengers are shown chatting amiably while Pfingst sits apart,
frowning.</TE>
<TE>   The forum also was marked by charges of dirty politicking when the
Pfingst camp was accused of planting a question in the audience about
whether any of the candidates had ever been under psychiatric care.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dumanis said she sought help after a failed suicide attempt
16 years ago following the death of a family member. Pfingst denied
planting the question.</TE>
<TE>   Besides cranking out a steady stream of scalding anti-Pfingst

<HD>School Dental Clinic Fills Mutual Need</HD>
<DH>Health: Low-income residents gain access to affordable care
while Oxnard College hygienist students get valuable experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pain and his sister's prodding finally got to be too much for
Juan Carlos Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   So Martinez, 31, who'd never had a professional teeth cleaning,
found himself lying in a trailer on the Oxnard College campus for 3
1/2 hours as he was treated by Cherie Marriott, a dental hygiene
student.</LD>
<LD>   After screening Martinez's mouth for cancer, reviewing his X-rays
and probing his gum line for signs of bone loss, she gave the Oxnard
resident the bad news: His periodontal disease was so advanced it
would take at least five marathon scaling sessions plus a referral to
a dentist.</LD>
<TE>   But Marriott offered to pay for Martinez's appointments herself,
just as she had done in three other serious cases this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing it for the experience," said Marriott, 24, who moved to
Oxnard from the Lake Tahoe area to attend the college's two-year
dental hygiene program, which she completes this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We need these type of patients to graduate, and unless you give
them the incentive to show up by paying for it, they wouldn't be
here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Relationships based on mutual need help explain the success of the
dental hygiene school. Before it began, the nearest dental hygiene
schools were in Pasadena and West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the campus clinic, which has afternoon and evening
hours, costs $15, compared with the $60 to $80 that a teeth cleaning
could run in a private dental office. Patients are seen in a common
room 18 at a time, one for every student. The program enrolls 36
students, divided into junior and senior classes, which have
different clinic schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Because students are required to have their work checked by one of
the three faculty members on duty, appointments typically take three
to four hours each.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing you have to have when you come here is plenty of
time, because we are slow as molasses," joked program director Betsy
Matsumo-Lindbergh, who taught at USC before helping start Oxnard's
program five years ago. "But you will leave with the cleanest teeth
you have ever had in your life."</TE>
<TE>   Because the clinic receives many of its patient referrals from the
Salvation Army and local homeless shelters, the condition of the
mouths these hygienists-in-training encounter are generally poorer
than normal.</TE>
<TE>   "They come in and you can see across the room that they need some
help," said Jennifer Culver, 31, a second-year student. "Then they
come back a few times and you can see such an improvement, which is
really rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   Local dentists say that in a county where nearly one-third of
children under age 4 have untreated dental disease, the school is
serving an important role. As part of their course work, students
make presentations on oral health at elementary schools and shopping
malls, where they often use the exposure to book clinic appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the nation's dental hygiene schools are based at community
colleges. Students admitted to Oxnard College's program must first
finish 1 1/2 years of prerequisites and have a grade-point average of
3.0 or better. They are selected through a lottery that draws an
average of 100 applicants for every 18 slots.</TE>
<TE>   Graduates are virtually assured a job--hygienists are one of the
fastest-growing occupations in the country, according to the American
Dental Hygienists Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Hygienists had a median income of $48,150 in 1999, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics--and work flexible hours.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly appealing to returning students such as
39-year-old Christine Abbinanti of Westlake Village, a single mother
and former visiting nurse; and Joseph Testa, 38, a former dairy farm
manager from Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time it starts feeling like too much, I just tell myself,
'Three days a week!,'" said Testa, who commutes two hours each way to
attend classes in Oxnard.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They breeze in for the day on flights from Utah, Nevada, even as far
as Japan, to glimpse the Orange County lifestyle, which John Martin
promises is so impressive that it must be seen in person.</LD>
<LD>   But the whirlwind tours on which Martin and others take clients
don't involve strolls through Crystal Cove, hikes on the ridges of
Laguna Canyon or sipping margaritas on Dana Point yachts.</LD>
<LD>   No, the visitors will experience the Yale Loop, that confusing web
of streets through Irvine's master-planned communities that's
notorious for trapping drivers in circles.</LD>
<TE>   Martin, an urban planner with strong ties to local development
companies, sees the homes on the circular thoroughfare as works of
art. The steady stream of builders and government officials who make
the pilgrimage to get a look at them on private, daylong tours
conducted by Martin and other paid consultants seem to agree.
Variations on the loop have popped up all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why those homes have a prominent place in Martin's latest
project: an as-yet-untitled 69-chapter book highlighting design
"breakthroughs and innovations" in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "He's writing a book about design innovations there?" quipped
Stefanos Polyzoides, a Los Angeles architect who is among the many
who call the county a sprawling mess and find it nothing short of
tragic that its housing culture has been exported all over the world.
"Sounds like a very short book.... It is just senseless subdivisions
as far as the eye can see."</TE>
<TE>   Innovation That's Not Always Obvious</TE>
<TE>   But when Martin navigates his silver Mercedes SUV through the
thick iron gates surrounding the housing developments--many of which
he had a hand in planning--he sees only a mark of pride for the
county. "[Critics] are so quick to point out the flaws that they fail
to notice how many great things we've done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit No. 1 offered by Martin: the Woodbridge development, built
on the loop in the 1970s. It looks like a bunch of oversized,
wood-shingled single-family houses.</TE>
<TE>   Martin urges a closer look.</TE>
<TE>   They are actually multifamily units. Three to each house. Yet they
were not designed as block buildings like so many other townhomes
were at the time. The design broke up the monotony and resulted in a
replica New England neighborhood instead of just more apartment
complexes. Each pod is designed like a unique mansion. For 1970s
townhouses, Martin says, the architecture was rich and diverse, and
is still copied.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to create a Cape Cod effect here," he said. "The
look is not a repetitious look. It's got a small-town atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "People weren't turned off by there being more homes per acre
here," he said. "It's got parks, it's got great architecture. People
love it." Resale figures show that the townhomes are still more
popular with homebuyers than many neighboring homes in other styles.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, a consultant who spends much of his time studying
demographic trends to help builders determine shifts in the
marketplace, has worked for the Irvine Co. as well as the Mission
Viejo Co. He continues to consult with builders on projects locally
and throughout the West. He is also a lecturer at UC Irvine, USC and
Cornell University in New York on trends in residential real estate
and community design.</TE>
<TE>   A library in his office contains large filing cabinets full of
architectural sketches, sales numbers, photos and promotional
material from every major residential development built in Orange
County since the mid-1960s. Between riffling through these files and
hopping across the state to interview leaders of the housing industry
for his book, Martin preaches the gospel of Orange County design to
clients all over the map.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Martin says, the developments lack adequate public
transportation, stores and offices that can be reached by foot, and a
healthy diversity of income groups living alongside one another.
These are all the things new urbanists such as Polyzoides say are
mandatory to create a livable community.</TE>
<TE>   Martin pointed to these shortcomings as things to avoid when he
consulted with Riverside County officials on the draft of their
general plan, which will guide growth there. Yet when it comes to
mass-producing houses that are attractive, Martin insists you can't
go wrong following Orange County's lead.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit No. 2: The Cortabella development in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Martin beams while driving through the community, where homes are
built 20 to the acre in the style of a Mediterranean seaside villa.
Such high densities are applauded by advocates of controlled growth
because they cluster the homes and leave open space elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   There are no driveways: The garages face one another in courtyards
paved with faux stone. Fountains, statues and fancy Italian-style
railings adorn the buildings. Large French windows open onto small
balconies overlooking the courtyards.</TE>
<TE>   "We came up with this when three of us took a trip to the
Mediterranean for the Irvine Co. in 1987," Martin said. "This design
is popping up all over the place now."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Garages From Protruding</TE>
<TE>   It's on to several more exhibits in Irvine and Newport Beach,
where homes are built with varied architecture and alleys in the
back, creating an attractive view from the street. Garages don't
stick out like snouts: They are recessed behind the front of the
house so the communities don't look like a sea of garages. Lot sizes
are mixed to make the development look more natural and less like a
checkerboard.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mahogany and Mayfield developments, also in Irvine, houses
built with all these concepts face a look-alike, garage-fronted
community across the street. "These homes sold four times as fast,"
Martin says of the more diverse homes.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges that the prices of the homes he cites are out of
reach for most people but says that is because land in Orange County
is so outrageously expensive. The design concepts, Martin says, are
being exported to other regions where prices are in range for
middle-class families. For instance, the same house that would sell
in the $600,000s here would be in the $200,000s in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that these concepts can be transported affordably does
not sit well with everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a tale of two Orange Counties," said Robert Lang, a
professor of planning at Virginia Tech who has written extensively
about urbanization in the West. "Design critics hate the developers'
guts and think the county was a squandered opportunity. Yet industry
people all over the world think it was a huge success."</TE>
<TE>   So successful that developers of the first mega-scale
master-planned community in the Salt Lake City area are looking to
Martin and other experts from Orange County for guidance. They are
dropping in for a tour later in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   There, the Sunrise development will rise on a former copper mine
outside the city and will be home to 40,000 residents. The blueprints
are being touted in Utah as the foundation for a sustainable,
walkable suburban city, with viable commercial centers mixed in with
attractive housing and public transportation to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Martin puts it on the scale of the Irvine Co.'s creation of the
city of Irvine. "Utah has never had a development like this," he
said. The developers of Sunrise also plan to use homebuilding
techniques that were spawned in Orange County, from those used in
courtyards to the blends of architectural styles.</TE>
<TE>   That comes as no surprise to William Fulton, a land use expert and
author of books about urbanization in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The suburban developments built in Orange County were
extraordinary for what they were," Fulton said: a compact, smart and
stylish alternative to the standard, boxy houses on big plots
elsewhere in the nation. "The problem is the county has outgrown the
suburban structure on which it was built."</TE>
<TE>   'No Such Thing as Build-Out'</TE>
<TE>   "Developers used to just assume that when they built what they
did, those towns were done," Fulton said. "Now we are finding there
is no such thing as build-out. Suburban communities need to figure
out how to recycle themselves. For Orange County, this is a tough
trick."</TE>
<TE>   It's tough because public transit is scarce and so are urban
centers that can be redeveloped to accommodate more people. In Utah
and elsewhere, builders have a chance to avoid Orange County's
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Some dispute that this is even possible. Polyzoides and others say
developers looking for inspiration should look north.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be thinking about train lines, intense housing,
mixed-use communities with commercial and residential that stress
walking and an ecological balance," he said. "Los Angeles is doing
this and coming back with a vengeance. But there is still no
innovation south of the Orange Curtain."</TE>
<TE>   Martin doesn't see it that way as he drives through a Newport
Beach development full of pocket parks, alleys and mixed lot sizes.
"People love this stuff," he said. "I can't wait to show it to the
Utah folks."</TE>

middle-class families. For instance, the same house that would sell
in the $600,000s here would be in the $200,000s in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that these concepts can be transported affordably does
not sit well with everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a tale of two Orange Counties," said Robert Lang, a
professor of planning at Virginia Tech who has written extensively
about urbanization in the West. "Design critics hate the developers'
guts and think the county was a squandered opportunity. Yet industry
people all over the world think it was a huge success."</TE>
<TE>   So successful that developers of the first mega-scale
master-planned community in the Salt Lake City area are looking to
Martin and other experts from Orange County for guidance. They are
dropping in for a tour later in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   There, the Sunrise development will rise on a former copper mine
outside the city and will be home to 40,000 residents. The blueprints
are being touted in Utah as the foundation for a sustainable,
walkable suburban city, with viable commercial centers mixed in with
attractive housing and public transportation to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Martin puts it on the scale of the Irvine Co.'s creation of the
city of Irvine. "Utah has never had a development like this," he
said. The developers of Sunrise also plan to use homebuilding
techniques that were spawned in Orange County, from those used in
courtyards to the blends of architectural styles.</TE>
<TE>   That comes as no surprise to William Fulton, a land use expert and
author of books about urbanization in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The suburban developments built in Orange County were
extraordinary for what they were," Fulton said: a compact, smart and
stylish alternative to the standard, boxy houses on big plots
elsewhere in the nation. "The problem is the county has outgrown the
suburban structure on which it was built."</TE>
<TE>   "Developers used to just assume that when they built what they
did, those towns were done," Fulton said. "Now we are finding there
is no such thing as build-out. Suburban communities need to figure
out how to recycle themselves. For Orange County, this is a tough
trick."</TE>
<TE>   It's tough because public transit is scarce and so are urban
centers that can be altered to fit more people. In Utah and
elsewhere, builders have a chance to avoid Orange County's mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Some dispute that this is even possible. Polyzoides and others say
developers looking for inspiration should look north.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be thinking about train lines, intense housing,
mixed-use communities with commercial and residential that stress
walking and an ecological balance," he said. "Los Angeles is doing
this and coming back with a vengeance. But there is still no
innovation south of the Orange Curtain."</TE>
<TE>   Martin doesn't see it that way as he drives through a Newport
Beach development full of pocket parks, alleys and mixed lot sizes.
"People love this stuff," he said. "I can't wait to show it to the
Utah folks."</TE>

<HD>Daily Donut a Shop With a Soul</HD>
<DH>Community: Health food it's not, but the fare served to
regulars at this Los Feliz store is warm and true.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of the Daily Donut, Lynn and Now Lay, are talking in their
Los Feliz shop one bustling morning about how they escaped Cambodia's
Khmer Rouge, fled to America, went to school, learned English, bought
their first shop in South Gate, and bought and sold enough other
shops to acquire a mini-mall and an apartment building.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly an old man perched in a corner seat interrupts.</LD>
<LD>   "When you came to this country, you'd never seen a toilet," Lennie
Bluett proclaims for the rest of the shop to hear, "and now you have
14! It's the American dream."</LD>
<TE>   Bluett is the best customer and best friend of the Daily Donut.
He's an 83-year-old piano player who's been holding court for most of
the 16 years the Lays have owned the shop, beguiling customers with
wit and charm honed in piano bars around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Mister Lennie," the Lays call him.</TE>
<TE>   Mister Lennie's picture is on the Daily Donut's wall, and his
corner seat is reserved. When the Lays go on vacation, they leave him
the key to the shop. When the couple, who live in the San Fernando
Valley, were seeking to put their daughter into a better school,
Mister Lennie became the girl's guardian so the Lays could use his
Los Feliz address.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is an L.A. story: the tall old black piano player, raised
in segregation, sharing laughs with two rugged immigrants raised amid
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   Bluett arrives one recent morning at the crack of dawn,
entertaining customers with stories of his travels and show-biz
experience, peppering them with greetings: Buenos dias ... bonjour
... ciao.</TE>
<TE>   Just back from playing at a hotel bar in Casablanca, he's sporting
a hand-knit Moroccan skullcap over his cleanly shaven head. He boasts
that he sported the bald look before Michael Jordan--why, even before
Telly Savalas.</TE>
<TE>   "I was traveling in Switzerland, and all these little children
came up to me shouting and pointing: 'Kojak!' 'Kojak!' 'Kojak,'" he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to say, 'No! No, not Kojak! It's Blackjack! Now shut up
and go away!'"</TE>
<TE>   Bluett spots a Los Feliz neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a judge," he warns the customers. "He could have you
arrested."</TE>
<TE>   "He's divorce court," jokes an employee, Rosana Aleman, handing a
Styrofoam cup of coffee-to-go to U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne.</TE>
<TE>   The judge pauses and tells a story about a preacher's response
when asked if he had ever contemplated divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Divorce, never. Murder, yes,'" Byrne laughs, pushing
the door to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Lay, 39, wonders from behind the counter why so many
marriages in America break up. It's different in Cambodia, where
woman are "loyal, hard-working and stable," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference," jokes a regular male customer, eating a glazed
doughnut, "can be summed up in three words: Community. Property.
State."</TE>
<TE>   The Lays' marriage was arranged by their parents. It was a
relationship that took hold while their homeland was in turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Missing the Green Fields of Home</TE>
<TE>   Now, 43, still misses Cambodia, its endless rice fields bright
green, dancing and fluttering in the wind. He says he was forced to
work the rice fields, and faced starvation and torture under the
Khmer Rouge, widely held responsible for the slayings of 1 million or
more Cambodians from 1975 to 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Now spent three months in jail for eating oranges that had fallen
from trees. He and his wife tried to escape more than once, but were
turned back and forced to walk back through fields littered with land
mines. Now says his mother and three sisters were killed by the Khmer
Rouge, who were singling out lighter-skinned ethnic Chinese or
Vietnamese for slaughter. Lynn lost two brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "They lined you up and checked skin color," Lynn says. "If the
skin is white, they take you out of the line and kill you. If the
skin is dark, then it's OK. I would stay in the sun to get dark."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn was pregnant with their first child when they crossed the
border into Thailand and flew to the United States in 1980. On the
flight she went into labor, and the plane was diverted to San
Francisco, where she gave birth. At the hospital, Now took his first
elevator ride. Their child was named Larry by a hospital translator.</TE>
<TE>   An extended family awaited the Lays in Los Angeles. The family
pooled its money and began fixing up, buying and selling doughnut
shops, an industry that thousands of Cambodian immigrants began to
dominate in California during the 1980s. Lynn sewed clothing; Now
worked in an auto shop. They both went to school.</TE>
<TE>   Their spacious home in an exclusive section of the Valley has
distanced them from their homeland. Their three children have little
understanding of the hardships they endured.</TE>
<TE>   "They say they are Americans," Now observes. "They say, this is
America and nothing bad is going to happen in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Six years after they landed in the United States, the Lays opened
the Daily Donut at Hillhurst and Franklin avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Bluett, a resident of one of the Los Feliz
district's high-rise condominiums, walked in, knowing little about
Cambodians but a great deal about struggle. He'd heard the stories of
relatives who escaped racism in the South. He'd heard the stories of
his grandfather, who armed himself with a shotgun and sat on the
porch of his Bell Gardens home, fearful that the KKK would attack his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Bluett came of age in Southern California at a time when whites
hung a black man in effigy from the flagpole at Fremont High School
and blacks demonstrated for the right to swim at any beach they
chose.</TE>
<TE>   His exposure to racism was cushioned by opportunities stemming
from his musical talents and a strong family. His mother was a cook
for Humphrey Bogart, and his father drove a bus for comedian Buster
Keaton.</TE>
<TE>   Complaining to Clark Gable</TE>
<TE>   Bluett's singing, dancing and piano-playing talents emerged at
Manual Arts High School, where he was a member of the chorus. Not
long after he graduated from high school, he was singing in a group
called the Plantation Boys. He played an extra on the set of "Gone
With the Wind." Bluett was one of three blacks to knock on Clark
Gable's dressing room door to complain about "Colored" and "White"
signs on the bathroom doors. Gable put in a call and had the signs
removed.</TE>
<TE>   Bluett's talents continued to earn him small roles in movies such
as "Stormy Weather" and "Cabin in the Sky." Through his friendship
with Bogart, he auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Sam in the
movie "Casablanca."</TE>
<TE>   "I was too young, too tall and too good-looking," he says
straight-faced. "I'm good looking now--but then I was gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   From the day he entered the doughnut shop, the 6-foot-4 Bluett
filled the place, overwhelming the Lays' broken English. Gradually,
he became their translator--the voice of the Daily Donut, the social
glue that held it together.</TE>
<TE>   He drove one customer around in his car until she found an
apartment. He encouraged the return of another regular who stopped
coming when Now told her she was gaining too much weight. These days,
a dozen or so regulars socialize at parties and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes the people who are there at the doughnut shop," says
Bluett's only child, Nicole. "He likes the owners. They think of him
as an elder and respect that."</TE>
<TE>   "There is 80-something years of history in that man," says another
customer, Washington Rucker, a jazz drummer.</TE>
<TE>   Sharyn Walker, a USC professor of immunology, walks over and
shares a chocolate butterfly doughnut with Bluett. She remembers
thinking he was obnoxious the first time they met in the shop five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to be left alone," she says. "I kept thinking,
'What is wrong with this man?' He just seems to stay in your face."</TE>
<TE>   But as with many, her distaste soon turned to affection, and she
found herself inviting him to her house for a party. Bluett agreed to
go but wanted to know if she had a piano. Walker took the hint and
went searching for a piano for her party. When she found one, she
went back to Bluett and told him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want you to get a piano," he told her. "I just wanted to
know if you had one. I get invitations from people who want me to
perform for them."</TE>
<TE>   Bluett's most recent performances were in the cocktail bar at the
Hyatt in Casablanca. (He was performing Sept. 11 but stayed through
November.) In Morocco, he plays in a small bar made up to resemble
Rick's Cafe in the 1942 movie. Behind the piano there is a large
picture of Humphrey Bogart. A trench coat and fedora are on a coat
rack. The most requested song is "As Time Goes By."</TE>
<TE>   "Both Mother and Father Time have been good to me," Bluett says.
"I'm in the sunset part of my life, and I don't want to waste a
minute. I wake up early, because I'd rather be interacting with
people, laughing and joking, kicking and scratching."</TE>
<TE>   Now squeezes into the booth seat next to Mister Lennie and notices
a gold bracelet that Bluett is wearing. Bluett says it is similar to
one worn by the king of Morocco.</TE>
<TE>   "You leave me that in your will," says Now, nudging his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Mister Lennie says, playing the rest of the shop for a laugh
again. "It goes in the box with me."</TE>

<HD>Fresno Triples Its Anti-Gang Forces</HD>
<DH>Crime: An explosion of killings, other violence prompts a
massive police crackdown on the city's estimated 500 gangs, 12,000
members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>One month into the biggest gang crackdown in Fresno history, 25 extra
police cars are cruising the streets when the report of an armed
robbery in progress flashes on patrol car computer screens.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Walter Boston watches the lights go on across his monitor.
Four cars, eight cars, a dozen. They are swarming the area in hot
pursuit.</LD>
<LD>   The chase ends quickly on this night. The driver is forced off the
road. According to police, he is reaching beneath his seat for a gun
when they open fire. Phillip Aguilar is dead at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   A paw is tattooed on Aguilar's body, a sign of membership in
Fresno's largest gang, the Bulldogs. The next morning, Mayor Alan
Autry says the ending might have been the same without the new
crackdown, but maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first thing I thought about," he said. "Those extra
cars have to help. The odds that a patrol car is somewhere in the
area of a crime are greatly increased these days. It's hard to beat
more bodies on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Fresno's gang crackdown began in January. It followed 40 murders
in 2001, a 67% increase over the previous year. Nine of those were
gang-related. And already there had been seven homicides in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   A jewelry store owner was shot to death Jan. 8 during a robbery in
the middle of downtown--an area Autry is determined to revitalize.</TE>
<TE>   That is when the mayor and Police Chief Jerry Dyer decided a
massive show of force was needed, and they would more than triple the
size of Fresno's anti-gang forces.</TE>
<TE>   Police and community leaders say the city's gang problems are
growing more serious every year. Police estimate that there are more
than 500 gangs in Fresno, with 12,000 members. Police say the
Bulldogs alone have several thousand members.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Southern California gangs have been moving into Fresno,
a trend that has triggered new turf battles. And many gang members
previously imprisoned are back on the streets, hardened.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, police and community leaders continue to fight the use
of methamphetamine and other drugs that they say fuels much of the
gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   Debate Over How to Deal With Gangs</TE>
<TE>   The only major area of debate is how to deal with the gangs.
Community leaders say the city needs to throw more social and
educational resources into the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The crackdown is a good thing as far as it goes, but it is just a
Band-Aid," said Frank Muna, a lawyer who once served on the city's
Human Rights Commission. "What's going on now is for the press, so
everybody can feel safe. But it's only a temporary solution."</TE>
<TE>   Before January, Fresno had a 30-member Multi-Agency Gang
Enforcement Consortium, with officers from the police, Sheriff's
Department, district attorney's office and California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when homeland defense was becoming a new priority
for many law enforcement agencies, the decision was made to add 100
more officers to the unit. About 70 came on loan from the 704-officer
Fresno Police Department, the rest from other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeland defense was a question for us," Autry said. "How do you
fight terrorism from abroad and our own home-grown terrorists: the
gang members and the drug dealers?"</TE>
<TE>   He said there should be a good sense of how the newly fortified
anti-gang effort is working by the end of this month. But statistics
already reflect improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno Police Lt. Greg Coleman and California Highway Patrol Capt.
Cal Minor are two of the top commanders of the anti-gang force. They
say gang-related felony arrests jumped from 41 in December to 212 in
January. Misdemeanor arrests climbed from 38 to 446. And there were
no gang killings during that time.</TE>
<TE>   High Police Visibility Having an Impact</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted very high visibility in the high-crime areas, and that
is working," Coleman said. "Realistically, everybody knows you can't
do something like this forever. But we are determined to do it as
long as necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Although there are black, Asian and white skinhead gangs, Latino
gangs are by far the city's largest. The half a dozen Latino
activists who gathered last week to discuss the issue agreed that the
crackdown has, at least temporarily, helped curb gang violence. But
gangs may simply lie low until the crackdown inevitably ends, they
said. Long-term solutions will require some major shifts in city
spending priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are doing a good job right now," said Alfonso
Hernandez, director of the city's Chicano Youth Center. "But what
really happens with something like this is that the police build up
their stats to show how they need more police.</TE>
<TE>   "What about more programs for education?" Hernandez asked. "People
in Fresno love the Boys Clubs and the Boy Scouts. But they don't go
into the barrios because they are scared."</TE>
<TE>   Autry said that's an impression he is determined to change. With
100 extra police on the streets, an extra 20 to 30 patrol cars out
every night, the message is being delivered that the city will not be
terrorized by gangs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a growing city, and right now we are pouring millions and
millions of dollars into sprucing this city up," he said. "We have to
show people that this is a safe city, and you can bet we will."</TE>

<HD>Campaign Puts a Friendship Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Election: Strains are becoming a rift as the gloves come
off between Riordan and Simon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the foyer of St. Monica's church is a plaque listing financier
Bill Simon Jr. and his wife as "Archangels" for their contributions
to the Santa Monica parish.</LD>
<LD>   The stone church itself was rebuilt after the Northridge
earthquake partly with money from the pocket of Richard Riordan, who
then was mayor of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Simon and Riordan, friends and former political allies, share a
devotion to their parish and much more. But today, the vicissitudes
of the Republican gubernatorial campaign have pushed the two wealthy,
Westside Catholic businessmen and philanthropists to spend the final
days of the campaign pointing out each other's weaknesses.</LD>
<TE>   Where once Riordan urged Simon to run, now he questions his
fitness for office; where once Simon, 50, expressed admiration for
Riordan, 71, now he suggests that the former mayor is ambivalent
about tax hikes. Where once they greeted one another with hugs, now
they only exchange pleasantries when they meet on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   The tension continued Sunday. In response to reporters' questions
about his attacks on his friend, Riordan said voters deserved to know
"what kind of person he [Simon] is." For his part, Simon said he was
"saddened" by an attack ad Riordan is airing.</TE>
<TE>   It is a bitter turn to the two men's relationship, nurtured in the
more dignified business of high-end philanthropy, tested in the
rough-and-tumble of a political campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The awkwardness was apparent at St. Monica's Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proud of both of them," Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson said tersely
about the candidates. Asked about their squabble, the pastor replied:
"I don't want to talk about that."</TE>
<TE>   As Simon and Riordan enter the final full week of the Republican
campaign, each blames the other for straining the friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan notes that Simon was the first to be critical when he
attacked Riordan's tax record during a debate at the GOP convention
in San Jose earlier this month. "He started some ... negativism on me
at the convention, distorting my record," Riordan said Sunday. "I
felt people should know what kind of person he is."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Simon notes that the former mayor encouraged him to
run and has praised him before. "I don't think it's any coincidence,"
Simon said. "I guess you could reasonably ask the question, 'What's
changed in the past 10 days other than a narrowing in Dick's lead?'"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon used to cross paths in more pleasant
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The two men move through similar social circles and got to know
each other through fund-raising for their church. Both run
philanthropic foundations. Simon's wife, Cynthia, is on the board of
LA's BEST, an after-school program that Riordan promoted when he was
mayor. Riordan's home is in Brentwood; Simon's in nearby Pacific
Palisades. Both have long vacationed in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Riordan and Simon struck up a friendship, though
the former mayor's campaign says it is a casual one and that the two
do not socialize regularly.</TE>
<TE>   As the Simon campaign tells it, Riordan entered politics first,
and he encouraged Simon to get involved in his own campaigns. Simon
gave money to Riordan's effort to oust members of the Los Angeles
school board, his campaign said. At the former mayor's urging, Simon
hosted a fund-raiser at his own home for Riordan's handpicked
successor as mayor, Steve Soboroff.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's campaign says he does not recall the fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan was also one of the various Republican luminaries who
urged Simon to run for governor. Even though the former mayor's name
was being mentioned as a possible GOP contender, Riordan squired
Simon about town, introducing him and another possible
candidate--actor and fellow St. Monica parishioner Arnold
Schwarzenegger--to various power brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon began campaigning early last year. And even then, Riordan
continued to give input, recommending that his friend hire the woman
who ultimately became the press secretary of the former mayor's own
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But then Riordan chose to enter the race himself.</TE>
<TE>   The two friends spoke occasionally even after Riordan announced
his candidacy. And while their aides occasionally sniped at each
other, the candidates resolutely would not. Riordan was considered
the front-runner and made a point of never mentioning Simon or Bill
Jones, who has raised less money than the two Los Angeles
millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   At First, Friends Refuse Negative Comments</TE>
<TE>   Simon took a similar tack, refusing to attack his friend despite
goading by reporters and some of his own campaign staff, though
strategist Sal Russo says the plan was always to hold off on
criticizing Riordan until closer to election day.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's initial reluctance to go after his friend helped spur Gov.
Gray Davis to launch a stinging preemptive advertising onslaught
against Riordan. The governor's advisors said they could not afford
to let Riordan coast through the primary.</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan's support was tested by the Davis onslaught, some Simon
backers helped engineer the former mayor's nasty reception at the
Republican convention in San Jose. They slipped anti-Riordan fliers
under candidates' doors at the convention hotel and arranged for a
college Republican to dress in a rhino outfit--a reference to the
view among some activists that Riordan, who has supported Democrats
in his career, is a "Republican In Name Only."</TE>
<TE>   It was at a debate there that Simon challenged Riordan's record on
taxes, leading the former mayor to angrily upbraid his friend,
saying:</TE>
<TE>   "You and I belong to the same church ... you have to be ashamed at
the folklore that came out of your mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Things have gone downhill ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Simon no longer shies away from criticizing Riordan on the trail.
Last week, Riordan hit his friend with an ad highlighting Simon's
failure to vote in several elections and criticizing Simon's business
acumen.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Riordan's ad said Simon had invested in a
savings and loan that ultimately cost the taxpayers $92 million. To
illustrate that investment, the ad uses an image of a headline from
The Times referring to the "Simon-led" bank. That headline actually
referred to Simon's father, who was running the family investment
firm with his sons at the time. The younger Simon was in charge of
monitoring the S&amp;L investment.</TE>
<TE>   Simon cited that clip Sunday when he said he was "disappointed" at
the attack. "There were certain elements about it that made me say,
'Geez, that's not true,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign had long promised it would air a negative spot
on Riordan, and hit back the next day with an ad in which Simon
asserts Riordan is "ashamed to be a Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns have prepared more of the same, and could roll them
out in the days between now and March 5.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the two men had slightly different takes on whether
their friendship would survive the primary. Simon said he expected
the two will remain friends.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan laughed when he was asked the question. "In politics," he
said, "you just have to wait until after the election and ask then."</TE>

<HD>Haitians in L.A. Spread Out and Blend In</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Many of the 10,000 who live in the area resist
efforts to form a community, clinging instead to class divisions from
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rony St. Urbain and his family drive 45 minutes from Chatsworth to
Eagle Rock three times a week to attend French-speaking Jehovah's
Witnesses services.</LD>
<LD>   St. Urbain and 10,000 other Haitian immigrants in Los Angeles are
used to traveling long distances to get together.</LD>
<LD>   Tired of being associated with so-called boat people and the
practice of voodoo, many Haitians in Southern California have
resisted attempts to organize as a community, choosing instead to
blend in across the region.</LD>
<TE>   "They're trying to get away from community," said Joseph Kesner,
53, a Haitian who moved to Los Angeles from Miami in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Yolette Dauphin, president and founder of the newly formed Haiti
America Society, said most Haitians in Los Angeles want to avoid the
stigma that usually comes with the formation of a new immigrant
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "What do they call us in those places?" said Dauphin, speaking of
Miami, home to the largest number of Haitians outside Haiti. "They
call us 'boats.' We are not boats. We are professionals,
businesspeople."</TE>
<TE>   Dauphin of Los Feliz said she created the Haiti America Society to
bridge Haitians and Americans. One of her goals is to erase the myth
that Haitians are poor, uneducated refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to unify the community have failed because most Haitians
are seeking to define themselves as members of the American middle
class without tying themselves to the abject poverty and political
instability of their homeland, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Class Divisions Continue to Divide Immigrants</TE>
<TE>   Alex Stepick, director of the immigration and ethnicity institute
at Florida International University in Miami, says the lack of
solidarity among Haitian Americans on the West Coast may come from
the class divisions that exist in Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary divisions are of the lighter-skinned folks against
the other people; people with wealth and people without it," said
Stepick, author of "Pride Against Prejudice: Haitians in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   "Even in Miami, there are quite a number of Haitians who refuse to
identify [themselves] as Haitian because they don't want to be
associated with refugees or boat people," Stepick said. "The
difference in a place like Miami and New York is you have enough of
those other Haitians who identify with one another and who can create
organizations. In areas with newer settlements, you don't have enough
other people to form Haitian organizations or a sense of community."</TE>
<TE>   In almost a decade, the number of Haitians in the Los Angeles area
has doubled from 5,000 to 10,000, activists say. From 1957 to 1971,
during the dictatorship of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, many of the
Caribbean nation's elite fled to Montreal and New York City. Over the
years, Canada has become a popular destination because educated
Haitians speak French, as well as Kreyol, or Haitian Creole, said
Eveline Dalencour, public affairs agent at the Canadian Embassy in
Port-au-Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Many Refugees Fled After 1991 Coup</TE>
<TE>   The most recent influx of Haitian refugees to the United States
occurred after the 1991 military coup, which ousted the nation's
first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. His
support rested primarily with the poor, who fled the nation in boats
heading to the Bahamas and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1988 and 1994, Catholic Charities relocated about 1,000
newly arrived Haitian immigrants to Los Angeles, said Loc Nguyen,
director of the group's immigration and refugee department.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority of Haitians in Southern California are not newly
arrived immigrants. For instance, author and art collector Carine
Fabius, 45, has been in the country for many years, Dauphin said.</TE>
<TE>   Born into a prominent mulatto family in Port-au-Prince that fled
Haiti in 1964, Fabius moved to Los Angeles from Miami in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Her home in Hollywood doubles as a Caribbean and Latin art gallery
with its large collection of Haitian artwork. Statues and paintings,
including canvases painted with dark-brown and black figures, animals
in the wild and brightly colored landscapes, adorn almost every
corner of the house. The most prominent piece, dominating a dining
room wall, is an abstract painting of Erzuli, love goddess of Haitian
voodoo.</TE>
<TE>   Fabius said she had no idea how many Haitians lived in Los Angeles
until she opened Galerie Lakaye in Hollywood 11 years ago with her
French-born husband, Pascal Giacomini.</TE>
<TE>   "Haitian people are so spread out here," said Giacomini, 48. "It's
not like in other cities where you can point to a place where
Haitians live. They say there are 10,000 here, but that's 10,000 in
the entire region."</TE>
<TE>   Haitian Seeks Others Scattered in Area</TE>
<TE>   St. Urbain, who moved to California in 1996 to join his wife,
Rolande, said he has been devoting much of his spare time to seeking
out Haitians scattered throughout the San Fernando Valley to preach
to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little difficult finding not only people who speak French,
but Haitian people," said St. Urbain, 42. "You go to a house because
the person's last name looks French, but until you get there, you
never know what they are."</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, said Los Angeles businessman Jordan Salomon,
efforts to organize Haitians in the Southland will be defeated by
class differences.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people that want to do something, but the question is, who
will follow?" said Salomon, 32, of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   A Haitian Jew who grew up in Canada, Salomon was an intelligence
advisor to Aristide before the 1991 coup. The great-grandson of
one-time Haitian President Lysius Felicite Salomon, who ruled Haiti
for nine years until he was overthrown in 1988, Salomon said he plans
to return to Haiti in a decade to run for public office.</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to form a Haitian cultural or political
organization in Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where would you put that group?" he said. "In Inglewood? In
South-Central? Haitians who live in Pasadena or Beverly Hills would
refuse to go to South-Central to associate with people who don't have
the same financial base. In Haiti, they would be of a different
class."</TE>

<HD>H. Weisberg, 88; Critic of JFK Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold Weisberg, a prolific author and persistent critic of the
official report that found a lone gunman responsible for the death of
President John F. Kennedy and who was often dubbed the dean of
assassination researchers, died Thursday at his home in Frederick,
Md. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Weisberg, who had a kidney ailment and sepsis, died of
cardiovascular disease.</LD>
<LD>   His career as the writer of about 10 published and roughly 35
unpublished books on the murders of Kennedy and the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. came last in a series of endeavors.</LD>
<TE>   Weisberg had been a journalist, a labor investigator for the
then-Progressive Party's Sen. Robert M. La Follette Jr. of Wisconsin,
an investigator for a World War II spy agency, a State Department
intelligence analyst and a prize-winning poultry farmer in Montgomery
County, Md.</TE>
<TE>   In an obsession that kept him in financial hardship for the last
35 years, Weisberg collected in his home more than 250,000 government
papers on the Kennedy assassination in 1963 and scoured millions more
at the National Archives. In 1965, he produced one of the earliest
books about the president's death.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg also became a leading authority on the King murder in
1968 and was an investigator on behalf of the late James Earl Ray,
who pleaded guilty to the crime but later recanted his story.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg came to believe neither Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused
Kennedy gunman, nor Ray was responsible for the deaths of the
prominent leaders. He focused on what he considered the inadequacies
of the government investigations, specifically an improper probe of
the available evidence. But for all his work, he never found a
definitive answer.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg detested many other students of conspiracy, the foremost
being filmmaker Oliver Stone, whose 1991 "JFK" spun all kinds of
theories about the president's death.</TE>
<TE>   "To do a mishmash like this is out of love for the victim and
respect for history?" Weisberg told the Washington Post. "I think
people who sell sex have more principle."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Weisberg presented information that he gleaned from
government investigative papers in an often dry manner--even if that
belied his cover tag lines promising "the end of the
cover-up--official lies exposed. Never such an investigation--never
such evidence!"</TE>
<TE>   His first literary success was a self-published work titled
"Whitewash: The Report on the Warren Report" (1965). After being
turned down by several publishers, he publicized the book himself and
sold more than 30,000 copies. Dell then published it and a follow-up,
"Whitewash II: The FBI-Secret Service Cover-Up" (both 1966).</TE>
<TE>   Other books followed, including "Oswald in New Orleans: Case of
Conspiracy with the CIA" (1967), "Martin Luther King: The
Assassination" (1993) and "Case Open: The Unanswered JFK
Assassination Questions" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg, a Philadelphia native, grew up in Wilmington, Del., the
son of Russian Jewish immigrants. He attended the University of
Delaware and then wrote articles for the Wilmington Morning News and
the Sunday supplement of the Philadelphia Ledger.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s, he worked for La Follette, who headed a special
Senate investigating committee commonly called the La Follette Civil
Liberties Committee. Weisberg was sent to look at labor-rights
violations in Harlan County, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in the Army and the Office of
Strategic Services. He joined the State Department after the war, but
left in the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg turned to farm life near Hyattsville with his wife, and
they won prizes for their poultry. They also were early participants
in a Peace Corps program called "Geese for Peace," in which the birds
were shipped overseas to be raised in poverty-stricken countries. He
turned to writing full time after giving up farm life in the
mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Weisberg's fascination with the Kennedy death was
solidified. In September 1964, the President's Commission on the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy--known as the Warren
Commission--concluded that Oswald was solely responsible for
Kennedy's death.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg immediately set to work on "Whitewash." His examination
of the report and its appendices showed what he considered
"superficial and immature" research into the possibility of a
conspiracy or a different assassin.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg, friends said, had a photographic memory and a
single-minded focus on his work that kept him occupied seven days a
week. He once told the Washington Post that he worried he would be
judged long after his death as "a goddamn fool or Don Quixote."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Lillian Stone Weisberg, whom he
married in 1939; and two sisters.</TE>

<HD>Officers Serve to Protect Gang Prevention Program</HD>
<DH>Volunteers: Members of two LAPD Valley divisions will wait
tables at two restaurants Tuesday to raise funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With every enchilada and margarita Officer Richard Stocks serves
Tuesday, his shoulders will relax a little bit more.</LD>
<LD>   For nine hours, he and 65 other volunteers from the Los Angeles
Police Department's Foothill and Van Nuys divisions will take over
for the regular servers at two San Fernando Valley restaurants for
the purpose of raising $5,000 for the LAPD-sponsored gang-prevention
program Jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   With the cancellation last summer of the program's major
money-making event--an outdoor Latino music festival that had
generated as much as $100,000--program founder Stocks and other
officers will be clearing tables to earn tips.</LD>
<TE>   A combination of government grants, corporate sponsorships and
charity events normally powers Jeopardy programs at the Foothill and
Van Nuys divisions, which operate on a $450,000 budget.</TE>
<TE>   The program offers athletic training, field trips, counseling and
parenting classes for as many as 150 families.</TE>
<TE>   With less funds to work with this year, the Foothill division's
Jeopardy program only enrolled 70 families--down from the usual
120--to maintain the same level of activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing for the kids has been lost with the lack of funding,"
Stocks said. "We just haven't been able to serve as many people."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Hispanic Broadcasting Corp., the sponsor of the
summer concert that benefited the Jeopardy Program, said they
canceled the event so it could be revamped with more family-oriented
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation, which owns the three Los Angeles-area radio
stations that recruit talent for the show, is working on its 2002
promotions calendar and hopes to include an event benefiting
Jeopardy, said Luis Hernandez, the business' Los Angeles marketing
and promotions director.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks isn't waiting for another concert to supplement Jeopardy's
funding. Plans are in the works for a summer motorcycle fund-raiser
in the spirit of the Love Ride, an annual trek between Glendale and
Castaic Lake that raises about $1 million for various charities.</TE>
<TE>   The vast array of other community-based programs for at-risk
children make it difficult for each one to garner funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's running after the same dollar," said Jules Baker,
president of the Jeopardy foundation. "Most of the people who can
afford to give don't live in gang-affected neighborhoods, so they
don't understand the scope of the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Jeopardy's tutoring, sports and enrichment programs provide a
haven for children who are likely to join gangs, Stocks said. In
Jeopardy, children can get help with homework or even go skydiving or
get boxing lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking kids who have never been to the beach on deep-sea
fishing trips," said William "Blinky" Rodriguez, a longtime northeast
Valley community activist. "Jeopardy exposes kids to things people in
more affluent communities take for granted."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Stock and his Foothill crew will work at Acapulco's at
8431 Sunland Blvd. in Sun Valley from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., while about
25 other officers from the Van Nuys Division will work at Lulu's
Restaurant, at 16900 Roscoe Blvd. in Van Nuys.</TE>

<HD>Redistricting Alters Political Landscape for Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Congress: The erasure of the 38th District means the city
could be represented by nonresidents for the first time in 10 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's new congressional district boundaries are spelling big
changes for Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Its port--a major economic engine for the region--and most of its
predominantly white, affluent neighborhoods have been sliced from the
rest of the city and added to a new district drawn to favor Orange
County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican. And most of the rest of
the city--ethnically diverse and poorer--has been included in the
district of Carson-based Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald, a Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   With the impending retirement of maverick Republican Rep. Stephen
Horn, whose 38th District was obliterated by political map makers,
the state's fifth-largest city probably will be without one of its
own in Congress for the first time in a decade.</LD>
<TE>   Many observers saw potential troubles in the city's bifurcation
and loss of a hometown representative. There was a brief but mostly
futile appeal last summer to the Democrat-dominated Legislature,
which redrew the state's congressional, state Senate and Assembly
district boundaries. The map makers responded by producing a more
favorable reworking of the Senate district lines but stood firm on
congressional boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the March 5 primary brings the new political landscape
into sharper focus, there is much discussion among civic leaders
about how to make the best of a less than ideal situation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not overall a good picture for Long Beach. The city will
have a lower profile, a little less awareness in Washington," said
Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Long Beach was divided up to serve other political purposes,"
Schmidt said.</TE>
<TE>   Those purposes involved producing a redistricting plan aimed at
giving nearly all 52 California incumbents "safe" seats from which to
run for reelection. With the agreement of the state leaders of both
parties, Horn's district was carved up to help accomplish this. In
addition to using parts of the district to shore up Rohrabacher and
Millender-McDonald, map makers used a portion to help form the only
added district, engineered to elect a Latino Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Is Unconcerned</TE>
<TE>   Some Long Beach leaders, such as Mayor Beverly O'Neill, downplay
the ramifications of the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are sorry to see the district dissolved, but I
don't see any concern" about the two incumbents who are widely
expected to win the local congressional races, O'Neill said of
Millender-McDonald and Rohrabacher. "They are good, energetic people,
and they are not strangers to Long Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Millender-McDonald, a former Carson city councilwoman and state
Assembly member, has represented an eastern section of Long Beach
since winning her congressional seat in a crowded special election in
March 1996. Rohrabacher, of Huntington Beach, represented the port
and western parts of Long Beach when he was first elected in 1988
until district boundaries changed in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Gordon, president and chief executive of the Long Beach Area
Chamber of Commerce, said many in the business community, initially
disappointed with the imminent loss of Horn, are now focusing on
building good working relationships with Millender-McDonald and
Rohrabacher.</TE>
<TE>   "Things change and politicians move on," Gordon said. "It is
really incumbent on us to work really hard to educate our leaders" on
issues, especially regarding the port and its importance to the
Southern California economy. He added that chamber leaders have met
with Rohrabacher and are trying to schedule a reception for
Millender-McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Millender-McDonald, whose new district includes nearly 80% of Long
Beach, said she spends considerable time in town when she returns to
the district each weekend from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm amused by that whole notion that I have a newfound territory.
I already am the representative for part of Long Beach, and I do not
bifurcate the city," Millender-McDonald said. "Whatever funding and
other resources come into the city, that's for the whole city."</TE>
<TE>   Despite having an opponent from Long Beach in the March 5 primary,
Millender-McDonald said, she does not anticipate running an expensive
reelection campaign and has yet to open a campaign headquarters; much
of the money she is raising will go to help Democratic women
candidates across the nation, and she expects to reserve just enough
for a couple of campaign mailers for herself, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to keep in touch with my constituents, and I come in
regularly to talk about issues," said Millender-McDonald. She noted
that she has worked with Horn to secure funding for projects
important to Long Beach, including the Alameda Corridor--a high-speed
rail-and-truck line between the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles
and a freight transfer station south of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Strong Edge for Democrats</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hold such a strong edge over Republicans--63% to 18%--in
the newly drawn 37th District that victory in the upcoming Democratic
primary is tantamount to winning the seat in November. Democratic
leaders last year cast about for a Long Beach-based elected official
to take on Millender-McDonald in the primary but found no one willing
to challenge an incumbent, although more than half the voters in the
new district live in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Millender-McDonald's only primary challenger is community
college political science instructor Peter Mathews, who ran several
times in Horn's district and who cites his longtime ties to Long
Beach as a reason he can win. He has been lining up endorsements in
Carson and Compton and challenging Millender-McDonald to debates (she
has so far declined).</TE>
<TE>   But insiders said Mathews has undermined his own credibility by
running unsuccessfully so often, and they don't give him much of a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Faces Uphill Battle</TE>
<TE>   In November, Rohrabacher, who is unopposed in the new 46th
District's Republican primary, will face Democrat Gerrie Schipske, a
Long Beach nurse-practitioner, attorney and college instructor who
came very close to defeating Horn in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Schipske is finding it hard to stir interest--and raise
money--in her campaign for the new district, which runs from the
Palos Verdes Peninsula to Costa Mesa. Republicans hold a 48%-33%
registration edge. Schipske contends that the district is more
moderate than the conservative Rohrabacher and sees an opportunity in
the 14% of the district's registered voters who are independent, but
she acknowledges that her race is a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like starting all over again," Schipske, the only Democrat
on the primary ballot, said of her efforts to interest donors and
party leaders in her race.</TE>
<TE>   Like other insiders, Long Beach-based political consultant Jeffrey
Adler believes that the city "loses a lot" in the redistricting and
will probably elect a local to Congress again one day, perhaps when
Millender-McDonald steps down.</TE>
<TE>   "Across the board, across the spectrum, Republicans and Democrats
alike agree that Long Beach would be best served by a district that
was inclusive" of most of the city's neighborhoods and its port,
Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I am sure that will remain on the agenda for the next 10
years," he said, when districts are again redrawn.</TE>
<TE>   Adler added, "In the Long Beach political lexicon, reunifying the
city is election reform."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a plain house on an ordinary street near LAX, but Paul and
Michele Carll never wished for anything grand. Just a modest home in
which to raise back-to-back blessings--one set of 4-year-old
triplets, and one set of 4-week-old twins.</LD>
<LD>   This is a morning of soft white Westside light, the sun and sea
working it out just right, and inside the house Paul is holding one
slumbering twin and Michele the other as they talk about how it went
wrong. How, after a long haul up the hill, they are in free-fall,
plunging through the floor of the middle class.</LD>
<LD>   "We did not live high on the hog," says Michele, 33, who had been
an account manager for a talent agency but put her career on hold
with the triplets. "We put money aside for the future, for the kids,
and for this house. The house is our nest egg, and it could be gone
in a matter of months."</LD>
<TE>   This story is not just about the Carlls, but about a time in which
ordinary people wonder what is left to trust. A time in which it's
uncomfortably easy to see ourselves sitting next to the Carlls.</TE>
<TE>   Paul says he was assured that his job as a computer systems
manager at Teleflora, an international flower delivery company, was
secure despite some restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You know I have triplets, with twins on the way. I have
a mortgage, a car payment.' They constantly reassured me."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes Sept. 11, the end of all guarantees, and here are Paul
and Michele wondering about the world they're bringing their children
into. The very next day, Paul, 37, gets called in by the human
resources boss and finds out he's got problems he hadn't imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my job," he told Michele by phone.</TE>
<TE>   The severance deal was a few months' pay and about two weeks of
medical coverage. Carll had only been there 15 months, Teleflora
having flattered him away from a medical publishing company.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of empathy for Paul and his situation," says Mike
Weinman, Teleflora's chief operating officer. "One of the most
difficult things you do as a manager is terminate an employee."</TE>
<TE>   Weinman says Paul did his job just fine, but Teleflora merged with
another company and he became redundant. He says no one gave him any
guarantees, but Paul insists it was Weinman himself who told him he
was safe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," says Paul, who immediately began working the
Internet, trolling for work, as Michele began pleading with Teleflora
to have a heart and extend their medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "After I called numerous times, begging and in tears, they finally
relented," she says, and agreed to cover the Carlls through the birth
of the twins.</TE>
<TE>   It was a life saver. Michele became anemic, delivered early, and
lost so much blood she needed two transfusions. She's still
recovering, but the insurance runs out on Friday, and either the
Carlls come up with $700 a month or they go without.</TE>
<TE>   Paul, meanwhile, has sent out more than 10,000 resumes, most of
them by e-mail, but it has been like pointing a flashlight into the
night sky. The tech field is so flooded by the dot.com crash, he's up
against bigger resumes for a smattering of jobs that pay half of what
he made. He's looked beyond tech, but no luck there, either. And the
free-fall continues.</TE>
<TE>   They switched the triplets from private school to public.</TE>
<TE>   They let the housekeeper go.</TE>
<TE>   They maxed out the credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   They use government coupons at Ralphs.</TE>
<TE>   They're selling one of the two cars.</TE>
<TE>   They're two mortgage payments away from flat broke.</TE>
<TE>   Triplets and twins, and no job, Paul says with a chortle he calls
the laughter of the insane. He's considered delivering pizza or
knocking on the door at Target, but they'd lose the house, so he's
trying to hold out for something more substantial. They bought this
place only 18 months ago, having rented it first while squirreling
away the down payment.</TE>
<TE>   They sit in the family room now, which they had just expanded to
make room for five little ones, cradling twins no bigger than loaves
of bread. Photos of the triplets are everywhere, filling the room
with bright-eyed innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a case of woe is me," says Paul, who sits in a rocking
chair with Colin held against him. "You can drive within a one-mile
radius of here and find a lot of families far more destitute than we
are. And for every negative in this, there are 10 positives.
Everyone's healthy, and I'm able to be home and help my wife and my
kids."</TE>
<TE>   "We have each other," says Michele, who holds Ava-Grace and plans
to look for a job once she recovers from the complications of
delivery. "And we're best friends. All we want is a 9-to-5 job with
company picnics. We just want normal."</TE>
<TE>   But does normal still exist, they wonder, or is it only a quaint
reverie? They see Enron or Global Crossing execs walk away with sacks
of money while the dreams of their duped middle-class employees and
investors go up in smoke. They hear a transformer blow out on the
street and worry that LAX is under attack.</TE>
<TE>   There are no promises now, Paul says. "But you know what you can
believe in?" he says, speaking over the murmur of his own doubts and
fears. "Your family, your faith, and your abilities. I'll find
something and work my way back up. We're not looking for any
handouts."</TE>
<TE>   Michele's eyes fill. When Paul takes a break from diapers and
shuttling the triplets around town, she sometimes finds him staring
at nothing, and her heart aches. Often, in the middle of the night,
she finds him draped in a blue glow, scanning the World Wide Web for
a turn of fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when he was unaware, Michele wrote a long e-mail to this
newspaper. Father of the year, she called him. Husband of the year,
too. Maybe some company will read about "this extraordinary man and
his talents," she wrote. Maybe someone will give him a chance.</TE>

<HD>Attorneys in Dog-Mauling Case Deploy Widely Different
Styles</HD>
<DH>Profiles: One defender is passionate, the other
dispassionate. The prosecutors are aggressive, methodical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense attorney Nedra Ruiz's unconventional theatrics took center
stage during the first week in the trial of a San Francisco couple
charged with the fatal dog mauling of their neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   She imitated a dog when asking a witness how tall the animal stood
on its hind legs. She waved her arms and raised her voice to
emphasize questions.</LD>
<LD>   And, surprising spectators and prompting the judge to stand for a
better view, she dropped down on the courtroom floor and tearfully
reenacted the fatal attack during her opening statement.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Hotchkiss, on the other hand, quietly asked questions on
behalf of his own client and frequently chose not to cross-examine
witnesses at all. His opening statement was simple and succinct,
lasting just 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Their respective clients, Marjorie Knoller, 46, and Robert Noel,
60, are charged with involuntary manslaughter in the January 2001 dog
mauling of Diane Whipple outside her San Francisco apartment door.
Knoller also faces a second-degree murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys' courtroom demeanors contrast sharply, and
their personalities appear to parallel their strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the sun and the moon," said defense attorney J. Tony
Serra, who works with Ruiz. "They both go around the Earth. But one
is a little bit brighter and a little bit hotter than the other."</TE>
<TE>   As the case resumes today, Ruiz will continue to argue that her
client, Knoller, tried to save Whipple's life by hurling her body on
top of her neighbor. Hotchkiss' defense is that Noel was not at the
apartment during the attack and therefore can't be blamed.</TE>
<TE>   The two prosecutors in the case, James Hammer and Kimberly
Guilfoyle Newsom, have similarly aggressive, methodical styles.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer, a clean-cut attorney with a broad smile, is a former
Jesuit who worked as a public defender and a professor before
deciding on a career as a prosecutor. Guilfoyle Newsom, who modeled
lingerie and sweaters to pay for law school, did a four-year stint as
a Los Angeles prosecutor and then returned to her hometown of San
Francisco to try felony cases.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors maintain that the defendants knew that their
massive Presa Canario dogs, weighing more than 100 pounds each, were
dangerous, and that they didn't do anything to prevent Whipple's
death.</TE>
<TE>   All four attorneys live and practice in the Bay Area, but have
made Los Angeles their temporary home during the trial, which was
moved because of publicity in San Francisco. They are trying to go
home on weekends, but their workload makes that difficult during a
trial that could last eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in San Rafael, Ruiz, 53, graduated in 1976 from Hastings
College of the Law in San Francisco and started her career doing
criminal defense work for the poor at a community center. She married
defense attorney Laurence Lichter, now a partner at Serra's San
Francisco firm, and had three children. Ruiz eventually joined the
firm herself, doing appellate work and fighting for the
decriminalization of prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   When Knoller dumped her public defender and asked Serra to
represent her, he declined because he was busy representing Sara Jane
Olson, who recently was convicted of attempting to bomb Los Angeles
Police Department cars in 1975. Serra referred Knoller to Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Serra said that Ruiz is a passionate attorney and that her
performance in court is an effective way to make an emotional impact
on the jurors. "To brand your case with a real hot iron is the real
way to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruiz's outspoken demeanor already has caused a stir a few
times. A judge held her in contempt for violating a gag order when
she talked to reporters after a hearing. Ruiz also accused Hammer in
open court of lying, but later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Kicking the Jury Box</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who is being paid by Knoller's parents, said she is trying
to bring the case to life in a forceful, dramatic way. During opening
statements, she kicked the jury box repeatedly and called one of the
dogs a "berserk beast."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the way I am," she said. "I have to present every facet
of my client's case to the best of my ability. If that involves ...
getting on the floor, then that's what I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss has a different style.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with his low-key personality and constant effort to
steer clear of publicity, the 67-year-old attorney would only provide
information on his background for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss speaks matter-of-factly and always appears composed. He
grew up in Kansas and attended Washburn University School of Law in
Topeka. For more than 30 years, Hotchkiss has worked as a public
defender, both in Riverside and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   One of his most publicized cases was that of a Navy airman
convicted of killing a San Francisco community activist despite
Hotchkiss' argument that his client acted in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss, a divorced father with one son, started his own
criminal defense practice in San Francisco in 1992. He was appointed
by the court to defend Noel in April 2001, and has done everything
possible to separate his client from Whipple's death.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Stone, a San Francisco attorney who has worked with both
defense lawyers, called Hotchkiss smart and cerebral. "He's very
calm," Stone said. "I don't recall him ever appearing angry."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer may have the most diverse background of any of the four.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer, the son of a city bus driver and a teacher's aid, worked
as a reserve police officer before deciding on a career in law. But
less than two years after graduating from Hastings, he decided to
become a Jesuit priest. He fed the poor in Mexico and taught Catholic
school in Watts and law school in Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   While at the law school, Hammer started a community legal center
for San Jose day laborers, which he considers "the proudest
achievement of my life."</TE>
<TE>   "The measure of my life is how I reach out to the least
fortunate," said Hammer, 40, who hikes and plays guitar in his free
time.</TE>
<TE>   The executive director of the San Jose center, Margaret Stevenson,
said Hammer rolled up his sleeves and fearlessly took on the
challenge. "What Jim had done, sort of by the seat of his pants, was
develop ways for law students to work as advocates in social
justice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1995, at the same time he told his family he was gay,
Hammer left the Jesuits and returned to the courtroom, prosecuting
cases in Santa Clara and then San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has tried only a few murder cases, Hammer was recently
promoted to the head of the homicide division. Hammer said he takes
his inspiration from crime victims, and tries to boil each case down
to its bones and "weave it into a story so the jurors can
understand."</TE>
<TE>   His partner in the case, Guilfoyle Newsom, 32, is a San Francisco
native who is half Puerto Rican and half Irish. She started her law
career interning at the district attorney's office near her college,
UC Davis. She graduated from the University of San Francisco School
of Law in 1994, and taught school briefly before taking a job as a
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   But she and other newcomers lost their jobs in 1996 after the
newly elected top prosecutor, Terence Hallinan, took office. So she
moved to Los Angeles, where she handled arson, sexual assault and
even a few dog-fighting cases.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Kay, who supervised Guilfoyle Newsom when she worked at
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, said defense
lawyers often underestimated her.</TE>
<TE>   "They would see this beautiful woman and they would think for some
reason that she can't be smart too," Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Kay added that Guilfoyle Newsom always prepared meticulously and
made hard-hitting and emotional arguments that reminded him "of a
minister in the pulpit on a Sunday morning."</TE>
<TE>   Returned to San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   She returned to the San Francisco district attorney's office two
years ago and is prosecuting violent felonies and homicides. In
December, she married San Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who is
said to be considering a run for mayor next year.</TE>
<TE>   They celebrated with a lavish black-tie reception at the home of
billionaire Gordon Getty, an event attended by actor Ed Asner, author
Danielle Steel and Mayors Willie and Jerry Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said she doesn't like to focus on her time as a
model, and prefers instead to cite her undefeated felony trial
record.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's what defines me," said Guilfoyle Newsom, who
spends free time doing philanthropic work. "I did that to pay for law
school, but at a certain point you want to move on."</TE>

<HD>Norby Makes a Challenge in 4th District</HD>
<DH>The Fullerton City Councilman says his campaign is based on
personal contact. He wants to stop El Toro airport and move on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A caller apologized to Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby for
bothering him during the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics.
Norby smiled--he'd had no time for TV. He'd spent long hours at his
daily ritual, calling more than 100 absentee voters.</LD>
<LD>   Norby, who is challenging Orange County Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad
on March 5, says he's campaigning the same way he won four council
terms: with as much personal contact as possible.</LD>
<LD>   His message: A plan for an airport at the former El Toro Marine
base is a quagmire that has kept the Board of Supervisors from
focusing on other vital issues. It will stay that way until the
airport issue is dead, Norby theorizes.</LD>
<TE>   And the airport won't die, he says, until someone replaces Coad,
one of a three-member majority backing an international airport at
the 4,700-acre former air station.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, 52, a high school history and government teacher, is almost
an anomaly among North County elected officials for his El Toro
stance. It's made him popular with airport foes in South County, who
have contributed the vast majority of his campaign funds. Some even
put Norby campaign signs in their frontyards, although they can't
vote for him.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, three of his council colleagues endorse Coad.</TE>
<TE>   Said Councilwoman Jan Flory: "In the seven years I've served with
Chris, I haven't found him to be for anything."</TE>
<TE>   Mainly what he's for, Norby insists, is less government--and one
that does better at solving problems it's supposed to address.</TE>
<TE>   Norby first gained attention outside Fullerton in the early 1990s
when he organized Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform to
promote a pamphlet he wrote. The pamphlet, now in its sixth printing,
warns that redevelopment is out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities are put in a position where they literally have to pay
money to big-box retailers to locate there," Norby said. "You can't
blame them, because they know they can get it. But is it really good
policy to allow these guys to shake cities down for money?"</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Norby says, cities should reach agreements--such as one
between Anaheim and Fullerton--that will keep new retail developers
from pitting one city against another.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors don't have control over city issues like
redevelopment. But Norby believes supervisors can promote
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The county board, he contends, "is a pulpit. We can set a tone,
bring people together."</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason he passionately opposes an El Toro airport,
saying it shouldn't be foisted on South County residents who don't
want it. He supports Measure W, an initiative on the March ballot to
rezone the base for other uses, including a park. Coad opposes it.</TE>
<TE>   "This airport issue has split this county between north and
south," Norby said. "I don't have anything against Mission Viejo or
Irvine. I want to be working with those people on issues."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he says, it makes no sense to put a major airport just
seven miles from John Wayne Airport. No two airports in the country
are anywhere near that close, he tells voters.</TE>
<TE>   It was only recently that Norby even considered challenging Coad.
He didn't even live in the 4th District. Nobody in Fullerton did.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, electoral districts--for the county, the state
Legislature and Congress--were realigned based on the 2000 Census.
The 4th district had included Buena Park, Placentia and Anaheim. The
new boundaries eliminated the eastern half of Anaheim (east of the
Orange Freeway), and added all of La Habra and Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Despite initial skepticism from those close to him, Norby said he
was ready to take on the challenge of trying for higher office.</TE>
<TE>   "Take on a wealthy incumbent who has plenty of campaign money? I
told him he was crazy," said his brother, Eric Norby, an attorney who
is among his best friends. "But it became pretty clear that voters
are looking for someone who is issues-oriented. And that's certainly
Chris' strength."</TE>
<TE>   It was his penchant for delving into issues, his love of teaching
government and history, and a deep affection for his city that drew
Norby to local politics in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   A third-generation Fullerton resident of Norwegian heritage,
Norby's campaign headquarters downtown is just a few blocks from the
middle-class home where he was raised. He is quick to point out that
he's the only member of the City Council who lives south of Chapman
Avenue, while the others are from the more affluent north side, which
he believes keeps him in touch with a more diverse group of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Norby has taught at Brea-Olinda High School for 16 years. He first
ran for the City Council in 1984, and has been reelected in
successive campaigns and served two stints as mayor. Should his bid
for the Board of Supervisors fall short, he said, he expects to run
again for council when his term is up in two years.</TE>
<TE>   While Norby can't outspend Coad--she's financing most of her race
with her personal wealth, and may quadruple him in campaign funds--he
said he's raised enough money and has enough volunteers to get his
message out. His goal was to raise $300,000, but his campaign staff
says the total will wind up closer to $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Norby believes Coad also is vulnerable on Measure H, an initiative
passed in November 2000. It forced the county to spend almost all its
$750 million in tobacco settlement money on health care. Coad was
among the majority that wanted to use it to reduce the county's
bankruptcy debt. She also voted with to challenge Measure H in court.
When the board lost there, she wanted to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a Board of Supervisors that's not constantly seeking
litigation," Norby said.</TE>
<TE>   Coad and Norby are both Republicans. Though Coad boasts in
campaign literature that she is a conservative, the two are wide
apart on the political spectrum, with Norby the more conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Some Coad supporters want to depict Norby as more Libertarian than
Republican. They also want to tie him with groups such as the
controversial California Coalition for Immigration Reform, which
opposes most benefits for illegal immigrants and is known for its
divisive language. Its leader, Barbara Coe, has endorsed Norby, but
he doesn't use her endorsement in his campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he promotes his endorsement by the Fullerton Police
Officers Assn., and such former mayors as Bill Thom of Anaheim and
Maria Moreno of Placentia. Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly last week switched
his endorsement from Coad to Norby, saying Coad hasn't done enough to
cooperate with Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, however, has locked up most of the major endorsements, many
of them long before Norby got into the campaign. She's has used it to
her advantage at times.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent joint appearance with Coad, for example, Norby told
voters about his confidence in county Treasurer John M.W. Moorlach.
That gave Coad the chance to respond that Moorlach has endorsed her,
not Norby.</TE>
<TE>   Coad resists too much public criticism of Norby, preferring to
stick with her own positions. But in Coad's view, Norby hasn't paid
his dues, nor has he built support to make himself a viable
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take away all the support he's getting from outside the
district, you really can't find many people behind him," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But Norby said his anti-airport view stems from a greater concern
that important matters were being overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of being deadlocked 3-2--airport, airport, airport--there
are so many issues we can all agree are concerns," he said. "Whether
we live in San Clemente or Stanton."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Harold P. Furth, 72, Princeton astrophysicist who originated the
Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, died of heart failure Thursday in
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Vienna who came to the United States in 1941 and
earned a doctorate from Harvard, Furth worked for the Lawrence
Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) in
Berkeley until 1967, when he joined the U.S. Department of Energy's
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   Furth, who devoted his career to research on controlled fusion and
held 20 patents, in the early 1970s conceived the Tokamak project. It
was the most advanced and highest performance fusion device ever
constructed in the U.S. and produced world record-setting scientific
results before closing down in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   He served on committees and panels for the U.S. Energy and Defense
departments, NASA and the National Academy of Sciences. Furth taught
until 1999, and continued his research until shortly before his
death.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Cogan, 78, who co-produced the landmark drama "A Raisin in the
Sun" in 1959, Broadway's first play by a black playwright, died of
lung cancer Feb. 7 at his home in Bedford, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Cogan had been a theater manager, owner and producer, and also
founded a talent agency that managed such celebrity clients as Anne
Bancroft and Neil Simon. That firm, Cogan, Bell &amp; Co., also
represented the classical Beaux Arts Trio and psychoanalyst Erik
Erikson.</LD>
<LD>   In 1959, Cogan joined music publisher Philip Rose in the daring
production of Lorraine Hansberry's dramatic play "A Raisin in the
Sun," about a Chicago black family. The star was Sydney Poitier, who
reprised his role in the equally ground-breaking film version of the
same title in 1961.</LD>
<TE>   Cogan also produced other plays, including "In the Counting House"
in 1962. From 1960 to 1986, he was the owner of Broadway's Biltmore
Theater.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Matthew Culligan, 83, the media supersalesman and former president of
the magazine behemoth Curtis Publishing, which owned the Saturday
Evening Post among others, died Jan. 31 in Newhall of complications
from a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   The native New Yorker served as a company commander in Europe
during World War II and lost an eye to a grenade in the Battle of the
Bulge, ever after wearing a distinctive black eye patch.</LD>
<LD>   At war's end, Culligan began his media career as an ad salesman
for Good Housekeeping magazine, and by 1962 had worked his way up to
president of the Curtis firm.</LD>
<TE>   Credited with cutting costs and raising revenues, he personally
went on speaking tours and sought advertising from executives of the
nation's 200 top corporations, requesting "amusing anecdotes" for his
sales pitches from none other than President Kennedy. But Culligan
resigned in 1964 after the Post became embroiled in several legal and
internal battles that caused advertisers to lose faith.</TE>
<TE>   Culligan later served as an official with the U.S. Information
Agency and as president of Mutual Broadcasting Co. He also wrote 11
books, and in one attributed his success to "an innate Irish facility
for conversation."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peggy Durdin, 92, the pioneering female foreign correspondent
covering Asia in a time and place where women rarely worked outside
the home, died of pneumonia Feb. 12 in Encinitas.</LD>
<LD>   Born Margaret Armstrong in China to Presbyterian missionary
parents, she was educated there and attended college in the United
States, then returned to teach English at the Shanghai American
School.</LD>
<LD>   But in 1938, she married New York Times correspondent Tillman
Durdin, moved with him to the Chinese wartime capital Chungking, and
herself began writing for such magazines as Life, Look, the Saturday
Evening Post, Reader's Digest and Time.</LD>
<TE>   Later she joined correspondents in Hong Kong as a "China watcher,"
reporting on the closed communist country. In 1958, she co-edited
Atlantic magazine's special edition on communist China and wrote a
booklet on China for the Foreign Policy Assn.</TE>

<HD>Lockyer's Elements in Ca. Political Chemistry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was unquestionably political, but science ...?</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's latest literary enthusiasm is a book
titled "E=MC2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation," a
bit of reading he put to good use at the recent state Democratic
convention in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer treated delegates to a PowerPoint presentation of his own
periodic chart of elements. Herewith, the Lockyer version of
hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, and so on:</LD>
<TE>   Burtonium: a highly volatile element that explodes when it comes
into contact with cell phones, maitres d', Republicans, governors,
air, water, etc. (John Burton, the state Senate president, is known
as a man with an equal-opportunity wit as well as temper, across the
political and social spectrum.)</TE>
<TE>   Fundraisium: some people believe that if you mix Fundraisium with
Grayvium, it will inevitably produce Governium. One thing's for sure:
so far, it's impervious to Reformium!</TE>
<TE>   Enronium: an unstable element that generated far fewer electrons
than originally claimed. Now Enronium attracts only Subpoena-trons!</TE>
<TE>   Microsoftium: known as the "crabgrass" element, Microsoftium seems
to prosper by mimicking and consuming new elements and converting
them to waste products. Has defied all previous government efforts to
split its nucleus, but may prove vulnerable to Lockyerite.</TE>
<TE>   Riordanite: owns many interesting properties, known to be fluid in
principle and best understood only with fuzzy logic. Riordanite is
subject to odd random emissions when anyone is watching.</TE>
<TE>   Dickchenium: now stored by the government in a remote, undisclosed
location, Dickchenium is mostly used for extracting Fund-raisium from
Petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   Georgebushium: not really an element, Georgebushium is actually a
recently invented oil byproduct that is generally recognized to be a
few quarks short of a muon.</TE>
<TE>   (And then there are those two unshakably stable elements that no
third element seems to be able to alter, Democratium and Republicum.)</TE>
<TE>   'John Q' Could Never Happen Here--Right?</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar season frenzy has crept north of the fever line, to
Sacramento, where Gray Davis' press office took advantage of the new
film "John Q" to point out that something this dreadful would never
happen in California, thanks to the state's relatively new department
of managed care, which runs interference on HMO outrages.</TE>
<TE>   (You know the story line: Denzel Washington finds his insurance
won't cover his dying son's heart transplant, and holds the hospital
hostage to get satisfaction.)</TE>
<TE>   During all of this, the producer, Mark Burg, who was there by the
magic of teleconferencing, let slip that he set the movie in Chicago
because it bears a credible resemblance to Toronto, where the film
was actually made--more film flight to the Great White North. Chicago
itself, Burg said, was too expensive; he would have loved to have
stayed home and made the film in L.A., but gosh, he only had $40
million.</TE>
<TE>   It was at this moment that Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio took the
opportunity to point out that Davis had proposed tax credits to keep
the movie industry on its home turf.</TE>
<TE>   Dishing Out Some Biting Remarks on Tyson</TE>
<TE>   The day before its "John Q" press event, Davis' office, ever
mindful of the boxing-hating vote, issued this statement about the
possibility of Mike Tyson's boxing here:</TE>
<TE>   "If it were up to me, it's a mistake," Gov. Davis said. "I don't
think we should grant Mike Tyson a permit, certainly not now. I think
he needs to get treatment and get help. And I would be opposed to
it."</TE>
<TE>   And as to how the state Athletic Commission may vote if it is
asked to consider approving a permit for Tyson to fight Lennox Lewis
in California, the governor stated:</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think they should use their independent judgment as to
what is best for California. But if they asked me, I don't think this
is the right time to give Mike Tyson a fight. I mean, you can't have
people who go around biting other people and apparently losing
control, a number of lawsuits against him for alleged problems, so
this is just not the right time to do it and I personally would be
opposed to it."</TE>
<TE>   Bold words from a man who'll be going many rounds with whomever
the Republicans nominate in March--although not, mercifully, in satin
shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Dickchenium Shines One On at Fundraisium</TE>
<TE>   Out of the blue, some friendly fire:</TE>
<TE>   At last week's Nixon Library luncheon to award Vice President Dick
Cheney and his wife, Lynne, the "architects of peace" prize, Cheney
got blindsided by questions he clearly wasn't expecting from the
$2,500-a-plate audience.</TE>
<TE>   One of them came from Fullerton's man in Congress, Republican Ed
Royce, who wanted to know whether the U.S. would do something to keep
members of the Saudi royal family from spending their oil riches to
run terrorist training schools in North Africa and Central Asia.
After a brief discussion of how terrorists have used legitimate and
phony charities as fronts, Cheney said, "The Saudis have been very
cooperative in a lot of our enterprises"--not exactly an answer to
the question.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney might have been in for another difficult intra-GOP moment
in San Jose a few days later. He was scheduled to give a speech in
the same place where, moments before, secretary of state and GOP
governor candidate Bill Jones planned to demand that Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis come clean on his little chats with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   As the press release was headlined, "Secretary of State Bill Jones
to Hold Press Avail[ability] to discuss Enron/Davis connection. Will
call on Davis to reveal details of all communication with Ken Lay,
and other Enron executives."</TE>
<TE>   This was dicey because, of course, Cheney has been refusing to
spill the beans on his own chats with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Some people might feel constrained to point out that what's sauce
for the donkey should be sauce for the elephant.</TE>
<TE>   Some Jones aide wised up in time to bring out the hook, although
Jones' spokeswoman says no, no, no, no, it was merely logistics: "We
weren't able to move [Jones] into San Jose with enough time.... He
was running late on appointments."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, c'mon--it had nothing to do with that potentially embarrassing
intra-party chafing?</TE>
<TE>   "No,' she declared, "it was not."</TE>
<TE>   How About Calling It Hahnistan?</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s splitting headache, the secession movement, has acquired
its own comedians.</TE>
<TE>   That other secession movement, the one that is literally in the
backyard of Mayor James Hahn, would cleave his town, San Pedro, along
with the burbs of Wilmington and Harbor City, from Greater L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The secession chiefs have to submit five possible names for the
new burg for the November ballot, and so they are accepting ideas
sent to info@harborstudy.org. A lot of names have port themes--no
surprise--but in a state where builders grandly name subdivisions
"River View" when neither a river nor a view exists, truth should not
be a confining consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nominees so far: Port Verde, Angel Port, Angels Port,
Pacific Port, Pacific Vista, Two Port City and a half-Spanish
version, Dosport.</TE>
<TE>   "A few were probably submitted in jest," says Dennis Dyer, one of
the secession leaders, "but most would be very suitable." The jesters
are "Bushville, Bushtown, Bushton," and, for a former L.A. mayor
whose name now only appears on a meeting room at the convention
center, "Port Yorty."</TE>
<TE>   Who's for Whom</TE>
<TE>   Davis: California Latino Superintendents Assn., New Frontier
Democratic Club.</TE>
<TE>   Jones: Republican Arab American Congress, United Agri Business
League, Silicon Valley Young Republican Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Simon: Gun Owners of California, Young Republican Federation of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Still spell-check deprived: the Riordan campaign, sending out a
press release with a headline about the candidate's "manufacturering
tax cut proposal."</TE>
<TE>   * NALEO, the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials, sent out a get-out-the-vote flier for the March 5 election
using as its poster boy one of its own, who just now is between
appointments and elections to anything, Antonio Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   * The Bakersfield City Council approved putting two phrases on the
walls of City Hall: "In God We Trust" and "E Pluribus Unum" (out of
many, one)--both to be found also on U.S. coins.</TE>
<TE>   * A bigwig at a Sacramento PR firm, Sara Brown, returned from her
honeymoon and let it be known that her new name is now Sara Lee, and
invited all and sundry to "forward your best attempts at pound-cake
jokes."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "OK. Fine. But no sex."</TE>
<TE>   Another deadpan line from GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon.
When a top campaign official, Bob Taylor, told Simon that during the
campaign's home stretch, Taylor wouldn't be letting Simon out of his
sight and promised to "stick to you like glue," Simon delivered his
droll response.</TE>

<HD>State Disputes Long-Term Power Pacts</HD>
<DH>Energy: Officials today will ask federal regulators to void
or modify $45 billion in contracts with suppliers. Firms say deals
are valid, were fairly negotiated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>California officials alleged Sunday that 22 energy companies
overcharged the state about $21 billion for long-term power contracts
signed during the energy crisis and extracted other unreasonable
terms because they had the electricity-starved state in a bind.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity
Oversight Board announced they would file similar complaints today
with federal energy regulators seeking to void or modify $45 billion
in long-term contracts.</LD>
<LD>   State officials blamed not only energy companies but also the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which they said encouraged the
state to enter into long-term pacts a year ago while energy companies
were positioned to demand unreasonably high prices.</LD>
<TE>   "When these contracts were negotiated, the sellers had California
over a barrel," PUC President Loretta M. Lynch said. "Now it's time
for the FERC to recognize last year's out-of-control market prices
and lower California's power costs."</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials in Washington could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of energy companies said the contracts are valid
and were fairly negotiated with state consultants and officials.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the contracts they negotiated in good faith ... and now
they want the federal government to correct their alleged
mismanagement of the process," said Gary Ackerman, executive director
of the Western Policy Trading Forum, which represents many of the
companies. "Those contracts ... will withstand any scrutiny by any
court or federal agency. It would be incumbent on the state to
establish a massive collusion or manipulation to strike those
contracts."</TE>
<TE>   When the contracts were signed, Gov. Gray Davis hailed them,
saying they calmed the volatile wholesale electricity market and
reduced the state's reliance on spot power purchases. As current
power prices declined and criticism of the contracts mounted, state
officials moved to renegotiate the deals--but without success thus
far.</TE>
<TE>   "We still paid more than we should have," Davis said in an
interview in Washington, where he was attending a governors
conference. "We're going to the FERC for relief, asking them either
unilaterally determine the price ... that energy companies should get
for those contracts, or force the energy companies to negotiate in
good faith."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said California will sue the energy companies if it does not
succeed in persuading federal regulators to take action.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC's petition, released Sunday, as expected describes a wide
range of weaknesses in the contracts signed by the Department of
Water Resources after the agency began buying power in January 2001
for the customers of financially troubled utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite its best efforts, DWR was forced to pay unjust and
unreasonable prices and to agree to onerous, unjust and unreasonable
non-price items and conditions, to ... ensure that the lights stayed
on in California," said the petition.</TE>
<TE>   "In many instances, DWR was forced to accept high-priced power for
10 or even 20 years in order to obtain any power at all for the two-
to three-year period in which it sought to focus its efforts."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC said that Sempra Energy Resources--one of the largest
suppliers--is charging $160 a megawatt hour for peak energy from
April through September, which is almost 250% above a benchmark
price.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra, said this high price was
negotiated because the company had to go into the market to acquire
power from other companies while its new plants were being built.</TE>
<TE>   "The state said, 'If you want to do business with us, we have a
serious power crunch this summer and next summer, and you need to
provide us with 250 to 300 megawatts and sell it to us at a discount
to these very high market rates,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kline said the company is losing money on those power sales to the
state. And he noted that power Sempra is providing for the vast
majority of the 10-year state contract will cost less than a third as
much as the early years.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Calpine contracted to sell California more power
than any other company. Joe Ronan, vice president of government
affairs, said that he is not worried about a federal review and that
the company's prices were among the lowest. "This was not like
someone held a gun to their head," he said. "The state was asking for
the bids and setting the price targets. They took some bids and
rejected others."</TE>
<TE>   In arguing the contracts are illegal, state officials are relying
in part on a December 2000 order in which FERC said the state's
market structure can allow power providers to get unreasonable
prices.</TE>
<TE>   After summer 2000, California turned to FERC for help in subduing
wholesale energy prices, which helped drive major utilities into
insolvency and forced the state into the power buying business.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators imposed price caps in June, and they still are
considering California's bid to get $8.9 billion in refunds from
power sellers.</TE>

<HD>Duke's Grandson, Pilgrim in Spirit</HD>
<DH>Religion: Son of John Wayne's daughter, the newly ordained
priest says Mass at his childhood chapel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne's grandson Matthew Munoz returned to the chapel of his
youth Sunday as a newly ordained Roman Catholic priest, sharing the
story of his own spiritual struggle that began with boyhood
misadventures on Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   "Me and my brothers raised hell here," Munoz joked as he opened 10
a.m. Mass at St. John Vianney Chapel on the island, drawing bursts of
laughter. "And now we're going to try to bring a little heaven back."</LD>
<LD>   Munoz, 37, is the eldest of five children born to Melinda and
Gregory Munoz. His mother is a daughter of John Wayne and his first
wife, Josephine. His dad, now remarried, is a judge in Santa Ana. His
parents, grandmother and other relatives filled the front pews for
the hourlong service.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most wonderful thing that ever happened," said Josephine
Wayne, who traveled from Los Angeles for the occasion. "It's a great
gift from God."</TE>
<TE>   With wavy dark hair and a goatee, Munoz cuts a cleaner image than
during his soul-searching years. Even he pokes fun of the way he used
to look, when he considered himself a hermit and let his hair and
beard grow past his waist.</TE>
<TE>   He began his sermon with candid confessions about some of the
mischief he and his siblings got into during their summer romps in
Balboa, the family's seaside escape from their home in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The Munoz boys used to have a contest, he recalled, in which they
threw cats as far as they could into the ocean to see if they could
swim back.</TE>
<TE>   "This Mass would be offered in reparation of the terrible things
we did here as kids," Munoz said, offering his apologies to any cat
owners who may have been affected by his actions.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz also acknowledged the struggle of his own spiritual journey.
He spent the early 1990s in seminary, but left in 1993, unsure
whether he wanted to devote his life to God or get married and start
a family. He spent the next seven years teaching high school and
working with the poor in Mexico before resuming his studies, on the
counsel of Msgr. Lawrence Baird, pastor at St. John Vianney. He will
be assigned to St. Edward's Catholic Church in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz told parishioners that he felt like St. Peter, because he
"was always missing the point." He cautioned them not to miss the
deeper meaning of life, nor forget that Jesus "is in our midst ... in
good times and bad."</TE>
<TE>   At a reception afterward, many of Munoz's friends and relatives
expressed surprise that he became a priest--the family's first. "It's
a very unusual road to choose," his mother, Melinda, said. "But
everyone's very proud of him."</TE>
<TE>   As for what John Wayne might have thought, Munoz said his
grandfather learned about the possibility years ago when his mother
told the movie star about the teenager's interest.</TE>
<TE>   "'Melinda,' he said in that great voice of his," Munoz said,
"'after all, he's almost a man. Let him do what he's got to do.'"</TE>

<HD>Sepulveda Corridor Gains Notoriety for Rape</HD>
<DH>Crime: Last year, 58 assaults were reported in the Valley
area. Most of the victims knew their attackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The typical rapist is not likely to spring from bushes to attack. He
probably won't drag his victim at knifepoint into a dark alley.</LD>
<LD>   Buying the prey a shot of Cuervo is more his style. Or taking her
to a movie or dinner. He might be an old friend, a cousin, a husband.
Or someone she just met.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the victim has just met her attacker or known him all her
life, the majority of rapes are committed by people known by the
victim--even in the most crime-ridden neighborhoods of the city.
Sepulveda Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley is one such place.</LD>
<TE>   Long known as a place to pick up a prostitute, the Sepulveda
corridor is also one of the most frequent settings for rape in the
city. The 51/2-mile stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard and the
surrounding streets from the 118 Freeway to south of Victory
Boulevard were the scene of 58 reported rapes in 2001. The grim tally
was even worse than the notorious six-mile Figueroa Street stretch in
South-Central, where there were 45 rapes, according to the Los
Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Sepulveda corridor attacks, at least 45 were acquaintance
rapes.</TE>
<TE>   "In most of the rapes we have, the victim knows the person," said
LAPD Det. Craig Rhudy, a 17-year veteran of the force. "We have very
few stranger rapes."</TE>
<TE>   The rape of Tiffany seems fairly typical.</TE>
<TE>   She had known Jason, her attacker, for more than a year. She knew
his friends and family. She had partied with him, even kissed him
several times. She never had to ask him twice to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Then one night, as she was sitting on a chair, Jason picked her up
and sat her down on a carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Then things got vicious.</TE>
<TE>   "When I tried to stand up, he pushed my shoulders back down really
hard," said Tiffany, 23, a North Hollywood resident who would not
give her last name or details of where the attack occurred. "Then he
said in a very calm voice, 'You don't want to even say a word.' I was
in shock."</TE>
<TE>   During the attack, Tiffany said she thought of an old Hollywood
image of a rapist, someone with a gun or knife and a mask. Someone
who would kill. But Jason had no weapon or disguise. She wasn't even
sure this was rape.</TE>
<TE>   "When he finished, he didn't even look at me," she said softly.
"It was like he was done and I was discarded."</TE>
<TE>   She credited the counseling she received in Van Nuys with saving
her life.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the Valley Trauma Center, I think I would have
committed suicide," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the center, the Valley's only rape crisis
facility, said at least 66% of the 772 rape and sexual assault
victims counseled there in 2001 knew their attacker. That percentage
may be much higher because 14% declined to reveal the attacker's
identity.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers do not surprise Constance Bryant, rape crisis program
manager at the Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence in
Ventura, who said about 75% of rapes in the U.S. are committed by a
person who knows the victim.</TE>
<TE>   What is deceiving is the term "acquaintance."</TE>
<TE>   "Most women know their attacker to some extent, but she may have
only known him for an hour," said Bryant, who has counseled hundreds
of victims. "It's a funny thing, but as humans, if we've met someone
even just an hour ago, we stop thinking of them as strangers. But you
really don't know anything about them, even if you've been on one or
two dates."</TE>
<TE>   Many rapes occur near the end of a night on the town, when a
couple decide to continue the evening at a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a high number of cases where the couple might say, 'Let's
get a room and just do some drugs or drink or hang out for awhile,'
so they get a motel," said LAPD Det. Gary Barthelmess. "Sometimes the
night ends with a rape."</TE>
<TE>   At the trauma center, Executive Director Patti Dengler said the
keys to reducing rape are education and accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "When a women gets raped, the focus is often on what she did and
how she could have prevented it," Dengler said. "We need to focus on
men and why some of them think it is OK to keep going when the woman
says no." Rape is one of the hardest crimes to prove. In 2000, there
were 1,342 rapes reported and 191 arrests citywide. In 2001, in the
LAPD's Van Nuys Division, there were 74 reported rapes and 15
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sepulveda is infamous for prostitutes, they accounted for
less than 10 of the 61 reported rapes on the corridor. The actual
number is thought to be much higher as prostitutes may be reluctant
to report the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of that comes from the prostitute's belief that no one
cares, so they won't even report it," Barthelmess said. "That's not
true. We will investigate their rape just like all the others. I
think there is a high percentage of prostitutes that almost figure
it's a given they are going to be assaulted."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa is one of those.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey baby, that's just the way things are here," said Lisa, a
vacant-eyed Sepulveda Boulevard hooker who would only give her first
name. She started walking away into the night, smiled at a man
sitting in a parked car, then turned and explained her philosophy.
"You got to do what you got to do on Sepulveda."</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany, the rape survivor, urged victims of sexual attacks to
seek counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a day goes by that I don't think about what happened to me,"
she said. "But now instead of being ashamed, I'm proud I got through
it."</TE>

<HD>CSUCI's Cabinet Now Fully Assembled</HD>
<DH>Education: The last two top administrators are in place,
bringing a wealth of experience, plus cultural diversity, to help
serve the new Camarillo campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final administrative pieces are in place at Cal State Channel
Islands, and President Richard Rush thinks people are going to like
the result.</LD>
<LD>   After months of searching, Rush has assembled his executive
cabinet, the group of senior administrators who will serve as his
principal advisors while overseeing a range of programs essential to
operating the Camarillo campus, set to open later this year.</LD>
<LD>   The group includes Alexander W. McNeill, who left his post as a
dean at the University of Alaska to become the new university's vice
president for academic affairs. Joanne M. Coville is vice president
for finance and administration, and Maryann L. Dase is the
university's chief information officer.</LD>
<TE>   William Gregory Sawyer and Alma D. Gonzalez were the last to
arrive, reporting for duty last month. He's vice president for
student affairs, and she is vice president for university
advancement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very strong group, and their credentials are impeccable,"
said Rush, who can use all the help he can get making sure the campus
opens on schedule for the fall semester. "They have the right values,
they are people of substance, and they are dedicated to the task at
hand."</TE>
<TE>   They've also accomplished plenty before landing in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Take Gonzalez, who was born and raised in East Los Angeles and
earned a bachelor's degree in Spanish literature from UCLA in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   She has worked as the general manager for a pioneering
Spanish-language advertising agency, headed corporate advertising for
Hughes Aircraft, and held key positions with the Los Angeles Olympic
Organizing Committee in 1984 and the Los Angeles Host Committee for
the 1994 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez also served as vice president of development and
communications for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund before landing a job as director of development for the Rand
Corp., a Santa Monica research firm.</TE>
<TE>   That's where an executive headhunter found her and asked if she
would be interested in helping launch the Camarillo campus, the 23rd
in the Cal State University system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if every position I held in the past led me here,"
said Gonzalez, whose job is to promote and support the university in
a variety of ways, from community relations to fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no interest in leaving Rand, I really liked it there, so
this had to be very, very special," she said. "I've done some of the
'first-time-ever' kind of stuff, the things you would consider an
opportunity of a lifetime. This to me is one of those opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer couldn't agree more. And he's been down this road once
before.</TE>
<TE>   As founding dean of student services at Florida Gulf Coast
University in Fort Myers from 1995 through 2001, he helped transform
a branch campus of the University of South Florida into a
full-fledged, four-year institution.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing is happening at Channel Islands, where a branch
campus of Cal State Northridge will evolve into Ventura County's
first four-year public university.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer Welcomes New Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the idea, and the challenge, of being able to deliver
higher education to a county that has not had a four-year
institution," said Sawyer, who was born and raised in inner-city
Columbus, Ohio. "I also wanted to be in a situation where--once
again--I was helping start something like this from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   As with Gonzalez, it seems his entire career has been moving
toward this moment.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his bachelor's degree in communication and theater from
Mount Union College in Ohio, his master's from Eastern New Mexico
University and his doctorate from the University of North Texas.</TE>
<TE>   He taught communication classes at colleges in Texas from Amarillo
to Irving, and worked his way to dean of students at the University
of North Texas at Denton.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer said growing up in his household, it was taken for granted
he would succeed. Both his parents earned college degrees in an era
when few other African Americans did. Their three children were
expected to do as well, if not better.</TE>
<TE>   It's a philosophy that Sawyer believes will serve him well in the
job of vice president for student affairs, which oversees everything
from financial aid to student housing and counseling services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to support the academic mission, to serve as advocate
and support for the students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was important to Rush that the university's senior
administrative staff be as diverse as the community it is going to
serve. So aside from the solid credentials Sawyer and Gonzalez bring
to the job, Rush said he values their experience and background as
members of minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the entire staff brings unique strengths to the
campus, from Dase's extensive experience in information services to
Coville's background as a certified public accountant and executive
vice president of the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and
Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "They've all accomplished things in their lives prior to coming
here," Rush said. "I think the entire region will be delighted to
have them not only as senior leaders on campus but also as members of
the community."</TE>

<HD>Dr. Robert Zweig, 77; Advocate for Cleaner Air and
Alternative Fuels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Robert Zweig, a Riverside family physician who witnessed the
effects pollution was having on his patients and spent 35 years
campaigning for cleaner air and promoting the use of alternative
fuels, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Zweig, co-founder of the environmental group Clean Air Now, died
Feb. 15 of complications of leukemia at Parkview Community Hospital
Medical Center in Riverside, where he was a founder and board member.</LD>
<LD>   Zweig, who once drank from the exhaust pipe of a hydrogen-powered
pickup truck to demonstrate that clean water is a byproduct of the
clean-burning fuel, never lost his passion as a clean-air champion.</LD>
<TE>   "Bob personified a clean-air hero," said Barry Wallerstein,
executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
"He was an innovative thinker, helping to lead the region to an
alternative fuel future."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a visionary advocate for hydrogen in transportation," said
James Lents, director of environmental policy at the College of
Engineering-Center for Environmental Research and Technology at UC
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   But Zweig wasn't just a visionary who talked about it, said Lents,
who first met Zweig in the late '80s when Lents was executive officer
of the South Coast AQMD.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very active in the process of helping to find funding and
to get agencies like the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
SunLine Transit Agency in the desert and the university here to take
a serious look at hydrogen and do some experimenting with it."</TE>
<TE>   "He inspired people," said Virginia Field, who chairs the board of
Clean Air Now. "He was respected by the air resources people and all
the regulatory agencies because he was willing to work within the
system rather than from outside. Lots of activists don't."</TE>
<TE>   Zweig's concern with air pollution grew out of his family
practice, where he saw many patients with respiratory problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Children were sent to me by other doctors," he told the Riverside
Press-Enterprise in 1998. "I had to recommend that some patients
leave the area.... You could see [smog] coming over the pass and
spreading into Riverside. It was a brown soupy fog."</TE>
<TE>   Declaring war on pollution, Zweig helped start the grass-roots
organization Clean Air Now in 1969, and later the Clean Air
Institute, one of the first antipollution research groups.</TE>
<TE>   Under Zweig's leadership, both organizations promoted hydrogen as
an alternative, cleaner-burning fuel.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'70s, Zweig arranged to bring one of the country's
first hydrogen-powered buses to Riverside. To demonstrate the
technology, he drove the bus up and down California and won research
funding from the state Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   In the '80s, he donated several thousand dollars to help buy a
hydrogen-powered pickup, which he gave to UC Riverside's College of
Engineering-Center for Environmental Research and Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Only 20% of the energy from an internal combustion engine finds
its way to the drive wheels, leaving 80% of the energy to go to
waste," he told the Press-Enterprise last year. But with a fuel cell
based on hydrogen, he said, the figures are reversed, with 80% of the
energy going to the drive wheels.</TE>
<TE>   "It reduces the energy need," he said. "And we can make hydrogen
[fuel] in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous awards recognizing his clean-air efforts came to Zweig in
his later years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, he received the Jules Verne Award for lifetime
contribution to hydrogen energy development at the 13th World
Hydrogen Energy Conference in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   A Philadelphia native, Zweig served in the Navy from 1943 to 1946.
He received his medical degree from Thomas Jefferson Medical College
in Pennsylvania in 1952. A year later, Zweig and his family moved to
California where he began a family practice residency at Riverside
General Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1972, when he began investigating alternative fuels, Zweig
set a clean-air example.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time propane was probably the cleanest, so we converted a
car to propane and tried to convince other people to do the same,"
said Dolores, his wife of 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1974, Zweig became convinced hydrogen was the way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "From then on, he just plugged hydrogen whenever he could," his
wife said. "Some people laughed at him at the time, but he never
stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Zweig continued to drive by example: Among his vehicles were a
hydrogen-powered pickup and a hybrid electric- and gas-powered Honda
Insight.</TE>
<TE>   He demonstrated the Honda to students at two high schools in
Riverside one day late last month, his final appearance on behalf of
Clear Air Now.</TE>
<TE>   The experience left him exhausted, his wife said.</TE>
<TE>   "He just was just so convinced that the world has to have cleaner
air, and he wanted to cut off our dependency on oil from the Middle
East, and he wanted the children to grow up healthier," she said. "To
that end, he just gave all of his extra energy."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Zweig is survived by two daughters, Tracy
Pinnella of Santa Barbara and Wendy Micklus of Washington; three
sons, Robert of Orange, Peter of Occidental and David of Colorado;
five grandchildren; and a sister, Eleanor Scot of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial will be held at 10:30 a.m. March 2 at First United
Methodist Church in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial contributions may be made to Clean Air Now or Victoria
Avenue Forever, both in Riverside.</TE>

<HD>The Duke's Grandson a New Priest</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne's grandson Matthew Munoz returned to the chapel of his
youth Sunday as a newly ordained Roman Catholic priest, sharing the
story of his spiritual struggle that began with boyhood misadventures
on Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   "Me and my brothers raised hell here," Munoz joked as he opened 10
a.m. Mass at St. John Vianney Chapel on the island, drawing bursts of
laughter. "And now we're going to try to bring a little heaven back."</LD>
<LD>   Munoz, 37, is the eldest of five children born to Melinda and
Gregory Munoz. His mom is a daughter of John Wayne and his first
wife, Josephine. His dad, now remarried, is a judge in Santa Ana. His
parents, grandmother and other relatives filled the front pews for
the hourlong service.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most wonderful thing that ever happened," said Josephine
Wayne, who traveled from Los Angeles for the occasion. "It's a great
gift from God."</TE>
<TE>   With wavy dark hair and a goatee, Munoz cuts a cleaner image than
during his soul-searching years. Even he pokes fun of the way he used
to look, when he considered himself a hermit and let his hair and
beard grow past his waist.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz also acknowledged the struggle of his spiritual journey. He
spent the early 1990s in seminary but left in 1993, unsure whether he
wanted to devote his life to God or get married and start a family.
He spent the next seven years teaching high school and working with
the poor in Mexico before resuming his studies, on the counsel of
Msgr. Lawrence Baird, pastor at St. John Vianney.</TE>

<HD>Gretzky Solves Canada's National Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>As executive director of Canada's Olympic hockey team, Wayne Gretzky
got all of the headaches and little of the glory.</LD>
<LD>   In a country full of hockey experts, Gretzky made himself a magnet
for criticism when he accepted the job 15 months ago. No matter whom
he and his staff picked for the 23-man roster or how they justified
their selections, they had to return from the Salt Lake City Winter
Games with Canada's first men's hockey gold medal since 1952 or they
would be considered abject failures.</LD>
<LD>   All the good things he had done for his homeland's hockey
reputation, such as winning four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton
Oilers and combining with Mario Lemieux to win the 1987 Canada Cup
tournament, would have been forgotten if this team didn't redeem
Canada's hockey honor at the Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody came to this tournament with the amount of pressure Team
Canada came in with," veteran Canadian defenseman Al Mac-</TE>
<TE>   Innis said. "Everybody should give themselves a pat on the back."</TE>
<TE>   The players got those pats Sunday--as well as shiny gold
medals--after they pulled away from the U.S. in the third period to
record a 5-2 victory in the Olympic hockey final.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches and team executives, however, don't get medals. Gretzky
had to content himself with a friend's gift of a black leather jacket
embroidered with patches for each of Canada's Olympic triumphs and a
maple leaf-shaped patch on the left side with the words "Canada 2002
Gold Medal Champions."</TE>
<TE>   The best reward for Gretzky, though, was the chance to breathe
without being second-guessed. He will no longer have to listen to
Canadian radio talk shows dissect his decision to leave young Boston
Bruin forward Joe Thornton off the team, to leave penalty-prone Theo
Fleury on the team and to refuse to promise goaltender Patrick Roy
the starting job.</TE>
<TE>   Roy declined a roster spot, leaving Martin Brodeur, Curtis Joseph
and Ed Belfour to share the goaltending duties. Fleury played well in
the tournament, and Brodeur was a key factor in Canada's victory
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud and happy for Theo Fleury," Gretzky said. "So much
attention was given to [his selection]. He did exactly what we picked
him for. He was grinding it out every shift. Martin Brodeur, at 3-2
he made an incredible save on Brett Hull."</TE>
<TE>   After years of being disparaged for being the de facto general
manager of the Kings and having too much influence in personnel
decisions, Gretzky proved he knows something about judging talent.
But he was simply too worn out to take any satisfaction from that
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a stressful time, a stressful two weeks," said Gretzky,
who retired in 1999 and is the managing partner and part-owner of the
Phoenix Coyotes. "The work our staff has put in the whole time has
been incredible.</TE>
<TE>   "In Canada, when you pick 23 guys, it's very difficult. Should Joe
Thornton be on the team? Absolutely. We're the only country that
critiques our team this way. But that also shows our depth. These
guys have done something nobody has ever done: they're the first
professional Canadian team to win gold. I told them they should be
proud."</TE>
<TE>   They, in turn, were proud of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly felt sorry for Wayne Gretzky, all the abuse he was
taking," center Joe Nieuwendyk said. "We're standing at the end. I
think that's the most important thing.</TE>
<TE>   "And he can smile. He did a tremendous job. Just to have his
presence around the dressing room and be a part to this and be one of
the guys was an inspiration for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky did more during the hockey tournament than merely show up.
He acknowledged Sunday the tirade he unleashed last Monday against
the "American propaganda" and rumors of dissension between Canadian
players and Coach Pat Quinn was intended to create an us-against-them
sentiment that would strengthen the Canadian players' bond.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt our team had been taking so much criticism, and that
took some of the heat off those guys," he said. "I didn't sleep for
five days."</TE>
<TE>   He can sleep now--at least until the NHL season resumes
Tuesday--knowing the team he helped assemble acquitted itself
splendidly in a splendid game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real happy for Canada and very proud of our players and
coaches," he said. "They deserve all the credit. I think the game
itself was a great game for the NHL to have in North America, to be
seen by so many people and give our game exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams worked hard. My feeling right now is pretty much
incredible. As a team we came a long way."</TE>
<TE>   So has he. But winning the Olympics, he said, can't be compared to
his Stanley Cup exploits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different feeling," he said. "It's the first time I've
done it on this side, but the same emotion as far as winning goes.
It's very emotional and I'm very happy for the players. They earned
it."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian fans felt they earned the right to celebrate. They
spontaneously began singing "O Canada," the country's national
anthem, and waved flags in a red-and-white frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like anything else, you get bragging rights for a while,"
Gretzky said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something our country, we desperately needed to win this
tournament."</TE>

<HD>Salt Lake Has Been a Trip for a While</HD>

<LD>After nine years on the news staff at this newspaper, it was my good
fortune in late 1998 to transfer to the Sports section. Days later,
the Salt Lake bid scandal erupted. So I've been coming to Salt Lake
with regularity for more than three years now, and I knew that these
Games--the last in the United States for at least 10 years--would be
memorable.</LD>
<LD>   I must admit that, after all the time spent in Salt Lake, the
place kind of grows on you. Not enough to move here; let's not be
ridiculous. But the mountains are beautiful, it's easy to get around
the city, and there is one really good restaurant</LD>
<LD>   --the Market Street Grill, though for the life of me, I still
can't figure out why the best restaurant in Salt Lake City, a long
way away from the ocean, serves fish.</LD>
<TE>   It's disturbing at first to meet so many people in one place who
are so very friendly, polite and kind. Truth is, you could easily get
used to so much niceness, and that's the memory of Salt Lake that
will linger with me the longest.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day of the Games, I left my cellular phone behind at
a security checkpoint in downtown Salt Lake City. I didn't realize
where it was until I arrived at another security checkpoint, this one
outside the snowboarding halfpipe venue in Park City, about 45
minutes east of downtown Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   I mentioned to Linda Miller, a Games volunteer, that my phone was
downtown. That was in the morning. Then I left the media tent to go
cover the event (won by Kelly Clark, one of the first dramatic
moments for the U.S. of these Olympics).</TE>
<TE>   While I was on the hill, Miller--and I had no clue this was going
on--called home. Her daughter Marilee answered. Miller explained
about my phone. Marilee volunteered to get the phone and drive it to
Park City.</TE>
<TE>   When I got back to the media tent, in the afternoon, the phone was
there.</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of Olympics this was. A lot of moments to
remember.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Clark's stunning ride, I was fortunate to cover some other
great moments: the U.S. men's sweep of the halfpipe competition;
snowboarder Chris Klug's amazing ride to bronze in the parallel giant
slalom 18 months after a liver transplant; the medal-winning rides in
the skeleton by Jim Shea Jr., Tristan Gale and Lea Ann Parsley, a
surreal scene in a driving snowstorm.</TE>
<TE>   I will remember halfpipe rider Danny Kass' family. Kass is 19 and
probably the most innovative halfpiper in the world; he successfully
landed a "1080," as it's called, three complete spins in the air.
Kass likes to come off as a 21st-century version of the slacker Jeff
Spicoli character from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Like, dude,
whoa: Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   All I know is that Kass' dad, mom, stepmom, grandma--whom he calls
"Oma"--and a whole bunch of cousins and nieces and nephews were
eagerly lined up along the fence to watch him compete in the Olympic
Games, the little ones munching on bite-size Oreos and peanut butter
and cheese crackers. It looked like Saturday morning at a youth
soccer league match. And he proudly went over to them all after one
ride and exchanged hugs and kisses, as if he'd just scored his first
goal.</TE>
<TE>   I will remember U.S. rider Rosey Fletcher, a solitary tear making
its way slowly down her left cheek, after she failed to qualify for
the snowboarding slalom finals.</TE>
<TE>   I learned from the female snowboarders that braids are in vogue.
This was a big thrill for my 7-year-old daughter, who prefers braids
too.</TE>
<TE>   These Games were--judging controversies and all--a great success.
It makes you hope that someday the Olympics will be back in the
United States. The next possibility would be the Summer Games in
2012. Four U.S. cities are in the running: New York, Houston,
Washington and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder: If I left my cell phone behind in Manhattan, do you
think someone would run it out to me on Long Island?</TE>

<LD>I'm not sure if I would have found the stamina to make it to Sunday's
gold-medal hockey game if it weren't for one more jolt from the
Brazilian Olympians. They provide more energy than a six-pack of Red
Bull.</LD>
<LD>   It was the next-to-last night of the Olympics. Three weeks on the
road, three weeks of emptying my pockets and walking through metal
detectors, three weeks of the same concession-stand rotation of
chicken fingers, pizza and barbecue sandwiches, three weeks of
lending Bill Plaschke money and three weeks of late nights running
into early mornings had wiped me out.</LD>
<LD>   I was at Natalie's, a restaurant and bar co-owned by Natalie
Williams of the WNBA's Utah Starzz, and my unofficial evening
hangout. It was 10:45 p.m. and I was thinking about setting my
personal Olympic record for earliest bedtime.</LD>
<TE>   Then I got a call from Lisa Papandrea, who will be the wife of
Brazilian bobsled driver Eric Maleson after a wedding ceremony in the
Olympic Village today. She had served as my go-between for a column I
wrote on the Brazilian bobsled team and we stayed in touch throughout
the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Every time we talked she had new stories. U.S. women's hockey star
Cammi Granato bought one of their Brazilian bobsled team "Frozen
Banana" T-shirts. A woman heard Papandrea and Maleson speaking in
Portuguese at the Olympic Village coffee shop and joined the
conversation; it was Grammy-nominated singer Nelly Furtado.</TE>
<TE>   Papandrea was calling to say the Brazilian athletes were arriving
at the Samba Grill at the Gateway Center just across the street.</TE>
<TE>   I went to the Samba Grill, looked around and didn't see anything.
Then they arrived in full flurry, a pack of blue-and-yellow parkas
laughing, and beating drums. Athletes, coaches, support staff--about
a dozen in all.</TE>
<TE>   They rolled into the restaurant and went straight to a side where
various percussion instruments were hanging on the wall. They pulled
down drums, tambourines and maracas. But two of the bobsled pushers,
Matheus Inocencio and Edson Bindilatti, had their sights set on the
biggest drum, about 14 feet off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Inocencio stood on Bindilatti's shoulders, someone handed him some
wire cutters and he freed the drum.</TE>
<TE>   They paraded to the middle of the restaurant, the rhythm going,
the words flowing. Bindilatti spun a tambourine on his finger, tossed
it in the air like a pizza-maker, caught it on his finger and kept it
spinning. They passed a woman in a wheelchair and gave her
high-fives.</TE>
<TE>   I was wide awake. I couldn't help it. When Brazilians are around,
sleepiness just isn't an option.</TE>
<TE>   They gathered in a circle and various people took turns dancing in
the middle. A little American girl used crayons and napkins to make a
sign that said "United We Stand," with the Brazilian and American
flags.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant owner, wait staff and various patrons stood and
watched. Others came in from outside to see what was causing the
commotion. In the corner, an old man stood up from his crowded dinner
table and started dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The whole scene lasted 20-30 minutes. There were autographs,
pictures and lots of laughs. Everyone finally put down the drums to
eat.</TE>
<TE>   It was past 1 a.m. when the Brazilians trickled out of the
restaurant. That didn't mean they were finished. The party continued
on the street corner, as locals came up to play the drums, ask for
autographs and pose for pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian bobsled team had finished 27th on Saturday. They
sure looked happier than the gold medal-winning Germans.</TE>
<TE>   As I left them on the corner with their newfound American friends,
I realized that the Brazilians had the best grasp on the concept of
these Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just an opportunity to compete. It's an invitation to
party.</TE>

<LD>I leave the Olympics with a greater appreciation for the work they
do, the hours they put in and the sacrifices they make.</LD>
<LD>   The athletes?</LD>
<LD>   No, the truckers.</LD>
<TE>   For 10 days of these Games, somewhere off Interstate 15, somewhere
near Ogden, left without a rental car, I called home a truck-stop
motel at the Flying J Travel Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   While other reporters got stuck covering the "Big Rig" in ice
skate judging down in Salt Lake, I got stuck with real big rigs--loud
ones, smelly ones. Olympic tidbit you won't find in David
Wallechinsky's book: They have to run the trucks all night to save
fuel. It also helps keep the diesel engines from freezing up.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn a lot living 50 feet from a giant propane tank,
where, by the way, one dared not Light the Fire Within.</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, 40 to 50 big rigs rumbled from dusk to dawn, churning
diesel and dust outside my window, creating a white noise never to be
confused with "The Sounds of Summer Rain."</TE>
<TE>   Don't think for a second this is another reporter-whines-to-boss
story about his lousy Olympic time.</TE>
<TE>   That was Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   I'm what they call in the business "a team player," a guy who
leaves his petty grievances at the press box gate.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, I did hear others complain.</TE>
<TE>   A New York Times photographer checked in to our motel and quickly
checked out after he found his room was missing a door. Not a
doorknob, a door!</TE>
<TE>   It is true I ate truck-stop vittles every night and that one night
a lady's voice came over the intercom and announced, "Maintenance to
propane, please, maintenance," words I never fathomed hearing in an
eating establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Flying J became home, a one-stop shopping plaza/gas
house/ country kitchen/trucker's lounge.</TE>
<TE>   One night, a colleague mused, "Tomorrow night I think I'll eat at
the gas station across the street."</TE>
<TE>   We would come to know our Winter Olympics headquarters as the
"chateau gas-and-go."</TE>
<TE>   During the day I took winding bus rides up to Snowbasin for the
Alpine skiing; at night I manned a truck-stop diner booth and watched
novellas play out as tuckered-out truckers stopped in for respites
before getting back out on their asphalt arteries.</TE>
<TE>   It was with increasing admiration that I watched these truckers
refill their super-sized coffee mugs and rub their bloodshot eyes.
I'll never forget the guy who wandered in looking like the ghost of
Roy Orbison--"Only the Lonely," indeed.</TE>
<TE>   A quick sweep of the medication aisle put in perspective what
these guys go through. Among the stimulants that keep our truckers up
all night include "Power Jack," "Liquid Energy," "Mood Fix," "Up
Time" and "Power Brain."</TE>
<TE>   This is not an easy life.</TE>
<TE>   One night, a car pulled up to the motor lodge lobby and a woman
got out in a wedding dress, asking if there were any honeymoon rooms
available at our dive.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, no vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   How pathetic was that?</TE>
<TE>   I also felt for the dozens of international journalists who might
have thought they were going to be spending two weeks in a quaint
Winter Olympics setting.</TE>
<TE>   You could hear the sarcasm dripping when a French journalist,
loading up on pieces of hot-lamp chicken at the diner buffet, turned
to his comrade and muttered, "Bon appetit."</TE>
<TE>   I would not have left anyone I cared for two nights at the plaza,
let alone 10, yet the old haunt, like a David Lynch flick, sort of
grew on me.</TE>
<TE>   My Olympic memories are of the truck plaza, not the medal, yet I
exit with a toothpick lodged and a yearning for wide-open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere beyond these Games, out there on that ribbon of highway,
there's a Slim Whitman tune calling my name.</TE>

<LD>My stay in Salt Lake City began in failure the day I arrived. I had
always said that one of my professional goals was never to go to a
Winter Olympics, and here I was. I always favored Summer Games
because of the word "summer" in the title.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the Olympic people had done me in by putting all that
sliding and skating and sloshing and slushing one time zone away, so
professional goals gave way to professional common sense.</LD>
<LD>   And now that it is over, it wasn't so bad. My voice should return
from the pneumonia by mid-April and, for almost a month, I didn't
have to listen to Simers whimper about not having his own company
limo because he's such a big star now.</LD>
<TE>   Usually, at these things, you have a couple of Olympic moments,
the kind that rekindle your spirit and restore your faith in humanity
and make little tears well up in your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   I think NBC stole all those this time. My fire within was not
lighted. My matches must have gotten wet.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there were moments. The opening ceremony, even via TV
in the press center, was amazing and moving. The moment of the Games
may have been when they carried in the tattered flag from the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   You could hear nothing but the footsteps of the flag-carriers. It
was powerful because of something few of the NBC announcers will ever
learn: Silence is golden.</TE>
<TE>   The nightly show you got at home was beautifully presented and
packaged. NBC could squeeze a tear of emotion out of Hannibal Lecter.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ebersol, the NBC boss and Olympic genius, knows how to do
this better than anyone and makes his company tons of money in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect people watching at home love all that overcoming odds
and coming back from adversity and doing it for Mom (or Dad, or
cousin Johnnie or Fido).</TE>
<TE>   The ratings clearly show that. NBC has borrowed nicely for tone
from the old ABC "Wide World of Sports," making each telecast the
Thrill of Victory and the Agony of Defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Down on the streets of Salt Lake, away from Bob Costas' fireplace,
it was more like the Thrill of Victory and the Agony of the Metal
Detectors.</TE>
<TE>   The only place you didn't set off beeps here was the entrance to
the men's room and McDonald's, where they would have been handy for
cholesterol control.</TE>
<TE>   We worked hard, chronicling the various ramblings of the French
figure skating judge and the various whinings of the Russians, South
Koreans, Lithuanians and Eric Heidens.</TE>
<TE>   We did our best to figure out the nuances, such as what the bottom
guy in doubles luge does, or whether you can buy one of those curling
brooms at Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Carillo, one of the best things NBC has going for it these
days, explained the doubles luge better than anybody when she
speculated that it began as "a bar bet gone bad."</TE>
<TE>   Another good line came from Mike Moran, the manager of public
relations for the U.S. Olympic Committee, in an interview about how
things had changed now that the USOC and its national governing
bodies have started working together for the betterment of the U.S.
team.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, they just thought of us as a big ATM machine," Moran
said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was my cab ride, from where a high percentage of all
great Olympic moments come.</TE>
<TE>   The cabby, age roughly 50, said he had it all figured out. He said
he would be an athlete in the next Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   No sweat, he said. Done deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna learn that curling stuff and then I'll fly down to
Puerto Rico and start a team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And what background do you have for this? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a graduate of the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So there I was, speechless in Salt Lake City.</TE>

<LD>I wish I could say I'll remember the good things I saw at the Winter
Games, because there were many performances and people worth
remembering.</LD>
<LD>   The power and command of Alexei Yagudin's free skate in winning
the men's figure skating gold medal. The radiant joy of Sarah Hughes'
gold-medal free skate. The teary eyes of Michelle Kwan as she watched
someone else ascend to the top of the medals stand and receive the
gold medal she was favored to win, a Nagano nightmare relived.</LD>
<LD>   Like Janet Lynn, a luminous figure skater of three decades ago,
Kwan is destined to be known as perhaps the greatest skater who never
won a gold medal. Will that haunt her?</LD>
<TE>   Should it?</TE>
<TE>   Her four world championships, six U.S. titles, and Olympic silver
and bronze medals will bring her the immortality of living on in
fans' memories and figure skating record books. And she seems
intelligent and strong enough to move on to other things outside of
skating rinks, in places triple-triple combination jumps don't matter
and that empty line on her resume where it should have said "gold
medalist" isn't so important.</TE>
<TE>   I wish there had been more nights like the dramatic, riveting
women's figure skating finale and fewer nights filled with news
conferences to announce the details of some protest or another. More
days of hearing athletes' life stories, and fewer days listening to
skating judges change their stories about sordid back-room deals.</TE>
<TE>   One day, staking out a hotel lobby to talk to International
Skating Union officials after they met to discuss their investigation
into the judging of the pairs figure skating competition, the
controversy reached its height. Or was that its depths?</TE>
<TE>   Each time the door to the meeting room opened, dozens of TV
minicams massed as if for an attack. It didn't matter if someone was
sneaking out for a bathroom break or a hotel staffer was going in to
install a leaf in the table. It was comical and appalling at the same
time: As one ISU official walked to the elevator, the army of cameras
blocked his path and took over the lobby. Walking backward to get
tape of their quarry, cameramen knocked over potted plants and
scattered chairs, all for a few seconds of tape of someone they
didn't know saying something they didn't understand.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if figure skating will recover from what happened in Salt
Lake. All its dirty little secrets were aired on a global stage,
which could be a good thing if that leads to the reforms promised by
ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta. But I'm not sure judges and
officials will be as interested in reform three or four months from
now as they are at the moment, after their dirty laundry has been
aired so publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Those in power generally don't like to relinquish it, and I doubt
figure skating judges will be willing to give up their power. And in
the end, as long as humans are involved in judging, subjectivity
simply can't be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder too, about what we have done to figure skating and
skaters that David Pelletier would call the time leading up to the
Games "the worst six months of my life" and say he found relief from
the intense pressure heaped upon him and partner Jamie Sale only when
he was on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   These are kids, or young adults, who have lived narrowly focused
lives. We expect so much of them. Perhaps too much, if what should
have been a time of happy anticipation turned into a trial. The
difference between triumph and despair can be the slip of a blade.
How many times in practice had Kwan done her triple flip perfectly
before she landed it on her hip in the long program? Nothing is sure,
in figure skating or in life.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Hughes can enjoy her moment. I hope she takes her gold
medal for what it is: the culmination of one dream, but the
springboard for others where you're not over the hill if you're 21
and fall on a triple flip.</TE>

<LD>The Olympic motto, "Citius! Altius! Fortius!" is usually translated
as "Swifter! Higher! Stronger!"</LD>
<LD>   It ought to be translated as, "Ya gotta have heart!"</LD>
<LD>   Time and again, at these Games and others before them, we have
seen athletes rise to deliver amazing performances with astonishing
results.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Witty is such an athlete.</TE>
<TE>   One of America's finest speedskaters, she is the winner of three
Olympic medals, two at Nagano, one at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   One medal at these Games? Sure, it was a gold one, won in record
time. But still, she missed on her two other shots, right?</TE>
<TE>   Well, a case could be made that Witty beat her only true opponent
every time out. In an athletic performance that ranks among the most
memorable the Olympics have produced, she beat a debilitating
illness.</TE>
<TE>   A month before the Games began, Witty, whose training and results
had been off all season, learned that she had mononucleosis, a viral
infection that leaves its victims feeling as limp as cooked
spaghetti.</TE>
<TE>   Witty had to seriously curtail her skating regimen.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days I only did a little," she said. "Some days I didn't
skate at all."</TE>
<TE>   Only days before the Games began, Witty wasn't sure if she would
skate three races, or one, or none.</TE>
<TE>   First up for her was the 500-meter event, a two-heat race spread
over two days. She talked about passing up the second half if she
felt too weak after the first, saving her strength for the 1,000, her
strongest event.</TE>
<TE>   Then she skated the first heat of the 500, finishing 17th. The
next day, rather surprisingly, she was back, tied her personal best
in the second heat and jumped up to 14th.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I could use the speed work," she said off-handedly.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, she outskated the world's best and won her gold
medal, setting a world record in the 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Should have been enough, under the circumstances. No good reason
for her to skate her third race, the 1,500. But she did anyway.</TE>
<TE>   She not only skated it, she set an Olympic record. It didn't hold
up, and she wound up fifth, but her single-medal Olympic performance
at Salt Lake City far exceeded her two-medal showing at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, "Swifter! Higher! Stronger!" But Witty reminded us, once
again, "Ya gotta have heart!"</TE>

pairs figure skating threatened to overshadow the rest of the Games after
Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, above right, won the
gold medal Feb. 11, over Canada's unhappy Jamie Sale and David Pelletier.
But four days and far too many news conferences later, the Canadians were
given duplicate golds.</CP>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>To the thunderous explosion of a massive fireworks display that
dappled the colors of the rainbow on the snow-capped mountains of the
Wasatch Range, the XIXth Olympic Winter Games drew to a close Sunday
night, an Olympics notable for judging controversies and doping cases as
much as a can-do American spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Controversy, in fact, dogged the Games right up until the end. The
International Olympic Committee stripped cross-country skiers Larissa
Lazutina of Russia and Johann Muehlegg of Spain of their most recent gold
medals after they tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance
so new it's not yet on the banned list. A third cross-country skier, Olga
Danilova of Russia, also tested positive for the substance, called
darbepoetin. All three were tossed out of the Games, sparking protests
from the Spanish and Russian delegations.</LD>
<LD>   But it all faded into the background Sunday night as a crowd of about
45,000--including 2,500 athletes from 78 countries--enjoyed a raucous
closing ceremony that combined levity and plain fun, figure skating and a
celebration of American music, from jazz to rock 'n' roll to rhythm and
blues. The ceremony also managed to meld Donny and Marie Osmond--unmasked
as the voices of the huge dinosaurs hovering over Rice-Eccles
Stadium--and skaters Kristi Yamaguchi and Katarina Witt, gold medalists
from prior Games, who twirled as the rock band Kiss wailed.</LD>
<TE>   "You have reassured us that people from all countries can live
peacefully together," International Olympic Committee President Jacques
Rogge told those assembled, representing the first large-scale gathering
of nations since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   These Games--hailed by many as the best Winter Olympics ever--were
noteworthy for the smooth way they were run. Technology worked. Traffic
jams were few. Volunteers were extraordinarily friendly. Athletes from
around the world praised U.S. hospitality.</TE>
<TE>   The Games were a hit elsewhere, too: NBC saw its ratings jump 15% over
the 1998 Nagano Games on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "This exceeded my expectations by a pretty wide margin," said Mitt
Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Also memorable was the performance of the U.S. team. The silver medal
won Sunday by the men's hockey team--Canada won the gold, defeating the
Americans, 5-2--gave the U.S. team a record 34 medals. It far eclipsed
the previous American best, 13 apiece at the 1998 Nagano Games and the
1994 Lillehammer Olympics. Only Germany, with 35, won more medals in Salt
Lake than the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "A great foundation and platform for us to take the Olympic movement
forward," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Lloyd Ward said,
exulting, "How do you feel about 34 medals!"</TE>
<TE>   The Games, though, also will be remembered for the protests, as well
as allegations of a pro-North American bias by judges and referees.</TE>
<TE>   It started three days into the Games, when Canadian pairs figure
skaters performed what many believed was a flawless program but only won
silver, while a Russian pair skated a flawed routine and earned the gold.
Within hours, the incident had turned into a full-fledged international
scandal when a French judge was accused of bowing to pressure to favor
the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation sparked protests by the Canadians, leading the IOC to
ratify a decision by skating officials awarding the Canadians duplicate
gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   But in doing so, the IOC also granted momentum to other athletes and
nations who believed they had been wronged.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Russians, South Koreans, Lithuanians and Spanish all
filed protests that were denied.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rancor over the judging and the doping, Russian athletes
appeared in Sunday night's ceremony, defusing--at least for the
moment--an international spat that over the last few days featured Cold
War-style rhetoric and threats to boycott the closing ceremonies. Russian
political and sports leaders blamed judges, officials, the U.S. and
Canadian media, National Hockey League officials--everyone, critics said,
but themselves--for their team's sub-par performance, only 16 medals.</TE>
<TE>Security Measures Pass a Huge Test</TE>
<TE>   Barring an incident today as thousands of Olympic visitors depart
Utah, a new era will have dawned in American security--a successful test
of the nation's ability to protect itself, as well as thousands of guests
from around the world, after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did report that early Sunday morning police fired
foam-tipped bullets to break up an unruly crowd outside a downtown beer
garden a few blocks away from the Olympic Medals Plaza. More than 30
people were arrested, police said. No injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the close of the Salt Lake City Games means the end of
another era, one in which the Olympic Games have been staged with
regularity in U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   Four U.S. cities are already in the running for the 2012 Summer Games,
which the International Olympic Committee will award in 2005: New York,
San Francisco, Washington and Houston. The next Summer Olympics will take
place in Athens in 2004. The next Winter Olympics will be held in Torino,
Italy, in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "What will be in 2012? It's a crystal ball. I don't know. But the
[U.S.] chances are there," Rogge said. "The last--let's be very fair--the
last [U.S.] Games, in Atlanta, were not good Games. Bad organization.
This has been corrected here."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge has more immediate concerns. The IOC must now turn its attention
to the next Olympics, the Summer Games in Athens. Preparations for those
Games have been plagued by chronic delay.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of darbepoetin, meantime, underscores the nature of the
cat-and-mouse game that athletes play with testers, and the difficulties
confronting the IOC and the recently formed World Anti-Doping Agency--a
joint effort of Olympic and government officials--in the fight against
athletes' use of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Darbepoetin is used to treat anemia by boosting the production of red
blood cells. The more red blood cells, the more oxygen can be carried to
muscles. The more oxygen, the longer and harder an athlete can train.
Darbepoetin works like EPO, or erythropoetin, another synthetic hormone
that for the last couple years has been the cheater's drug of choice. EPO
is on the IOC's banned list of substances.</TE>
<TE>   Darbepoetin, on the market for only months, is so new that the IOC
hasn't had time to consider whether it should be banned. Nonetheless,
Dick Pound, a Canadian IOC member, and the World Anti-Doping Agency's
chairman, said: "The message is, 'Listen, you can run but you can't hide
anymore. We can find this stuff. We can embarrass your national
federations and you. You are not going to spoil the competition for those
who don't cheat.' "</TE>
<TE>2 Cross-Country Skiers Stripped of Gold Medals</TE>
<TE>   Lazutina, one of Russia's greatest Olympic champions, had tied a
record Sunday with what would have been her 10th medal, her sixth gold,
by winning the women's 30-kilometer classical race. She was ordered to
forfeit that victory. She was allowed to keep two medals won earlier at
these Games.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg had won three golds here. He was told to give back the one he
won Saturday in the 50-kilometer classical race. He gets to keep the
golds he won in the 30-kilometer freestyle and 10-kilometer pursuit
events. Danilova was disqualified from the 30-kilometer classical race.
She had finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   It was all set aside Sunday as athletes from around the world
celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great time; now it's time to let loose and celebrate,"
said Cammi Granato, captain of the U.S. women's hockey team. "It was so
special," said bronze-winning speed skater Jennifer Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a moment of melancholy. Late in the show, after Willie
Nelson sang "Bridge over Troubled Water" as many in the audience waved
flashlights, the Olympic flag was lowered, the flame extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   The audience joined in and sang the words of that classic cowboy song,
"Happy trails to you, till we meet again."</TE>

<HD>Spending Their Way Toward a Recovery</HD>
<DH>Outlook: As consumers buy apace, economists boost forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home sales in Los Angeles County jumped by more than 20% last
month. At a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Newport Beach, about 600 people
have made deposits on a new line of sports cars starting at $85,000. And
at Wal-Mart and other retailers, the cash registers just keep ringing.</LD>
<LD>   The signs are everywhere: Consumers aren't letting up.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the best time to buy," said retired Laguna Hills resident
Frances Fremin. She and her husband already have booked two trips to
visit relatives in New Orleans and North Carolina; they couldn't resist
the bargain air fares. "If there's something I need, I'm going to get
it," she said.</LD>
<TE>   For months, such determined spending has kept the teetering economy
from collapsing, and now is prompting economists to boost their outlook
for near-term growth.</TE>
<TE>   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., previously
thought the first quarter would pretty much be a repeat of late last
year--little or no growth. But now, he's projecting the nation's gross
domestic product--the value of all goods and services produced--to grow
at a solid 2.5% rate this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been revising our growth rate upward virtually every week,"
said Sohn, noting that it's largely because of the indefatigable
consumer, whose spending drives about two-thirds of the economy. "It's
been a pleasant surprise after a pretty tough time last year."</TE>
<TE>   The overall economic picture is still hazy, with perhaps the biggest
risk being the widening crisis over accounting irregularities in
corporate America. It also remains to be seen whether consumers, many of
whom are heavily in debt, can keep up their hearty spending. Personal
bankruptcies hit a record last year.</TE>
<TE>   But there are good reasons to think consumers won't disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate (5.6% in January) remains low by historical
standards, and economists are expecting a resumption of job growth soon,
which would mark an end to the recession that began last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The same factors that have boosted consumers' purchasing power in the
last year are expected to remain in place: strong productivity, scant
inflation and low interest rates. What's more, tax cuts passed by
Congress last year will translate into roughly $70 billion in savings in
2002, and home mortgage refinancings should kick in an additional $50
billion in consumer spending this year, according to a new report by
Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally feel we're out of the trough and starting to head
north," said Bob Grand, a managing partner at the accounting and
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   But some economists say that consumers have spent so much that there
won't be much pent-up demand as the economy recovers.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Leamer, director of UCLA's Anderson Business Forecast, looks at
the spending statistics and shakes his head. He says this is the time
consumers should be saving more, and it's especially so with the first
wave of Baby Boomers nearing their retirement years.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we're seeing increasing spending [in the current
economy], is symptomatic of a myopic consumer who can only see a year or
two ahead," said Leamer, who is sticking by his previous forecast that
calls for weak economic recovery in the short-term.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come out of a recession, you need something to give you a
boost," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and
Policy Research, a think tank in Washington. "And in this case, it's
going the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   But right now, that's hard to see. Weekly reports on chain-store sales
have shown persistent growth this year. The latest report, for the week
of Valentine's Day, indicates sales at stores open at least a year jumped
more than 5%--the strongest reading since early January of last year.
Business picked up across the board, said the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   Store managers and salespeople say consumers continue to be lured by
bargains and terrific financing deals, many of them initiated after the
Sept. 11 attacks and still in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to never have a sale here in this particular store," said
Laurence Ueland, a saleswoman at Hermes at South Coast Plaza. The
high-end boutique in the Costa Mesa mall has been whacking 40% to 60% off
the prices of some clothes and shoes. Customers love it, Ueland said.</TE>
<TE>   "People get in their mind that they can get this great deal," said
Denise Banner, a saleswoman at Fletcher Jones Motorcars in Newport Beach,
one of the nation's largest Mercedes-Benz dealerships. More consumers are
wanting to haggle, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Car sales have been robust because of zero-percent financing and other
promotions. Fletcher Jones wouldn't say what kinds of deals its buyers
are getting. But like many dealerships, Fletcher is having a terrific
year. With nearly 600 orders for the new SLs--with the top model starting
at $125,000--Fletcher already is looking at sales of more than $50
million.</TE>
<TE>   That luxury-car sales are holding up well suggests there's still
plenty of money out there. At Fletcher and other dealerships, it's
difficult to see the so-called negative wealth effect from the weak stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Boyer, a 60-year-old resident of Irvine, said this is a
"cautionary time" and expressed concerns about wildly gyrating stock
prices. But that didn't stop him from dropping by Fletcher Jones recently
to take a spin in a new Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, [business] went in the toilet," said Boyer, who sells
software and technical services, "but it's come back pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   For many people, the shocks from the stock market are being cushioned
by steady gains in home equity. Indeed, the resilient housing market has
been a surprising factor in the strong consumer-spending numbers. In
contrast to the last recession, housing this time around has been a big
plus, especially in places like Southern California, where real estate
accounts for a larger share of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, sales of new and existing homes in Los Angeles County
surged 22% from January 2001, to a level not seen since the frenzied
housing market of the late 1980s. Although the strong January sales--seen
throughout the Southland--are unlikely to be sustained, analysts said
figures suggest there's still a big consumer appetite for homes.</TE>
<TE>   Demand is propelling price gains, in turn pushing more consumers to
trade up and refinance because interest rates are so low. The 30-year
fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.81% last week, not far from a record low
reached last year, and analysts say the outlook is favorable.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: If home sales and prices continue to rise, as some
analysts are expecting, that will spur more consumers to remodel kitchens
and buy furniture and other big-ticket items.</TE>
<TE>   Said Alec Levenson, a labor economist at USC's Marshall School of
Business: "It's probably too early to say, but it looks like the negative
impacts of Sept. 11 may be a lot more short-lived than we thought."</TE>

<HD>Remake for an Ex-Felon</HD>
<DH>Fresh out of federal prison, film producer Bruce McNall is back and
trolling for hits--with a little help from influential pals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1995 comedy "Get Shorty," John Travolta's character, Chili
Palmer, successfully segues from criminal to Hollywood power player.</LD>
<LD>   It was the industry parodying itself in a way that underscored
Hollywood's capacity to file away past misdeeds and open itself to all
comers so long as they have the right script, financing or relationships.</LD>
<LD>   Now a real-life version is playing out in a second-floor Santa Monica
office, where former Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, less than a
year removed from federal prison for bank fraud, is hoping to revive a
film-producing career that during the 1980s bankrolled such hits as "The
Fabulous Baker Boys," "War Games," "Mr. Mom" and "Weekend at Bernie's."</LD>
<TE>   "This industry gives you the ability to reinvent yourself," McNall
said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Walt Disney Chairman Michael Eisner--for whom McNall helped
land the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team--is orchestrating the
upcoming publication of McNall's autobiography by Disney's Hyperion
division.</TE>
<TE>   Recently McNall lunched with producer and former Sony studio chief
Peter Guber to discuss his future. Actor Tom Sizemore, one of the stars
of "Black Hawk Down" and "Saving Private Ryan," said he plans to form a
production company with McNall in April. McNall also remains friends with
such well-known industry executives as producer Dick Zanuck.</TE>
<TE>   "He still is as vibrant and creative in the aftermath of what he
experienced as he was before it all happened," Zanuck said.</TE>
<TE>   McNall worked his contacts while serving his time, writing scores of
letters, complete with pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed the writing from prison. I enjoyed the creative aspect of
it. When I got out, some of the producers said, 'Gee, we should do
something based on your writings,' " McNall said in his first interview
since being released.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner said he was fascinated and amused by the details in the
twice-a-year letters McNall sent him. They convinced him that his friend
had more than a Hollywood tell-all in him. He saw a richly detailed story
of one man's spectacular fall that reflected an era of fast money.</TE>
<TE>   Besides getting a book out of McNall, Eisner has something else: a
wallet McNall made for him in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like something a kid would make at camp," Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Like other producers, McNall is looking for a hit that brings a
financial windfall. But unlike the others, he needs the money to pay $5
million in court-ordered restitution to victims of his fraud. Amid the
schmoozing of moguls, producers and stars, McNall's call sheet also
includes regular conversations with his parole officer.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood can be remarkably forgiving. Robert Downey Jr. received a
Golden Globe award shortly after he was released from prison, and bad boy
Charlie Sheen, once plagued by problems ranging from drugs to
prostitutes, earned one this year. The late David Begelman, a former
producing partner of McNall's, was welcomed back into Hollywood as a
studio chief and producer after pleading guilty to forging checks in one
of the industry's most notorious scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But moving from the big house to the big screen is no easy task. Even
without a criminal past, McNall's comeback would be an uphill struggle.
Despite some successes, McNall at his peak was not in the ranks of A-list
film producers such as Brian Grazer, Scott Rudin and Jerry Bruckheimer.</TE>
<TE>   His roles as head of Sherwood Productions and Gladden Entertainment
typically involved financing films, something that has become more
difficult in recent years as foreign financing has dried up and studios
have clamped down on costs. What's more, the business is now populated by
fresh young stars, many of whom were in grade school when McNall, 51,
last produced a film, more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He isn't Michael Jordan trying to make a comeback," said Guber,
McNall's longtime friend. "He's had no proximity to Hollywood for the
last five years, and proximity is power. You also have to recognize where
he is in his age. For a guy over 35 or 40 to hang out with people who are
21 at bars, parties and restaurants--it's a real challenge."</TE>
<TE>Most Visible Role</TE>
<TE>   Even in Los Angeles, producing always took a back seat publicly to
McNall's most visible role. As owner of the Kings and as chairman of the
National Hockey League board of governors, he became one of the most
powerful figures in sports during the early 1990s. It was McNall who
lured superstar Wayne Gretzky to the Kings, guiding the franchise in 1993
to what remains its only Stanley Cup finals in 35 years. (The Kings lost
the series, 4-1, to the Montreal Canadiens.)</TE>
<TE>   Those were his glory days. At any given time at the Forum, he could be
seen laughing with the likes of actors Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn or
sitting with dignitaries, including former President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   But McNall's business empire proved a house of cards, leading to a
guilty plea on four criminal counts related to bank fraud of more than
$236 million. Among other things, McNall inflated his net worth, even
listing dead horses as collateral.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced in 1997 and served four years of a 70-month sentence
in prisons in California, Arizona, Oklahoma and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give up control, which was hard for a person like myself
who was had always been in control of everything around me," McNall said.</TE>
<TE>Complex Collapse</TE>
<TE>   McNall's financial collapse was so complex that it is only now
wrapping up in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Trustee R. Todd Nielson praises
McNall for taking responsibility for his crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Through this entire process he was very truthful," Nielson said. "We
reviewed $2.5 billion that flowed through Bruce's empire. I never caught
him in a lie. He's told me what he did was wrong. He's paid his price."</TE>
<TE>   A coin collector since he was a child in Arcadia, McNall started his
business career by amassing one of the nation's largest rare coin
operations. He founded Sherwood Productions in 1982 and soon hired
disgraced studio executive Begelman to run it for him.</TE>
<TE>   Begelman renamed the company Gladden Entertainment after his then-wife
Gladyce. But Gladden, which produced its last film in 1991, fell into
trouble under Begelman's watch and eventually collapsed along with
McNall's other companies. Begelman committed suicide in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   McNall is reentering the industry from an office six blocks from Santa
Monica Pier, a considerable step up from his most recent addresses. After
his release last March, McNall spent two months in a dingy, motel-like
halfway house at Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. He spent four more
months under court-supervised house detention.</TE>
<TE>   His office looks as though time stopped when he entered prison, filled
with memories of the good times. On one wall is a plaque commemorating
Michelle Pfeiffer's best-actress nomination for "The Fabulous Baker
Boys." There are awards from the NHL and pictures of thoroughbreds McNall
once owned as they galloped toward the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   The place also is a virtual shrine to Gretzky, with pictures
throughout, including one of McNall, Gretzky and the late actor John
Candy superimposed over the Toronto Skydome at the time the three bought
the Toronto Argonauts football team.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky has remained loyal even though McNall's guilty plea included
admitting he deceived Gretzky on a horse investment. The Hall of Famer
delayed the retirement of his jersey by the Kings until McNall was out of
prison so he could attend the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "He's paid his debt to society, and we're happy he's back in Los
Angeles," Gretzky said. "Bruce is a good person, and we're sure
everything will work out for him."</TE>
<TE>   In his new job, McNall has no title yet but is functioning as the
chief creative executive for Fine Arts Entertainment. He recently formed
the company with producer and former business partner Alan Salke and
Robert Geringer, a lawyer who has emerged as one of McNall's closest
friends and his chief benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   McNall said he won't be handling the company funds because "I don't
believe I'm a good businessman"--and because his criminal record and past
lies might scare off some investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always out there," he said of his conviction. "I've told people
a lot of things in the past that didn't work. Actions are the only things
that will make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Sizemore, a lifelong hockey fan who said he was fascinated with McNall
even before meeting him, said he has no qualms about getting into
business with McNall. The production company they will form will fall
under the umbrella of Fine Arts as a vehicle for films in which Sizemore
can both star and direct, the actor said.</TE>
<TE>   "I always saw Bruce as a tragic figure who took a Shakespearean kind
of fall," Sizemore said. "I totally trust him, and not because he said I
could. I don't have those fears."</TE>
<TE>Victims Were Banks</TE>
<TE>   Since McNall's financial victims were mostly banks, some of which
don't exist anymore, he doesn't face the kind of animosity that he would
had his crime involved fleecing small investors. But his crimes did drag
down 10 of his associates, who ended up pleading guilty to various
crimes. Dozens of other employees abruptly lost their jobs when his
empire collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people believed in him at a time when his public face was
not backed up by his resources. His crimes are public record, and most
people will weigh what he's bringing to the table with his past history,"
said lawyer Robert Corbin, who represented McNall employee C. David
Rossen, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   McNall also said he is trying hard to repair his torn relationship
with his former wife Jane Cody and their two children. The family was
blindsided by his financial collapse. In 1995, Jane held an embarrassing
yard sale of McNall's things, including 300 neckties, to raise money.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cody said she's owed $3.9 million plus interest by
McNall under the terms of their divorce, which revealed that McNall had
forged her name on documents to tap into community property.</TE>
<TE>   She said that as a result she nearly lost a house she owned before
they were married and has been working as an associate dean at USC to
support their children as a single mother. She also said she still has
some neckties and Kings memorabilia she's willing to sell to raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a rough road, especially for the children, not only because
he was absent for so long but also because of the trauma of having a
father in prison and the very radical financial changes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She credits her former husband with making an effort to repair the
damage he caused the children, a son in high school and a daughter at the
University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "He has extended himself for them, and that will go a long way toward
healing things," Cody said. "But there still is a lot of healing to do."</TE>
<TE>   McNall today lives in a Malibu condominium owned by partner Geringer
and drives Pacific Coast Highway in a 1997 BMW that Geringer lets him
use. He's back to wearing his trademark dark suits, albeit on a frame 85
pounds lighter, the result of prison food and workouts. Accepting a
compliment on his new look, he said he wouldn't recommend his weight-loss
regimen to anyone.</TE>
<TE>Job Offers in Sports</TE>
<TE>   McNall said he entertained job offers in sports and hockey after
leaving prison but resisted because "it would be like an old broken-down
fighter trying to reinvent something."</TE>
<TE>   When he attends hockey games, McNall sits in a luxury box that he said
he guaranteed Gretzky as part of their last contract negotiation. Until
the season opener in October, McNall had never seen Staples Center, which
was built and opened while he was in prison.</TE>
<TE>   McNall knows he has a long way to go before he fully regains his life,
especially with a restitution bill of millions of dollars. So far even
the autobiography hasn't helped, since nearly all of the advance goes to
co-writer Michael D'Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   He once owned a 727 jet and seven homes and told banks he was worth
$133 million. For the last five years, his jobs have included operating a
tractor, stacking sandbags, working as a clerk in a warehouse and other
menial prison labor. Whatever money he earned was applied to his debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Twelve cents an hour," he said, "isn't a lot."</TE>

<DL>JAMMU, India
</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani terrorist who Indian police say admitted to aiding the
1993 street war against U.S. forces in Somalia may be the long-suspected
link between Osama bin Laden and the killing of 18 U.S. soldiers in
Mogadishu.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence of the Al Qaeda connection to the fighting in the Somalian
capital has been sitting in an Indian police file in the disputed state
of Jammu and Kashmir since 1994, when Indian police arrested Maulana
Masood Azhar. His supporters have been accused of kidnapping and killing
Americans in India and Pakistan during at least the past seven years.</LD>
<LD>   Azhar, leader of the banned militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, also is
the mentor of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom Pakistani authorities
arrested as the lead suspect in the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<TE>   In a prison diary on file in an Indian court, Sheikh also admitted to
kidnapping Californian Bela Josef Nuss and three British backpackers in
October 1994 in a failed bid to spring Azhar from jail. And FBI agents
questioned Azhar in connection with the 1995 kidnapping in Kashmir of an
American hiker, who is presumed to have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar told Indian police after his arrest in Kashmir that he traveled
to Nairobi, Kenya, in 1993 to meet with leaders of the Somalian group
Al-Ittihad al-Islamiya, which the U.S. accuses of receiving Al Qaeda's
help to train Somalian fighters for attacks on U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar said the Somalis asked for assistance and got recruits and money
from the ranks of a Pakistani militant group that Washington later named
as part of Bin Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   According to the confession, Azhar was dispatched to meet with the
Somalis by another Pakistani militant, Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Suspected Somalis Were Al Qaeda-Trained</TE>
<TE>   The Somalian group surfaced again after the Sept. 11 attacks, when
U.S. officials identified it as a possible target for airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have long suspected an Al Qaeda connection to the 1993
Somalian conflict. The alleged link was central to the prosecutors' case
in the trial of four men convicted last year of the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The attacks killed 224 people, including
12 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that members of the same Kenya-based cell that
helped train Somalis to kill U.S. soldiers in 1993 went on to carry out
the 1998 embassy bombings, which have been blamed on Bin Laden. At least
one of the four men convicted in the embassy bombings was a member of the
Somalian group, FBI special agent John Anticev testified.</TE>
<TE>   Indian intelligence officials claim Azhar not only traveled to Kenya
but made as many as three journeys to Somalia and was a key player in the
Al Qaeda operation there.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar told Indian police that in his meetings, Al-Ittihad leaders
complained that Pakistan's army, which was taking part in the
international mission in Somalia, "is working in favor of America and
America is trying to establish its rule in Somalia."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Ittihad benefited from Pakistan's decision in 1993, under
international pressure, to expel between 400 and 500 foreign veterans of
the Afghan war, according to Azhar's confession.</TE>
<TE>   Most did not go home, either because they weren't allowed to or
because they feared persecution, Azhar said. Instead, the majority went
to Sudan, where Bin Laden was then based, and from there to Somalia,
Azhar said. The "militants continued the correspondence with us from
Somalia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Indian intelligence sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the clandestine nature of their work, say they also
believe Azhar helped bring mercenaries from Yemen to Somalia with the
help of Yemeni militant leader Tariq Nasr Fadhli.</TE>
<TE>   Tariq is said to have fought under Bin Laden's command in
Afghanistan's guerrilla war against Soviet troops in the 1980s. Tariq,
reportedly at Bin Laden's bidding, then led a guerrilla war against the
Marxist government of South Yemen, which collapsed in 1994 and once again
became part of Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni authorities identified Tariq as a suspect in two December 1992
hotel bombings in Yemen that targeted U.S. Marines headed for Somalia.
The explosions killed a tourist and a hotel worker.</TE>
<TE>   Indian authorities arrested Azhar in Kashmir in February 1994, after
he arrived from Karachi, Pakistan, on a fake Portuguese passport. They
say he was headed to Kashmir on a mission to unite militants fighting
Indian rule in the Himalayan region.</TE>
<TE>   But during interrogation, Azhar also provided information on the
Somalian operation, which just four months earlier had inflicted the
heaviest casualties U.S. forces had suffered in a single battle since
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent Somalian link takes up less than two typed pages in a
confession of more than a dozen pages. Azhar also spoke about his
interest in the Somalian conflict as a magazine editor, fund-raiser and
traveling spokesman for Harkat Ansar, one of Pakistan's most ruthless
terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   India freed Azhar, Sheikh and another jailed terror suspect in
December 1999 to win the release of passengers on an Indian Airlines
flight hijacked to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar then founded the Jaish-e-Mohammed militia. Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf banned the organization in his January crackdown on
militants, when Azhar was accused of making inflammatory speeches and
Pakistani police detained him. India says he has clear ties to both
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency and Al Qaeda, and that his
fighters continue to launch attacks in Jammu and Kashmir state.</TE>
<TE>FBI Had Questioned Azhar on Kidnappings</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also has had a long interest in Azhar.</TE>
<TE>   It questioned him in Indian jails during an investigation into the
July 4, 1995, kidnapping of Donald Hutchings, a neuropsychologist from
Spokane, Wash. He was abducted along with two Britons, a German and
another American, John Childs, who managed to escape.</TE>
<TE>   The decapitated body of a Norwegian kidnapped after Childs fled was
dropped on a mountain path, and police recovered the body of a British
hostage two years ago. None of the other captives was ever found.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at New Delhi's Tihar jail say the FBI interviewed Azhar
there in 1996. On April 27, 1998, the U.S. Embassy asked permission for
two FBI agents to interview Azhar again, along with three of his jailed
supporters. Indian authorities said it appeared that the 1998 request was
granted.</TE>
<TE>   The embassy letter, signed by charge d'affaires E. Ashley Wills, said
FBI agents were still investigating the Kashmir kidnappings, which Indian
police blamed on a breakaway faction of Harkat Ansar.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil, Harkat's supreme leader, added his signature to Bin Laden's
February 1998 fatwa declaring it a Muslim's duty to kill Americans,
including civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden claimed credit for the clashes that drove U.S. troops out of
Somalia, but some experts dismissed his claims as idle boasting, saying
Somalian gunmen had enough expertise and anti-American fervor to fight
without outside help. However, federal prosecutors argued in the embassy
bombing trial that Bin Laden's 1998 edict, issued under the banner
"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders,"
had its roots in the 1993 attacks on U.S. troops in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Months after entering Somalia in 1992 to help end its famine, U.S.
troops were seeking to arrest warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed, whose
militia was blamed for a June 5, 1993, ambush that killed 24 Pakistani
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   During frequent attempts to grab Aideed or his lieutenants, the
Americans used UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters armored to withstand
23-millimeter antiaircraft shells.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 25, 1993, Aideed's gunmen managed to bring down their first
Black Hawk with a rocket-propelled grenade, a weapon normally used
against ground targets. Three U.S. soldiers died in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, rocket-propelled grenades brought down two more
Black Hawks in the Oct. 3 battle that left 18 U.S. soldiers dead and
about 75 wounded. At least 500 Somalis died in the 16-hour fight. The
incident was portrayed in the movie "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   A theory emerged that someone had taught Aideed's gunmen how to alter
the fuses on the rocket-propelled grenades, or RPGs, so that they
exploded in midair. Afghan fighters learned from U.S. and British
military advisors in the 1980s that a helicopter's weak spot is the tail
rotor.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to hit a tail rotor with ordnance designed to explode on
contact, but a grenade exploding in midair could spray it with shrapnel.
That is how a man hiding in a tree shot down the first Black Hawk on Oct.
3, setting off a catastrophe that Bin Laden cited five years later as
proof of American weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden told a CNN interviewer that the Somalis had cooperated with
Arab veterans of the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   "After a little resistance, the American troops left after achieving
nothing," Bin Laden said.</TE>
<TE>   During the embassy bombing trial, federal prosecutors argued that Al
Qaeda was involved in the Somalian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the principal goals of Al Qaeda was to drive the United States
armed forces out of Saudi Arabia (and elsewhere on the Saudi Arabian
peninsula) and Somalia by violence," prosecutors charged in an indictment
that named Bin Laden and other defendants.</TE>
<TE>Army Pilot Testified in Embassy Bombing Trial</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's last witness at the embassy bombings trial was James
Yacone, a platoon commander who piloted one of the two Black Hawks that
dropped troops near Mogadishu's Olympic Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Yacone said he watched as a rocket-propelled grenade exploded near the
tail rotor of the second chopper, piloted by Clifton Wolcott and Donavan
Briley. The aircraft spun out of control and crashed, killing them.</TE>
<TE>   Yacone told the jury that he saw more than 100 RPGs fired at
helicopters that day, and each exploded about 500 yards in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't able to see all the RPGs being shot but, you know, every
thirty seconds or so we'd see the streak of smoke and then the puff of
where the thing would detonate in the air," Yacone said.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes after flying in to help, a second Black Hawk was hit by
an RPG in the tail boom section and crashed when "their tail rotor just
came apart," Yacone said.</TE>
<TE>   An RPG round also hit his Black Hawk, blowing off the door gunner's
leg and spraying shrapnel into Yacone's left arm. With the cockpit full
of smoke and one of his two engines disabled, Yacone managed to reach the
Somalian coast and crash-landed in friendlier territory.</TE>
<TE>   District Court Judge Leonard B. Sand ordered the jury to disregard
Yacone's testimony, since Al Qaeda fighters apparently were not directly
involved in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Kenneth Karas continued to press the Al Qaeda connection in
Somalia. In his closing argument, he told the jury that testimony had
shown Somalia was "a magnet for Al Qaeda people."</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden issued an edict "to the members of Al Qaeda to do what they
can to stop the Americans, to drive them from Somalia," Karas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The specific words that Bin Laden used were, 'We have to cut off the
head of the snake,' " Karas said. "As far back as 1993, this is what is
on Al Qaeda's mind: the United States presence in Somalia."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite protestations by the Pentagon that it wants no part of the
peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan, the military campaign has itself
evolved into an elaborate police action aimed at quieting local warlords,
securing the country's fledgling government and protecting the more than
4,000 U.S. troops in the country against sniper fire.</LD>
<LD>   The search for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar, meanwhile,
has slowed as the number of potential sites dwindles, raising questions
about the longer-term mission in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld continues to argue against a U.S.
peacekeeping role in the country. But he acknowledged last week that such
a mission could become the endgame for American forces, as the military
battles to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a haven for
terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   "It's in our interests as a country to take the kinds of steps . . .
to assist that country in providing a more stable and secure
environment," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   American officials have publicly pledged not to walk away from
Afghanistan once the hunt for Bin Laden is over. But rather than commit
U.S. troops to keeping the peace, Rumsfeld has touted the establishment
of an Afghan army to provide stability and security during rebuilding
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing such an army, however, will take time. Meanwhile, U.S.
troops are taking fire almost daily from unseen assailants, and have been
forced to take sides in a foggy military landscape in which it is
increasingly difficult to distinguish friend from foe.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon and U.S. intelligence officials stress that Bin Laden and
Omar are still being pursued. But there have been few signs of progress,
and the search has been increasingly minimized in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, CIA Director George J. Tenet
did not mention the status of the search for Bin Laden in his remarks.
When asked whether Bin Laden was still alive, Tenet said he didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
"Fox News Sunday" that the "odds are he probably is alive. We will get
Bin Laden." But in another televised interview Sunday, on ABC-TV's "This
Week," Myers stressed that capturing the Al Qaeda leader is not "a prime
mission" of the anti-terror campaign.</TE>
<TE>   There are also signs that the United States is less committed than it
once seemed to a painstaking search of the vast network of caves where
Bin Laden was once believed to be hiding. Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of
the U.S. Central Command, told Congress recently that some caves have
been bombed so thoroughly that it is "not worth our energy to go and
completely dig them out."</TE>
<TE>   As American troops pull back from the caves and get more involved in
humanitarian efforts and helping to build civil institutions, questions
are arising over what their role in Afghanistan will be, how long they
will be there and how they will manage to stay out of rivalries among
warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon insistence that its mission has not become one of
peacekeeping and quelling tribal conflicts amounts to "semantics," said
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee. "I
think we are involved in an effort to stabilize a situation and to help
the government assume control over the countryside."</TE>
<TE>Cloudy Scene for American Troops</TE>
<TE>   U.S. airstrikes Feb. 16 near the eastern city of Khowst, where tribes
have been sparring, illustrate the increasingly murky nature of the
Americans' role in Afghanistan, amid conflicting reports about whether Al
Qaeda elements were present.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe you've seen [with the airstrikes] for the first time a
change from attacking Al Qaeda or Taliban positions to protecting the
government of Afghanistan," McCain said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Rumsfeld indicated that his preference is to help build up
an Afghan army to maintain peace. Speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation,"
he envisioned "a multiethnic, multi-regional force of some number,"
consisting of 25,000 to 70,000 Afghan troops drawn from across the
war-torn country. "I think we will be assisting them in one way or
another to fashion such a force," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense secretary has acknowledged that that option is fraught
with difficulties. But Pentagon officials have suggested that such an
army could be constituted in as little as six months.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Karzai, the interim Afghan leader, and U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan have strongly urged expanding the mandate of a 3,700-member
international peacekeeping force that currently does not include U.S.
troops and is operating only in Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   But despite concerns for Afghan stability, the Pentagon is reluctant
to back expansion of the peacekeeping mission for fear of encouraging
dependency.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that anyone can assure that there will be peace and
stability and security in Afghanistan for a long time to come, except the
Afghan people," Rumsfeld said Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "And
we have to help them do that and help them figure out a way to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has conceded that Karzai has reason to worry about
instability, with rival warlords jostling for power, Taliban and Al Qaeda
militants on the loose and Iran apparently spiriting weapons across the
border in support of opposing factions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a pretty picture," Rumsfeld told reporters last week. If it
turns out that the U.S. plan of building up the Afghan army "can't be
done as rapidly or as effectively or . . . in a way that's
cost-effective, then, clearly, we do something else."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Sunday, Zalmay
Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, seemed to concur with
Rumsfeld's assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the warlords do not want to go back to war--but if the
Afghans want to go back to war, there is not an international force big
enough to stop them," Khalilzad said. "Our concern is that because of the
lack of trust and security, warlords might do things that lead to war, so
we're looking at various options to limit the prospect of war among the
various armies."</TE>
<TE>   However, Khalilzad said, the Bush administration wants to make sure
that the major thrust is to encourage the creation of a national army.
"We do not want Afghanistan to be a kind of security welfare state," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts warn that creating an Afghan army will take time.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that they're going to just add water and create an army is
fanciful," said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the South Asia program
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "What is going to
happen in the meantime?"</TE>
<TE>   The mission of U.S. intelligence operatives in Afghanistan also is
evolving, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the bombing campaign, CIA paramilitary forces were largely
engaged in identifying targets for U.S. planes, tracking Taliban troop
positions and coordinating land and air operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're trying to identify small pockets of potential resistance,"
said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee. "The role of intelligence in all of that is to try to
infiltrate those pockets and learn as much about them as possible."</TE>
<TE>   CIA units were the first to arrive in Afghanistan, and an estimated
200 operatives were rushed to the region in the early weeks of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the agency's presence has not diminished but that the
focus has shifted from military support to more traditional information
gathering. He added that there is still "a considerable amount of
interrogation to do" among the more than 5,000 prisoners being held by
U.S. or allied forces.</TE>
<TE>   A recent CIA study underscores the risk of U.S. forces getting
involved in local political disputes.</TE>
<TE>Civil War Not Imminent, CIA Says</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued a classified report this month warning that the
situation in Afghanistan remains combustible. The 10-page paper, put
together by the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence, is subtitled
"Conflicts on the Rise, but Return to Civil War Not Imminent."</TE>
<TE>   According to a U.S. intelligence official, the document discusses
factional disputes in the country, concluding that "most of the conflicts
. . . have been contained" but highlighting the importance of resolving
ongoing disputes. The official declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Other signs of growing chaos in Afghanistan also are developing. Tens
of thousands of ethnic Pushtuns in the north are fleeing drought, hunger
and ethnic strife, claiming that anti-Taliban commanders have been
inciting people to loot their homes and in some cases kill Pushtuns, a
United Nations spokesman said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Around Herat in the west, the United States has become nervous that
Iran is trying to increase its sphere of influence and destabilize the
interim government.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, gunmen and a British patrol exchanged fire, a peacekeepers'
spokesman said Thursday. It was the second such incident in less than a
week.</TE>
<TE>   With those and other signs of instability as a backdrop, the military
endgame is riddled with danger, defense analyst Harlan K. Ullman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The dilemma for the U.S. is, how do you not commit troops to
peacekeeping but attain the same result by other means?" Ullman said.
"This is really serious stuff. In some ways, it makes the Cold War look
benign. I mean, we're dealing with the most basic human emotions,
passions and hatreds which, as we know, now have global reach. So there's
no simple solution."</TE>

<HD>States Cut Back Coverage for Poor</HD>
<DH>Health: They once sought recipients for program that insures
children in low-income families. Now struggling states pull back, even
though U.S. pays up to 85% of costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing number of states are cutting back a popular health
insurance program for children, just five years after it was unveiled
with great fanfare as a life raft for working-poor families.</LD>
<LD>   When budgets were flush, states from California to Rhode Island were
stumbling over themselves to court youngsters into the
government-sponsored children's health insurance programs, also known as
CHIP. By last year, 4.6 million children were enrolled and the biggest
challenge was finding more to take part.</LD>
<LD>   But as the economy has soured, states have pared back or frozen
enrollments, cut back on marketing and added restrictions and fees. In
seeking to lower their own costs, some have forgone millions of dollars
in contributions from the federal government, which pays for the bulk of
the program.</LD>
<TE>   Parents like Cristina Clerico of Hyrum, Utah, have been left in the
lurch. Her state went so far as to freeze enrollment in its CHIP program
in December after officials determined that they couldn't afford their
20% share of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a lean year [in Utah], I recognize that, but there are
certain programs that are important to the well-being of the state, and
this is one of them," said Clerico, 32, who has tried to get insurance
for her two children since her husband lost his job as a carpenter late
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's experience is being repeated around the country. Montana and
North Carolina also have capped or frozen enrollment, though North
Carolina later reopened it. Oklahoma and New Mexico have come close to
dropping children from the program. Idaho has stopped advertising its
program, and Rhode Island has begun charging families monthly premiums
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we rein in this very generous program--the Cadillac of all
programs--it's going to bust our budget and force a tax increase," said
Diane Kinderwater, a spokeswoman for New Mexico's Republican Gov. Gary
Johnson. So far, the state's Legislature has balked at paring back
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   CHIP serves families who make too much money to qualify for the
Medicaid program for the poor but not enough to buy private health
insurance. Under CHIP, families pay little for a wide array of medical,
dental, vision and prescription drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The program encourages regular check-ups and timely treatment; without
coverage, uninsured children can develop serious or chronic conditions
that result in costly emergency room visits or hospital stays. Families
can be bankrupted trying to pay for such care.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has been a strong proponent of California's CHIP
program, called Healthy Families, which enrolls half a million children.
Two years ago, times were so flush that he pushed to expand coverage
beyond children--to 300,000 working-poor parents. But late last year,
facing a $12.5-billion deficit, he put on the brakes, proposing to delay
the expansion until July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under pressure from fellow Democrats and some Republicans in an
election year, he has vowed to proceed this summer--but has put the onus
on state legislators to find the dollars. Once the expansion is fully in
place, the state's share of the expenses will easily top $100 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>Critics Say Time Is Wrong for Expansion</TE>
<TE>   "It's the right thing to do regardless of the fiscal situation," said
Glen Rosselli, undersecretary of California's Health and Human Services
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, say this is not the time to expand programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is complete insanity," said California state Sen. Ray Haynes
(R-Riverside). "We're only making our budget deficit worse and we're
doing it in the worst possible way."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, which had similar plans to expand coverage for parents, has
decided to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't afford it," said Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for
Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull. "We're not going to expand a program when
we're facing the deficit that we're facing."</TE>
<TE>   Many states are in a conundrum, said Vickie Gates, director of the
State Coverage Initiatives program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when their revenues are going down because of their economic
circumstances, they're faced with the greatest increase in need" for
CHIP, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When CHIP was approved in 1997, former President Bill Clinton touted
it as the most significant expansion in public health insurance in more
than three decades. Congress pledged up to $24 billion over five years.</TE>
<TE>   What made the program so alluring, even to conservative lawmakers, was
that it targeted working families, not those on welfare. And the federal
government contributed up to 85% of the costs, depending on each state's
per-capita income.</TE>
<TE>   In some states, including California, recruitment began slowly as
states tested the best way to find eligible children. But national
enrollment spiked last year, up 38% from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   States used television ads, billboards, school fliers and even home
visits to recruit children. The CHIP initiative became a political
darling--partly because it relied far more on federal than state dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "States had been working so hard to make it easy for families to
enroll," said Rachel Klein, a health policy analyst for the consumer
group Families USA. "They practically competed against one another in how
fast they were enrolling kids."</TE>
<TE>Federal Government Encourages Enrollment</TE>
<TE>   Even in these tough times, the federal government has not pulled back
on its financial support and is encouraging states to expand, not
restrict, coverage. And it is giving governors flexibility to change
benefits and co-payments if they agree to serve more people.</TE>
<TE>   In some states, lawmakers have tried to insulate CHIP from the budget
ax. Some are still actively recruiting new members, taking a
"wait-and-see" approach in case the economy rebounds, said Diane Rowland,
executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the
Uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   But economic realities are making expansion of coverage more
difficult, and in some states, such as Utah, next to impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parents like Clerico pray that their children stay healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to hope for the best and get something when we can,"
said Clerico, who has multiple sclerosis and does not have coverage for
herself or her children through her job at a nonprofit.</TE>
<TE>   It's a risky existence. Clerico had to take her 7-year-old daughter to
a hospital's after-hours clinic last month because she had an ear
infection. Clerico will have to pay the bill over time.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's problem is that CHIP, once up and running, became too popular
to sustain. The state based its $5.5-million CHIP budget on enrollment of
21,000 children, said Stephen McDonald, a spokesman for the Utah
Department of Health. But by December, 27,500 children had enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to freezing enrollment, Utah eliminated coverage for most
chronic dental problems, imposed monthly premiums and increased
co-payments for drugs, lab tests, X-rays and hospital stays.</TE>
<TE>   Utah lawmakers are trying to find the money to restore the cuts in
dental services and reopen enrollment next year, said state Sen. Peter
Knudson, a Republican from Brigham City who is leading the effort. No one
on the program has been dropped, but no new children are being added.</TE>
<TE>   "The program will go on," he said. "I hope we can at least restore it
to the level we had before and then build upon that. That's my goal."</TE>
<TE>   Other states are struggling to maintain CHIP programs as well.
Oklahoma had planned to stop covering 50,000 children enrolled in its
SoonerCare CHIP program on April 1. The cutbacks were suspended this
month, though, because the Legislature cobbled together an emergency
infusion.</TE>
<TE>States Finding Ways to Keep Costs Down</TE>
<TE>   Some CHIP programs have developed subtler ways of keeping costs down.
In Kentucky, for instance, the enrollment process has been made more
difficult for parents, who now must demonstrate proof of income and show
up for in-person interviews to keep their children covered.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho eliminated its outreach program, including TV and radio
announcements, and canceled contracts with Head Start and the Girl Scouts
to promote the program.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho state Sen. Stan Hawkins, a Republican, said outreach increases
interest in CHIP, which in turn causes the state to hire more people to
process applications.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing you know, you have a ratcheting up in costs overall,"
Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Children's advocates are furious at what they consider a betrayal. "We
do agree that costs are rising, but they should not be turning to Idaho's
low-income families to save costs," said Michele Casey of the Idaho
Community Action Network.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever the programs are scaled back or restricted, parents and
children feel the pain--physically or financially.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina froze enrollment in Health Choice in January 2001 after
78,000 children joined the program, 6,000 more than state officials had
estimated were eligible. By the time the freeze was lifted in late
summer--because of public pressure--enrollment had plunged by 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among those forced to wait for a spot was Connie Ledford's 8-year-old
son, who needed surgery for chronic ear infections. His parents went
ahead with the surgery and are now swamped with medical bills that they
say they can't pay.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just turned down for a home because our credit is just so
terrible because of all the bills that piled up from it," said Ledford,
26, whose son is now enrolled. "We might wind up filing [for]
bankruptcy."</TE>

<HD>Candidates' Ads Twist Facts in Bashing Rivals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three of the major candidates for governor have relied on
misleading or inaccurate charges against their rivals in a growing,
multimillion-dollar onslaught of television attack ads.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and two of his potential Republican challengers have
trashed one another in at least a dozen commercials shown to millions of
viewers statewide. Eerie music and flashes of negative headlines have
heightened the impression that unworthy candidates endanger California's
future.</LD>
<LD>   But in order to cast their opponents in the worst possible light, the
Democratic incumbent and Republicans Richard Riordan and Bill Jones have
distorted facts, consultants unaffiliated with the campaign say.</LD>
<TE>   The candidates themselves also have engaged in heated rhetoric. On
Sunday, for instance, Davis called Riordan "a walking contradiction" and
accused him of reversing himself on numerous issues. Riordan, who on
Saturday had accused Davis of subverting English-only instruction, on
Sunday returned to his frequent charge that the governor has mishandled
the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Their ads are at least as vitriolic and oftentimes selective or
distorted. The candidates, for example, define "Enron" one way when on
the attack and another way when under attack. The bankrupt energy giant
has become a potent symbol of dishonesty in business and politics, and
thus fodder for ads. But to campaign ad producers, the definition of
"Enron" includes executives and subsidiaries only when it suits the
candidate's needs.</TE>
<TE>   The squabbling over what "Enron" means reflects the widespread use in
political ads of "facts taken out of context--or misleading facts where
you know that including the truth would negate the point you're making,"
said Barbara O'Connor, director of Cal State Sacramento's Institute for
the Study of Politics and Media.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a window, I think, into the soul of the candidate," she said.
"The desire to win is stronger than the desire for veracity."</TE>
<TE>   As the March 5 primary approaches, viewers are seeing more and more of
the negative ads. Riordan, Jones and Los Angeles businessman Bill Simon
Jr. are competing for the Republican nomination to challenge Davis in
November. Simon began airing an ad critical of Riordan on Thursday, but
Riordan's campaign has not disputed the facts in the ad.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Davis has mounted the most aggressive ad campaign, putting up
six spots bashing Riordan on crime, energy, abortion, the death penalty
and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "You have 30 seconds to make your case," said Garry South, chief
strategist of the Davis reelection campaign. "It's not our responsibility
to get all the mitigating circumstances in there. . . . There's a little
leeway here in terms of how you state the case."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Davis takes some leeway in a spot that depicts the former Los
Angeles mayor as soft on crime.</TE>
<TE>   The ad blames Riordan for a 9.2% rise in homicides in Los Angeles and
says "gangs are taking back the streets."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, homicides in Los Angeles dropped more than 50% when Riordan
was mayor from 1993 to 2001. The "9.2%" statistic ignores the first 7 1/2
years of Riordan's tenure in office. Instead, it covers the last six
months of Riordan's final term and the first six months of Mayor James K.
Hahn's term.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blatant misrepresentation of an overall pattern of
dramatically declining crime in L.A. and elsewhere," said Cheryl Maxson,
an associate professor of criminology at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   South defended the statistics used in the ad. "It's absolutely fair,"
he said. "Those statistics are undeniable."</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, South said the governor's ads against Riordan are
justified because the former mayor has called Davis "the enemy of the
state" and criticized him at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Our allegations against Dick Riordan and the ads we've put on the air
are a hell of a lot more documented and factual than the crap that comes
out of his mouth every day about the governor of California--if you want
to apply that as a standard," South said.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign has denounced the crime spot and other Davis ads
as dishonest.</TE>
<TE>   "He has chosen a scorched-earth strategy vis-a-vis Riordan to beat him
in the Republican primary, because he knows Riordan is probably the only
Republican who can beat him in November," said Don Sipple, Riordan's
chief strategist. "It's a cynical, callous approach, but I think that's
Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   But the accuracy of Riordan's ads also is in dispute. In two
commercials, Riordan charges that Davis took more campaign money from
Enron "than any other politician in America"--$119,500.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Enron has given more than $735,000 to President Bush,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that
tracks campaign money. Records show Enron's political action committees
and its executives gave $113,800 to the Bush presidential campaign,
$300,000 to his inaugural fund, $10,500 to his Florida recount fund, and
$312,500 to his 1994 and 1998 campaigns for governor of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that Gray Davis got more money from Enron than anybody else
. . . it's just not true," said Larry Makinson, senior fellow at the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Texas Gov. Rick Perry has taken $237,000 from Enron's PAC
and executives, and Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn has accepted $193,000
from them, according to Texans for Public Justice, a nonpartisan group
that tracks Texas campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Wheat, the group's research director, said Riordan's ad "sounds
like poppycock."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan advisors insisted their ads were fair and accurate, because
they counted only direct contributions from the Enron corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't say Enron and its PAC," Sipple said. "We didn't say Enron
and its executives. We didn't say Enron and [former company Chairman] Ken
Lay. We said Enron."</TE>
<TE>   But direct contributions from corporations to candidates for federal
office are illegal. Corporate donations to candidates for public office
in Texas are also illegal. So by the Riordan campaign's criteria, "George
W. Bush received zero from Enron, and that's absurd," Makinson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign calls the Riordan ad "a lie." Yet the governor uses
an equally loose definition of Enron in a spot that goes after Riordan
for his role in California's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has run the ad mainly in Northern California--as in the crime
spot playing on regional hostilities to tarnish Riordan's image outside
Los Angeles. A narrator tells viewers that Los Angeles had surplus
electricity to sell to the rest of the state last year at the height of
the blackout threats. But Riordan, it says, "gouged" the rest of the
state and charged "more than Enron."</TE>
<TE>   But state records show that an Enron subsidiary, Portland General
Electric, charged an average of $670 per megawatt of power--more than
double the $292 average charged by the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power during the first three months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ad is based on the $181 average price charged by another
Enron subsidiary, Enron Power Marketing Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "The ad says Enron," South said. "That's a certifiable fact."</TE>
<TE>   The other candidate whose advertising has raised accuracy questions is
Jones, the California secretary of state. The only ad that Jones has put
on the air--at minimal levels--is a spot that features former Gov. George
Deukmejian criticizing Riordan and Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, Deukmejian says in the ad, "has given millions of dollars to
Democrats"--an accusation aimed at undermining the former mayor among GOP
primary voters. It's true that Riordan has given more than $1 million to
Democrats, as well as roughly $600,000 to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   But Deukmejian's claim that Riordan gave "millions" is based on an
additional $1 million that Riordan gave to LA Convention 2000, a
nonpartisan nonprofit corporation that promoted Los Angeles when the city
hosted the Democratic National Convention in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an abject lie, and it's a falsehood manufactured out of
nothing," said Ben Austin, who was spokesman for the nonprofit and later
became one of Riordan's deputy mayors.</TE>
<TE>   Jones spokeswoman Beth Pendexter insisted the ad was accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Another ad with facts in dispute is Riordan's spot against Simon. It
cites "mismanagement" of a collapsed savings and loan, Western Federal,
and "accounting irregularities at a Texas energy company," Hanover
Compressor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was a Western Federal board member who says he was "monitoring"
his family's investment in the S&amp;L but played no management role. He says
federal regulators prematurely took over Western Federal and prevented
management from returning it to profitability. The allegation is the
subject of a pending lawsuit by Western Federal investors against federal
regulators. His campaign does not dispute the ad's contention that the
S&amp;L bailout cost taxpayers $92 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hanover is mired in controversy over its accounting practices and its
ties to Enron, but Simon's tenure on its board predated the period under
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a classic political hit job that takes the tiniest kernel of
truth and blows it into a complete falsehood," said Jeff Flint, a Simon
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan spokeswoman Kim Serafin stood by the ad, saying Simon "doesn't
want to accept responsibility for his failures."</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan ad also says Simon failed to vote in 13 of the last 20
local, state and federal elections. Simon acknowledges he did not vote in
11 elections since he moved to California, but says county records fail
to reflect that he actually voted in nine others, not seven.</TE>

<HD>Israel Eases Grip on Arafat, but Travel Ban Stays</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Leader must remain in Ramallah. Palestinians decry
decision, which is aimed at preserving Sharon's fragile government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel on Sunday ordered its tanks to pull back from the
headquarters of Yasser Arafat but refused to lift a travel ban that has
trapped the Palestinian Authority president in the West Bank city of
Ramallah for nearly three months.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the "humiliating" Israeli
decision and suspended recently renewed security contacts with Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon agreed to review its
siege of Arafat last week after Palestinian authorities arrested three
suspects in the October slaying of a right-wing Israeli Cabinet minister.
That decision immediately threatened to fracture Sharon's coalition
government, where there is substantial disagreement over how to treat
Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   After a stormy three-hour debate Sunday, the Cabinet emerged with what
it said was a compromise for its members but, as far as the Palestinians
were concerned, changed little. The Cabinet said Arafat can leave the
block-long compound in Ramallah where he has been under virtual house
arrest since December and move about the city. Tanks that have watched
over Arafat from about 200 feet away will move.</TE>
<TE>   But if he wants to leave Ramallah, the onetime globe-trotting leader
will have to seek permission from Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials portrayed the decision--designed, clearly, to hold
the fragile government together--as an important first step in easing
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinian officials were furious at what they called an empty
concession, noting that Arafat had already been leaving the compound,
most recently to visit the wounded in Ramallah's hospital. Continuing to
confine him to Ramallah is a blow to tentative efforts aimed at reducing
violence, Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be any meetings with the Israelis for the time being,
whether it's on the security level or the political level," Nabil abu
Rudaineh, a spokesman for Arafat, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Citing last week's arrests, Israel's defense and foreign ministers
advocated lifting the travel ban on Arafat. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said the siege of Arafat had backfired, allowing him to rally support.
And Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said freeing Arafat would
encourage him to act more decisively in reining in militants.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon evidently heeded the threats of hard-line members of his
Cabinet who said they would bolt if Arafat was released.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing," Sharon's hawkish public security minister, Uzi
Landau, declared, "is those who proposed letting [Arafat] move around the
territories and perhaps even go abroad were blocked. . . . Arafat is not
leaving Ramallah."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians officials, incensed, canceled a security meeting with
Israeli officials that had been scheduled for later Sunday--even as small
progress was being reported in containing a sudden, bloody surge in
attacks and reprisals that claimed dozens of lives last week alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a shameful and unacceptable decision," Erekat, a minister in
the Palestinian Cabinet, told reporters. "This reflects the fact that
this government has no political program whatsoever and is determined to
pursue the path of destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The last couple of days had seen the two sides taking steps to pull
back from what seemed last week like all-out war. Israeli and Palestinian
security chiefs met Thursday, for the first time in weeks, and
Ben-Eliezer, the defense minister, ordered Israeli forces to use "maximum
restraint" during the ongoing Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday and the Jewish
holiday of Purim, which starts tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Shootings have continued. A 27-year-old Palestinian woman in labor was
being taken to a hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus when Israeli
soldiers opened fire on her car early Sunday because it failed to stop at
a checkpoint, they said. She was badly injured but delivered a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Ahmed Korei,
was shot at by Israeli troops when his car sped up to a checkpoint
outside Ramallah on Sunday night. The army said the shooting was a
mistake and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   But generally, the number of casualties has dropped off significantly.
Arafat reiterated his call for a cease-fire, and Palestinian security
agents Thursday arrested three alleged assassins of Rehavam Zeevi, the
ultranationalist Israeli tourism minister gunned down in an East
Jerusalem hotel Oct. 17 by members of a radical Palestinian faction.</TE>
<TE>   Israel had made the arrests a condition for letting up on Arafat. On
Sunday, however, government officials said that at least one other
suspect in the case remained at large and that Arafat would also have to
extradite the accused killers. Palestinian officials have repeatedly said
they will never hand suspects over to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "They took a small step" with the arrests, Sharon spokesman Raanan
Gissin said Sunday after the Cabinet meeting, "and we took a small step.
They made real arrests, but they haven't finished the job."</TE>
<TE>   As part of a campaign to relegate Arafat to political oblivion, Sharon
has been gradually tightening the noose around the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   Retaliating for three suicide bombings that killed 25 Israelis in less
than 24 hours, Israeli forces on Dec. 3 destroyed Arafat's private
helicopters, his most common mode of transportation, and the runway at
the Palestinians' only airport. Then, in mid-December, Israel sent tanks
deep into Ramallah and over the ensuing weeks ringed Arafat's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   He has not been allowed to leave Ramallah since. Israeli authorities
rejected his request to attend Christmas services in the
Palestinian-ruled town of Bethlehem, an annual appearance that he makes
as the Palestinians' elected president.</TE>
<TE>   Holed up in his headquarters, which has also been the target of
Israeli shelling in recent days, Arafat has given interviews and greeted
a smattering of diplomats. But it's a cataclysmic change in his habits:
Until he was grounded, Arafat traveled the world at a breakneck pace,
attempting to create a sense of international legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   The stiffest challenge to Sharon from within his Cabinet came from
Landau and two ministers affiliated with Zeevi's political party, who
threatened to quit. By appeasing them, Sharon angered politicians from
the left who favored a gesture to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But Landau said it was important to keep up pressure on the
Palestinians. He said the high death toll among Palestinians last
week--about 40 were killed, along with 11 Israelis--is what forced Arafat
to seek a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, we started doing something. We initiated. We hit hard,"
Landau told Israeli radio. "And consequently the Palestinians came asking
for a cease-fire. This means that this is the right policy. If we are
successful, why stop? Why not pursue this policy more intensely?"</TE>

<HD>Candidate Is Apparently Kidnapped</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The Colombian hopeful and her aide were seized by
rebels, witnesses say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>A minor Colombian presidential candidate was apparently kidnapped
by leftist rebels over the weekend while attempting to enter an
increasingly anarchic zone once ceded by the government to guerrillas for
peace talks.</LD>
<LD>   Ingrid Betancourt, a former senator who won popularity in Europe for a
memoir about her fight to expose corruption in Colombia, was reported
missing late Saturday along with her campaign manager, Clara Rojas.</LD>
<LD>   Betancourt, 40, was seized along with two journalists and two other
passengers as she drove toward this sultry town, the capital of the zone
until President Andres Pastrana abruptly canceled peace talks Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Betancourt, famous for publicity stunts such as handing out Viagra and
condoms on busy street corners to draw attention to her campaign,
received less than 1% of the vote in recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her that things were a little complicated, that there had been
confrontations on the road," said Nestor Leon Ramirez, San Vicente's
mayor and a supporter of Betancourt's independent Oxygen Green party.
"She said she was coming anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The two journalists, one a reporter from the French magazine Marie
Claire and the second a Colombian photographer, were released Sunday
morning along with the driver of the car, Adair Lamprea.</TE>
<TE>   The three told Colombian army officials that guerrillas from the 13th
Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had seized
Betancourt near the town of Montanitas, military officials said. The town
is on the road between here and Florencia, a regional capital in southern
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Lamprea said that Betancourt was stopped by the guerrillas at a
roadblock made of two boxes booby-trapped with explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "The commander told us they got the person they wanted. We had nothing
to do with it. . . . They told us they wanted presidential candidates and
lawmakers," he told the Reuters news agency.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Sunday, no word had been heard from FARC officials to
confirm or deny the kidnapping, but military officials said they were
sure of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "'It's been confirmed. She has been kidnapped," said Colombian army
Sgt. Jose Roman, a spokesman for the military's news agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Switzerland-sized area that made up the detente zone has become
increasingly dangerous since the government moved to retake the area
after the collapse of talks to end Colombia's nearly 40-year conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military and police have seized most of the region's
five urban centers, but vast outlying areas remain firmly in the hands of
the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government issued a statement Sunday saying it had
warned Betancourt against making the trip. It said it had turned down her
request for an escort to the region, saying the trip was too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said Betancourt told him that she was taking the risk because
she wanted to show support for the people of San Vicente, who have
worried that they will become targets of military reprisals because of
their long association with the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be with you in good times and in bad," Ramirez said she
declared. "Now is a bad time, so I want to be with the people of San
Vicente."</TE>

<HD>Afghans Selling All They Can Sell</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.S. Army gear airdropped for opposition soldiers is now for
sale--cheap--at Mazar-i-Sharif's bazaar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The best bargain in the bazaar here is not the gold-spotted lapis
lazuli beads, the wolf skin cap or the Ahmed Shah Masoud commemorative
rug.</LD>
<LD>   It's the GI sleeping bag.</LD>
<LD>   Or the Gore-Tex cammies.</LD>
<TE>   Or the size 12 combat boots, limousines for most Afghan feet and sold
at a "special price" because so few people here can wear them.</TE>
<TE>   In early October, as America ramped up to wage war against the
terrorist-supporting Taliban regime, Air Force jets zoomed over remote
Afghan villages, dropping guns, ammunition, combat fatigues--"cammies" in
Army-speak--and other supplies to Northern Alliance soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Mazar-i-Sharif's markets have been looking a bit like Army
surplus stores.</TE>
<TE>   Many Northern Alliance soldiers, who typically go weeks without a
paycheck, have chosen to sell their new gear instead of use it. Poor
villagers have tromped into the city lugging sacks of recovered materiel
to cash in on the gifts from the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The items cost a fraction of what they do in the United States--or
what it took to fly them halfway around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Take the U.S. Special Forces sleeping bag, a high-quality worm-shaped
black polyester tube that retails in America for $160. Here, the going
price is about 13 bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Black leather combat boots run about $6.90, unless they're over size
10. Then they're half off.</TE>
<TE>   Need an Army-green waterproof backpack? Many foreign journalists did,
picking them up for the equivalent of $3, compared with $35 back home.</TE>
<TE>   The deals are so good that the stuff is getting snapped up by real
soldiers--Jordanian troops, French paratroopers, even U.S. officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, if I lose my sleeping bag, I'll have a backup," said Army Maj.
Martin Rose, who's stationed in Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. commanders insist that most airdrops reached their targets.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to quantify it, but we're confident the majority of
shipments got to our guys," said the U.S. Central Command's Col. Rick
Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Some shipments were intended for small contingents of Special Forces
soldiers who were traveling light in the war's early days and needed to
be resupplied by air. The deliveries stopped in mid-December, when the
Taliban fell.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials say they're unable to measure how many
military-related supplies were unloaded, though figures are available for
humanitarian aid: 3.4 million pounds of wheat, 2.5 million daily rations
and 328,000 blankets.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of that went to the market too, with blankets and daily rations
big sellers this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Most Northern Alliance soldiers in Mazar-i-Sharif still stroll around
in faded camouflage and old Soviet belt buckles with the hammer and
sickle scratched off.</TE>
<TE>   It's the higher-ranking commanders who are outfitted in smart
American-made fatigues.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm just like Green Beret," said ethnic Uzbek Gen. Abdul Hak
Sakra, tugging the lapels of his crisp new Gore-Tex field jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Ata Mohammed, an ethnic Tajik commander and former protege of Masoud,
the anti-Taliban leader assassinated in September, even secured a set of
fatigues for his 7-year-old son, Khalid.</TE>
<TE>   "A gift for my little commander," he said, rubbing the boy's head
during a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the best place to find new gear is at the southwestern
corner of the blue mosque, a stunning, intricately decorated bright blue
dome in the center of town.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, sleeping bag seller Mohammed Dullah paced the sidewalk,
shouting "Bista sefari! Bista sefari!" which literally means "traveling
bed."</TE>
<TE>   A woman beneath a diaphanous white burka approached him, inspected the
quilted bag, asked the price and then hurried away.</TE>
<TE>   Even at below cost, the surplus gear is still too expensive for most
Afghans, and vendors are often left waiting for aid workers, journalists
or foreign soldiers to buy their wares.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like hunting," Dullah said. "Some days you get so many. Other
days you get none."</TE>

<HD>Angolan Rebels Vow to Carry On Despite Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LUANDA, Angola
</DL>
<LD>Rebels vowed Sunday to continue their longtime struggle in Angola
despite the death of their founder and leader, Jonas Savimbi, but said
the government could open a path to peace by declaring a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Savimbi, 67, was confirmed dead by his National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA, late Saturday after television networks
showed his bullet-riddled body. He was killed by government troops.</LD>
<LD>   "Anyone who thinks the ideals of UNITA died with its leader is
mistaken," the group said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Savimbi's death has fueled hopes for peace among Angolans battered by
a decades-old civil war that has killed at least half a million people
and left millions more homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Savimbi is expected to touch off a power struggle within
UNITA that could splinter it into rival factions. Analysts say a quick
end to one of Africa's longest-running wars is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Though calling for peace, the UNITA statement made no mention of
heeding an Angolan government call to surrender. UNITA's leadership has
repeatedly spurned government offers for a pardon and demanded fresh
peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA spokesman in Portugal, the former colonial
ruler in Angola, was quoted by the Lisbon newspaper Publico as saying
that "the ball is now with [Angolan President] Jose Eduardo dos Santos."</TE>
<TE>   "If he declares a cease-fire, obviously we have a path open that we
did not have before," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The comments came as Dos Santos left for Portugal en route to the U.S.
to present his plans for securing an end to the war. He is to meet with
President Bush on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The army says it is still pursuing rebel units. In a statement after
Savimbi's death, the government urged UNITA fighters to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry urged the Angolan government to call a
cease-fire and said UNITA should join in negotiations to map out the
country's political future.</TE>

<DH>Zimbabwe: Militants with clubs and rocks attack people leaving a
rally for candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of followers of President Robert Mugabe ambushed people
leaving an election campaign rally Sunday where opposition leader Morgan
Tsvangirai vowed to end a "reign of terror" if he took power.</LD>
<LD>   The militants, armed with clubs and stones, also threw rocks at cars
leaving Chinhoyi, Mugabe's hometown, including one that observers from
the Southern African Development Community said was carrying members of
their election monitoring team.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as Tsvangirai left the stadium in Chinhoyi, more than 500
supporters of Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front, or ZANU-PF, party swarmed the exit and attacked sympathizers of
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change.</LD>
<TE>   The attack occurred in full view of foreign observers who are here for
the March 9-10 election.</TE>
<TE>   "The violence is likely to continue right up until the day before
elections," said Lovemore Madhuku, chairman of the National
Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai is mounting the strongest challenge Mugabe has faced since
taking power on independence from Britain in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   He accuses the president of intimidation and planning to rig the vote,
criticisms echoed by the United States and European Union, which have
imposed personal sanctions on Mugabe and his inner circle. The EU pulled
out its election monitors last week.</TE>
<TE>   Police dispersed the ZANU-PF crowd at Chinhoyi stadium. But militants
later regrouped along the road leading out of the town toward the
capital, Harare, hurling rocks at motorists and smashing windows of at
least three cars.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai said the ruling party was acting like "animals."</TE>
<TE>   "We will not allow [them] to run around the country like wild
animals," the MDC leader told the rally in Chinhoyi, a ZANU-PF
stronghold. "[Mugabe] wants to be the only choice, and he wants to
achieve that even through his reign of terror.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to inherit a country in a mess, a country that has been
raped by political violence."</TE>
<TE>   Chinhoyi, about 70 miles northwest of Harare, was the scene of
fighting last August when Mugabe's supporters forcibly seized white-owned
farms as part of the president's controversial land-reform program.</TE>
<TE>   Other observers from southern Africa have said a wave of political
violence threatened chances for a free and fair vote.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, two South Africans were trapped in an MDC office by 200
pro-government militants armed with stones and iron bars in the first
incident involving election monitors.</TE>
<TE>   They were not hurt, but the MDC said five of its supporters were
injured in the attack and more than 100 had been killed since last
February, when the farm seizures began.</TE>

<HD>Moldovans Rally Against Leaders</HD>
<DH>Europe: About 70,000 pour into the capital to call for the
Communist government to resign.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHISINAU, Moldova
</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of Moldovans streamed into this capital Sunday,
answering nationalists' calls for a show of people power to try to
overthrow the Communist government.</LD>
<LD>   Carrying banners reading, "Stop the Red Terror!" and "The Communists
Are Terrorists," an estimated 70,000 people from the 4-million population
poured into Chisinau's central square.</LD>
<LD>   Yurie Rosca, leader of the Christian Democratic People's Party, the
driving force behind the protests, told the crowd that the rallies would
continue until the government fell.</LD>
<TE>   "We will keep protesting as long as is necessary to bring down this
dictatorial regime. . . . We will come to this square every day. Our
protests will be peaceful," Rosca shouted from a stage erected in front
of the Parliament building.</TE>
<TE>   Police cordoned off the building, but there were few other officers
deployed at the demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of nationalists, schoolchildren and students have
protested since January against the government's pro-Russia policies,
which they fear will play down Moldova's cultural and linguistic links
with neighboring Romania. They worry that the Communists, who control
more than two-thirds of Parliament and all ministerial posts, want
Moldova, a former Soviet republic, back in the Kremlin's orbit.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrations, initially dominated by young people, began as an
outcry against plans to force children to learn Russian in schools and to
rewrite history textbooks. The rallies have shifted focus to call for the
government's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The Communists, in power since last February after a landslide
election victory driven by promises to fight poverty, have so far
tolerated the rallies and last week backed down on the language and
textbook plans.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the country is facing economic collapse, with the
protests piling pressure on a government wrestling with crippling foreign
debt and pleading for funds from hesitant foreign lenders. Many
economists feel that Moldova is heading for a debt default and will need
bailing out.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>President Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan said Sunday that he
was returning to Washington with an urgent message that America must move
quickly to improve security in a country where a Cabinet minister was
only recently slain in public and warlords and their armies are at one
another's throats.</LD>
<LD>   The greatest long-term threat to the country's stability is the large
number of armed men commanded by rival warlords, Zalmay Khalilzad said,
but the "assassination" of the aviation minister Feb. 14 was a "setback"
to the struggling interim government.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, diplomatic sources said the interim government suspected
that the minister for civil aviation and tourism, Abdul Rahman, had been
overcharging Muslim pilgrims traveling to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for the
annual hajj. Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai has told Cabinet
ministers that he intends to publicly "name names" of government
officials allegedly involved with Rahman in overcharging pilgrims and
pocketing the profits, the sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Khalilzad made it clear that the Bush administration believes that the
interim government was handling the matter properly after an initially
chaotic response in which officials, including Karzai, gave conflicting
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that senior people have been implicated [in the killing] and
the government is talking about following a judicial process openly is
good," Khalilzad told reporters at the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy in
Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, armed U.S. Marines and plainclothes American security
officers flanked the small group of journalists on the embassy steps.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad appeared to agree with Karzai's view that the killing was
premeditated, and he played down the divisions within the government
about the event.</TE>
<TE>   "The major overall challenge is how to prevent a return to warlordism,
" he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, diplomatic sources said a deep divide remained within the
Cabinet over Rahman's slaying. Karzai continues to believe it involved a
conspiracy by high-level security officials, while Foreign Minister
Abdullah has said it was a spontaneous act of rage by pilgrims who had
waited two days for flights to Mecca arranged by Rahman's ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Three senior security officials are being sought in Saudi Arabia, and
three others have been arrested in Kabul. Rahman was widely suspected
within the government of corruption, and Karzai had frequently complained
about his performance but was unable to fire him because the appointment
of government ministers was brokered in the peace negotiations in Bonn,
diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, upon arriving on a domestic flight the day Rahman was killed,
recognized the potential for an explosive situation among the delayed
pilgrims. He assured them that their flights would take off and said they
should demand answers from Rahman before he boarded his own flight to
India. Rahman was stabbed to death aboard his plane, and his body was
tossed to the tarmac, where it was pummeled by angry pilgrims.</TE>
<TE>   Ministers who support the exiled Afghan king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, as
well as some of the ethnic Pushtuns in the Cabinet, are "absolutely
terrified" that they too could be assassination targets, and they have
begged U.S. authorities for more protection, a diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad said the Bush administration was aware of the fragility of
the security situation in the country and was considering several options
to help improve it.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility would be to back the expansion of the peacekeeping
force, known as the International Security Assistance Force--a move
Karzai has requested--so troops could be deployed outside Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   But Khalilzad ruled out any role for U.S. military forces among the
peacekeepers. There are long-standing fears that American soldiers would
be put at too much risk if they had the highly visible job of
peacekeeping. However, the United States would continue to give
intelligence and logistical support to the force as well as provide
rescue services if ISAF troops were in danger, Khalilzad said.</TE>
<TE>   A second option would be to ask the U.S. Special Forces troops on the
ground to expand their mission to include attempting to forestall
conflicts between warlords.</TE>
<TE>   A third possibility would be to bring in military advisors to act as
negotiators between warlords. It is likely that different options will be
pursued in different parts of the country, Khalilzad said.</TE>

<HD>Hunt in Reporter Case May Broaden</HD>
<DH>Asia: Daniel Pearl's kidnappers are believed to have fled Pakistan.
U.S. says it had eye on top suspect before abduction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Muslim extremists suspected in the killing of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl may have slipped out of the country, possibly to
their home bases in the Persian Gulf region, according to intelligence
sources here.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators have been working closely with FBI agents in an attempt
to identify and locate the newest suspects, whom they described as
"hard-core" jihad adherents who could be intent on further attacks, the
sources said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a whole gang involved in the kidnapping," said one
intelligence official, who requested anonymity. "Non-Pakistanis are also
members of this gang, including people from the Gulf region."</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, White House and Justice Department officials confirmed
that the suspected leader of the gang, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a
British-born Muslim militant, had been on the U.S. "radar screen" in the
weeks before the kidnapping and that, starting Jan. 9, the United States
formally--and aggressively--sought Pakistan's help in capturing him. The
most recent request for assistance came Jan. 24--the day after Pearl was
kidnapped but before Sheikh's apparent involvement in the case was known.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official in Pakistan would not identify the country
or countries where the suspected gang members might be hiding, or
speculate on state sponsorship, but did not rule out the possibility of a
link to the Al Qaeda terror network.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities here first said they suspected foreign involvement in the
Pearl case several days ago, but Sunday's acknowledgment that the
culprits might have slipped out of Pakistan was the first indication that
the pursuit was increasingly taking on multinational dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan will seek foreign help and is continuing a "close sharing of
information" with U.S. authorities, said the intelligence official, who
added, "We are keen to solve this case because we do not want the
perpetrators of this crime to be emboldened by Daniel's murder."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, the Journal's South Asia bureau chief, disappeared Jan. 23
in the port city of Karachi after he was lured to a restaurant with the
promise of an interview with a Muslim cleric. Since Thursday night, when
the U.S. Consulate in Karachi received a videotape revealing his death,
officials have been alert to additional attacks on Western targets,
though they stressed that security measures already were tight at U.S.
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's kidnappers, who called themselves the National Movement for
the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, had demanded the release of all
Pakistani prisoners held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and the return of the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, as well as
the delivery of promised F-16 fighters to the Pakistani military.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh confessed to the kidnapping during his first court appearance
two weeks ago. He is to appear in an anti-terrorism court again today in
Karachi. Investigators say he remains the best hope for solving the case
and locating Pearl's body, according to a source close to the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheikh Omar holds the key to tracking down the murderers and
unearthing the other plans the group might have of kidnapping and
murder," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official in Washington said Sunday that the
department had asked Pakistan to hand Sheikh over to the United States
"before the kidnapping."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's involvement in the 1994 kidnapping in India of four Western
tourists--including an American--prompted the request, the official said.
Indian police rescued the victims and imprisoned Sheikh and his
accomplices. Five years later, his supporters hijacked an Indian
airliner, demanding Sheikh's release. The Indian government complied
after the hijackers killed a passenger and dumped his body on the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department official noted that "an indictment or a
criminal charge would be necessary" before the U.S. could seek
extradition. A Bush administration official confirmed Sunday that Sheikh
was indicted by a U.S. grand jury several months ago in connection with
the 1994 kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Early last month, the Justice Department asked the National Security
Council to have the State Department request that Pakistan "locate this
guy and . . . take him into custody," a White House official said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 9, U.S. Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin made that request of
Pakistan's foreign minister, the official said. She and FBI Director
Robert Mueller met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Jan. 24.
They asked Musharraf for his help in finding Pearl and, apparently
unaware of Sheikh's involvement, reiterated their request for Sheikh's
capture. Musharraf promised to help on both counts, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the Justice Department had not sought Sheikh earlier, the
White House official said, "You'd have to ask Justice what brought him
back up on their radar screen." Justice Department officials declined to
comment on that aspect of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At least two Pakistanis are being sought in connection with Pearl's
kidnapping, including one man believed to have snatched Pearl, Amjad
Hussain Farooqi. Another, Mohammed Hashim Qadeer, is believed to be at
large despite claims by his family that he was killed during fighting in
Afghanistan. Three other suspects have been charged with aiding the
kidnappers by sending e-mail messages and photos.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM AVON PARK, FLA.</KH>
<HD>Tribute With a Capital T to a Car for the Ages</HD>
<DH>Antique Ford buffs flock to a five-day tour to pay homage to an
auto many consider the most influential ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AVON PARK, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>On a warm and sun-dappled afternoon, a cortege of Model T Fords
chuffed into the heart of this small Florida Citrus Belt town, where Al
Capone once roomed at the brick-fronted hotel on Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   There were roadsters, touring cars, coupes, speedsters, depot
hacks--gleaming vestiges of the dawn of the age of the automobile. Jamie
Bateman, 26, the owner of a store that sells party goods, strolled among
the rolling antiques as they stood at the curb, and confessed she was
dying for a ride.</LD>
<LD>   "If these old walls and buildings could talk, they'd be glad to see
their old friends back," Bateman said. Her mother, Charlotte Cooper, 65,
said the sight evoked yellowing pictures of her grandfather standing
beside a Model T in the family's photo albums.</LD>
<TE>   A group of Model T enthusiasts from 16 states assembled earlier this
month to indulge their passion for what is generally considered the most
influential car of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the car that replaced the horse," said Tom Henry, 63, of
Winter Park, Fla., who organized the five-day Model T tour through
Central Florida. "It used to be a boy and a girl sat on the porch, and
her parents would watch. When the Model T came along, the boy and girl
could take off down the road."</TE>
<TE>   As well as Americans' dating habits, "it changed the whole country,"
said Terry Ryan, 59, a retired brewer from Pacific, Mo., who came to
Florida with his wife to ride in their stripped-down '26 T speedster. "It
opened up schools for kids who couldn't get there before, and jobs for
people who couldn't have taken them before."</TE>
<TE>   For Avon Park, a town of 8,400 whose business district has been
migrating to U.S. Highway 27 to the west, the presence of the old cars at
a recent Sunday lunchtime was a welcome, crowd-drawing event.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, they're bringing life to our downtown," said Louis Bates,
Avon Park's development director. His municipality celebrates its 108th
birthday in May, Bates said, "and we're hoping they'll come back."</TE>
<TE>   From 1908 to 1927, the Ford Motor Co. manufactured almost 15 1/2
million Model Ts, so many that for a time, more than half of the cars in
the world were Henry Ford's brainchildren. About 200,000 of those
vehicles remain today, lovingly tended and driven by a tightly knit
fraternity of the road. They cost from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on
condition and rarity.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the year, T clubs throughout the United States organize
driving tours, daily jaunts to drive and show off their cars. A national
association of owners and aficionados, the Model T Ford Club of America,
will hold its annual meeting in Anaheim from Friday to March 3.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of some cultural historians, no single invention exerted a
greater influence on the development of modern America than the
20-horsepower vehicle that Ford turned out for 19 years with minimal
changes. The T paved the way for Americans' greater mobility and the
explosive growth of the suburbs, but it also gave a mighty push to the
trends that led to the withering of urban areas and the nation's
dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   The car affectionately known as the "Tin Lizzie" was also one of the
most adaptable contraptions in history. Some World War I tanks were
powered by a quartet of the Model T four-cylinder engines. Those engines
also became a vital force in the modernization of the American
countryside, being harnessed to drive everything from hay bailers to
sawmills and snowplows.</TE>
<TE>   The car was simple and relatively cheap--a Runabout in 1927, Lizzie's
final year of manufacture, sold for $360, $15 more if the buyer wanted
bumpers. Ford's unwavering goal was to provide the masses with a better
way to get around.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry was trying to give everyone a car, and everyone else was trying
to make a car for the well-to-do," said Don Reggets, 60, of Jefferson,
Pa., owner of a '26 coupe. "I have to give our ancestors a lot of
credit--the way they engineered all those gears and the other things
going on."</TE>
<TE>   To demonstrate how simple a T is, participants in the Central Florida
tour were planning to reassemble a completely dismantled car in 15
minutes or less.</TE>
<TE>   Not that driving one is a breeze for today's motorist, notes Tim
Henry, 40, of Oviedo, Fla., the tour organizer's son. To give his three
children rides, he acquired a '24 depot hack, the wooden-sided ancestor
of the station wagon created to carry passengers from railway stations to
hotels and back again.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to worry about--you could leave the key in it,
because people today don't know enough to start it and steal it," the
younger Henry says. Unlike modern cars, the Model T starts with a hand
crank, and a neophyte can break his arm if he doesn't turn the handle the
right way.</TE>
<TE>   Driving a T, which millions of Americans were able to do generations
ago, is today a virtually lost art. It involves using three pedals on the
floor and two levers on the steering column. Go any faster than 30 mph,
the elder Henry told the crowd here, and you're pushing it.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Clayton, 70, a builder and developer from Egg Harbor Township,
N.J., admits to a conflicted love affair with the car, which he says is
unsafe in modern traffic because of its primitive braking mechanism, a
belt that tightens around the transmission.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, they didn't get the nickname of 'Tinkering T's' for nothing,"
noted Clayton, who has trucked down two of the cars--a truck and a depot
hack--for the Florida event. "Go on a tour and something's always
breaking."</TE>
<TE>   According to the younger Henry, a full 10% of the vehicles that drove
in last year's Central Florida T tour broke down and needed tows at some
point. During this year's event, an escort van that was supposed to show
up carrying camshafts and other spare parts for the 76 cars taking part
wasn't able to make it.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, they break down, they are in trouble," Henry said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Henry, who admits to having initially been drawn to modern "muscle
cars," admits he has fallen under the spell of the Model T. "It brings
smiles to people's faces," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Many owners point out that as well as having fun, they are preserving
and restoring valuable pieces of the country's automotive and industrial
history. For the most senior of T buffs, might there be the added
satisfaction that something that came into the world so long ago still
works well?</TE>
<TE>   Some of the cars that took part in the Avon Park display were
prominently decorated with this bumper sticker: "I may be old, but I
still get hot."</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Bowery, 59, of Wellsburg, W. Va., can't drive a T herself,
but she rides shotgun in her husband's '27 touring car. It is open to the
elements on two sides "and gets a little breezy sometimes," notes Bowery.
"You never have a good hair day."</TE>
<TE>   The Bowerys are restoring a depot hack, having decided that one Model
T isn't enough. "It's a chronic disease," the woman from West Virginia's
panhandle explains with a smile. "Though not usually fatal."</TE>

<HD>In Heated Race, Minn. Senator Says He Has MS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), who is running for reelection this
year in a tight race that could tip control of the Senate, disclosed
Sunday that he has a mild form of multiple sclerosis but pledged to
continue his bid for a third term.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing's changed at all," Wellstone told reporters at his home in
St. Paul, Minn. "I'm ready to go."</LD>
<LD>   Wellstone said he was diagnosed about a month ago with the chronic,
sometimes disabling disease of the nervous system. It affects his lower
right leg.</LD>
<TE>   The 57-year-old senator, a wrestling champion in college, also has had
bouts of back pain stemming from herniated spinal discs. At the Capitol
in recent years, Wellstone frequently could be seen walking with a
pronounced limp.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone said he announced his illness in the interest of full public
disclosure. "I don't want to be dishonest with anyone," he said. "I can
no longer say it was a wrestling injury because it is not."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have told Wellstone he will not need medication and can
campaign without interruption.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, Wellstone faces a
strong challenge this year from a Republican recruited by the White
House, former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman. Recent polls have shown the
two running a close race.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the announcement, Coleman said in a written statement
only that his "thoughts and prayers" were with Wellstone and his family.</TE>
<TE>   The Wellstone-Coleman race is one of the nation's most closely
watched, one of a cluster of tight races in the Midwest and upper Plains
states. Analysts judge the Minnesota race a tossup, which makes it a
critical battleground.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats control the Senate by the slimmest of margins, 50 to 49,
with one independent, Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont. With 34 seats at
stake in November, a net turnover of just one could flip control back to
the Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone was first elected to the Senate in 1990 and promised to
serve just two terms. But last year he decided to break that pledge
because he said he was not done fighting for liberal causes.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's doctor, J.D. Bartleson of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., appeared with him at Sunday's news conference. Bartleson said the
senator probably has had the disease for 15 years. The condition is not
life-threatening, Bartleson said.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone said he looked forward to the campaign. "For me," he said,
"no stress would be stress."</TE>

<HD>Hesitant Lieberman Encouraged to Mutiny Against Gore in 2004</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>Chewing over Internet policy with Silicon Valley techies at
breakfast. A lunchtime speech to earnest environmentalists in San
Francisco. Cocktail-hour mulling the new economy and foreign affairs with
lawyers and businesspeople at a downtown Seattle office glistening with
blond wood, modern art and funky African sculpture.</LD>
<LD>   That might have been the prototypical blue-state itinerary for Al Gore
in 2000. But one day last week, it was the schedule of Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), Gore's affable running mate. And therein may lie the
promise and peril for Lieberman as he joins the flock of Democrats now
exploring, with increasing tempo, possible bids for the party's 2004
presidential nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberman is potentially attractive to many of the same elements in
the party who like Gore. Indeed, some who backed Gore in 2000,
particularly those tied to the centrist Democratic Leadership Council,
would quietly prefer that Lieberman take the spotlight next time. Says
one DLC insider: "I don't think there is much enthusiasm in the DLC for
Gore. . . . Most of our troops think it was a slam dunk last time for
Gore and he blew it, or at least turned a five-point win into a tie.
There's a little buzz about [North Carolina Sen.] John Edwards among DLC
people. But if we had any real favorite, it would be Joe."</LD>
<TE>   The problem for Lieberman fans is that for now it's a moot question
how he might compare with Gore in 2004. Publicly and privately, Lieberman
insists that out of loyalty, he won't run if Gore does. "That came from
my gut and I'm going to stick with it," Lieberman says.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's clear that as Lieberman explores the race, he'll face steady
encouragement to reconsider. On his West Coast tour, he was
enthusiastically received at each stop. At the breakfast in Silicon
Valley, several executives emerged giving him high marks on high-tech
policy. He stirred his small audience at the Seattle cocktail hour with a
denunciation of President Bush's tax cut. And later that evening, he was
greeted with a steady stream of young well-wishers pledging support at a
stylish Seattle restaurant where diners seemed more likely to recognize
the surviving members of Nirvana than a visiting politician.</TE>
<TE>   It has all left Lieberman in an oddly contingent position as rivals
such as Edwards and Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry aggressively sow
early seeds. On the one hand, Lieberman has benefited enormously from the
exposure he earned as Gore's running mate; a recent Times poll found
Lieberman clustered with Washington's two most prominent
Democrats--Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri--as the second tier
(distantly) behind Gore in an early measure of rank-and-file sentiment
for the 2004 nominee. Kerry and Edwards barely registered.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the prospect that Lieberman might eventually defer
to Gore could make it tougher for the Connecticut senator to line up firm
commitments from activists, fund-raisers and other elected officials.
"Lieberman is lagging behind in the infrastructure assets game," insists
a top operative for one potential rival. One Democratic fund-raiser at
the Silicon Valley stop said that while Lieberman "was incredibly well
received out here," few were yet even thinking about him as a potential
nominee. "The one who is just out here all the time," the fund-raiser
added, "is Kerry."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as the tortoise in this early maneuvering, Lieberman is
demonstrating some potential strengths. He's raised money steadily ($1.2
million last year) for a political action committee he formed to support
other Democrats in 2002, traveled widely (he's appeared in some three
dozen cities since the 2000 election, both raising money and appearing
for other candidates) and kept himself visible in Washington (he played
an important role in brokering the agreement Congress reached with Bush
on education reform).</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, Lieberman seems to have a clear sense of how
he would position himself in the race. One reason Gore picked Lieberman
was his unstinting criticism of President Clinton's behavior with Monica
S. Lewinsky. But more than any other potential 2004 candidate--even
Gore--Lieberman has embraced the policy themes associated with Clinton
and the DLC's "New Democrat" movement; he's even named his political
group ROCPAC after the Clintonian trilogy of "responsibility, opportunity
and community." (Actually, Clinton more often ordered the three as
opportunity, responsibility and community, but that would have left
Lieberman with ORCPAC, which sounds like something from "The Lord of The
Rings.")</TE>
<TE>   When Lieberman departs from the Clinton legacy, he usually edges to
the right. Even compared to other "New Democrats," Lieberman has been
more critical of Hollywood and the music industry and more hawkish on
foreign policy (he's been the leading Democrat urging Bush to remove
Saddam Hussein). By contrast, Gore's departures have typically tilted him
left of Clinton (on issues such as licensing gun owners).</TE>
<TE>   Which means that even if Gore doesn't run, a Lieberman candidacy would
test the boundaries of acceptable heresy from conventional liberalism in
a Democratic primary. His boosters believe Lieberman's muscular foreign
policy and strong appeal to cultural conservatives on values issues fit
the profile Democrats will need in a general election against Bush, who's
likely to be strong on both fronts. But in the primaries, those views
won't be easy to sell to dovish schoolteachers in Iowa or secular young
professionals in New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   Before Lieberman can worry about any of those voters, he'll need to
resolve his minuet with Gore. For all their personal affinity, the two
men already may be subtly jostling. Some Democratic foreign policy
experts thought Gore's recent call for action against Iraq may have
partly reflected a determination not to allow Lieberman to his right. And
Lieberman's pitch to Silicon Valley and environmentalists last week
caused some of the former vice president's California supporters to
wonder if the Connecticut senator was firing a shot across Gore's bow.
Lieberman says he has no inside information on Gore's intentions. But as
Lieberman bustles exuberantly from event to event, a happy warrior if
ever there was one, it doesn't take any inside information to know
exactly what he hopes Gore will do.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform to Get a Rest</HD>
<DH>Politics: Sen. Daschle plans to delay voting on the House's bill
for a few weeks to build support, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Outlining his strategy to win final passage for campaign finance
reform, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Sunday that he
is likely to postpone action on the bill until the Senate concludes a
lengthy debate on energy legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle's comments in a televised interview underscored the confidence
that advocates of the campaign bill have gained since the House approved
a sweeping overhaul of campaign finance law Feb. 14. The Senate approved
a nearly identical bill last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Reform advocates hope that the Senate will now agree to the House
version and send it to President Bush for his signature or veto.
Opponents hope to force the legislation into a House-Senate conference to
stall or change it.</LD>
<TE>   Daschle told ABC's "This Week" that he expects as early as today to
seek agreement to take up the House-passed bill, debate it quickly and
put it to a vote. But it is highly unlikely that he would get such
consent because any of the other 99 senators could object.</TE>
<TE>   The energy bill, meanwhile, is expected to take two weeks or longer to
consider. It would be taken up after the Senate completes action on a
separate measure to overhaul voting procedures--a result of the 2000
election controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether a delay would sap the campaign finance bill's momentum,
Daschle said: "Just the opposite. I think that the longer it's out there,
the more focus on the issue and the greater degree of support."</TE>
<TE>   The bill would prohibit national political parties from collecting
"soft money"--unlimited donations from corporations, unions and wealthy
individuals. It would also raise the legal limits on individual
contributions to candidates for national office and impose new
regulations on preelection advertising by independent groups, such as the
National Rifle Assn. or Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the bill would curb the influence of big donors.
Critics call it an unconstitutional infringement of free speech and a
misguided attack on political parties.</TE>
<TE>   If opponents begin a filibuster, proponents will have to muster 60
votes to break it for the bill to be considered by the Senate. Last week
Sen. Gordon H. Smith (R-Ore.) indicated that he would probably oppose a
filibuster even though he opposes the bill--an announcement that gave
proponents hope that they have the needed margin for victory. Last April
the Senate voted, 59 to 41, to approve a campaign finance bill sponsored
by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to get this job done," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have been weighing
their options since the House vote and have not ruled out a filibuster or
other stratagems to derail the bill. On Sunday, McConnell told CNN's
"Late Edition" that he thinks some version of campaign finance
legislation will eventually become law. But he said critics would still
fight back. "All options are before us," including a filibuster,
McConnell said.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest 20 in Salt Lake City</HD>
<DH>Olympics: A late-night disturbance downtown was an anomaly at these
mostly tranquil Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>In the only disturbance to mar an otherwise peaceful Olympic Games,
police fired foam-tipped bullets Sunday morning to disperse an unruly
crowd angered by the early closure of a downtown beer garden.</LD>
<LD>   Police in riot gear were called in about 1 a.m. after a crowd of
several thousand spilled out of the Bud World festival tent onto Main
Street. Twenty people were arrested for failure to disperse, and police
restored calm in about an hour. There were no injuries and no damage
other than one broken window.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Rick Dinse said officers were pelted with rocks and
bottles during the incident. They moved to clear the street in part
because some women caught up in the crowd were being harassed; Dinse said
he feared for their safety.</LD>
<TE>   The incident stood in stark contrast to the peaceful family atmosphere
that has characterized Salt Lake City during two weeks of Olympic
competition. The city's normally quiet evening streets have been mobbed
by tens of thousands of visitors, virtually all of whom have been on
their best behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just amazing that this [disturbance] is all that has happened
with the crowds we've had every night," Mayor Rocky Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Games have spent $300 million for security and have been
guarded by 15,000 security workers, including 600 volunteer law
enforcement officers from 48 states who paid their own way here. Some
have drawn nighttime shifts watching mountain competition venues in
temperatures that dropped to 10 degrees below zero.</TE>
<TE>   At Olympic venues, authorities report making only 15 arrests, mostly
for drunkenness, possession of drugs or climbing fences to avoid
admission gates. In Salt Lake City, there had been a handful of arrests,
including those of four homeless people and a couple of demonstrators.
The warehouse police rented to process detainees has been the quietest
place in town.</TE>
<TE>   In a city never known as a party town, police officers generally have
shown tolerance when someone crossed the line. People on the streets with
open cans of beer were told to empty the containers, rather than being
cited, and one anti-abortion protester said his bust "was the most
pleasant arrest experience I've had in over 50 arrests."</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the thousands of people who have been in Salt Lake
over the past 17 days and all the potential for problems, things have
gone remarkably well in terms of security," said Bill Rathburn, a 27-year
veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department who was in charge of police
planning for the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and is attending his 10th
Olympics while in Salt Lake City as a security consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things about the Olympic Games is that they attract very
nice people. That makes them easy to police," Rathburn said. "So I was a
little surprised by the incident Sunday. But I suspect you'll find a lot
of local people were involved."</TE>

<HD>Davis Calls Riordan 'Walking Contradiction'</HD>
<DH>Election: Governor accuses the former mayor of reversing himself on
issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Sunday called former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan "a walking contradiction" and accused his Republican
gubernatorial rival of reversing himself on issues.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan charged back that Davis was distorting Riordan's record on
energy in an effort to divert attention from his own failures.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with The Times, Davis continued a line of attack he
has sketched out in an unusual barrage of negative ads against Riordan,
who is running against Secretary of State Bill Jones and financier Bill
Simon Jr. in the March 5 Republican gubernatorial primary. Davis, who is
essentially unopposed on the Democratic side of that election, accused
Riordan of reversing his stance on abortion and of inconsistency in other
areas as well.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't believe a thing Riordan says," the governor said. "He's a
walking contradiction. There's no topic on which he's not reversed
himself at least two or three times."</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, Riordan stood outside the headquarters of Los
Angeles' Department of Water and Power and asserted that Davis was
distorting his record on energy.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody is to blame for higher rates and blackouts, it's Gray
Davis," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP contender touted the performance of the DWP under his
administration, which shrank an $8-billion deficit and avoided the
blackouts that racked the rest of California last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Although Simon has taken to criticizing Riordan in recent days, he
joined his fellow Republican in the critique of criticizing the
incumbent. Simon accused the governor of passing the buck by asking the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revise the power contracts Davis
signed last year.</TE>
