<HD>Nun's piercing memoir of torture and her quest for the
truth</HD>

<LD>Sister Dianna Ortiz, a young Ursuline nun, moved from Kentucky to
Guatemala to work as a missionary in 1987. She was set on serving the
indigenous people of the area. "I'm more convinced than ever that God
is calling me to live with the Guatemalan people in a lifestyle
consistent with their mode of life," she wrote to a friend. In San
Miguel Acatan she taught youngsters the basic skills they'd need to
begin first grade, using an interpreter who spoke the native dialect,
K'anjobal.</LD>
<LD>   Her support of the dialect may have been seen as subversive by the
Guatemalan army's counterinsurgency force, since it strengthened
Mayan ties and Mayans were considered the natural allies of the
guerrillas fighting the country's government. Or maybe, simply by
providing services to those in need, she helped the wrong people. "We
had youth meetings, music meetings and catechetical meetings.... We
could have met with people who were guerrillas -- and we wouldn't
have known it," a fellow missionary notes. Perhaps hers was a case of
mistaken identity, or a scare tactic to get other missionaries to
leave the area.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, on Nov. 2, 1989, Ortiz was kidnapped by
security forces, taken to a secret prison and brutally tortured. Her
piercing memoir, "The Blindfold's Eyes: My Journey From Torture to
Truth," is a portrait both of the horrific torture she endured and
the twofold tribulation that continues to this day as she struggles
to survive the flashbacks that threaten to defeat her and as she
works against stonewalling by both the Guatemalan and U.S.
governments in her quest for the truth.</TE>
<TE>   During her 24-hour captivity, Ortiz was burned nearly 100 times
with cigarettes, gang-raped and suspended over a pit of bodies of
those who had been murdered and those who were still dying. She was
also forced to hold her hands on a knife as her torturers plunged it
into another woman, and was videotaped in the process so that she
could be blackmailed.</TE>
<TE>   She escaped, came back to America and is still working to recover
her life and her faith in humankind.</TE>
<TE>   In the years following her ordeal, Ortiz was placed under
psychiatric care, unable to remember anything of her life from the
time before the nightmare; close friends and family members became
strangers. While she recovered, she was regularly stunned by the
force of memories that left her wanting to die, and at one
particularly low time, she considered suicide. Her narrative clearly
depicts the excruciating path of healing for torture survivors.</TE>
<TE>   The torture itself and its effects on her, though, make up only
part of the book. The bigger story, and in some ways a more
disturbing one, details the tribulations she endured at the hands of
the U.S. and Guatemalan governments as she tried to find out exactly
what had happened to her and why. The Guatemalan government, for
example, initially called her abduction a case of staged
"self-kidnapping" and, later, a hoax arranged so that she could meet
a supposed lesbian lover.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the narrative, Ortiz uncovers crucial
information about "Alejandro," a North American man who had access to
the torture chamber, who gave orders to her torturers and who she is
convinced had connections to the U.S. Embassy. She also identifies
one of her torturers as a Guatemalan trained at the School of the
Americas, a Ft. Benning, Ga., facility run by the U.S. government for
training Latin American soldiers. This man, she believes, was taking
orders from yet another soldier who, until recently, was on the CIA
payroll. The can of worms she uncovers about U.S. actions in
Guatemala (many done behind the public's back) is disquieting and
significant.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz recounts the agony she endured to gather this information
and to present it to the proper authorities, yet the documentation
she reproduces in the book shows that her leads are never fully
investigated by either government. Both seem more interested in
closing her case than in obtaining genuine answers. "I know what it
is to have my own government eschew my claims for justice because
they cause political problems," Ortiz writes. "I know what it is to
wait in the dark for torture, and what it is to wait in the dark for
truth. I am still waiting."</TE>
<TE>   By speaking out against torture and directing the Washington,
D.C.-based Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition
International, Ortiz hopes to raise awareness about the practice and
thereby eliminate it. "[T]he lessons of my torture didn't stick; I
was supposed to have learned that I am powerless, that nothing I say
or do can stop the torture. I was supposed to have learned despair.
But I can't help hoping.... I have to offer all I have and believe
and hope it's enough. And I do."</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: This is not a warm and fuzzy book of faith
triumphing over evil, but a plunge into the pit of malignancy and of
the slow, clenched-fist crawl to emerge; it is the tale of speaking
one's truth at a very high personal cost and of searching for freedom
from lies and shame. "The Blindfold's Eyes" is a heart-rending,
difficult book to read, but necessary and brave as well.</TE>

<LD>Weekend box office</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by blockbuster sequels "The Lord of the Rings: The Two
Towers" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," as well as
"Catch Me If You Can," the Christmas holiday saw the biggest box
office on record. From Thanksgiving to Sunday, the domestic box
office generated a record-breaking $939 million in revenue, up from
$748.3 million last year, according to the box office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations Co. Among films in limited release, "Chicago"
debuted with $2.1 million, for a per-venue average of $26,947;
"Pinocchio," which bowed Christmas Day, grossed $1.2 million, for a
theater average of $964; "The Hours" grossed $338,622, averaging a
healthy $30,784 per theater; "The Pianist" grossed $111,261, for a
per theater average of $42,864; and "Nicholas Nickleby" bowed with
$42,864 and an average of $8,573; "Max" opened with $30,157, for an
average of $5,026.</LD>

<HD>Deck stacked against 9/11 cards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deitrich Curry and Mike Morris</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Card No. 53 tells the story of James DeBlase, a middle-aged
stockbroker with a love for football. No. 60 describes Yvette
Anderson, a religious woman who enjoyed cooking collard greens. And
No. 73 speaks of Dan Heg- lund, a dedicated New York City firefighter
captain. DeBlase, Anderson and Heglund, all of whom died in the
terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, are now part of "The Heroes of the
World Trade Center," a set of 202 palm-sized cards commemorating the
events of that infamous day. Similar to baseball trading cards, each
has a photo displaying a victim or topic on the front, with
biographies and descriptions of 9/11-related events featured on the
back.</LD>
<LD>   Kingsley Barham, creator of the cards, said his goal for "Heroes"
is to put a human face on a national tragedy. However, not everyone
is seeing things in that light. Stephen Push, who lost his wife when
her plane crashed into the Pentagon, thinks the idea of is tasteless.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he is doing it for the money. He wants the publicity,"
Push, a member of Families of 9/11, said of Barham's decision to
publish the cards. "It's not the way I would want to memorialize my
wife. It seems commercial." Push is not the only one to object to the
cards. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is featured on his own
"Heroes" card, told the New York Post that the cards were "sick" and
"despicable." He also said Barham is "cashing in on the city's worst
tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   "More than 150 books have been written on the subject of 9/11. No
one ever asked them if they wrote the books for the money. So why are
people asking me?" responded Barham, president of Chestnut
Publications, based in Delray Beach, Fla. Barham insists that the
cards, depicting 160 people and 42 subjects (ranging from anthrax to
pollution), should be viewed as a memorial, depicting both living and
deceased civilians who left their mark on the world that day. The
cards are packed in an eight-card foil pack, with a retail price of
$2.50. An 8% royalty from the gross sales of the cards will go to
families who allowed loved ones to be featured on the cards.</TE>
<TE>   Barham said that victims' families were contacted about the cards
and that those who refused to participate were left out. He let each
family decide how to describe the relative pictured.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not meant to be trading cards. They are only to be
collected," Barham said. "The only reason these cards are
controversial is because of the medium in which they are presented.
They are not baseball cards. They are just the same size." The cards
are due to arrive in retail stores early next year, but they
currently can be found in some comic-book and specialty stores.</TE>

<HD>'Survivor' boosts CBS' Letterman</HD>

<LD>CBS' "Survivor" again has yielded spillover benefits to the network's
late-night and early-morning programs, based on Nielsen Media
Research data for the week of the show's two-hour finale released
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   For the period that began Dec. 16, "Late Show With David
Letterman" delivered more than 4.9 million viewers on average -- its
highest weekly rating since the week ending Sept. 28, 2001 -- while
"The Early Show" drew its biggest audience since March.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the boost from "Survivor," whose winner appeared on "The
Early Show," the struggling program -- which underwent a format
overhaul in October -- remained a distant third in its time period.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" maintained a solid
margin over Letterman, averaging 6 million viewers. The NBC program
has won all 13 weeks of the new TV season.</TE>
<TE>   The three-hour conclusion to the latest "Survivor" averaged nearly
23 million viewers on Dec. 19 -- over 10 million more than NBC, which
ran repeats of its Thursday-night comedies and "ER." The producers of
"Late Show" have long maintained that Leno enjoys an advantage
because NBC draws much bigger audiences in the last hour of prime
time.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When pop archivists wax nostalgic about 2002 in Hollywood, they'll be
hard pressed to top the Winona Ryder shoplifting trial this fall. It
featured more breathless worldwide media coverage than the Oscars; a
jury that included Peter Guber, the studio chief who'd given Ryder
several jobs; and testimony from a Saks security manager who said
that when the actress was first detained on suspicion of shoplifting,
she claimed she was actually doing research for an acting role.</LD>
<LD>   If only Madonna had such a good cover story for why she made
"Swept Away." All in all, it was a bad year for actors of all stripes
and sizes, especially superstars like Eddie Murphy, who had three
bombs in a row with "Showtime," "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "I
Spy," putting him right up there with Robert De Niro, who went
0-for-3 with "Showtime," "City by the Sea" and "Analyze That."</LD>
<TE>   There was more top talent in bad movies than ever. Just imagine
what it must've been like to wake up and read the reviews if you were
Robin Williams in "Death to Smoochy," Angelina Jolie in "Life or
Something Like It," Matthew Perry in "Serving Sara," Heath Ledger in
"The Four Feathers," Charlize Theron in "Trapped," Hayden Christensen
and Natalie Portman in "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"
and, well, just about everybody in "Scooby-Doo," including Matthew
Lillard (as Shaggy), who will be sadly overlooked at Oscar time
despite the noble efforts of Warner Bros., which actually ran a
full-page trade ad touting the actor as a best actor contender. All
we can say is, boy, Madonna must be jealous!</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look back at some of the year's dubious achievements and
other strange-but-true moments:</TE>
<TE>   Yikes, imagine what he would've done if he'd lost: When Russell
Crowe learned that some poetry he'd read as part of his "Beautiful
Mind" best actor acceptance speech had been cut from the televised
version of the BAFTA Awards earlier this year, the actor cornered the
show's producer, shoved him up against a wall and bellowed, "Who on
earth had the [gosh-darn] audacity to take out the best actor's
poem?"</TE>
<TE>   And that goes double for your personal trainers and yoga
instructors: The invitations for VIP screenings of the new Imax
version of "The Lion King" instructed celebrities that their
offspring could attend the film only if accompanied by their actual
parents, bluntly specifying: "Please do not bring nannies."</TE>
<TE>   He was even happier that he didn't have to see "The Wedding
Planner": Responding to news that Ben Affleck, his "Good Will
Hunting" co-star and childhood buddy, was engaged to marry Jennifer
Lopez, Matt Damon told "Extra": "Ben wasn't this happy even when he
lost his virginity."</TE>
<TE>   Actually he was preparing for the sequel to "Down and Out in
Beverly Hills": Actor Nick Nolte was charged with driving under the
influence on Pacific Coast Highway just days after telling a reporter
at the Toronto Film Festival that "I did a little heroin every day"
while playing the character of a low-life criminal in the film "The
Good Thief."</TE>
<TE>   Don't let this guy see "Jackass: The Movie": Los Angeles Lakers
star Shaquille O'Neal played in the Western Conference semifinals
this spring with four stitches in his left forearm after the
330-pound center cut himself falling in his bathroom trying to
imitate the way "Spider-Man" star Tobey Maguire crawls up the wall of
a skyscraper in the movie. Said O'Neal, who wears a Superman tattoo:
"That's what happens when you cross superheroes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he's never been in a movie with Madonna: Asked about
rumors that he'd fooled around with Sandra Bullock while making "Two
Weeks Notice," Hugh Grant responded: "I've never done a film where I
haven't been accused of sleeping with my co-star except, thankfully,
'About a Boy.' "</TE>
<TE>   And having sat through some of your recent movies, I'll do the
writing too: Frustrated by Woody Allen's long-winded answers on the
witness stand during this summer's trial between the filmmaker and
ex-producer Jean Doumanian, Judge Ira Gammerman brusquely interrupted
Allen during his testimony, saying, "Stop talking. I'll do the
directing."</TE>
<TE>   Trivial pursuit: This summer's Harrison Ford-starring film "K-19:
The Widowmaker," had how many producers? A) 5. B) 11. C) 18. (See
answer below.)</TE>
<TE>   And they even gave Frank the Pug a bigger trailer: Saying this was
a bad year for her career, actress Linda Fiorentino told Variety:
"First they gave away my starring role in 'Men in Black 2' to Frank
the Pug, who's probably living it up at some posh hotel promoting the
film overseas, [and then] somebody sold my home address online for
$37. It doesn't get much worse when your stalking price is that low."</TE>
<TE>   He must've been on vacation when "Pluto Nash" opened: Touting a
new two-year deal with Eddie Murphy, DreamWorks co-chief Walter
Parkes enthused, "I've always known about Eddie Murphy as a
performer, but it wasn't until I sat down with him that I was aware
of Eddie Murphy the filmmaker. I was astounded by his understanding
of what makes his movies successful."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently Dave Manning was busy writing a blurb for "Swept Away":
Weeks before his film "Auto Focus" arrived in theaters, director Paul
Schrader posted his own five-star review on www.Amazon.com, saying, "
'Auto Focus' slips under the skin of the TV celeb and delivers,
without preaching or indicating, a shattering portrait of the
clueless American male."</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of ridicule, whatever you do, don't read the reviews
when the movie comes out: When Steven Soderbergh sent out the script
for this year's low-low-budget film, "Full Frontal," the director
attached a set of rules, cautioning prospective actors that filming
would be a very no-frills experience. One warning: "You will drive
yourself to the set. If you are unable to drive yourself, a driver
will pick you up, but you will probably become the subject of
ridicule."</TE>
<TE>   Now you know how Hugh Grant must feel: When New York City
firefighters voiced their displeasure with actress Sandra Bullock for
snubbing them when they dropped by a Brooklyn movie set to present
her with a T-shirt commemorating her Sept. 11 fund-raising efforts,
her handler explained: "It's not like they made an appointment or
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Personally, we thought it was more like Bud Abbott hiring Lou
Costello: When Michael Ovitz hired ex-Columbia Pictures chief Mark
Canton as the new head of Ovitz's short-lived movie producing
company, the New York Observer's Frank DiGiacomo said the deal "feels
a little like Moe Howard hiring Larry Fine."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: None of the above. "K-19: The Widowmaker" had 20
producers, and none of them will need to worry about getting good
seats to this year's Academy Awards.</TE>

<HD>Stage, screen stars to be honored by queen</HD>
<DH>Actor Alan Bates, director Ridley Scott will be knighted in
2003, among others.</DH>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>New Year's Eve is proving to be a good knight for the movies.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Alan Bates and director Ridley Scott were selected to
receive knighthoods Tuesday in a New Year's list honoring Britons
from all walks of life for contributions to their professions and to
charity.</LD>
<LD>   Recipients honored by Queen Elizabeth II range from stage and
screen stars to a beekeeper, a cleaner and a creator of crossword
puzzles.</LD>
<TE>   British-born Scott, 65 -- director of spectaculars including
"Alien," "Blade Runner" and Academy Award-winner "Gladiator" -- was
honored for services to filmmaking. As a knight, he will be known as
Sir Ridley Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Bates, 68, burst onto the London stage in John Osborne's "Look
Back in Anger" in 1956 and went on to become one of the country's
biggest stars. He won a Tony Award this year for his role in
"Fortune's Fool" and recently appeared in the films "Gosford Park"
and "Evelyn."</TE>
<TE>   There was also a knighthood for a Nicholas Winton, a British
stockbroker who rescued hundreds of Jewish children from
Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of WWII.</TE>
<TE>   Winton, 93, kept his role in the transports secret for decades,
but the story of the "British Schindler" was told in a documentary
film released last year. Winton arranged for trains that brought 669
children to Britain and Sweden. More than 15,000 Czech children died
during the Nazi occupation.</TE>
<TE>   The honors are officially bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II but
largely selected by the government. Almost half of those honored were
nominated by members of the public.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recipients were the parents of a murdered black
teenager, honored for their services in community relations. Neville
and Doreen Lawrence, whose 19-year-old son, Stephen, was stabbed to
death by a gang of white youths in 1993, were named Officers of the
Order of the British Empire, or OBE.</TE>
<TE>   Since their son's death -- for which no one has been convicted --
they have campaigned against racism in the police service and
established a charity to help minority students become architects.
"Their persistence and courage in the face of tragedy and bitter
disillusionment and disappointment have been outstanding," the
citation said. "Their dignity and courtesy have been an example to
all throughout."</TE>
<TE>   The title Companion of Honor -- awarded for "conspicuous service"
to the nation -- went to artist Sir Howard Hodgkin, art collector Sir
Denis Mahon and James Lovelock, the environmental scientist whose
Gaia theory sees the Earth itself as a living organism.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist, biographer and London historian Peter Ackroyd was named
Commander of the British Empire, or CBE, as was actor Brian Cox --
the original Hannibal Lecter in the 1986 film "Manhunter."</TE>
<TE>   Alison Lapper, an artist born without arms, was named Member of
the Order of the British Empire, or MBE.</TE>
<TE>   Theater and film director Michael Blakemore got an OBE, as did
film designer Stuart Craig -- who brought Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry to life in the Harry Potter films -- and
celebrity chef Rick Stein.</TE>
<TE>   There were OBEs for actors Edward Fox, Jean Simmons and Brenda
Blethyn, the Oscar-nominated star of "Secrets &amp; Lies."</TE>
<TE>   Sports figures honored included golfer Sam Torrance, captain of
European Ryder Cup team, who got an OBE.</TE>
<TE>   Many recipients are recognized for strength in difficult times.
Heather Saunders -- whose husband, Stephen, was killed by Greek
terrorists in June 2000 -- received an OBE for helping to track down
the killers.</TE>
<TE>   In descending order, the honors are knighthood, CBE, MBE and OBE.
Those who are awarded CBEs, OBEs and MBEs have no title but can put
the letters after their names.</TE>

<LD>What does a turtle have to do with keeping your computer safe?</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, a turtle wears a shell that helps protect it from
harm. A turtle also takes its time and is very careful when it does
things.</LD>
<LD>   That's why a little green guy named Dewie was picked to help
people learn how to protect their computers. Dewie the Turtle is the
new government mascot whose job is to teach everyone about Internet
security.</LD>
<TE>   When connecting to the Internet, there are things that you should
do to make sure your computer won't be damaged and that no one else
will get information that they shouldn't have.</TE>
<TE>   To protect your computer from harm, Dewie says:</TE>
<TE>   Make sure your passwords have at least eight characters and
include both letters and numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Be sure your computer has "anti-virus" software to prevent
computer viruses from damaging it. A "computer virus" is a message
that can get inside your computer and make it stop working.</TE>
<TE>   Only open e-mail attachments if you know who sent them to you and
what they contain.</TE>
<TE>   There are other ways to keep your computer safe. Tell your parents
they can find more of Dewie's tips at the Federal Trade Commission
Web site, www.ftc.gov/infosecurity.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Trade Commission, Office of Public Affairs, provided
this Learning Link.</TE>

<HD>Museum's fictions stranger than truth</HD>
<DH>Wanna see George Washington's false eyelashes? Or a critter
that's half-monkey, half-fish? Just pay your five bucks, suspend
disbelief, and enter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Foster Klug</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Most curators dream of stocking their museums with Picassos, Rodins
or golden treasure from the pharaohs' tombs.</LD>
<LD>   But James Taylor, who runs what he and partner Dick Horne bill as
the world's only museum devoted to novelty and exotic performance,
has always had other ideas about what makes a good exhibit. "You get
me a 300-pound guy clog-dancing on top of a bunch of olive-oil jars,
and I'm there," he said. "That's art."</LD>
<LD>   The founders of the 3-year-old American Dime Museum have built
their gallery on the theory that others are also tired of the dusty
dinosaur bones and expensive paintings moldering in marble-columned
halls. They invite anyone with five bucks -- and a healthy sense of
the absurd -- to come to their Baltimore museum and gaze on the
corpse of the amazing 9-foot-tall Peruvian Amazon mummy, to marvel at
the mysterious Feegee Mermaid (half monkey, half fish) and, if you
wander into the little row house on the right day, to take a turn
pounding a 4-inch nail into a human blockhead's nose.</LD>
<TE>   The Dime Museum gets its name from the carnival-like museums of
the 19th century where, for the price of a dime, truth was stretched
thinner than the taffy sold on a carnival midway. "Is it real?"
customers often excitedly ask Horne and Taylor as they examine what
are described as George Washington's false eyelashes, the
fragile-looking black prostheses propped up on two small pieces of
wood. The curators only answer with smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it fake?" customers ask about Abraham Lincoln's dried-up,
deathbed excrement mounted in a hanging glass-fronted case. Then they
spot a letter nearby debunking the sample, saying an analysis found
evidence of food not invented until decades after the president's
death.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't mind being humbugged, as long as they're being let
in on the joke," said Horne, paraphrasing 19th century American
showman P.T. Barnum.</TE>
<TE>   "Not knowing how much of what you're seeing is real is most of the
fun. You have to use your sense of humor and sense of judgment."
Every year, thousands willingly suspend their disbelief and gawk at
the stuffed unicorn goat that once toured with Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &amp; Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   They gaze, mouths agape, at the shriveled right hand of Spider
Lillie, a 19th century English prostitute who released spiders from a
compartment in her ring to kill her enemies. "Have you seen the
Turkin?" asked 9-year-old Tyler Falkenhan, wide-eyed. "It's half
turkey, half chicken. Very cool."</TE>
<TE>   Charon Henning, who volunteers at the museum as an archivist, said
she enjoys watching how people react to the bizarre artifacts
bursting from the display cases. "The reaction from first-timers
coming in ranges from 'What am I getting into?' to 'This is the
coolest thing I've ever seen,' " Henning said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fantastic, often hard-to-believe displays, Horne and
Taylor say their collection shares the same roots as the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington and other mainstream museums. In the 19th
century, people depended on museums for their entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   From tiny roadside shacks to big-city galleries, the idea was to
get people in the doors by offering exotic exhibits from the far
corners of the world. "All forms of museums grew out of the original
dime museums," Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   "They all were responding to what the public wanted to see. If
that called for sewing a monkey and a fish together to make a Feegee
Mermaid, that's what they'd do."</TE>
<TE>   Movies, and then television, killed the dime museums, and many
bigger, more respected museums soon changed gears, veering from
common spectacle toward the higher art for which they are known
today.</TE>
<TE>   The last real dime museum, Huber's Museum in Times Square,
sputtered out around 1976, Horne said. Horne and Taylor resuscitated
the form in 1999, bent on maintaining the long tradition of never
letting the truth get in the way of a good display.</TE>
<TE>   In the museum's basement, volunteer Craig Coletta helps guide
people through a sideshow exhibit featuring a devil-man mummy; Grace,
the Mule-Faced Woman; and Fivey, the Five-Legged Dog.</TE>
<TE>   Coletta, who works weekdays as a conflict mediator, also lets
interested customers pound nails into his nasal cavity as part of his
human blockhead routine, once a staple of sideshows and dime museums.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping alive a dying art form," Coletta said, smiling, the
head of a four-inch nail reflecting the sideshow's lights as it
protruded from his nostril. "After all these years, people still like
to look at weird stuff. We're not that much different than our
ancestors 150 years ago."</TE>

<HD>KNBC lets weatherman go</HD>
<DH>Christopher Nance, who joined the station in 1985, loses
his job amid allegations of sexual harassment, which he denies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran KNBC-TV weatherman Christopher Nance has been let go by the
NBC-owned station after months of uncertainty regarding his job
status, stemming from what he says are unfounded allegations of
sexual harassment.</LD>
<LD>   Nance -- who joined the station in 1985 on its weekend newscasts
and most recently appeared mornings, including local weather updates
during the "Today" show -- was suspended in August for what the
station described only as "a personnel matter." Station sources said
the action stemmed from what was deemed inappropriate conduct with an
intern.</LD>
<LD>   Nance, 47, was subsequently reinstated while station officials
continued to investigate the allegations. According to Nance, he
received the news from KNBC's general manager, Paula Madison, on
Friday. "She said I was being terminated, and that was it," he said
Monday, adding that he hasn't ruled out pursuing legal remedies
against NBC.</LD>
<TE>   Nance said he was "blindsided by these accusations," which arose
over the summer when he was undergoing marital difficulties that have
since been resolved. Regarding his relationship with the intern, he
said, "There was nothing inappropriate about it. There was nothing
physical. There was nothing sexual."</TE>
<TE>   An NBC spokeswoman read a statement saying that Nance "no longer
performs services for KNBC. We cannot provide any further information
at this time." Danny Romero and John Stehlin are filling his weather
chores on an interim basis.</TE>
<TE>   Nance contends that the station began broadly investigating him
after the charges and that "ever since then, I knew it was just a
matter of time for me.... You don't stay anywhere for 17 years and
not have some enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Among the complaints registered against him, he said, was the fact
that he had begun bringing a Bible to work with him after the sudden
death of his brother because of an aneurysm in September.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his on-air responsibilities, Nance had been active
in KNBC's community outreach efforts, reading to children at area
schools as part of the "Let's Read 4 Life" program. His Web site says
he has talked to more than 600,000 students as part of his "Let's
Talk Weather" and "Let's Read Together" visits.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nance was honored multiple times for those efforts --
including a resolution by the Los Angeles City Council -- he
acknowledged he's been questioned about his involvement with the
program, since various children's books that he wrote were sold in
conjunction with his appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Nance said he had been forced to charge to help pay for the
appearances after NBC reduced its support for his outreach efforts
several years ago, adding that "nobody had a problem with it," either
at the station or the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Nance, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, was also active
in various charitable and fund-raising programs regarding the
disease, forming his own foundation in 1996. His Web site uses his
nickname, "Weather Dude," which is attributed to what one of the kids
called him when he appeared at an inner-city school.</TE>
<TE>   Nance said his sickle cell relapsed during the fall -- a
combination of stress from the charges and his brother's death -- but
that his health is now fine.</TE>
<TE>   As for why the station would fire him if the charges were
baseless, as he contends, Nance said, "We have some inexperienced
managers that are very skittish about what the people back in New
York are going to say."</TE>
<TE>   Nance did acknowledge that he had dated interns at the station
many years ago, long before he was married. In 1990, he also obtained
a restraining order against a Pasadena woman who he claimed had been
stalking him. The woman maintained she had a long-standing
relationship with Nance, which he denied.</TE>
<TE>   The weatherman also made news last year when an escaped inmate
being sought by the Sheriff's Department called KNBC, saying that he
wanted to surrender to him. The inmate didn't show up for the planned
surrender but was rearrested a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Before KNBC, Nance worked as a weathercaster at stations in San
Francisco and Monterey.</TE>

<LD>For those who celebrate Christmas, the days after always have a high
hangover potential, literally and spiritually, and in L.A. it is
perhaps a bit more striking than elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Whether hauling out crumpled wrapping paper to the recycling bin
or heading back to work, the first step into the post-Christmas
morning is often characterized by a gasping squint and a hand raised
reflexively to ward off ... what? The sun, perhaps, and the dry, warm
wind, suddenly so much more Death Valley than Currier and Ives. But
more likely it's just the head-throbbing realization that the party's
over and that tree and those lights are not going to come down by
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "Never again," many of us think as we step gingerly over the Legos
and Lite Brite bits to contemplate the forest of smudgy glassware,
the towers of pots we left "to soak," secretly hoping a cleanup
commando of elves would arrive during the night. "Next year, we're
going to keep Christmas small. Next year, we'll just go to a
restaurant/a hotel/Nepal."</LD>
<TE>   So there is something heartening about the complete and utter
insanity that is the annual Stats after-Christmas sale, which
continues through Sunday. The home-decorating emporium opens at 5
a.m. on the 26th and, according to Eduardo Saucedo, who at 8 a.m. was
cheerfully helping motorists navigate the Pasadena store's parking
lot, some people arrived at 2. In the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here since 4," Saucedo says, ushering a silver Lexus
into the next row over. "And it is just crazy. The people just come
and come, and they come out with cartfuls, boxes and boxes. They
spend, like, thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't as hard as it sounds. The store's inventory is all
half-price, but a life-sized Nativity scene is still going to set you
back even at a serious discount. There are 8-foot-tall snowmen and
6-foot Santas; there are 10-foot-high Christmas trees, flocked and
nude, some with pulsing internal lights. There are fake fireplaces
and disco balls. And then there's the smaller stuff, the wreaths and
garlands and white sparkly poinsettias, the ornaments, wrapping
paper, ribbon and cookie plates, the yule logs and four-wick festive
candles.</TE>
<TE>   For many Angelenos this sale is a local tradition as firmly
entrenched as the Rose Parade and requires the same sort of time
commitment and stamina.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a lot of people I recognize every year," says Damon
Stathatos, the general manager, "particularly in the earliest hours
of the sale."</TE>
<TE>   Stats is a family-run business -- Stathatos' father, Dan, founded
the Pasadena store (there are now five locations) in 1962. Two of
Dan's sons, a brother and a nephew work in the store and all of them,
along with the rest of the staff and a bunch of folks hired just for
the day, work the sale. So, ironically enough, Christmas in the
Stathatos family is a bit brief and distracted. "It's kind of hard to
concentrate," says Stathatos, "knowing what's going to happen the
next day. We try to make it an early evening, but it's hard to get to
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that there are people sitting outside your store at 2 in
the morning and all.</TE>
<TE>   The early-bird customers, he says, are mostly after the big-ticket
items -- this year, the staff unloaded three life-sized Nativity
scenes, six 3-foot models and hundreds of artificial trees ranging
from 2 feet tall to 27.</TE>
<TE>   When you need a little Christmas or Easter or Thanksgiving, right
this very minute, Stats is the place to go year-round, a veritable
holiday in a box. Even in the middle of July, the smell of cinnamon
and lavender hangs in the air. On this day, though, there's too much
movement inside for even a scent to hang around.</TE>
<TE>   As Johnny Mathis tries to turn back the clock 24 hours over the
sound system, people push carts jammed with frosted fake fruit,
multicultural angels and Santa dolls through the aisles, over toes
and into one another's backs. There is something decidedly Dec. 26
about seeing seven identical smiling Santas piled together like the
aftermath of some yuletide frat party or being shoved in the derriere
by a beaten-metal snowman and a heap of faux holly. Happy
post-holiday.</TE>
<TE>   But as difficult as it is to navigate a cart safely, parking it,
even for a moment, is a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "Our cart was right here," complains a woman remarkably like this
columnist to a red-vested employee. "And now it's gone. Gone. Did you
see it? It had garland in it."</TE>
<TE>   With years of Stats training behind him, the young man keeps a
perfectly straight face.</TE>
<TE>   "Lady," he says gravely, "I've seen a lot of carts like that
today."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in contrast to the frenzied festiveness of their
surroundings, some of the faces in the crowd are slightly grim. "I'm
giving this five more minutes," says a man to a woman vacillating
between holly and pine garland. "Five more minutes." "Yeah, yeah,"
she answers, as, no doubt, she has been answering for the last 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   Another woman, with a cart full to overflowing and a plastic
reindeer dragging its hoofs on the ground, is here without her
husband's knowledge or consent. "I don't want him to know I'm
spending so much money," she said with a Lucy Ricardo grin. "But I
had to replace my Nativity. He threw out the old one."</TE>
<TE>   She plans to put some of her new purchases up immediately, and not
everyone else in the building is buying to stash away for next year.
In Christian Orthodox tradition, Christmas is celebrated on Jan. 6,
which guarantees never having to pay full price for anything.</TE>
<TE>   In the Christmas tree room, the winking, blinking heart of the
beast, two staff members are carrying a 7-foot-tall Santa out through
the crowd, which is both disconcerting -- Santa in full rigor mortis
-- and awe-inspiring -- someone is actually buying a 7-foot-tall
Santa.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like Santas," says Lynn Minidias, a lovely woman who,
with her husband, Jim, looks perfectly normal, although they did
drive all the way from Palmdale this morning and are now
contemplating, albeit playfully, the purchase of a life-sized
Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   "We could always donate it to the church," says Jim, "if it didn't
fit in our yard."</TE>
<TE>   Next to the Santa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest Santa we have," says Lynn of her purchase. "And
it got a lot bigger on the way out to the car."</TE>
<TE>   It is a mostly female crowd, although there are a few families,
including some of the most patient and best-behaved children on
record. "I see the light of day," one father says to his 8-year-old
son as Mom finally heads for the cash register at about 9:30. "See, I
told you it would end."</TE>
<TE>   Braver than most mortals, Jay and Christy Lewis have their three
children, 2, 4 and 7, in tow and, miraculously, the sound of
shattering glass does not follow in their wake.</TE>
<TE>   "They're used to this," says Christy, who with her husband runs
Lewis Events, which organizes corporate functions. "We drag them
everywhere." The two are perusing a display of musical instrument
ornaments and wondering if they would work for a Mardi Gras party.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies have holiday parties in January," says Jay.
"We're trying to anticipate. We're always trying to anticipate."</TE>
<TE>   New Year's may explain the extraordinary popularity of the fake
white poinsettias that are heaped in what seems like every cart.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people like the glitter," says Vickee, a cashier who got
to work at 3:30 a.m. Are people buying big, despite all the pesky
rumors about the economy? "Thousands of dollars," she says. Some of
the purchases are for institutions -- churches, hotels, offices --
and some are made by party planners, but most buyers, she says, are
just people.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where they're going to put all the stuff they buy,"
she says, scanning her 50,000th ornament of the day. "How much
Christmas do you need?"</TE>
<TE>   Just a little more than there is, it would seem. Which is almost
always true, if you think about it. One could survey the scene at
Stats on the day after Christmas and see consumerism run amok. Or one
could take the season to heart and see courage, resolve and dogged
joyfulness -- no matter how this year's holiday went, or is going,
next year's will be better, brighter, even more fabulous and full of
glitter.</TE>
<TE>   And, after all, there are only 359 days to go.</TE>

<HD>Waiting for 'Godot's' humor</HD>
<DH>PBS' film version of Beckett's meditation on the human
condition doesn't get the joke.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Year's Day is, traditionally, a day for taking stock. And what
better way to do that than to spend a couple of hours pondering the
pointlessness of human existence?</LD>
<LD>   OK, maybe that's not what PBS had in mind when it scheduled a new
film version of Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" for Wednesday
night at 9:30 on KCET and KVCR. But there's no avoiding that
philosophical quandary in the play that was introduced in the Irish
playwright's adopted home of Paris in January 1953.</LD>
<LD>   It is the play's 50th birthday that explains its scheduling as
part of the "Stage on Screen" series. The program follows the
September airing of "Beckett on Film," a presentation of seven short
plays that -- along with "Godot" -- are part of an Irish-based
project to film all 19 of Beckett's stage works.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there's a damper on this birthday party, since
"Godot" -- filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, based on a Gate Theatre of
Dublin staging that played at UCLA in 2000 -- is a decidedly mixed
success.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side: Hearing Beckett's lines filtered through the
accents of Irish actors Barry McGovern and Johnny Murphy helps to
connect the play's humor, hope and despair with the Irish literary
tradition that is so rich in those qualities.</TE>
<TE>   But too often, this blank, listless film doesn't seem to get the
joke. Chuckles are few and far between, even though much of "Godot"
is a clown show.</TE>
<TE>   The setting, at least, looks right: A desolate path alongside a
rock pile crowned by a lone, barren tree.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing -- and everything -- happens here as a pair of tramps wait
for the mysterious Godot, who never shows up. As the two acts unfold
over separate days, Vladimir (McGovern) and Estragon (Murphy) say and
do much the same things, suggesting that they are caught in a dull,
unvarying loop.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, the play is considered a cornerstone of theater
for the absurd, which meditates on the essential absurdity of the
human condition.</TE>
<TE>   But listen closely to the tramps' brief, elliptical exchanges.
Aren't these miniature discourses on religion, psychology,
sustenance, companionship, endurance, death and more?</TE>
<TE>   And what to make of the appearance of the cultured but harsh
master, Pozzo (Alan Stanford), and his careworn slave, Lucky (Stephen
Brennan)? Aren't they embodiments of the class system, of capitalism,
of man's inhumanity to man?</TE>
<TE>   McGovern invests Vladimir with intelligence and kindness, while
demonstrating, through subtle facial variations, the epic battle
between optimism and despondency taking place in his mind. Murphy's
Estragon is less cerebral and more corporal, making him the more
obviously clownish of the pair.</TE>
<TE>   Every once in a while, Lindsay-Hogg and cinematographer Seamus
Deasy take the camera overhead for a God's-eye view of the action --
one of the more inspired aspects of the filming.</TE>

<HD>Indian tunic, insulated</HD>
<DH>The breezy summer classic, embroidered front and back, now
comes in cushy cashmere for winter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In summertime, L.A. girls live in embroidered Indian tunics, often
from Govinda's, the import store at the West Los Angeles Hare Krishna
Temple. But the sheer cotton or silk tops, which come in a rainbow of
colors, are too lightweight for even the mildest L.A. winters. Enter
designers Jennifer Schuman and Sari Hymowitz and their new line of
boho luxe cashmere tunics.</LD>
<LD>   At about $365 each, the sweaters have been flying off the shelves
at Barneys New York and Theodore in Beverly Hills; American Rag Cie
and Fred Segal in L.A.; and Angel in Montecito. "People have been
wearing the cotton ones since the 1960s," said Nicole Green, head
buyer for the Angel boutique. The plush cashmere versions,
embroidered on the front and back, "are a new twist on a classic,"
she says. "It's like having your favorite summer top, the thing you
throw on over your bathing suit, but in the winter."</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Davis, a buyer for Theodore, agrees: "It's the look of the
moment."</LD>
<TE>   A Los Angeles native, Schuman, 29, also designs the swimwear line
Luce di Sole. Hymowitz, 28, used to be a buyer in the swimwear
department at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. The two met when Hymowitz
first picked up Schuman's sexy suits for the store three years ago.
They've been friends ever since, traveling together to France, Italy
and Morocco, but not to India -- yet. Schuman says, "That's our next
stop for sure."</TE>

<HD>NEW YORK WILL NOT WOO OSCAR -- THIS TIME</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A trial balloon floated with great fanfare on the East Coast last
summer -- that New York City would make a concerted push to host all
or part of the Academy Awards -- apparently has run out of air with
the disclosure Monday that New York officials do not plan to lobby
the Oscar organization to include the Big Apple in this year's show.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the New York City Host Committee said there just
wasn't enough time to present the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences with a formal proposal.</LD>
<LD>   "If New York City does something, we do it right and we do it
big," said Jeffrey Stewart, spokesman for the host committee, an arm
of the city's convention and visitors bureau. "So, due to a lot of
different circumstances, a formal proposal was not put together and
is not being submitted to the academy."</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, however, held out the possibility that the idea would be
revived next year for the 2004 Oscars. He was responding to a report
in the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety that a consortium of
New York media heavyweights is working behind the scenes to move at
least part of the celebration to the East Coast following an aborted
bid last summer to bring "the whole party to Gotham."</TE>
<TE>   But Stewart shot down even that speculation, noting that the host
committee did not plan to pressure the academy.</TE>
<TE>   Academy President Frank Pierson said, "We certainly haven't heard
anything from anybody. That's where we stand.... As far as we're
concerned it's not happening."</TE>
<TE>   As for whether Oscars producer Gil Cates might work a Gotham
presence into the March 23 ceremony, Pierson said, "Gil is still
laying out his plans for the show.... Those are things we don't want
to discuss in advance."</TE>
<TE>   Academy spokesman John Pavlik also noted that nothing in the way
of a proposal had ever "come in to us.... This whole thing has been
sort of a made-up story. At the time, we said we were not going to
New York."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, academy Executive Director Bruce Davis
reiterated that the academy has a contract to stage the show from the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a contract with the Kodak Theatre and we're going to
honor that," Davis said. He added that had they moved part of the
production to New York, it would have incurred twice the cost. "No
one ever explained that would nearly double the cost without an
increase in revenue with no one picking up the tab for that. That was
never attractive to us."</TE>
<TE>   One of the people who had been behind the move was Miramax Films
Chairman Harvey Weinstein, who said giving New York a piece of the
Oscars would bring revenue and comfort to a city suffering the
continuing aftereffects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Host Committee, which is chaired by businessman
Jonathan Tisch, brother of Hollywood producer Steve Tisch, has been
searching for ways to revitalize the city's economy through events
that attract major media exposure. On Feb. 23, New York will host the
Grammy Awards. The city is bidding to host the Republican National
Convention in 2004 and the Super Bowl in 2008. The city also wants to
host the Olympics in 2012.</TE>

<HD>Living on love, or words to that effect</HD>
<DH>It doesn't exactly pay the bills, but a young couple are
pinning hopes on careers as performing poets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gayle Pollard-Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Saturday night at a raucous hip-hop concert at Biola University,
a religious college in La Mirada. Enyce is in the house. So are Ecko,
FUBU Platinum, Rocawear and a multitude of hot, high-priced,
name-brand, urban designer fashions that might as well be labeled
"You Spent What for That?!" During the freestyle rap, an
improvisational riff is inspired by a guy in the audience waving one
of his new must-have Js, top-of-the-line $200 Air Jordan XVIIs,
athletic shoes in black and white with a copper strip gleaming on the
heel.</LD>
<LD>   Then the poets take the stage.</LD>
<LD>   GaKnew wears old tennis shoes, generic jeans and a basic
blue-and-white sweater. A former rapper, he keeps the rhythm going
with his lyrical "Vision of an Underground Poet."</LD>
<TE>   "Well, I done quit my job," he starts, speaking up-tempo,
snatching the attention of the crowd. He closes with his signature "I
Am," singing, "Black man ... / African American, mystery man ... /
Colored boy, nigga-ro, slave when ... / will you comprehend you're a
hu-man."</TE>
<TE>   Thea Monyee performs in a gray turtleneck she's borrowed so often
that her roommate finally gave it to her and shoes she will describe
only as "not Prada."</TE>
<TE>   This gig pays, hallelujah.</TE>
<TE>   GaKnew and Monyee get $200. Each. They make another $150 selling
videos of his performance film and their self-produced chapbooks.
Monyee meets her goal. She sells out of her "Escaping the Cocoon:
Falling in Love With Life," except for the nine taken from their
table while they're on stage by students who think the pamphlet-sized
books are free.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, $45, is a big deal, because as Monyee enthuses
endearingly in her romantic ode, they are "Broke Lovers":</TE>
<TE>   You mean more to me than just your paycheck,</TE>
<TE>   So you don't ever have to sweat over keeping up with the Jones's,</TE>
<TE>   You see what we lack in finance, we more than make up for in
romance, and can't nobody slow dance to Lenny Williams the way that
we do!</TE>
<TE>   The resumes are unique</TE>
<TE>   He's 26. She's 21. Economically, they don't stand out in their
demographic. Young and broke go together like love and marriage.</TE>
<TE>   They don't stand out at a hip-hop concert or a spoken-word
performance. He's slender, of medium height, bearded, with curly
black hair and, as his lady love says, quoting from his poem "I Am,"
"root-beer-bottle brown" eyes and skin the color of "deep wine."
She's nearly as tall as he is, also slender and, through the eyes of
the poet who loves her, the color of "caramel ... a golden tone, with
pillow-like cheeks, big dimples and a smile like a 5-year-old
cheesing" for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   They do stand out in their occupational preference. On how many
job applications can one reasonably write: Poet. Artist. Dreamer.
Believer.</TE>
<TE>   Spoken word is to poetry as stand-up is to comedy or hip-hop is to
music. Expressive performance art, it's original poetry recited,
generally from memory, with dramatic attitude, faster than routine
conversation, and often accompanied by emotive gestures. Think
in-your-face beatniks, front and center stage. On speed.</TE>
<TE>   It's big. Mainstream big. "Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam" is one
of the hottest tickets on Broadway. HBO has announced it will air a
third season of Simmons' "Def Poetry" show. (Monyee appeared on it
last summer, and happily received a $625 paycheck.) Clubs routinely
charge a $10 cover to listen to artists who cost nothing to hear last
year.</TE>
<TE>   It's big enough that maybe they can make a living. Like Coco
Brown. He took spoken word to the top of the Billboard charts two
years ago with his melodic baritone in "Sundress," a seductive paean
to women.</TE>
<TE>   This is not how GaKnew (pronounced ga-NU, ne Lanny Wilson) planned
to make a living. At Santa Monica College, he studied filmmaking and
art for a year until his mother moved to Virginia, forcing him, at
age 18, to get his own apartment and a full-time job. To support his
art, he works full time at Kinko's, making $9.99 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   This is not how Monyee (pronounced moan-YAY, nowhere near "money,"
nee Griffith) planned to make a living. At USC, she aced premed
studies during her freshman year before her parents divorced, wiping
out any hope of paying the next tuition bill. Disillusioned, she took
a break from college and got a job at a rental car agency, where she
earns $9 an hour. She's back in school at the much more affordable
Cal State Dominguez Hills, but premed gave way to English when she
caught the fever.</TE>
<TE>   "Poetry is a starting point for a lot of things. Lanny works with
film. I'd like to write novels. It's a way to break in," Monyee says.
"It opens a lot of doors. I've gotten calls from producers. I have no
idea where I'm going, but I'm going to ride the poetry horse until I
can ride no more."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make a living off of poetry," says GaKnew. He knows
plenty of poets who are as broke as they are. But he won't give it
up. "Poetry will always be there," he explains. "A poet is who I am.
Like a man is a man, I am a poet. Even if I'm not performing, I'll be
a 79-year-old man writing poetry."</TE>
<TE>   Hard-earned money</TE>
<TE>   It's a rainy Friday night. They show up at Midnight Records in
West L.A. to host their weekly open-mike Safe House Poetry Jam. It's
canceled unexpectedly, eliminating the possibility of making a few
bucks.</TE>
<TE>   It's a standing-room-only Thursday night at Lush in Santa Monica,
home of the Flypoet Spoken Word &amp; Music Showcase, a monthly melange
of poets and musicians who perform while an artist paints on a large
canvas just offstage, immediately capturing their essence. Monyee's
teasing tonight, briefly previewing the show she'll put on Jan. 9,
when she's a featured poet. She needs to draw a crowd because she'll
make $5 for every patron who says her name at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the club, she parks her 4-year-old Toyota Camry on the
street, avoiding the valet fee, the tip and car envy.</TE>
<TE>   ... because truth be told, nobody in L.A. has a car that is paid
for,</TE>
<TE>   So I would roll with you, in a bucket, missing three doors!</TE>
<TE>   And I'd still feel warm as though I was rolling in the leather
seats of a 2003 Escalade,</TE>
<TE>   owned by a couple who constantly argues over still not making
enough money....</TE>
<TE>   It's a Wednesday night, and GaKnew is not making as much as he
hopes at Doboy's Dozens Coffeehouse in the Crenshaw district. He's
screening "Thoughts of Egression," his performance film, at $10 a
ticket. His profits evaporate when the projector he reserved is not
available after all, and Doboy's owner bails him out at double the
original cost.</TE>
<TE>   The following Wednesday, he is featured at the Magic Johnson
Starbucks on Centinela near LAX. His "I Am" draws a standing ovation.
He pockets $15.</TE>
<TE>   GaKnew needs every dollar, because his film has been accepted by
the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. The
$1,000 entrance fee is due by the end of January. Then there's plane
fare to New York in April.</TE>
<TE>   The couple also are looking for paying jobs because they're saving
big-time for their "Broke Lovers" wedding. They're engaged, although
the only thing Monyee has to show off on the third finger of her left
hand is a manicured, unpolished fingernail. Their love, she says in
the second stanza, "is not based on BLING BLING, Because ... 'I don't
need no diamond rings.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's a packed Tuesday night at Da' Poetry Lounge at the Greenway
Court Theater on the campus of Fairfax High School. Admission is $5,
none of it flowing into the wallet of Monyee. She competes in a
poetry slam judged by members randomly chosen from the audience. She
usually wins, which is how she made the Los Angeles team that
competed against GaKnew's Hollywood team at the Poetry Slam Nationals
in Minneapolis in August.</TE>
<TE>   This night, first place pays $50. She comes in second. She's
exhausted from working at Enterprise Rent-a-Car from 6 a.m. to 3
p.m., studying for finals (only three semesters to go!) and
performing everywhere she can.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 25, when he picks her up from work, GaKnew surprises
Monyee with a sweet marquis-cut diamond ring. To pay for it, he cut
out all "extracurricular activity," held onto the Biola University
check and saved money from his day job and whatever he made at other
readings. Thanks to his winning raffle ticket, they'll honeymoon
briefly in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, they're performing at a Kwanzaa festival at a church
in Long Beach. They don't get paid, again.</TE>

<LD>The ambitious three-year renovation of Milan's famed La Scala opera
house, begun in January 2002, is undergoing troubles of operatic
proportion.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, an Italian preservationist group protested the
demolition of the stage and some backstage areas called for by
architect Mario Botta's extensive modernization.</LD>
<LD>   Now fears are growing over news that the water level under the
theater has risen by 31 inches. The proposed new stage tower will
require foundations of at least 18 meters deep, leaving the lowest 13
feet of the structure underwater.</LD>
<TE>   La Scala, built by Giuseppe Piermarini in 1775-78, is considered
one of the finest opera houses in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, La Scala suffered a minor scare when a small piece of
wood caught fire under the stage during renovations. Performances
will continue at La Scala's new temporary home, the Arcimboli theater
on the outskirts of Milan, until the completion of the renovation,
slated for December 2004.</TE>

<HD>TV Azteca takes over station</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican broadcaster TV Azteca took over the facilities of local
Mexico City station CNI Channel 40 early Friday amid cries of threats
and abuses as the legal dispute between the two stations escalates.</LD>
<LD>   CNI Channel 40 says private armed guards wearing ski masks and
black uniforms stormed the station's transmission facilities before
dawn, holding channel employees for several hours and taking over the
channel's signal. TV Azteca confirmed that it had taken over the
facilities, saying it was "exercising its rights and in full
compliance with the law."</LD>

<LD>You can't fault these actors for their 'do jobs -- um, we mean day
jobs. They are, after all, only playing movie roles that call for
reality hair in a make-believe setting. But if this winter's batch of
celluloid locks should start any trends, it won't be pretty.</LD>

<LD>   Bangs of New York</LD>
<TE>   As William Cutting, a.k.a. Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New
York," Daniel Day-Lewis plays the merciless leader of Five Points, an
underworld ruled by racketeering, bootlegging, swindling and, worst
of all, a bad guy with really, really bad hair. Speaking of five
points, here are ours for a Day-Lewis makeover:</TE>
<TE>   1. Off with the Medusa-style bangs.</TE>
<TE>   2. Lose the caterpillars above the eyes and upper lip.</TE>
<TE>   3. Ever heard of shampoo?</TE>
<TE>   4. Dude, buy a cap.</TE>
<TE>   5. Next time your barber asks, "So, you here for an oil change or
a haircut?," please, go with the clip job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About Schmidt's comb-over</TE>
<TE>   Don't snarl and point your finger at us, Jack Nicholson. We can't
help but notice your comb-over coif as Warren Schmidt, whose new
purpose in life is to stop his daughter's marriage in "About
Schmidt." We realize you're going for a look that says your dome is
home to a follicle forest, but we think it's about time the comb-over
is over and out. Even the former comb-over king, Rudy Giuliani,
surrendered the signature look last month for a sexier slicked-back
Mr. GQ style -- and he's received only praises, no teases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hairy scary</TE>
<TE>   We've seen parentheses in footnotes, warranties and pre-nups but
never on a famous face. Taking it on the chin is "About Schmidt's"
Dermot Mulroney, who portrays an underachieving waterbed salesman
whose locks are also underachievers. According to production notes,
female visitors to the "Schmidt" set refused to believe that
Mulroney, who sported a cascading mullet (kept contained in a
ponytail for much of the film), was the same guy they swooned over in
"My Best Friend's Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's afraid of the frizzies?</TE>
<TE>   Not Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf in "The Hours." We're far more
accustomed to seeing her with a thick red cascade of curls and
romantic tendrils framing her face. But for her role as Woolf, in
addition to a prosthetic nose, she wears her tresses straight, parted
down the middle, pulled back and bedeviled by pesky fly-away frizzies
that seem to have a life force of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Virginia, there is a solution: Have a smoke.</TE>

<LD>"I see a blue whale in the sky too, Jeremy. Want me to tell you about
what I see?"</LD>
<LD>   "Like a game, Dad?"</LD>
<LD>   "That's right, Jeremy. My whale is about as long as several buses
lined up end to end. And it would take you awhile to walk around it."</LD>
<TE>   "How could I walk around it in the sky?" Jeremy asked with a
frown.</TE>
<TE>   "But remember you said everything was upside-down today," Dad
reminded him. "Here's another hint. One of the earliest ones seen was
as long as two football fields. Imagine that."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy brightened, "Yeah, I can see it now, about two Rose Bowls."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think your whale has eyes?" asked Dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course. All whales have eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "Listen to this. Sometimes my whale's skin is covered with
thousands of red, blue, green and yellow eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" exclaimed Jeremy.</TE>
<TE>   "Your whale, on the other hand, can talk," added Dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, come on, Dad. Quit kidding."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm serious, son. Whales like yours make a low whistle sound
that can travel for hundreds of miles. It is said that blue whales
are the loudest animals on Earth -- they are even louder than a jet
engine. They use this sound to communicate and to find mates."</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me more, Dad."</TE>
<TE>   "During World War II, my kind of whale was used to help spot enemy
subs. They also worked as escorts for convoys of ships and served as
early-warning radar stations. There aren't as many in the world
today."</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" Jeremy pondered.</TE>
<TE>   "Some met with disasters, others lost their usefulness, and old
age has put many out of service," Dad explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Gee."</TE>
<TE>   "And your whale's numbers have been greatly reduced too,"
continued Dad. "So many of them were hunted and killed that they are
now an endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: What are Jeremy and his dad talking about?</TE>

PBS (KCET, KVCR) offers an alternative to rock called "New Year's Eve
All-Gershwin Concert," on "Live From Lincoln Center," at 8 p.m., with
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra led by Lorin Maazel. The Ebony

<HD>'Confessions': Quick! Somebody get the gong!</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who think there is no justice in American popular culture take
note: "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," the autobiography of a man
who created some of the most irritating programs in television
history, has, two decades after publication, been made into a most
irritating film. The mills of the Lord grind slowly, but they grind
exceeding fine.</LD>
<LD>   The man in question is Chuck Barris, the inquiring mind behind
"The Dating Game," "The Newlywed Game" and "The Gong Show," programs
that reinforced the venerable axiom that nobody ever lost money
underestimating the taste of the American public.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps because he likes a good story, perhaps because he enjoys
tweaking the establishment, perhaps because unleashing all that
terrible television wasn't enough for him, perhaps (though not very
likely) because it was actually true, Barris insisted in his book
that he had yet another career: He was a decorated hit man for the
CIA, with numerous assassinations to his credit.</LD>
<TE>   This is a fairly outrageous claim, yet it is the peculiar
accomplishment of "Mind," written by Charlie Kaufman and directed in
his debut by George Clooney, to have made a film so tedious that it
is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not. Barris'
triumphs and his crises mean the same to us: zero.</TE>
<TE>   This is not because he's not a significant figure. As the avatar
of lowest-common-denominator television, someone who cashed in big on
people's willingness to humiliate themselves after he realized that
"almost any American would sell out their spouse for a
refrigerator/freezer or a lawnmower they could ride around in,"
Barris is the visionary, if that's the right word, who made reality
TV possible.</TE>
<TE>   But as interpreted, presumably accurately, by Sam Rockwell, Barris
is such a self-involved jerk that nothing else matters. In its
avidity for recounting this kind of a life, in its belief that the
more annoying a character is, the more significant he becomes,
"Dangerous Mind" follows in the footsteps of the late, unlamented
Andy Kaufman biopic, "Man on the Moon." As if Barris' on-screen
persona weren't off-putting enough, "Dangerous Mind" makes things
worse with the way it chooses to tell his story. Starting with the
man himself standing nude in front of a TV as he works his way
through a 1981 nervous breakdown and flashing back over his
overlapping television and CIA careers, the film is much more smug
and pleased with itself than it has any reason to be.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is likely the screenplay, which makes you
wonder if, with a nod to "Adaptation," there are two Charlie
Kaufmans, one who writes brilliant scripts like "Being John
Malkovich" and "Adaptation," and one who writes unwatchable ones like
"Human Nature" and "Dangerous Mind." Or perhaps, like the stunts in
"Jackass," directing a Kaufman script is not something that should be
tried at home.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Clooney, who inexplicably cast himself as Barris'
robotic CIA handler, has things to answer for in the directing
department. Though he is adept at working with some actors (Drew
Barrymore does well with the role of Barris' super-patient
girlfriend, Penny), he is too indulgent with others, particularly
Julia Roberts as a rival assassin, encouraging a nudge-nudge,
wink-wink style that stumbles all over itself in its zeal to be arch
and hip.</TE>
<TE>   Just as troublesome is Clooney's passion, not uncommon in
enthusiastic first-timers, for throwing everything but the kitchen
sink onto the screen. With its multiplicity of over-stylized looks
and slick gimmicks, "Dangerous Mind" was doubtless more stimulating
to direct than it will be for audiences to experience.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney himself shrewdly anticipated that criticism when he
predicted in an interview, "The knock on me will be that it's
over-directed," which is more self-insight than you usually get from
a filmmaker. If the directing thing doesn't work out, a second career
as a film critic is a possibility. Or if excitement is an issue,
perhaps Barris' old CIA slot is still open. You never know if you
don't ask.</TE>

<HD>A Long, Sad Chapter 11 in History: Bankruptcies in 2002 Set
Record</HD>
<DH>The value of corporate filings surges to $368 billion;
ripple effect on economy seen</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>2002 may well go down as the year of the fallen giants.</LD>
<LD>   A weak economy and widespread accounting irregularities conspired
to fuel what by one measure has been the biggest year ever for
corporate bankruptcies, with the value of 2002 filings soaring to a
record $368 billion as of Dec. 25, BankruptcyData.Com reported
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The number of public companies filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Court protection was actually higher in 2001: 257 versus 186 so far
this year. But when measured by assets, the 2002 filings -- bloated
by big names such as WorldCom Inc., Global Crossing Ltd., Kmart
Corp., Conseco Inc., Adelphia Communications Inc. and UAL Corp. --
shattered last year's record by 42%. In fact, five of the 10 biggest
bankruptcies of all time occurred this year.</LD>
<TE>   The trail of wreckage has left business experts nervously
discussing the consequences of such massive failures on the U.S.
economy and investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankruptcies have a ripple effect, touching suppliers, customers,
banks and other relationships," said Samuel Gerdano, executive
director of the American Bankruptcy Institute. The Alexandria, Va.,
group is made up of attorneys, auctioneers, bankers, judges and
others involved in the Chapter 11 process.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, 2002 merely marked an extension of a trend that
started in 2001. Over the last two years, companies with $626 billion
in assets have filed for Chapter 11, according to Christopher
Stuttard, editor at BankruptcyData.Com, a Boston-based Web site that
tracks corporate filings.</TE>
<TE>   That dwarfs the cumulative asset total of all the corporate
bankruptcy filings logged during the previous decade, although it's
worth noting that assets listed in court filings often bring pennies
on the dollar when they are sold during reorganization proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the prognosis for next year is equally bleak.</TE>
<TE>   "We polled our members earlier this month, and a healthy majority
felt that 2003 would bring bankruptcies to another new record,"
Gerdano said.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in corporate bankruptcies is largely blamed on the 1990s
"bubble" mentality that inspired banks and investors to pour money
into companies that didn't always have the soundest business plans.
That, in turn, encouraged some corporate managers to overextend
themselves as they grew and acquired new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting scandals at companies such as WorldCom and Adelphia
also figured in the debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the classic post-bubble period," said James A.
Pressler, associate economist at Northern Trust Co. "It's only
exacerbated by the fact that the WorldComs and Enrons -- the big,
supposedly successful companies -- were humbled overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Going forward, economists fear that U.S. debt levels remain
troublingly high, with consumer indebtedness and personal bankruptcy
filings at or near postwar records. Consumer debt is considered an
important factor, even in corporate bankruptcies, because consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   If consumers aren't financially healthy enough to head to the
mall, corporate profits are likely to languish. That has a negative
effect on everything from employment to the stock market. Indeed,
some experts already are singling out the retail sector as a
potential hot spot for bankruptcy filings next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't understand how each dollar spent in one
industry trickles down into other industries, affecting everything
from plant services to advertising," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this recession has really put pressure on a lot of
companies -- particularly small and mid-sized companies -- that they
were just not prepared for."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Brown, spokesman for Consolidated Freightways Corp., which
was once California's biggest trucking company, can attest to that.
Although the company began to falter two years ago, it had positioned
itself to prosper from the predicted economic recovery. But the
upturn proved too little, too late. Consolidated filed for bankruptcy
protection in September.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we were doing a lot of the right things to take advantage
of it when the economy began to take off," Brown said, "but by
September it became apparent to us that we were not going to be able
to recover."</TE>
<TE>   The only bright spot on the horizon: Bankruptcies often soar at
the tail end of an economic downturn, noted Gary Schlossberg, senior
economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco. That could
mean that the worst is over, even if there are still some bad times
to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankruptcies are more the caboose than the engine," Schlossberg
said. "The problem is that this train has a long tail."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>Coral Gables, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. shares fell more than 7% on Monday after
a report said two independent directors have resigned.</LD>
<LD>   Marvin Bush, a brother of President Bush, and Stephen Way left the
company recently, BB&amp;T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones said.</LD>
<LD>   Salvatore Alfiero, chief executive of Protective Industries, and
Kathryn Falberg are new additions to the board, Jones added.</LD>
<TE>   The departures occurred in October, weeks before former
shareholders sued Fresh Del Monte, accusing current controllers of
bribing the head of a Mexican government-affiliated investment group
to buy the company. The company didn't announce the resignations
because there were "no negative issues" related to them, spokeswoman
Christine Cannella said.</TE>
<TE>   Way said in an interview that he resigned "six weeks to two months
ago" because of time constraints from running HCC Insurance Holdings
Inc., where he serves as chairman and CEO. Bush, president and
co-founder of Winston Partners Group, didn't immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "decided to resign from all public companies he served on to
dedicate more time and attention to his firm," Cannella said.</TE>
<TE>   Falberg was chief financial officer of Inamed Corp. from April to
July of last year. She is a board member of Visx Inc.</TE>

<HD>Home Sales Decline in November, but Record Still Likely for
Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Fewer previously owned homes were sold in November, but sales for all
of 2002 are on track for the best year on record as some of the
lowest mortgage rates seen in decades beckon people to buy.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Realtors reported Monday that home resales
slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.56 million in
November, a 3.5% decline from the previous month.</LD>
<LD>   The slippage came after sales jumped by 5.9% in October to a rate
of 5.76 million, the fourth-highest monthly pace on record.</LD>
<TE>   Even with November's drop, sales remained quite good, racking up
the sixth-best month ever and running 5.9% above the sales pace of
November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market has been one of the few bright spots for an
economy struggling to regain its footing after being knocked down by
last year's recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing has remained a lone oasis of strength, keeping the
recession of 2001 mild and helping to keep the economy away from a
new recession this year," said economist Richard Yamarone of Argus
Research Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Stoked by low mortgage rates, home resales and sales of new homes
are expected to set records this year, outpacing the previous
all-time-high sales registered in 2001, economists predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "For all of 2002, we'll easily surpass the record of 5.3 million
sales in 2001, with sales topping the 5.5 million level," said David
Lereah, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Low mortgage rates this year encouraged many people to refinance
their home mortgages. The extra monthly cash that homeowners save by
refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates has helped consumer
spending remain the primary force that has kept the economy going
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was
6.07% in November, down from 6.11% in October. Last week, rates on
30-year mortgages dropped to a new low of 5.93%, according to Freddie
Mac, the mortgage company. It began tracking mortgage rates in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor motivating home buyers is solid appreciation of
housing values. The national median price for an existing home in
November was $161,400, which represented a 9.7% rise from November
2001.</TE>

<HD>Top Ribapharm Execs Threaten to Quit in Protest</HD>
<DH>The drug company's CEO, CFO and general counsel oppose
majority holder ICN's plan to oust five of six directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Escalating the bitter battle for control of Ribapharm Inc., the drug
maker's top management threatened to quit Monday in protest over
majority shareholder ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s plan to fire most of
Ribapharm's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   Ribapharm said its chief executive, Dr. Johnson Y.N. Lau, along
with Chief Financial Officer Thomas Stankovich and general counsel
Roger Loomis, would resign unless ICN backs off its plan to remove
five of Ribapharm's six board members.</LD>
<LD>   Ribapharm's statement Monday was the latest salvo in an unusual
corporate battle between a company and a rebel spinoff firm.</LD>
<TE>   The conflict between the two Costa Mesa companies centers on a
lucrative hepatitis C drug known as ribavirin, which is made by
Ribapharm. ICN, which owns an 80% stake in Ribapharm, spun off a 20%
stake in the firm in April.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm is pressuring ICN to complete the spinoff as part of a
long-awaited restructuring. But ICN is having second thoughts, as it
continues to benefit financially from its big stake in Ribapharm. In
the third quarter, ICN's royalties from ribavirin more than doubled
from a year earlier, to $63.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing last week a plan to shake up Ribapharm's board, ICN
alleged that the spinoff company awarded inappropriate cash bonuses
and stock options to managers after the firm's first-time stock
offering last spring. ICN also obtained a court order preventing
Ribapharm from making any major business decisions until changes are
made at Ribapharm's board.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Lau said Monday: "Our senior management team is
committed to ensuring that shareholder value is enhanced and,
regretfully, we feel we must resign if our independent directors are
terminated by ICN. We do not feel Ribapharm's full value can be
realized if its board of directors is gutted."</TE>
<TE>   An ICN spokesman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week, ICN's chief executive, Robert W. O'Leary,
said his company had not decided whether to proceed with a full
spinoff of Ribapharm.</TE>
<TE>   One Wall Street analyst said the management of Ribapharm could be
trying to save face, as ICN might oust them after shaking up the
board. "Maybe this is a way they can say, 'We quit,' rather than
being fired," Larry Smith, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, told
Bloomberg News. Smith has a "buy" rating on Ribapharm's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm executives said Monday that they just want ICN to make
good on plans to complete the spinoff and that all compensation and
recent bonuses are in line with other mid-size pharmaceutical firms.</TE>
<TE>   Lau said he and his team have delivered on all major company
objectives, such as increasing investment in research and
development. He noted that his team increased net income 113% to $90
million in the first nine months of this year compared with last
year.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, ICN's shares fell 43 cents to $10.87. Ribapharm's stock
closed at $6.34, up 3 cents. Both trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Blue Chips Up, Tech Stocks Down in Lackluster Session</HD>
<DH>The Santa Claus rally fails to materialize as the Dow and
S&amp;P head for their worst December performance since 1931. Crude oil
prices retreat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks rose for the first time in a week Monday as
crude-oil prices tumbled, indicating that consumer spending may pick
up. Wal-Mart Stores led the gain.</LD>
<LD>   "Energy prices are equivalent to a tax," said Ray Rund, managing
director at Shaker Investments Inc. in Cleveland. "If prices come
down, that frees up money for other forms of consumption."</LD>
<LD>   The market couldn't quite shake off last week's four-session
losing streak, which was based on worries about higher oil prices and
inflation. Monday's trading was lackluster due to a dearth of major
earnings or economic news and the fact that many traders were absent
ahead of New Year's.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 29.07 points, or 0.4%,
at 8,332.85, having lost 2.4% last week. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index fell 8.77 points, or 0.7%, to 1,339.54 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 3.99 points, or 0.5%, to 879.39.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by 5 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchange while losers led by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The market has forfeited the so-called Santa Claus rally, which
typically begins just before Christmas and runs through the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the last two weeks of the year are robust for Wall
Street as investors grow optimistic about the next 12 months. This
year, though, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are headed for their worst
December performance since 1931.</TE>
<TE>   Rising oil prices have reminded investors that inflation could
pose another threat to the uncertain economic recovery. Increasing
tension in Iraq and an oil strike in Venezuela already have sent
crude prices surging.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, the scenario is earnings, the economy and external
risks.... Investors are sitting on the fence," said Alan Ackerman,
executive vice president of Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices, up 30% since mid-November, retreated Monday as the
OPEC cartel indicated its readiness to fill supply gaps caused by a
29-day oil strike in Venezuela and looming war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Crude futures fell $1.35 to $31.37 a barrel in New York trading
after earlier rising to a two-year high of $33.65.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Wal-Mart rose $1.48 to $50.64 after saying sales were strong
during Christmas week but that it still expects only a modest
increase for the season.</TE>
<TE>   * J.C. Penney also ended higher, up 82 cents at $22.89. On Monday,
the department store operator reported better-than-expected holiday
sales, due to aggressive advertising that lured in more shoppers in
the days before Christmas. The S&amp;P retailing index ended up 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Banks rose on the prospect of higher consumer credit card
spending. Wells Fargo, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, rose 78 cents to
$47.08; PNC Financial Services Group gained 93 cents to $41.96; and
MBNA climbed 44 cents to $19.11.</TE>
<TE>   * Chip stocks fell on worries about the outlook for the industry.
The SOX index of semiconductor stocks fell 2.2%, led lower by Intel,
which fell 64 cents to $15.76. Semiconductor equipment maker Applied
Materials fell 23 cents to $13.29.</TE>
<TE>   * Exxon Mobil advanced 11 cents to $34.75. ChevronTexaco rose 75
cents to $66.65. Amerada Hess rose 47 cents to $55.13. The recent
surge in prices bodes well for oil companies, but higher energy
prices could cut profits for consumers and the rest of corporate
America.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold fell back from six-year highs as year-end profit-taking
kicked in. In New York trading, February gold fell $5.80 to $343.40
an ounce. But even with Monday's retreat, gold is up about 23% after
a year of world political turmoil, war risks and weak stock markets.</TE>

<HD>1 Million Hens Ordered Destroyed as Poultry Quarantine Is
Expanded</HD>
<DH>San Diego and Orange counties are added after new virus
cases are found. State's $3-billion industry may be at risk.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials ordered more than 1 million egg-producing hens
destroyed and expanded a poultry quarantine Monday after finding new
cases of a fast-spreading and deadly avian virus in San Bernardino
and San Diego counties.</LD>
<LD>   The developments heightened concerns that exotic Newcastle
disease, which recently surfaced at a Riverside County egg farm, was
proliferating and could pose a threat to California's $3-billion
poultry industry.</LD>
<LD>   Egg and poultry farms in Riverside County -- the state's No. 1 egg
producer -- have been under quarantine for the last several weeks,
along with ranches in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. More
than 100,000 commercial chickens already have been destroyed by
agriculture officials.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the quarantine was extended to San Diego County after
laboratory tests confirmed infection at a farm with 75,000 hens. All
of those birds will be destroyed, as will 1 million hens at a San
Bernardino egg ranch also found to have cases of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County, which has no poultry production, was added to the
quarantine list as well to stop the movement of birds across the
region.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the commercial egg facilities are on heightened alert,"
said Leticia Rico, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Food and Agriculture. "We are working closely with their vets to
enhance biosecurity practices" to contain the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Egg operations throughout the Southern California quarantine area
can still sell their products -- the disease does not pose a threat
to humans -- but poultry farmers cannot. The Southland is home to a
fraction of the 280 million chickens and turkeys raised in the state.</TE>
<TE>   No sign has emerged that the disease has spread to any poultry
processors in the Central Valley, where nearly all of the state's
meat birds are found.</TE>
<TE>   There is no vaccine or treatment for the deadly virus, which
causes flu-like symptoms in fowl.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said they still are investigating the source of
the outbreak. They declined to say whether the Southern California
egg farms used a common processing facility, which could have
contributed to the spread of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hopeful that we could keep it isolated to the flocks it
started with," said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry
Federation.</TE>
<TE>   But unless the Southern California egg producers did in fact share
a common processing facility, he added, the disease could be on the
move.</TE>
<TE>   The industry and state agriculture officials are working to
develop more rigorous measures to curb the disease. State officials
intend to test more farms around the infected facilities, in addition
to collecting samples of dead hens across California.</TE>
<TE>   Poultry farmers who are found to have an infected flock must
destroy their birds, but they will receive compensation from the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers are not, however, compensated for the weeks or months
of lost egg production, industry observers complain.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic Newcastle disease was first spotted in September in a flock
of backyard chickens in Compton. It was the first time the disease
had surfaced since the early 1970s, when 12 million chickens had to
be destroyed at a cost of more than $50 million. The disease took
almost three years to eradicate.</TE>

<HD>Disappointing Season for Retailers</HD>
<DH>Post-Christmas buying is not strong enough to offset weak
holiday sales at Wal-Mart and Federated stores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Katz</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Federated Department Stores Inc. said Monday
that post-Christmas sales weren't strong enough to cushion the worst
holiday shopping season in more than three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart, the world's largest chain store operator, said sales at
stores open at least a year rose as little as 2%, the low end of its
forecast of a gain of 2% to 3%.</LD>
<LD>   Results for the November-December holiday period at Macy's and
Bloomingdale's Cincinnati-based parent, Federated, will fall about
4.5%, a steeper decline than expected. J.C. Penney Co. said
same-store sales at its department stores rose 4.5% in December.</LD>
<TE>   Discount retailer Target Corp., also said same-store sales were
above expectations last week but were not strong enough to offset
disappointing December sales.</TE>
<TE>   Low prices on such items as DVD players and apparel probably
didn't attract enough consumers concerned about job cuts to make up
for disappointing sales in the weeks before Dec. 25. A small sales
gain at Wal-Mart probably foretells poor results at other merchants,
investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're etching out 2% to 3%, you can bet that the rest of the
industry is below that," said Charles Stutenroth, who helps manage
about $26 billion at Fort Washington Investment Advisors Inc., which
holds Wal-Mart and Federated shares.</TE>
<TE>   General merchandise, apparel and furniture sales for the week
ended Saturday fell 9.4% from the previous week, said ShopperTrak
RCT, a Chicago-based firm that tracks data from more than 30,000
retail stores. Total sales will rise 1% in December, the smallest
year-over-year monthly gain since September 2001, when the terrorist
attacks affected consumer spending, ShopperTrak said.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect sales and profit warnings over the coming weeks," said
Merrill Lynch retail analyst Dan Barry.</TE>
<TE>   He added that despite big promotions, deep discounts and a bump in
post-holiday sales from shoppers with gift certificates, "it was not
enough to save Christmas sales this year."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Wal-Mart rose $1.48, or 3%, to $50.64, while Federated
shares rose 56 cents to close at $28.08. Both stocks trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart last week lowered its forecast for the five weeks ending
Friday from an estimated increase of as much as 5% after reviewing
sales through Christmas Eve. Post-holiday clearance sales and gift
certificates helped keep results from slipping further, investors
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a decisive victory, yet we avoided the worst outcome,"
said Martin Bukoll, an analyst at Northern Trust Corp., whose $320
billion in assets include Wal-Mart shares.</TE>
<TE>   This would be the fifth month out of six that sales results came
in below, or at the low end of, the Bentonville, Ark.-based
retailer's initial forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Salomon Smith Barney cut its fourth-quarter profit
estimate for Federated to $1.93 a share from $1.95.</TE>

<HD>Fed May Cut Jobs as Fewer Checks Written</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve may eliminate jobs in the check-clearing and
processing operations of its 12 regional banks as electronic payments
reduce the number of checks consumers and businesses write.</LD>
<LD>   Presidents of all 12 regional Fed banks recently sent letters to
employees saying that check volume was dropping because of electronic
payments and consolidation in the financial-services industry. About
5,200, or 22%, of the 23,550 employees at the regional Fed banks help
process checks.</LD>
<LD>   Cost reductions and probable consolidation of some Fed operations
"are likely to result in the downsizing of staff," Dallas Fed bank
President Robert McTeer wrote this month.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve handles about 40% of the checks cleared in the
U.S. An estimated 42.5 billion checks were written in 2000, down from
49.5 billion in 1995. Recent figures are not available, a Fed
spokesman said.</TE>

<LD>Shareholders of Woodland Hills-based Syncor International Corp.
overwhelmingly approved a $1-billion buyout by Ohio drug distributor
Cardinal Health Inc., the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover of Syncor, which prepares and delivers radioactive
prescriptions, was stalled in November by the disclosure that Syncor
founder Monty Fu and his brother made improper payments to foreign
officials. Cardinal ultimately agreed to complete the deal, though it
cut its all-stock offer by 9.6%, to about $800 million. It also will
assume $202 million of Syncor debt.</LD>
<LD>   Syncor pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-bribery laws and was
fined $2.5 million. Fu quit the company and gave it enough stock to
cover the cost of the fine.</LD>

<CX>   Restaurant chain -- An article in the Business section Tuesday on the
resignation of Irvine-based Prandium Inc.'s chairman incorrectly said
that the company, which operates the Koo Koo Roo and Hamburger Hamlet
restaurant chains, is in bankruptcy reorganization. The company
emerged from bankruptcy protection in July, just a few weeks after
filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, a company spokesman said.</CX>

<LD>New York bank J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it signed a seven-year
contract for information technology services with IBM Corp. worth
more than $5 billion as it moves to cut costs.</LD>

financial services sector, is a coup for the computer maker, which is
focused on selling services.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the agreement, J.P. Morgan said, it will transfer
about 4,000 employees and contractors to IBM in the first half of
next year. Desktop support and other services will remain in-house,
the bank said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of IBM were down $1.11 to $76.25 and J.P. Morgan was up 19

<HD>State Gives SBC Right to Offer Long-Distance</HD>
<DH>The local-phone giant is expected to pose an immediate
challenge to AT&amp;T and other firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. will realize a long-awaited goal today when
it begins providing long-distance telephone service in California
after the state Public Utilities Commission gave the company its
final stamp of approval Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Formerly known as Pacific Bell, SBC will compete against AT&amp;T
Corp., WorldCom Inc.'s MCI unit and other long-distance carriers in
addition to dominating the market for local calling in California.
SBC's network covers 78% of the state, and the San Antonio company
controls 90% of California's residential access lines and 80% of its
business lines.</LD>
<LD>   SBC has been fighting for the right to offer long-distance service
in California's $15-billion market since Congress passed sweeping
deregulation laws designed to spur competition in the telecom
industry in 1996. Those laws set out 14 requirements that incumbent
local phone companies such as SBC had to meet to get permission from
the Federal Communications Commission to sell long-distance,
including opening their networks to competitors.</LD>
<TE>   SBC rivals had urged state and federal regulators to deny SBC's
requests to enter the California long-distance market on the grounds
that the company still held a monopoly in local service. But the
PUC's final approval was considered a foregone conclusion after the
FCC's ruling this month that the company had met the legal criteria
to offer the service.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the PUC vote, SBC announced rate packages that
bundle long- distance with other services, including local calling
and high-speed Internet access. The firm also will offer domestic
long-distance as a stand - alone service for 10 cents a minute.</TE>
<TE>   The new SBC packages generally do not provide considerable savings
over plans offered by major competitors, according to Rich Sayers,
who runs a price-comparison Web site called 10-10PhoneRates.com.</TE>
<TE>   But SBC, headed by Edward E. Whitacre Jr., is expected to become a
formidable competitor almost instantly. "Historically, when a Baby
Bell like SBC enters the consumer long-distance market, it can take
up to 20% of the market in the first 12 months," said analyst Cory
Jackson of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, that wouldn't mean a huge boost for SBC's overall
finances. "It will be an incremental positive," said Jackson, who
holds no stock in the major telephone service providers. "We are
talking about a company that already has billions in revenue."</TE>
<TE>   One possible downside for SBC, Jackson added, is that the company
will find itself under increased scrutiny from regulators to make
sure it does not use its vast network of wires to engage in
anti-competitive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   SBC shares fell 1 cent to close at $27.27 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday.</TE>
<TE>   SBC officials described their entry into long-distance in
California as a major step forward.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great way to start the new year," said Christie
Gillison, executive director of voice services. The company will
promote the new packages heavily in an advertising and telemarketing
campaign to its 10 million Golden State customers.</TE>
<TE>   SBC's rivals criticized the PUC vote. AT&amp;T President Ken McNeely
called it "puzzling and disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   "After fooling regulators into believing they would play by the
rules," he said, "SBC is now trying to change the rules to crush
competitors."</TE>
<TE>   State regulators initially agreed with such concerns. But this
month a PUC administrative law judge proposed safeguards to make sure
that others could vie fairly with SBC, including requiring the state
to monitor whether the company gives competitors equal access to its
local phone lines. With those measures in place, the judge said, SBC
should be allowed into the state market if it won FCC approval.</TE>

<HD>Sunrise to Buy Marriott Division</HD>
<DH>Acquisition of senior living centers will increase
company's California properties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunrise Assisted Living Inc. agreed to buy Marriott International
Inc.'s senior living unit for $150 million in cash and assumed debt
to become the largest manager of senior living centers in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies have significant operations in California. Sunrise
has 28 assisted living centers in the state, including 16 in Southern
California. Marriott has 15 centers in California, including 13 in
the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia-based Sunrise will take over managing 126 centers housing
the elderly, boosting its management business to 350 properties with
40,000 residents. The company has sold about $1 billion in properties
since 1998 while retaining management contracts, to get more of its
profit from set fees rather than from the income that the centers
generate.</LD>
<TE>   "We are insulating our shareholders from the property risk that
comes with owning large portfolios of real estate," Chairman and
Chief Executive Paul Klaassen said on a conference call with analysts
and investors.</TE>
<TE>   Sunrise will pay $89 million in cash and assume $38 million in
liabilities and $23 million of life-care endowment obligations, or
money owed to residents for unused time in the centers.</TE>
<TE>   Sunrise shares rose 80 cents, to $24.81 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, while Marriott shares rose 41 cents, to $32.57.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, CNL Retirement Properties Inc. will buy nine of the
centers from Marriott for $170 million. The centers will be managed
by Sunrise. The purchase is in addition to the 12 centers Marriott
sold to CNL last week for $89 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of the management business and the 12 centers will lower
Marriott's fourth-quarter results by $123 million, or 48 cents a
share, to $133 million, or 52 cents. The Maryland-based company said
it expects to have a gain of $23 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
first quarter when the sale of the nine centers is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott, the nation's largest hotel company, said earlier this
year that it would sell the unit to focus on owning, managing and
franchising Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Fairfield Inn hotels. Marriott
entered the senior living business in 1984 and is exiting after a
glut of development hurt profit in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase will be completed in the first quarter of 2003,
Sunrise said. With the purchase Sunrise will enter states including
Texas, Arkansas, Utah and Tennessee, and expand its managed
properties in California and Florida. Sunrise also will acquire 12
land parcels with the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Klaassen said the industry will see further consolidation, as more
than 90% of senior living centers still are owned by independent
operators.</TE>
<TE>   Sunrise said it expects to earn $2.57 to $2.65 a share in 2003.
Though the purchase will cut net income by 10 cents a share in 2003,
Sunrise said it will sell more of its properties while retaining
management agreements next year. The purchase will add to 2004
profit, Sunrise said, without elaborating.</TE>

<HD>Tech Industry May Get Upgrade in 2003</HD>
<DH>Firms' need to replace aging PCs and rising corporate
profits may spur broad buying cycle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most of the two years since the Internet bubble burst and knocked
the technology industry into its worst slump, everyone from
unemployed programmers to disaffected investors has looked hopefully
to 2003 for a turnaround.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the new year about to begin, it looks like a high-tech
turnaround is indeed on the way -- albeit a relatively slow and
modest one, as corporations move to upgrade their aging computer
systems and look for people to maintain them. The industry's momentum
is then expected to accelerate in 2004 and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Spending on information technology rises and falls with corporate
profits. As the economy softened in 2001, companies delayed
modernizing their systems, particularly given that many had spent
considerably in the late '90s on upgrades to combat anticipated Y2K
problems.</LD>
<TE>   IT expenditures peaked in 2000 at more than $1 trillion, before
falling 10% in 2001 and remaining flat in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But now those upgraded systems are themselves in need of
upgrading.</TE>
<TE>   Only a quarter of the PCs in use today are powerful enough to run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows XP operating system, which is quickly
becoming the standard for desktop and laptop applications. Happily
for the tech industry, that need to update coincides with growing
strength in corporate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporate profitability is the driving force for improvement in
IT spending," noted Daniel Niles, a technology analyst at investment
bank Lehman Bros. "We believe this is beginning to occur."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent meeting with securities analysts, executives from Palo
Alto-based Hewlett-Packard Co. said they expect IT spending to grow
2% to 4% in 2003 and then increase 7% to 9% annually for several
years after that.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be another upgrade cycle within the next three
years," said a report this month by management consultant Booz Allen
&amp; Hamilton Inc. -- though not, it noted, of the magnitude of
1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   PC sales, virtually flat for the last two years, were better than
expected in the third quarter, and 2002 may show a gain over 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for 2003 is even brighter, in part because new systems
are sure to be in demand.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lehman Bros., some 500 million PCs are too old to run
Windows XP. Microsoft will not offer technical support for Windows
versions 3.1, 3.11 and 95 after today. Windows 98 and Windows NT
versions up through NT4.x won't be supported after June 30.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, equipment purchased from 1997 to 1999 is now fully
amortized, meaning the initial costs to companies have been
recaptured on the books.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors are expected to combine to help spur a broad
purchasing cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Chip manufacturers are gearing up for a boost in business, as
well. Global chip sales hit $12.68 billion in November, a 20%
increase over last year, according to the Semiconductor Industry
Assn., a trade group based in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., NEC Electronics Inc. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. are shortening or eliminating their New
Year's holiday breaks on their chip-making lines, the Nikkei Business
Daily reported last week.</TE>
<TE>   Some tech stocks already are showing signs of a rebound. In the
last three months IBM Corp. shares have risen from less than $60 to
close Monday at $76.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Over the same
period, HP's stock has climbed from about $12 to $17.44 on the NYSE,
and Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. has increased
from $2.50 to $3.08 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some are counseling caution. Toni Sacconaghi Jr., an
enterprise hardware analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said
recent tech stock gains are based more on sentiment than on any real
corporate spending.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen any evidence of an improvement in corporate IT
demand over the last few months," Sacconaghi said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, outsourcing probably will be especially hot in 2003.
Spending in this area could boom by 10% as companies farm out their
IT needs to the likes of IBM, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and El
Segundo-based Computer Sciences Corp.</TE>
<TE>   A number of mammoth outsourcing contracts have been announced of
late. HP and Toronto's Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, for
example, recently closed a $1.5-billion deal.</TE>
<TE>   EDS and Bank of America Corp. last week announced a 10-year,
$4.5-billion outsourcing pact. And IBM won an IT contract Monday with
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. that's worth $5 billion over seven years.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just the big companies that stand to benefit from a
pickup in IT budgeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Any company with revenue of below $1 billion is prime for picking
now" for those offering IT services, said Greg Chun, founder of
business consultancy Greco Technologies Inc. in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, IBM is doing banks, etcetera. But the middle market is huge,
much larger than the top 100. That's where the bulk of the market
is."</TE>
<TE>   One potential area of expansion is document storage, as corporate
and government offices increasingly archive material electronically.
In particular, the business of storing medical data digitally is set
to take off next year as the health-care industry steps up its
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act, which governs how patients' records are handled.</TE>
<TE>   IT employment also is expected to see healthy growth in the coming
year, with firms needing to hire 1.1 million people to meet their IT
requirements in 2003, the Information Technology Assn. of America
said in its latest employment survey.</TE>
<TE>   Tech-support workers and Web and database developers will be in
particular demand, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the million-plus jobs anticipated, it still probably
will be a tough market for those seeking employment -- a harsh
reminder of how far the sector has fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, Greco Technologies put an ad on Monster.com for a
software developer and received 600 applications in one day. Greco
had to use a filter to winnow the submissions to a manageable number,
a surprising break from past experience.</TE>
<TE>   "A year and a half earlier," said Chun, "we wouldn't have gotten
any response because everyone was employed."</TE>

<HD>Tribune to Buy 2 WB Stations From Acme</HD>
<DH>The $275-million deal would make the acquirer the largest
owner of the network's stations. It would help the seller slash its
debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tribune Co. agreed to buy two television stations for $275 million in
cash and other assets in a move that would make it the largest owner
of WB Network affiliates.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase of Acme Communications Inc.'s WB-linked stations in
Portland, Ore., and St. Louis would increase the media company's
holdings to 26 TV stations, including 19 WB affiliates, Tribune said.</LD>
<LD>   Tribune, which owns 22.5% of the WB, also owns the Los Angeles
Times.</LD>
<TE>   Acme, a Santa Ana-based company headed by AOL Time Warner Inc.
executive and WB founder Jamie Kellner, said proceeds of the deal
would help slash its debt to $11 million to $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   With the close of all pending transactions, Acme said it would own
nine TV stations in mid-size markets, including eight WB affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, sources disclosed that AOL -- the WB's majority owner
-- had agreed to pay Kellner and eight other WB founding executives
nearly $110 million for their 11% stake in the network.</TE>
<TE>   AOL executives  said the arrangement had been negotiated in the
spring of 2001 as part of Kellner's promotion to his current job as
chief executive of AOL's Turner Broadcasting System unit.</TE>
<TE>   The buyout was intended to prevent Kellner, who founded the WB in
1995 with Time Warner, from having conflicts of interest that could
arise from his new role overseeing both the WB and a group of cable
channels, including CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network.</TE>
<TE>   AOL executives feared that without the buyout, Kellner would have
a financial incentive to funnel the best programming to the WB.</TE>
<TE>   The deal comes as Acme, named for the fictitious manufacturer of
explosives and gadgets used in Warner Bros.' Road Runner cartoons, is
struggling for profitability. For the nine months ended Sept. 30,
Acme reported a net loss of $48.7 million, contrasted with a net loss
of $19.9 million for the same period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Acme shares rose 72 cents to $8 on Nasdaq. Tribune shares closed
up 97 cents to $45.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Gimmicks Inflated Profit, Audit Shows</HD>
<DH>Internal probe indicates firm used aggressive accounting
during acquisitions. It says it will change its practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., whose former chief executive was indicted on
tax evasion charges, used bookkeeping gimmicks to inflate results
during an acquisition spree in the 1990s, according to an internal
accounting review.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco will take $382.2 million in charges to adjust for accounting
errors in fiscal 2002 and previous years.</LD>
<LD>   The largest maker of industrial valves and electrical connectors
also said it began handing over new documents related to a Securities
and Exchange Commission probe of its acquisitions from 1999 and 2000
that was reopened this year.</LD>
<TE>   The company "engaged in a pattern of aggressive accounting which,
even when in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, was intended to increase reported earnings" above more
conservative estimates, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski built Tyco into the
biggest maker of undersea fiber-optic cable through more than $64
billion in acquisitions that now are under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner led the
review. Boies conducted an earlier Tyco investigation into alleged
fraud and theft by former executives.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's shares have dropped 74% this year as investors questioned
the company's accounting, liquidity and strategy. The company, now
led by Edward Breen, has sued former executives including Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco stock rose to $16.20 after the close of regular trading
Monday. The shares rose 18 cents to $15.35 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the report.</TE>
<TE>   Boies selected 15 "large" acquisitions to investigate, with advice
from the SEC. Errors made in accounting for the acquisitions resulted
in $36.1 million in fiscal 2002 restatements, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would change its practices because of the
report. It will demand more documentation to justify accounting
decisions and reduce "nonrecurring charges" that were used to exclude
some costs from profit reported in news releases.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco also said it planned to adopt accounting rules to "improve
the clarity and consistency of its financial statements."</TE>
<TE>   Boies' earlier report helped indict Kozlowski and former Chief
Financial Officer Mark Swartz on charges they took $600 million in
unauthorized compensation and illegal stock gains. Kozlowski was
indicted in June on allegations that he evaded $1 million in New York
sales taxes on purchases of paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Breen did not return messages for comment. Tyco spokesman Gary
Holmes, in a phone interview, said company statements "speak for
themselves."</TE>

<HD>Global's Winnick Steps Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Winnick on Monday resigned as chairman of Global Crossing Ltd.,
the telecommunications company he built from scratch into one of the
brightest stars -- and most spectacular failures -- of the technology
boom.</LD>
<LD>   Once named the richest man in Los Angeles, Winnick was alternately
hailed as a big charitable donor to zoo and library projects and
reviled as a corporate scoundrel who cashed out at least $575 million
in Global Crossing stock before the company collapsed into bankruptcy
proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick's resignation was expected as part of the company's
reorganization plan, which was approved this month and pays creditors
pennies on the dollar for the billions in debt Global Crossing used
to build a worldwide fiber-optic network.</LD>
<TE>   "In order for the company to have a shot at recovering, you have
to bring in new leadership," said Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications
consultant in Marietta, Ga. "You have to wash away everyone that's
been tainted by the process and start clean."</TE>
<TE>   Although Chief Executive John Legere will stay at the company,
Winnick's co-chairman, Lodwrick Cook, is expected to be ousted when
two Asian companies take over next year as majority shareholders. The
company's reorganization must still be reviewed by the Federal
Communications Commission. Cook declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, who will formally step down today, will return to his
Beverly Hills investment banking firm, Pacific Capital Group.</TE>
<TE>   "The collapse of the telecommunications industry ... has taken a
terrible toll on employees and investors alike, with an unprecedented
loss of billions in investments and tens of thousands of jobs,"
Winnick, 55, said in a statement. "I deeply regret that so many good
people involved with Global Crossing also suffered significant
financial loss."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, a former colleague of disgraced bond trader Michael
Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert, had no telecommunications
experience when he raised $20 billion to launch Global Crossing in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing declined to comment beyond a short statement from
Legere.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to extend our thanks to Gary Winnick," he said. "His
courage and dedication to a singular vision led to the completion of
an advanced global IP [Internet Protocol] network that only five
years ago existed as a concept on paper."</TE>
<TE>   But Andrew Odlyzko, director of the Digital Technology Center at
the University of Minnesota, had a different take on Winnick's tenure
at Global Crossing. He predicted that it would be viewed historically
as a lesson in greed.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who looked intelligently at this business would have seen
that this was a bubble, something that was bound to come to a bad
end," he said. "People years from now will not laud him as a builder
or visionary."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges against
anyone at Global Crossing, but the firm's accounting remains under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Global
Crossing also faces shareholder lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's departure was widely seen as inevitable. Still, its
timing was uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing was Gary's baby," said Terry Christensen, a
spokesman for Winnick. "And he wanted to see it through, at least to
a reorganized form."</TE>
<TE>   Christensen said Winnick also wanted to establish a $25-million
fund to reimburse employees for losses they incurred in purchasing
Global Crossing stock for their retirement plans. Winnick deposited
the funds into an escrow account Dec. 19 to fulfill a pledge he made
in October while testifying before Congress, but Christensen said
Winnick was "still working on the mechanics" of how people would be
reimbursed.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the company's valuation in 1999, Winnick's stock
was worth $6 billion, and he was ranked the richest person in Los
Angeles by the Los Angeles Business Journal. He sold at least $575
million in Global Crossing shares, using some of the proceeds to
purchase and refurbish a historic 64-room mansion in Bel-Air. He also
contributed millions to the Los Angeles Zoo, the Los Angeles Public
Library and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</TE>
<TE>   During the company's rise, Winnick lavished perks and salaries on
his executives, and he personally oversaw a painstaking restoration
of the company's former executive offices in Beverly Hills, which
included a re-creation of the Oval Office. But the company ultimately
collapsed under the weight of its $12.4 billion in debt and filed for
bankruptcy protection in January.</TE>

<HD>Piper Jaffray to Pay $32.5 Million to Settle Wall Street
Probe</HD>
<DH>The company is paying the least of any of the securities
firms targeted in the investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Bancorp on Monday said its Piper Jaffray securities arm has
agreed to pay $32.5 million to join in the settlement of a
wide-ranging probe into Wall Street business practices.</LD>
<LD>   Piper Jaffray said it will pay a fine of $25 million and also will
pay $7.5 million over the next five years to support independent
research options.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement comes after regulators and 10 of the world's largest
investment banks announced a tentative $1.4-billion settlement on
Dec. 20.</LD>
<TE>   A group of state and federal regulators, led by New York Atty.
Gen. Eliot Spitzer, had been investigating whether the banks put
their interests ahead of investors by issuing tainted research and
secretly handing out hot stocks to favored clients.</TE>
<TE>   The banks, including Citigroup Inc., also agreed to a number of
structural reforms, including prohibiting stock analysts from
accompanying bankers on "road shows" and "pitches," where bankers try
to sell their underwriting services.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Bortner, securities administrator for Washington state,
which led the Piper Jaffray investigation, said on Dec. 20 that U.S.
Bancorp's settlement offer was "insufficient by quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   The company in the end will pay the least of any of the firms.
Citigroup will pay $400 million, the largest fine.</TE>
<TE>   "The fine amount is fair when compared with the rest of the firms,
because of their size," Bortner said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray, which has 1,200 brokers in 26
states and ranked 23rd this year among U.S. equity underwriters,
continued negotiations through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Thomas Weisel Partners, also investigated for
its research practices, is now the only firm that hasn't reached a
settlement with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Weisel officials declined to comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for California Corporations Commissioner Demetrios
Boutris, whose office conducted the state investigation of Weisel,
said Monday: "Our attorneys are working with the [Securities and
Exchange Commission] to determine what will be next for Thomas
Weisel. We have nothing to report at this time, however."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Bancorp shares rose 32 cents to $21.20 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>

by almost 24% in October from a year earlier as a rash of accounting
scandals, a volatile stock market and disappointing returns on the
bonds eroded demand.</LD>
<LD>   Net foreign buying of U.S. corporate bonds totaled $10.4 billion
in October, down from $13.6 billion a year earlier, the U.S. Treasury
Department reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of it has to do with corporate malfeasance," said David
Gilmore, a partner at FX Analytics in Stamford, Conn. "Some fairly
high-level bankruptcies for U.S. firms also would feature into
greater risk aversion among foreign investors." A data firm reported
Monday that U.S. corporate bankruptcies hit a record high this year,
when measured by the assets of the filing companies.</LD>
<TE>   October marked the second month of slumping overseas demand.
Foreign investors bought just $3.7 billion of corporate debt in
September, down 63% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Although stocks rallied in the latter half of October, corporate
bonds posted a loss of 1.3% that month, according to Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors were a mainstay for the corporate bond market
last year, helping companies sell a record $818 billion of debt.
International capital flows to corporate bonds and other U.S. assets
have been a key support for the dollar, and some analysts have
worried that the greenback could be vulnerable if foreign flows
slump.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly takes some of the wind out of the sails for the U.S.
dollar," said T.J. Marta, a foreign exchange analyst for Citigroup.</TE>
<TE>   According to data compiled by Citigroup, net foreign buying of all
U.S. securities -- including Treasuries, corporate bonds, agency debt
and stocks -- came to $397 billion through October, down from $430
billion in the year-earlier period. Foreign net purchases of
corporate bonds fell 23% through October to $148 billion from $192
billion in the same period last year, according to Treasury data.</TE>

<HD>'Pork for Pensions' Is a Fair Swap</HD>
<DH>Cutting corporate welfare could fund a Bush Social Security
plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew G. Biggs and Maya MacGuineas</AU>
<BD>Andrew G. Biggs is a Social Security analyst at the
Cato Institute. Web site: www.cato.org. Maya MacGuineas is a senior
fellow at the New America Foundation. Web site: www.newamerica.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The midterm elections ended the misconception that proposing changes
to Social Security leads to a swift political death. President Bush
has repeated his support for voluntary personal retirement accounts,
and the moderate Democratic Leadership Council also leans toward the
idea.</LD>
<LD>   But how to pay for it? Reformers had targeted budget surpluses to
fund the transition of Social Security from government collections
and disbursements to personally directed investment accounts. But the
war on terrorism and the recession-induced decline in tax revenue
have produced a fiscal noose that threatens reform.</LD>
<LD>   A potential solution is to take an ax to corporate welfare.
Instead of draining taxpayers' pockets, the billions in subsidies,
grants and handouts could finance the transition to a sustainable
Social Security program. Investing corporate pork in Americans'
retirements is a bargain both left and right could learn to love.</LD>
<TE>   Corporate welfare is a revenue source with appeal to Democrats and
Republicans, who recognize -- but who so far have lacked the courage
to address -- the waste and inequities that special business
preferences create. Corporate welfare extends from classic political
pork, such as a $1.1-billion loan guarantee to build cruise ships in
Sen. Trent Lott's hometown, to financial assistance for large
companies from the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and to farm
subsidies that ate up $35 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Time magazine estimated in 1998 that corporate welfare costs
taxpayers $125 billion annually, a figure that includes "tax
expenditures" granting exemptions to favored industries, such as
timber, energy and insurance. Domestically, these handouts favor
certain companies and industries over others. Internationally,
corporate welfare weakens the free-trade credentials of the U.S. and
invites retaliation from Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by the Bush administration's budget director, Mitchell E.
Daniels Jr., to curb federal pork have yet to bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   While corporate welfare benefits are concentrated among
knowledgeable Washington insiders and special interests, the costs
are spread among millions of taxpayers who have little idea what they
are funding. Politicians are far more likely to hear from farmers and
business people seeking to preserve their handouts than from
taxpayers who are sick of paying for them.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security reform can break the political logjam. Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) have called for a commission to pinpoint and eliminate
corporate subsidies. Taking the idea a step further and earmarking
the savings for individual accounts could overcome resistance from
special interests.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be possible to cut all corporate welfare, and by itself
corporate welfare may not fix Social Security. Nevertheless, cutting
even half the total pork could fund any of the three personal account
plans from President Bush's 2001 Social Security reform commission.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just transfer corporate welfare money into the current
program? Why do we need personal accounts?</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Social Security has no way of truly saving money.
Surplus funds are credited to Social Security's trust fund, but the
actual cash just covers up deficits elsewhere in the budget.
Increasing Social Security's surpluses without saving the money in
individual accounts tempts another round of corporate handouts.
Personal accounts are the only true "lock box" that the government
can't pick.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is reluctant to act on Social Security without a viable
means to pay for reform. Likewise, it would be tough to persuade
politicians to give up corporate welfare without something to offer
in exchange. This "pork for pensions" trade-off could clear the way
for action.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians may like pork, but they'll like the credit from saving
Social Security even more.</TE>

<HD>Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?</HD>
<DH>At midnight tonight, perhaps we should set our clocks
thousands of years ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bart Kosko</AU>
<BD>Bart Kosko is a professor of electrical engineering at
the University of Southern California and author of "Heaven in a
Chip" (Random House, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it really going to be the year 2003 tomorrow?</LD>
<LD>   The Muslim calendar says it will be 1423.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese calendar says 4699.</LD>
<TE>   The Jewish calendar says 5763.</TE>
<TE>   The Hindu and Aztec and hundreds of other cultural calendars say
hundreds of other years.</TE>
<TE>   Our Gregorian choice of the year 2003 appears to be nothing more
than entrenched cultural prejudice in a truly multicultural world.</TE>
<TE>   Historians must now count backward from the birth of Jesus Christ
to date most of human history because of historical accidents
involving which groups first invented guns and which first practiced
market economics.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting numbering scheme suggests that Aristotle and the
Buddha lived out their heathen days as they waited for the Big Event
that would follow their deaths by hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims denounce this numbering of history as "crusader
culture" -- they would have us renumber history from the year that
Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina.</TE>
<TE>   Even the numbering system itself rests on an accident. There is no
good mathematical reason to use a decimal system. It persists only
because of an accident of evolution: Natural selection gave us 10
fingers and not six or 14, leaving us with the decimal system and the
metric system as well as decades, centuries and millenniums.</TE>
<TE>   But we need not be stuck with a calendar that picks one culture's
numbering of history and imposes it on everyone else. There is a
natural way to give Jesus and the West their cultural due and still
define the modern calendar so that it does not prefer one culture
over any other in human history.</TE>
<TE>   This new calendar accurately reflects the full flower of all human
civilization -- and does not require that we change how we abbreviate
the year on personal checks and in computer systems. It also fits
neatly into our finger-based numbering scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Such a calendar balances two overarching cultural facts. The first
is that the modern world has adopted the Christ-based standard for
numbering years.</TE>
<TE>   The worldwide millennium celebrations two years ago support this,
as did the attendant fears of a Y2K computer bug. Hollywood films and
English-language software continue to cement this Christian standard
even among hundreds of millions of non-Christians, many of whom use
pirated versions of these films and software.</TE>
<TE>   Even a culturally biased worldwide standard is better than no
standard at all -- and globalization demands a standard.</TE>
<TE>   The second fact is that there is a working consensus among social
scientists and cultural anthropologists that our modern civilization,
or "history," began in the Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago,
with the rise of agriculture. All else is the "prehistory" of
hunter-gatherers.</TE>
<TE>   That means only 400 to 500 generations have passed since then,
depending on the average age of a reproducing generation within a
range of 20 to 25 years. Our genetic hardware has remained largely
the same as that of our hunter-gatherer forebears over those
generations, even though there has been some genetic change -- the
modern Angus bull shows how substantially a genome can change over
just a few generations of unnatural selection.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all the cultural achievements that we call civilization took
place within these 10,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   Now combine the de facto worldwide standard of the Christian
calendar with the 10 millenniums of human civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Start the count when civilization begins and adjust slightly to
match the current standard.</TE>
<TE>   The result is what we can call the Calendar of Civilization: Happy
10,003.</TE>

<HD>Foreign Policy Loses Its Logic</HD>
<DH>It doesn't make sense to target Iraq when N. Korea poses a
greater threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darn, but those weapons of mass destruction keep turning up in the
wrong places.</LD>
<LD>   Forward air bases, Army infantry units, a hospital ship and docile
yet combat-trained reporters are all being readied for a "regime
change" war against Iraq promoted as a way to rid the world of an
arsenal Saddam Hussein doesn't seem to have.</LD>
<LD>   That United Nations inspectors, even after American intelligence
briefings, are coming up empty-handed is embarrassing enough, but
then North Korea had to steal the show by taking the wraps off its
far more advanced nuclear weapons program.</LD>
<TE>   That's pretty scary because American intelligence agencies believe
that bizarre, unpredictable North Korea already has enough plutonium
and tested bomb technology for one or two functioning nuclear
warheads that can easily be lobbed at our ally South Korea, home base
of 37,000 U.S. soldiers. Pyongyang in 1998 fired one of its
long-range Taepodong missiles over Japanese territory. American
intelligence officials believe that the regime is working on missiles
capable of reaching Hawaii and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Yet we have made it clear we are not planning to go to war with
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no hostile intent toward North Korea, and we hope they
will come to their senses," Secretary of State Colin Powell said
Sunday. He later added that "nobody is mobilizing armies, nobody is
threatening each other yet."</TE>
<TE>   Powell went on to say: "Let's take this patiently. Let's take it
with deliberation. Let's work with our friends and allies."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprisingly, it's the one proven warrior in the Bush
White House who seems to understand that peace is worth fighting for
and that diplomatic finesse is not a sign of weakness; war is.</TE>
<TE>   Were it not for Powell, the chicken hawks in the administration --
warmongers who have not themselves experienced battle -- already
would have us invading Iraq without giving U.N. inspectors a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld, these strident cheerleaders for so-called preemptive action
are obviously disappointed that the Iraq inspections have turned up
nothing more then the rusting remnants of a deadly weapons programs
originated -- and used -- with the full knowledge of the U.S.
government to punish fundamentalist Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Iran, still in Bush's putative "axis of evil" along
with Iraq and North Korea, may have a much more advanced nuclear
weapons program than Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Shiite fundamentalists must be high-fiving in Tehran
over the costly American makeover of Central Asia. These
fundamentalists would be the biggest benefactors of any takedown of
neighboring Iraq, as they were when the U.S. installed Iran's
longtime puppets, the Northern Alliance, as top dogs in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the nuclear nonproliferation regime is a shambles, with
President Bush publicly derisive about existing arms control pacts.
Bush insists that we will be just fine relying on a cockamamie
missile defense fantasy that is arguably the biggest defense
contractor boondoggle in the nation's long history of such deals.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling safe yet? You shouldn't be.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's foreign policy is now less logical than Pyongyang's.
A starving dictatorship's clumsy blackmail attempts at least make
some twisted sense in that the Bush administration has refused, from
its very first days, to even discuss North Korea's persistent request
for a nonaggression pact with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The administration plan is to isolate this paranoid excuse for a
nation, as if it isn't already the most isolated place on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   If we can't make peace with an utterly defeated nation like North
Korea, we're in trouble. From Columbine to Weimar Germany,
humiliating those with nothing to lose is always a recipe for
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea and Japan understand this, and both countries are
making major moves in an attempt to bring the North Koreans back into
the world community.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, which unleashed the nuclear monster and is
still the only nation to have used this deadliest weapon of mass
destruction against innocent civilians, should also understand why
other nations want one.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sick and ultimately suicidal obsession, but who are we to
talk when we are designing ever more efficient nuclear weapons for
preemptive use, underground "bunker busting" and God knows what else?</TE>
<TE>   We are the ones who continue to give legitimacy to the weapons of
mass destruction, threatening devastating preemptive strikes,
including possible use of nuclear weapons, against those who
defiantly refuse to bend to the will of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bush administration remains detached from the
destabilizing Israeli-Palestinian nightmare, is struggling to gain
footing against Al Qaeda and is apparently indifferent to the
successes of Muslim fundamentalism in Chechnya, Lebanon, Yemen,
Palestine and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we are mobilizing our massive forces against a weakened
secular dictator 6,000 miles away who doesn't seem to have had
anything to do with a series of devastating terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   What is happening here? Certainly not the construction of a
coherent foreign policy aimed at increasing the security of the
United States or our allies.</TE>
<TE>   This is an administration that in two years has so mucked up our
approach to the world that merely applying the demands of logic is
made to appear unpatriotic.</TE>

<LD>On the day after Christmas, a woman gave birth to the first human
clone -- or so a cloning company affiliated with a
science-fiction-like religious sect claims. Skeptical scientists
await confirmation from independent DNA testing of the as-yet-unseen
infant, called Eve, and her unidentified mother.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of us are left to wish that -- given the millions of
unwanted or orphaned children here and abroad and the need for adults
to adopt, foster or mentor them -- it was parents being "cloned."</LD>
<LD>   Just a week ago, on the day before Christmas, a man gave up his
newborn son, leaving the infant at a hospital in Long Beach under
California's safe haven law.</LD>
<TE>   Such laws, first introduced in Texas in 1999, have sparked
controversy, although not as heated as in today's debate over
cloning. California's version, enacted last year, allows any adult to
anonymously leave an unwanted baby at any hospital or fire station
within 72 hours of birth without threat of prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives argue that safe haven laws encourage
abandonment. Some liberals think the laws don't do enough to help
troubled mothers. But anecdotal evidence shows that, when well
publicized, they do what they were designed to do: save lives.</TE>
<TE>   The laws are meant to give panicked, often teenage parents a
no-questions-asked alternative to leaving their newborns in dumpsters
or other unsafe places. Earlier this month, even with the new law,
the body of an infant girl turned up on the Long Beach shore instead
of a hospital. Another was found -- too late -- on a South Los
Angeles porch.</TE>
<TE>   Such losses have prompted Los Angeles County to step up efforts to
publicize the law with billboards, bumper stickers and a toll-free,
multilingual Safe Haven Hotline, (877) 725-5111, operated 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Once saved, these children and many more like them need families,
or surrogates for families. The United States has more than half a
million foster children, with 50,000 of them in Los Angeles County.
Worldwide, the need is staggering. HIV/AIDS is devastating African
nations, leaving millions of children orphaned.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting, foster-parenting or even mentoring a child is a huge
responsibility. Those who can't open their homes can open their
wallets by donating to a favorite children's charity or to The Times
Holiday Campaign, which supports several nonprofit agencies providing
housing, tutoring, life-skills training, substance-abuse counseling
and other services for children and teenagers.</TE>

<TE>   Checks or money orders can be sent to the Los Angeles Times
Holiday Campaign, File 56986, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6986, through
January. Credit card donations can be made via the Internet at

<LD>North Korea's expulsion of nuclear weapons inspectors and disabling
of devices that ensured it would not revive a plutonium-based atomic
weapons program have quickly increased the danger on the Korean
peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday talk shows, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell portrayed
North Korea's actions as a threat but not a crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration says it intends to emphasize diplomacy,
politics and economics over a military approach at this time, but it
hasn't defined precisely how. Yet the next logical step seems clear:
Urge the nations that should be the most concerned about North Korea
developing more nuclear weapons -- Russia, China, Japan and South
Korea -- to take a more direct role in persuading the nation to
reverse course.</LD>
<TE>   Pyongyang agreed in 1994 to shut down nuclear weapons development
-- it was thought to already have two nuclear weapons, although not
the ability to launch them -- in exchange for financial assistance
and oil to heat its economically crippled country.</TE>
<TE>   So the Bush administration is right to insist that Pyongyang not
restart its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon or reprocess spent fuel rods
into plutonium that could be used to increase its atomic arsenal. But
other nations have an even greater stake.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should organize a conference that includes North
Korea, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. North Korea would, in
effect, get the talks with Washington it wants, while the United
States, which views direct negotiations as appeasement, could portray
the conference as a multilateral discussion among those nations that
have the most influence with the Communist dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   China can play a major role in defusing the situation. It is
trying to establish itself as a world power and insists it does not
want nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Hu Jintao, the newly
named general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, should
pressure North Korea to shut all its atomic weapons sites and admit
nuclear inspectors to monitor all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, who has good relations with
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, should add his weight to that
message.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, China, South Korea, Japan and the United States can
provide fuel, food and economic aid to help North Koreans avoid
freezing or starving to death.</TE>
<TE>   Tightening the economic screws on North Korea, as some in the Bush
administration urge, could backfire. China and South Korea, the
north's main benefactors, are reluctant to cut off aid, worrying that
an even greater economic catastrophe could produce floods of refugees
into their countries, lead Pyongyang to generate income by selling
nuclear know-how to other dangerous nations or prompt it to invade
the south.</TE>
<TE>   A failing state with nuclear weapons should be everyone's
nightmare. That's why North Korea's neighbors need to demonstrate
that they understand the growing nuclear danger in North Korea and
are willing to help remove it.</TE>

<LD>Large oil slicks that despoiled the once-pristine waters off the
Spanish coast are now metastasizing into Portuguese and French
territorial waters. The oil flows from 14 cracks in the tanker
Prestige, which sank Nov. 19 and now rests on the ocean floor 130
miles from the fishing port of Vigo.</LD>
<LD>   Its black cargo has tarred 180 beaches on Spain's Atlantic coast,
killing or maiming thousands of birds and ruining fish and shellfish
harvests. Most economic activities have ceased in coastal towns and
cities, and tens of thousands of people have lost their livelihoods.</LD>
<LD>   Damage done, the European Commission has issued a blacklist that
bans 66 specific ships from European waters and ports. The Spanish
and French governments went a step further Dec. 12, barring
single-hull tankers built more than 15 years ago from sailing within
200 miles of their coasts unless the vessels submit to exhaustive
inspections.</LD>
<TE>   The two nations' bilateral decision marks a de facto acceleration
of the phaseout of these dangerous ships, originally set for 2015 in
legislation approved by the European Union last year.</TE>
<TE>   This bold measure makes us wonder: What would it take to make the
United States government follow suit?</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 also defers until 2015 the
phasing out of single-hull tankers. Yet new findings by U.S.
environmental scientists have raised serious concerns that the
long-term environmental effect of oil spills in the ocean may have
been badly miscalculated. U.S. scientists had thought an ecosystem
would return to normal in about 20 years. Three months ago,
scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts announced they had found oil pockets just below the
seabed in that state's coast more than 30 years after a ship, the
Florida, ran aground, spilling nearly 185,000 gallons of oil.</TE>
<TE>   Not even bacteria have broken down the oil, says scientist
Christopher Reddy. "It still looks like run-of-the-mill diesel fuel."</TE>
<TE>   Prevention is the only effective protection against a spill's
devastation. The best available cleanup technologies with properly
trained personnel can recover only about 25% of an oil spill. The
United States should follow the European example and accelerate its
own phase-in of double hulls long before 2015.</TE>

<LD>I have seldom been more depressed than I am after reading "Burden of
Beasts in China" (Dec. 27). Certainly there is enough cruelty in the
world to keep us all in tears, but to harm captive animals that
cannot fight back should be a huge stain on all our consciences. If
we do nothing to stop it, we all richly deserve to be tortured to
death. From now on, I will actively campaign to stop travelers from
visiting China until this situation is corrected and I will refuse to
purchase any item with so much as a part that was manufactured in
China.</LD>

<LD>In his Dec. 26 commentary, "Housing Still Hasn't Hit the Ceiling,"
Nicolas Retsinas notes that California created four jobs for every
housing unit built in the 1990s but fails to explain why the market
didn't react by simply building more houses.</LD>
<LD>   A typical exchange goes like this: Developer Jones announces plans
to build 100 homes in an area at a unit cost of (fill in a reasonable
price for your neighborhood). Local residents then protest the
increased traffic, etc., that the new tract would bring (as if their
own homes somehow didn't contribute to this). Jones then goes back to
the drawing board and produces plans to build only 50 homes at (fill
in a much higher price here) on the same land.</LD>
<LD>   The locals acquiesce and the homes are built. The losers in this
exchange are young couples who can afford much less in the way of
housing than their parents could.</LD>

<TE>   Retsinas' sanguine view of the health of real estate is, I hope,
correct. However, several factors may derail his rosy scenario.</TE>
<TE>   First, Retsinas cites as a positive for housing the very low down
payments required today (5% or lower).</TE>
<TE>   But this low down payment may be the modern analog to low stock
margins in the 1920s. If prices started to decline, it could lead to
a large rise in mortgage defaults, since homeowners would no longer
have positive equity.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in homes for sale would lead to further price
declines, starting a downward price spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the massive fiscal contraction in California could hurt
real estate sales. It could lead to higher taxes and job losses,
depressing demand in the (once) Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   A new fiscal stimulus package out of Washington, along with
federal aid to the states, will help California and other
hard-pressed states. But will it be too little and too late to rescue
real estate and the overall economy from another recession?</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully not.</TE>

<LD>Re "From the Halls of Academia," Commentary, Dec. 27:</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Pipes has designated himself to the position of the
"thought police." He wants us all to be on the same page, dancing to
the same music played by the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone with common sense can sniff out the truth of this
relentless war song. It is quite obvious that the first thing a big
lie cannot stand is dissent. Why is that? Mr. Pipes, are you afraid
of the truth coming out?</LD>
<TE>   Kit Magat</TE>
<TE>   Gardena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pipes is absolutely correct in his analysis that American colleges
have evolved into bastions of compulsory politically correct speech
that deny the airing of any competing or contrary view.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the past and traditional role of academia, finding free
speech on campus is rare indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Michael G. Miller</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now director of the Middle East Forum, Pipes is an academician. He
espouses the thesis that Islam today is comparable to Nazism before
1945. I believe his comparison is an extremist view. Still, it is an
academic view, and Pipes himself is a member of the academic
establishment he condemns.</TE>
<TE>   Pipes would not be able to expound his extreme view were it not
for the open forum of ideas that is protected by academic
institutions in this country. Yet he would silence other voices. More
important than Pipes' view, or anyone else's, is the open marketplace
of ideas. All academicians should be free to speak out and offer data
to support their views.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Pipes, I would counter that the jihadism of Osama
bin Ladin does not represent Islam historically or contemporaneously.
Jihadism is like ultra-messianism in Judaism and Christian Identity
in Christianity -- a heretical mandate for violence espoused by a
tiny, terrorist elite.</TE>
<TE>   Jean E. Rosenfeld</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pipes argues that America's universities need to become more
mature, responsible and patriotic. Perhaps he needs to walk across a
couple of university campuses and observe the behavior of several of
today's freshmen. These are children, really, who have never had to
support themselves. This is part of the disconnect between Pipes and
students today. These kids are not that far removed from MTV. This is
why professors feel free to use the classroom for their own political
agendas.</TE>
<TE>   How do I come by my insights? I'm the first of my family to
graduate from college, beginning after serving one tour of duty in
the military. Americans are growing soft. The university cannot be a
maturing process for young minds. Mental toughness, having been there
and done that, needs to be a prerequisite for taking up a seat in
college. Students need to compare and contrast the outside world with
what their professors would have them believe. Professors still have
the power to wield grades, but at least with debate, both sides can
learn.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Padua</TE>
<TE>   Daly City, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pipes pines for America's campuses to return to the good old days
of a "politically balanced environment, as it was before the 1960s."
No women; few blacks; quotas on Jews: I nominate Pipes for the Trent
Lott Chair in Social Philosophy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The front page of Sunday's Times takes me back to Philosophy 101 and
the days of trying to figure out those tricky problems in logic: if a
and b and c, what is d?</LD>
<LD>   (a) "Many States Face Gloomy Budget Choices," the lead headline
reads; (b) "N. Korea Shows Its Bluster Is No Bluff," the article
below it reads; (c) "Chasing Phantoms Across Afghanistan" (the
longest article on the front page, about " 'The Untold War' ... in
which the enemy won't fight and victory is undefinable"); which
should lead to a conclusion that, (a) given all our national economic
problems, and (b) the growing nuclear threat from North Korea, and
(c) the proof from Afghanistan that we can't win a war in that
region, then (d) we should not attack Iraq?</LD>
<LD>   Wrong! I flunk. (d) "Strategy Against Iraq Calls for Swift Attack"
(fourth article on national issues). No, the whole country fails.</LD>

<TE>   Historians often remark that there was no reason for World War I.
There was no single overriding issue that would have demanded war. It
resulted from national hubris and clumsy diplomacy on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Bush administration is clumsily heading toward the
possibility of war with the world of Islam plus North Korea-China.
Why? Partly the administration's hubris in thinking that America has
been anointed to regulate the world, partly oil mercantilism and
partly our one-sided diplomacy in the Middle East.
Rumsfeld-Bush-Perle has got to wake up. What happened to the British
empire could happen to the U.S.</TE>

nothing. Sure, Saddam Hussein is an evil man, and yes, he runs a
repressive regime, but so far he hasn't hurt the U.S., nor can anyone
prove he intends to.</TE>
<TE>   Here we are, just recovering from the worst sneak attack in
America's history, and President Bush is about to spend billions we
don't have and commit untold American lives going after someone who
had nothing to do with the real atrocity. Here's our obsessed
president on a frolic of his own, on a personal vendetta and we're

ignorant or so complacent that we just don't care?</TE>

<HD>Learning How to Cope With an 'Urban' Coyote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Coyote Tales Give Pause," editorial, Dec. 26: With the cessation
of coyote trapping in Los Angeles in the early '90s, nature's
magnificent survivors moved unabated into the city and began
procreating the "urban" coyote -- a highly intelligent, "streetwise"
creature born along freeways and in parks, with little fear of
humans. Much of the current alarm stems from bold coyotes appearing
in long-established, highly urbanized areas, often stalking humans
walking their dogs or scaling six-foot security fences and devouring
domestic pets inside. Understandably, inner-city dwellers do not
expect, or want, to deal with wild predators.</LD>
<LD>   Much fear and misinformation abound on this subject, and certain
myths should be dispelled. Simply removing a dangerous coyote does
not automatically trigger an increase in numbers. As with all
mammals, food supply -- not available space -- dictates reproduction.
While a vacated den may attract a new inhabitant, the new coyote may
not be aggressive and may prefer a dinner of rodent to abducting
someone's pet. Locked garbage cans and feeding pets indoors certainly
are essential precautions, but they do not solve all instances of
intrusion or attack by coyotes. Sensible, humane policies must be
maintained to control any animals that attack or threaten humans.
Otherwise, residents often take protection into their own hands.</LD>

<LD>Despite pleas from parents and intervention by a county supervisor, a
central Oxnard Boys &amp; Girls Club will close its doors Friday for
renovations, leaving four staff members without a job.</LD>
<LD>   But Carmen Ramos-Soriano, president of the youth center's board of
directors, promised the community that the club -- which serves about
400 Oxnard children -- will reopen by the end of next year.</LD>
<LD>   "This is temporary with a capital 'T'," she said Monday following
a meeting with Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn, who had been
asked by several parents to help them fight the club's closing. "We
are going to reopen it," she added.</LD>
<TE>   Her statement was enough to convince Oxnard Planning Commissioner
Morey Navarro, an alum of the aging 7th Street facility.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Navarro rallied around angry parents who said they
doubted the board's resolve to reopen the club.</TE>
<TE>   But Navarro, who also attended the meeting, said he is now
satisfied that board members are committed to keeping their promise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a roadblock for them," Navarro said. "The
faster we work together, the faster we can get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it appears that four staff members who were laid off as
the club was closed will not be reinstated, but can reapply for their
jobs when the club reopens.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers included Ruben Herrera, 53, a beloved coach at the club
for 33 years. The employees were let go nearly two weeks ago after
board members decided the club was no longer safe for children.</TE>
<TE>   On a tour through the 49-year-old building Monday, Ramos-Soriano
and Tim Blaylock, chief operating officer for the Oxnard and Port
Hueneme clubs, pointed out the leaky roof, crumbling ceilings and
cramped, dingy restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos-Soriano said club officials will meet with parents on Jan.
13 to brainstorm fund-raising ideas and to discuss their vision for
what the new club should look like.</TE>
<TE>   "I want better for the children of Oxnard," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he is setting up a meeting early next week so that
parents can voice their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped the board would consider reopening at least a
portion of the facility -- probably the gymnasium -- while
renovations took place.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, he asked club officials to consider arranging
transportation for children to the nearby 5th Street club while the
7th Street facility is closed.</TE>

<HD>State Auditing D.A.'s Fund for Misuse</HD>
<DH>The attorney general is trying to determine whether money
for law enforcement in Orange County was spent improperly on liquor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state attorney general's office said Monday it is auditing a
special fund in the Orange County district attorney's office to
determine whether money earmarked for law enforcement was misused.</LD>
<LD>   The probe comes two weeks after Orange County Auditor-Controller
David Sundstrom said he was unable either to verify or refute
allegations by the Orange County Grand Jury that money from the fund
was improperly spent on alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   Sundstrom said his audit stalled because Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas would not provide him with certain documents about the
expenses. Rackauckas argued that making the documents public would
compromise undisclosed criminal probes.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said his office's audit of
the Special Appropriations Fund began several weeks ago. Officials
are trying to determine whether a Rackauckas aide used money to buy
drinks for politicians, lobbyists, journalists and others.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman, Nathan Barankin, said the attorney general is
within his rights to conduct the audit because his office allocated
the money in the special fund and oversees its use. The attorney
general routinely audits the funds, but is paying special attention
to Orange County, Barankin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to expedite this particular audit because of the
questions raised," Barankin said. "The purpose of the program is to
help local law enforcement prosecute and convict dangerous criminals.
Our objective is to make sure the money is being used for that
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Rackauckas, declined to discuss
the audit.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general disburses about $3 million annually to local
district attorneys for use in sensitive areas such as witness
protection and relocation.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the grand jury reported that Rackauckas' top investigator
billed the fund for alcohol-only expenses at a Santa Ana social club.
It's unclear exactly how much was spent.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the county does not reimburse employees for alcohol
expenses, Sundstrom opened an investigation of the fund in October.</TE>
<TE>   But Sundstrom has said he was unable to determine whether
Rackauckas aide Don Blankenship billed the fund for alcohol.
Sundstrom last week asked the attorney general to help him complete
the audit. He said he hasn't gotten a response.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I going to take the D.A.'s word or the grand jury's word?"
Sundstrom said Monday. "I need to come to my own assessment
independently. In order to do so, I need to see those documents."</TE>
<TE>   If Sundstrom determines money was misspent, he said he will ask
the district attorney's office to reimburse the county.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has criticized Rackauckas for his handling of the special
fund as well as other allegations contained in the grand jury report.
Rackauckas has denied any wrongdoing, saying the grand jury was
unduly influenced by his political enemies.</TE>

<HD>New Year's Revelers Can Take the Bus Free</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time, the Orange County Transportation Authority will
offer free bus service on New Year's Eve and the early hours of New
Year's Day to help provide safe travel for the holiday.</LD>
<LD>   Rides will be available on 55 regularly scheduled routes from 6
p.m. to midnight today. Between 11:30 tonight and 4 a.m. Wednesday,
riders won't have to pay to use OCTA's Night Owl runs on the four
routes along major county thoroughfares.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to provide a service to help ensure that local residents
can travel safely to and from their New Year's celebrations," said
Tim Keenan, chairman of the OCTA board of directors. "We hope to make
free New Year's bus service a tradition," he said.</LD>
<TE>   OCTA officials said the four Night Owl routes serve some Orange
County destinations where public New Year's events are being held,
such as Disneyland, Edison Field, the Anaheim Pond, The Block in
Orange, and downtown Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Route 43 runs north-south between Fullerton and Costa Mesa via
Harbor Boulevard. Route 50 runs east-west between Long Beach and
Orange via Katella Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Route 57 links Brea and Newport Beach along State College
Boulevard and Bristol Street. Route 60 runs east-west between Long
Beach and Santa Ana, along 17th Street and Westminster Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   For holiday bus schedules and more details, visit OCTA's Web site
at www.octa.net, or call (714) 636-RIDE.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the Metropolitan Transit Authority will
offer free rides on its bus and rail systems New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The Metro Rail subway system will be free from 9 p.m. until
closing, usually about 1:30 a.m. Free rides on the bus system will be
from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Homicide Rate in County Falls to 1999 Level</HD>
<DH>Oxnard, with 11, and Santa Paula, with six, had about
two-thirds of the 23 slayings in 2002. Most are gang-related and
remain unsolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of homicides in Ventura County fell sharply this year,
even as gang violence ticked upward.</LD>
<LD>   The 23 homicides in 2002, including the Santa Paula couple who
were bludgeoned to death in their bed and a rash of gang-related
deaths in Oxnard, were the fewest since 1999 and eight below last
year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always difficult to explain why numbers like these go up or
down," said Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman for the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department. "One thing that we point to, though, is the
strong commitment by peace officers, support staff and the public,
who all want to keep crime low."</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard and Santa Paula accounted for about two-thirds of the
homicides in the county, although the two cities make up about
one-quarter of its population.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard logged the most homicides, with 11, and Santa Paula had its
deadliest year on record with six.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike 2001, when half of Oxnard's 12 homicides were
officer-involved incidents, this year's slayings were primarily
gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Three homicides occurred in Ventura and one each in Port Hueneme,
Camarillo and El Rio. Simi Valley, which recorded six homicides in
2001, had none in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most we've had in the history of the city," Santa
Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said. "We normally have an average of
closer to 2.5, and in many years we've had none."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula reported no killings in 2001 and three in 1999 and
2000 combined.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of killings throughout the county involved one or
more of the following: alcohol, drugs, gang warfare, robbery or
domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Robbery and joyriding were cited as motives in a case that
Gonzales called the most heinous of his career.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 21, Santa Paula residents John M. Ramirez, 59, and his
wife, Joann Wotkyns, 55, were bludgeoned to death in their bed. Less
than two weeks later, police arrested Adam Sarabia, 16, whose alleged
motive was robbery and a cruise in the couple's Special Edition Chevy
Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia has pleaded not guilty and remains in juvenile hall,
pending a Jan. 15 preliminary hearing. He will be tried as an adult
and, if convicted, faces life in prison without the possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the type of homicide case that you hear about and read
about but never believe will happen in your own backyard," Gonzales
said. "It was this city's most significant, ever."</TE>
<TE>   Arrests were made in three other homicide cases. A case in Oxnard
was ruled accidental, and an officer-involved incident in Ventura was
ruled as justified. The remaining cases are unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   While Sarabia was one of the youngest homicide suspects arrested
this year, five victims were also teenagers. Most were involved in
gang violence or robbery, but one case involved a young man with no
obvious ties to crime.</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of Nov. 2, Steven Miinster -- a 15-year-old Hueneme
High School student who worked part time as a clerk in the school
office -- was shot in the torso as he stood near his family's Oxnard
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   He died minutes later at a local hospital. There have been no
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Reeves, 19, of Ventura represents the county's only
officer-involved fatality. Reeves, a suspected car thief, was shot by
Ventura police at a local motel April 4, when he came at officers
with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to having the most homicides for 2002, Oxnard also
reported one of the most puzzling cases.</TE>
<TE>   About 4:30 a.m. March 23, a mentally disabled man was sleeping in
his bed when someone threw a Molotov cocktail through a kitchen
window and fired several shots into another window.</TE>
<TE>   As relatives struggled to douse the fire in the kitchen, Isaac
Hughes, 61, lay dying in his room from a shoulder wound.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police still don't know why -- or whether -- Hughes, who
had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, was targeted.</TE>
<TE>   "Homicides are so unpredictable," said Oxnard Police Sgt. Jim
Seitz, head of the department's major crimes unit. "It's just one of
those crimes you can't stop."</TE>
<TE>   Like other police agencies in the county, Oxnard officials this
year beefed up units that specialize in gangs and drug sales in hopes
of making more arrests and stemming the tide of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Another odd case involved Santa Paula resident Joseph McMullen,
29, who was shot and killed April 28 behind his mother's home, a week
after surviving another shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the attacks were related, involving drugs and
gang retaliation.</TE>

<HD>Paul Kantor, 83; L.A. Dealer Showed Many Emerging Artists</HD>

<LD>Paul Kantor, a pioneering Los Angeles art dealer whose galleries
provided a sophisticated showcase for leading modern and contemporary
artists in the 1950s and '60s, died Dec. 23 at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center. He was 83 and died of complications from Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a shoe salesman, Kantor was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in
1919, but spent his adult life in Southern California, where he
developed a sharp eye for artistic excellence. He presented the first
Los Angeles exhibitions of works by many artists who would become
internationally renowned, including California painter Richard
Diebenkorn and Abstract Expressionists Robert Motherwell, Mark
Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb and Willem de Kooning.</LD>
<LD>   Kantor often complained about the difficulties of selling fine art
in a town steeped in popular culture. "The whole art community here
operates at such a low level, they deserve galleries where they can
pay a dollar down and a dollar a month for art," he told a Times
interviewer in 1975. But he built a clientele of high-profile
Hollywood figures who appreciated his taste, including producer
William Goetz, director Billy Wilder, MCA chief Lew Wasserman and
playwright Clifford Odets.</LD>
<TE>   "Paul was a very important dealer for Los Angeles," said Manny
Silverman, whose West Hollywood gallery presents exhibitions by some
of the artists Kantor represented. "He always had a fine eye for
quality and a great acumen for business."</TE>
<TE>   Kantor studied philosophy, psychology and art at Brooklyn College,
then served in the Navy during World War II. In 1946, while visiting
relatives in San Francisco and looking for a place to settle, he took
a fateful bus trip to Los Angeles. He soon married a fellow
passenger, painter Josephine Morris, and made Southern California his
home.</TE>
<TE>   Kantor said that he got into the art business by accident in the
late 1940s, when he loaned money to artists who ran the Fraymart
Gallery on La Brea Avenue. He took over the gallery when he
discovered that he was liable for their debts. To make ends meet, he
turned part of the space into a frame shop and supplemented his
income by writing a newsletter for the Seafarers Union.</TE>
<TE>   But Kantor was onto something, and as his knowledge of art grew,
he developed a business that commanded attention. He moved the
Fraymart Gallery to a tonier neighborhood on Beverly Boulevard in
1950 -- the same year he discovered Diebenkorn's work, at an annual
juried exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of History,
Science and Art in Exposition Park. Diebenkorn's painting didn't win
the big prize, as Kantor thought it should, but he tracked down the
artist, who was teaching at the University of New Mexico at
Albuquerque, and bought three paintings for $300.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all the money I had," Kantor said.</TE>
<TE>   He changed the gallery's name to Kantor Gallery in 1952. Five
years later, he relocated his business to Camden Drive in Beverly
Hills, near the gallery run by his friend Frank Perls.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, after Kantor's first marriage had ended in divorce, a
young German woman, Ulrike Wegener, came into his gallery to see
whether he would buy a Joan Miro watercolor she was trying to sell.
They didn't agree on a price, but met by chance at a restaurant a
year later and married soon thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Kantor closed his gallery in 1966 and began doing business from
his house. "I didn't want to be a shopkeeper in Beverly Hills
anymore, but I've never wanted to stop dealing," he told The Times in
1995. "I love the subject, and I love having the work around. I just
don't like having to deal with people."</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, he cultivated a gruff manner and recounted
frustrations with Los Angeles collectors. One favorite story featured
Marcia Simon Weisman, who asked Kantor when he was going to take down
an exhibition of Georges Rouault's prints and graphics and put up
something new.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll change the show when someone buys one," he responded.</TE>
<TE>   Kantor also criticized Weisman's brother, industrialist Norton
Simon, who became notorious for grilling experts about potential art
purchases and then making his own decisions while building the
collection housed at his museum in Pasadena. Simon could have had an
even better collection if he had listened to the experts, Kantor
said. But almost in the next breath, he dismissed Simon as a
collector who "bought by consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such laments, Kantor built a lucrative business, mainly by
buying multimillion-dollar artworks by Pablo Picasso and other major
artists in partnership with other dealers and selling them privately
in Los Angeles. He also inspired his wife and a son to become art
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Ulrike Kantor were divorced in 1973 and remarried in
1996. She ran her own galleries during the late 1970s and '80s, while
she was single. Their son Niels Kantor opened the newest Kantor
Gallery in 1994 on Melrose Avenue, where he shows contemporary art.</TE>
<TE>   Kantor is survived by his wife; four sons, Anatole, James, Niels
and Philip; a daughter, Siulan; a brother, Robert; and two grandsons.</TE>

<HD>PUC Tables Vote on Gas Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deluged with protests, the California Public Utilities Commission on
Monday delayed until next year a vote on competing plans to relax
regulation of the Southern California natural gas market.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer groups, large gas customers and others had expressed
fears that implementing new rules allowing energy marketers to buy
gas pipeline capacity would invite market manipulation and higher
prices.</LD>
<LD>   The clincher, however, appeared to be a Dec. 20 letter from Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) to PUC President
Loretta Lynch urging a delay. Burton said he wanted to afford the
Legislature time to discuss with the commission the "further
deregulation of Southern California's natural gas infrastructure."</LD>
<TE>   The new rules would allow energy companies not regulated by the
utilities commission to buy and sell the rights to transport gas
through lines owned by Southern California Gas Co., which is part of
Sempra Energy. About 65% of California's natural gas flows through
the system.</TE>
<TE>   When it became clear Monday that Commissioner Jeff Brown would be
on the short end of a 3-2 vote, he withdrew a resolution that would
have put new rules in place by August.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and the commission's staff had urged a more deliberate
timetable in light of dozens of protests, the complexity of the
issues and disclosures about manipulation of gas markets during the
energy crisis of 2000-01. Their resolution would require Southern
California Gas to file a new plan for the implementation of gas
system rules.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Carl Wood, a Lynch ally and a foe of deregulation,
called Burton's letter "a wake-up call" that reminded him of the
commission's commitment to consult with the Legislature before
further deregulating the state's energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the PUC endorsed the new rules in concept a year ago,
Brown accused fellow commissioners of intentionally delaying
implementation with intent to kill. "This thing is dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had hoped that his resolution would be supported by
Commissioner Henry Duque, a Republican appointee of former Gov. Pete
Wilson, and by Michael Peevey, a supporter of deregulation appointed
by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But Peevey said he was troubled by the flurry of letters,
including the one from Burton, and was not prepared to vote for
Brown's resolution Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey said he had a "strong inclination" to vote for the measure
at the commission's Jan. 19 meeting. However, Peevey is serving out
the term of retired Commissioner Richard Bilas, which expires today.
Duque's term also ends today.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio declined to say whether Peevey was
being reappointed but said Davis would have an announcement on both
commission openings in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   The appointments, which must be confirmed by the Senate, would
allow the governor to fill all five spots on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Brown's plan included the Utility Reform Network,
major oil refineries, Southern California Edison and the state
Department of General Services, which procures gas for the state.
Some expressed fear that energy marketers could tie up enough
pipeline capacity to gouge utilities and others when the system
becomes congested.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives intermediaries who have no vested stake in the health of
California the right to control assets and profit as they wish," said
Mike Florio, senior attorney at Utility Reform Network.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Gas spokesman Richard Beamish said, "These
rules contain multiple safeguards that would prevent [market
manipulation] from happening."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, there are limitations on pipeline capacity
that any entity can own on any Southern California Gas receipt point.
Similar rules are in place in Northern California for the Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric Co. system. PUC officials say they are not aware of market
manipulation on that system.</TE>

<LD>The Marin Municipal Water District is considering a proposal to
remove salt from San Pablo Bay to provide as much as 10 million
gallons of water a day -- enough to supply 30,000 homes a year.</LD>
<LD>   The plant and pipelines could cost $100 million, and some experts
say the cost of electricity to power the plant would be prohibitive.</LD>

<HD>Project Seeks to Remove 'Seamy' From Simi</HD>
<DH>City plans to offer matching grants as incentives for
business owners along faded Los Angeles Avenue to fix up their
properties.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the old days, a war veteran with $1 down could get into a Simi
Valley home. So the community quickly came to be known as "Seamy
Valley," at least to its upscale neighbors in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Simi Valley leaders have tried for more than four decades to shake
that image as a haven for cheap housing and tacky shops. Their latest
venture is a plan to renovate tired Los Angeles Avenue, once the
commercial heart and soul of Simi Valley but now a two-mile stretch
of faded strip malls, mom-and-pop shops and tacky discount stores.</LD>
<LD>   Barber Abe Mehrassa keeps a 1960s-era postcard tucked away in a
corner of his shop as a reminder of the avenue's heyday.</LD>
<TE>   On the front is a picture of a thriving shopping center, the words
"Simi California" written in black script across the cyan blue sky
above Larwin Square.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first shopping centers in Simi Valley, Larwin Square
was home over the years to a furniture emporium, a jewelry store, a
camera shop and a multiplex movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   But something happened to the shopping center -- whose name was
later changed to Mountain Gate Plaza -- and many other storefronts
along Los Angeles Avenue, one of the main streets through Simi
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   It slowly, painfully fell into disrepair. Foot traffic fell away,
businesses moved to more advantageous locations or shut down
altogether, and the indoor part of the mall was shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   Now, city officials say they want to persuade the owners of
businesses that dot the avenue from Erringer Road to Simi Village
Drive to make improvements. If the city offers financial incentives
to property owners to make their stores more attractive, the theory
goes, businesses will draw more customers -- and bring more tax
revenue to the city treasury.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley City Council voted recently to set aside $500,000
for the incentive program, which would provide matching grants of up
to $20,000 to property owners or tenants who agree to improve their
aging storefronts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the grants, the city plans to install new lighting
and landscaping along the street, said Brian Gabler, director of the
Community Development Agency.</TE>
<TE>   City officials point to the success of a similar program
introduced four years ago along Tapo Street, another blighted
commercial district, as reason to believe the Los Angeles Avenue
proposal will work.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen projects along Tapo have been completed and seven are
under construction, Gabler said. The city's contribution of $495,600
in grants encouraged private property owners to spend $739,800 of
their own money to paint, landscape or otherwise upgrade their
properties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mehrassa, the barber, said an attractive building does not
necessarily translate into ringing cash registers. There are other
factors, such as rising rents and competitors with deep pockets, that
keep mom-and-pop shops on the edge of extinction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're trying to do that, they shouldn't be allowing any more
shopping centers to be built," Mehrassa said. "They should be doing
something about the rents. Businesses can't make it here."</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Gate tenant Eli Pardo would agree. After owning Anderson
Jewelers for 39 years, Pardo closed his store for good on Christmas
Eve. With more than half the storefronts in the plaza vacant and
ownership changing hands three times in the last two years, the
shopping complex is more ghost town than bustling commercial center,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in very, very poor shape," Pardo said of Mountain Gate,
which recently underwent a rehab that took five years to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "After five years of renovation, it never amounted to anything,"
he said. "This place is empty."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, a strip mall built in 1948 is also grappling with
vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   The one-story L.A. Avenue Center has lost one of its five tenants
and is close to losing another, said Jim Cherry, owner of the Carpet
Coop, who has leased space in the building for 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the exterior desperately needs attention, Cherry said the
biggest problem is the faulty plumbing. Tenants have complained to
the new owner about toilets that don't flush properly, crumbling
asphalt in the parking lot, holes in the walls, a broken air
conditioner and graffiti out front, but nothing has happened, Cherry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry would like to see the landlord, a Los Angeles businessman
who bought the building nearly a year ago, take advantage of the city
program. But he is doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he has any money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city will give grants to tenants who want to make
improvements to their stores with the permission of building owners,
Cherry and other tenants on the avenue said they don't think it's
their responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone talks about [Los Angeles Avenue] being a slum place,
like Tapo," Cherry said. "It's so bad now. This place needs something
drastic."</TE>
<TE>   Some 136 properties on Los Angeles Avenue have been identified by
city officials as businesses that could benefit from the renovation
program, Gabler said. The initial grant will cover 25, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city is slated to begin accepting applications in February
after the Planning Commission and City Council establish boundaries
for the improvement zone, Gabler said.</TE>

<HD>Mohammed al-Fassi, 50; Sheik Known for Garish Estate,
High-Stakes Divorce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mohammed al-Fassi, the Saudi Arabian sheik who provoked his Beverly
Hills neighbors' ire in the late 1970s when he painted his Sunset
Boulevard mansion and its outdoor nude statues garish colors, has
died. He was 50.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Fassi, who was embroiled with his first wife in a long-running
community property battle that also got wide publicity, died of an
infected hernia on Dec. 24, in Cairo, Egypt, according to attorney
Marvin Mitchelson.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchelson represents al-Fassi's estranged first wife, Sheika Dena
al-Fassi, in the case between the legally separated couple.</LD>
<TE>   In 1983, Dena al-Fassi was awarded nearly $82 million, or half of
their almost $164 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Beverly Hills property, the assets included two
Boeing 707 jets; 36 cars; a $15-million yacht, 26 horses; a zoo in
Saudi Arabia; homes in Switzerland, London, Spain, Florida and Saudi
Arabia; and millions of dollars in jewelry, gold coins, carpets,
antiques and paintings.</TE>
<TE>   But except for $7 million from the sale of their Beverly Hills
home and an additional $1 million in insurance, Mitchelson said, Dena
al-Fassi has not been able to collect.</TE>
<TE>   The mid-1970s marriage of al-Fassi's sister, Hend, to Saudi Prince
Turki bin Abdul Aziz made al-Fassi's extravagant lifestyle possible.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition of the royal family is to financially support its
immediate and extended family and al-Fassi directly benefited from
his relationship with the royal family, Mitchelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Morocco, al-Fassi moved to Saudi Arabia when he was about
10. His father, a wealthy merchant, supplied goods to the royal
family.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Fassi met the Italian-born Dena in London in 1974; she was
studying English and working part-time in a boutique.</TE>
<TE>   They were married in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Fassi first gained notoriety in 1978 when he paid $2.4 million
in cash for his Beverly Hills mansion. It didn't take him long to
antagonize his neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   He had the 38-room, white-stucco home painted a shade of green
that one critic likened to the color of rotting limes.</TE>
<TE>   He replaced the red tile roof with copper, filled the outdoor urns
with plastic flowers and -- most jarringly -- had the classic Italian
statuary surrounding the 3 1/2-acre estate painted in natural skin
tones with the hair and genital areas painted to appear more
lifelike.</TE>
<TE>   The unorthodox paint job caused traffic jams on Sunset Boulevard
as sightseers slowed to gawk and photograph the mansion, which was
dubbed "a dirty Disneyland" by the press.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, al-Fassi called a news conference to plead for his
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   As for the painted statues, he later told the Washington Post: "I
saw them as plain and pale. I saw it as a personal touch. I can't
understand why anyone would object."</TE>
<TE>   When the mansion fell victim to arson in 1980 while the al-Fassis
were abroad, many neighbors watched the spectacular blaze and
chanted, "Burn! Burn! Burn!"</TE>
<TE>   And when the mansion was sold and finally razed in 1985, 500
invited guests donned souvenir hardhats and marked the beginning of
demolition with raised wine glasses. The land the mansion stood on
remains vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Fassi was no less conspicuous a resident of Miami Beach, where
he antagonized the community in the late '80s by installing a blue
neon Arabic sign on the wall of his nine-room home facing Biscayne
Bay: "In the name of God most gracious, most merciful."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, al-Fassi continued to generate headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Under Saudi law, sheiks and others may have as many as four wives.</TE>
<TE>   And while still married to his first wife, he married aspiring
American actress Victoria Sosa, who weeks later charged that he had
bitten and beaten her and held her prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was dropped after an out-of-court settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Fassi also faced lawsuits for allegedly failing to pay debts in
Los Angeles and suits from former staff members who alleged that
al-Fassi and other family members had abused them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he was at the center of a battle within the Saudi royal
family.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Iraqi side during the Persian Gulf War, al-Fassi made
radio broadcasts from Baghdad denouncing Saudi Arabia for allowing
foreign troops into the country.</TE>
<TE>   He also called for democracy in the kingdom and attacked the royal
family.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1991, while he and his family were staying at a hotel
in Amman, Jordanian security forces arrested him and turned him over
to the Saudi authorities who had demanded his extradition.</TE>
<TE>   For months, he was held without charges in Riyadh before being
placed under house arrest for about three years, according to
Mitchelson.</TE>
<TE>   He was finally banished from Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted him out of the country and took all his money," the
attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled that
al-Fassi and Bin Abdul Aziz, his brother-in-law, must pay Dena
al-Fassi $223 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sum includes two decades of accrued interest.</TE>
<TE>   Dena al-Fassi's suit contended that the royal family had taken
possession of all of Mohammed al-Fassi's assets over the years. The
ruling is the first to demand accountability from the Saudi kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen it yet, but we definitely intend to collect it,"
said Mitchelson, who plans to seek a further judgment against the
king of Saudi Arabia and the kingdom itself at the end of January.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Fassi, according to Mitchelson, had six wives, three of whom he
divorced.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his three wives, including Dena, seven children
and a sister and brother.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Congregation Weathering Zoning Battle</HD>
<DH>Ordered from warehouse by Huntington Beach officials,
Praise Christian Center moves outdoors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every Sunday for the last year, loyal church members have walked past
ceramic deer, potted palms and fruit trees -- green-tagged with
wholesale prices -- to seek the word of God on the grounds of a
Huntington Beach landscape supplier.</LD>
<LD>   It is here beneath an outdoor canvas canopy that the faithful from
Praise Christian Center have assembled in coats and thick sweaters to
ward off the morning chill while listening to Pastor Derek
Anunciation deliver his message.</LD>
<LD>   "Attendance has dropped since we began holding services outside,"
said Anunciation, the 35-year-old pastor.</LD>
<TE>   The church has been forced outside because of a zoning battle that
has caught the attention of several national religious and
conservative organizations. Praise Christian held services inside a
converted warehouse at American Landscape Supply on Goldenwest Street
until it was ordered from the building because of city zoning codes.</TE>
<TE>   The building needs a fire sprinkler system, fire alarm, upgraded
plumbing and noise buffers, among other improvements. The city is
also asking for $44,000 in fees for improvements to Goldenwest
Street, which runs in front of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Brindle, who owns the land where Praise Christian holds
services, believes the city fees are aimed at him. He said the city
has been on him to sell his 20-acre parcel so a developer can build
homes, similar to the $600,000 homes that ring his property. The city
denies the fees are a pressure tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation said he can't afford the roadway fee.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a small congregation," said Anunciation, who estimates
about four dozen families regularly attend his services. "We can't
come up with that kind of money."The yearlong dispute between the
tiny church and the beach city could become a classic standoff, said
Erik Stanley, an attorney with Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based
organization specializing in defending religious civil liberties. He
said the city may have violated the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act that says local governments cannot
"substantially burden" the free exercise of religion through zoning
laws.</TE>
<TE>   A similar argument was used in Cypress where the city wanted to
bring in a Costco discount store on land owned by the Cottonwood
Christian Center. Cypress rejected the church's proposal to build,
then condemned the church's property so it could sell the land to
Costco or a similar, tax revenue-generating "big box" store. The
lawsuit was settled in October with the church agreeing to sell its
property and build on an adjacent parcel.</TE>
<TE>   Praise Christian's fight doesn't involve condemnation, but Stanley
said Huntington Beach's zoning ordinance is so restrictive against
churches that -- in his view -- "it's illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Before a Planning Commission decision in November to amend the
zoning ordinance, a church would not have been permitted on the land,
which is zoned for industrial use. In overhauling the ordinance, the
commission said the church could return to the warehouse provided it
obtain a conditional-use permit. The commission also added the
roadway improvement fee.</TE>
<TE>   "The pastor needs to comply with the fees and permits," said Diane
Turner, a city spokeswoman. "He is seeking to alter the use of that
building."</TE>
<TE>   According to the city, improvements to Goldenwest Street cost
nearly $2 million and included widening and infrastructure upgrades.
The City Council approved the fees this year and Anunciation's
application for a church was the first to come under the new fee
structure, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Praise Christian's attorney Robert H. Tyler said the fees are part
of the city's "discriminatory tactics." He said it's clear the city
prefers the land be used for something other than a church.</TE>
<TE>   "In Derek's case, the city has been trying to run the owner off,
and they're effectively trying to squeeze Derek so the present
property owner would sell to a developer to build homes," said Tyler,
who is with the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative group based in
Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The city denied the allegations, saying the requirements are
applied to everyone seeking a change of use for a building.</TE>
<TE>   Brindle, 65, said he has had to fight the city to protect his
property for more than two decades. He bought the land in 1976 when
there were few other structures around. The property is a hodgepodge
of various uses, including a nursery, oil derricks, warehouse and a
duck pond.</TE>
<TE>   He said he's refused to sell despite generous offers by
developers. "I've already seen conceptual plans for 63 residences for
this property," said Brindle. "They [city officials] just don't want
a church on a multimillion dollar piece of property like this one."</TE>
<TE>   Brindle met Anunciation through a twist of fate. Brindle was
flipping the television channels one evening when he saw
Anunciation's cable show. At the time, Praise Center was paying
$1,800 a month in rent and needed a cheaper location.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the show, Derek said 'If there's a wealthy man out
there who doesn't care about money, would he step forward?' Well, he
hit the nail on the head. That's me," Brindle said. Church members
like Rachel Blanco pray for a solution. "Here everybody knows
everybody," she said. "We're like a family."</TE>

<HD>Progress Cited on Water Deal as Deadline Nears</HD>
<DH>Imperial Irrigation District must OK sale to San Diego
agency by midnight tonight or get smaller allocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CENTRO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The attorney for the Imperial Irrigation District said Monday night
that incremental progress is being made in breaking the deadlock over
a proposed water deal between the district and coastal Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   But Imperial board members responded with anger at the federal
government and deep distrust of other California water agencies
involved in the proposed deal.</LD>
<LD>   That deal is the result of two political imperatives: San Diego's
push to secure a long-term contract for Colorado River water, and the
demand by six other river-dependent states that California curb its
enormous consumption.</LD>
<TE>   Imperial faces a deadline of midnight tonight to either approve
the sale of water to the San Diego County Water Authority or see its
allocation of irrigation water from the Colorado River slashed by 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial lawyer John Carter said that the Department of Interior
has agreed to a key concession and that coastal water agencies have
agreed to back Imperial in its bid for $200 million from a state bond
issue to pay the cost of repairing the Salton Sea. The sea exists
solely on agricultural runoff and could be harmed if Imperial reduces
water usage.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial board, which rejected an earlier proposal 3 to 2 on
Dec. 9, is set to reconvene this afternoon to consider the issue
after first meeting in closed session with its lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Even board members who initially supported the sale expressed
anger at an announcement by Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett
Raley that Imperial's water will be cut if it does not meet the
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think we have to fight" the Department of Interior? asked
board member Lloyd Allen. "Yes, we've got to fight. We can't let them
do this."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and consultants representing Imperial, San Diego,
Metropolitan and the Coachella Valley water districts are engaged in
marathon negotiating sessions, including meetings and conference
calls, in an effort to revive the deal.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the Imperial district has balked at the proposed sale
is fear that it will be billed for the projects aimed at fixing the
Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Allen said the three other agencies agreed that if their request
for $200 million from Proposition 50, the state water bond passed in
November, is not approved by October, the water sale will be
scuttled.</TE>
<TE>   But Raley said the idea of putting such conditions on the
Imperial-San Diego water transfer is inconsistent with the agreement
approved two years ago by the Department of Interior and six other
Western states. That agreement called for the sale to be finalized by
today.</TE>
<TE>   Key legislators and officials of Gov. Gray Davis' administration
have discussed using Proposition 50 to help save the water deal.</TE>
<TE>   However, any decision on such an allocation would have to be made
by the Legislature, which could take months.</TE>
<TE>   Raley has said the federal government and the other Colorado River
states deserve "finality" in their efforts to curb California's
historic overuse of the Colorado River by transferring water from
farms to cities.</TE>
<TE>   On another point, Raley said the Department of Interior will agree
not to make further attempts to reduce Imperial's water allocation by
claiming that farmers are wasteful.</TE>
<TE>   But Imperial directors said they want to see all promises made by
the federal government and the other California agencies put in a
legally binding form.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally I don't trust these people to do what they say," board
member Andy Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be pushed around and I'm not going to be bullied
just because it's Dec. 31," board President Stella Mendoza said.</TE>

<HD>Ayn Rand Group Strives to Have Voice in Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ayn Rand's desk has found a home in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Looking slightly forlorn among the cardboard boxes stacked along
the walls of a sleek glass office on Alton Parkway, the 72-year-old
walnut table at which Rand penned "Atlas Shrugged" awaits its final
assignation.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to cordon it off," said Yaron Brook, president and
executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute now headquartered here.
"We want to put it on display. We want to turn this into a place
where people can come to learn about Ayn Rand."</LD>
<TE>   Founded in 1985 by followers of the late writer and dedicated to
spreading her philosophy of rational individualism, enlightened
self-interest and laissez-faire capitalism, the Ayn Rand Institute
spent its first years in a cramped building with a view of Marina del
Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Then Brook, 41, took over. Two years ago he moved his family to
Orange County. Four months ago, the organization followed, bringing
its 22 employees, sparse furnishings and Rand's archives to the
12,500-square-foot office.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the move, Brook says, was to expand into larger
quarters. Another was to shorten his commute and put him closer to
the institute's founder, Leonard Peikoff, who has lived in Irvine
since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after relocating the office in August, Brook decided to
offer a series of public lectures.</TE>
<TE>   The initial lecture was "Why We're Losing the War" on terror.
Since then the institute has sponsored three additional lectures.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to continue the monthly lectures, held at the Hyatt
Regency Irvine. "We want to have an impact on what people are
thinking," he says. "When people start talking about us to their
friends, we will have a presence and a voice in the debate."</TE>

<HD>The Doctors Are In -- and They're Booked Solid</HD>
<DH>Many patients want elective procedures done in December, to
use up medical benefits. Congress has been asked to change the law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As surely as Christmas decorations go up, the phone calls pleading
for appointments begin each December as people try to schedule a
physical, or blood work or to get that tooth crowned.</LD>
<LD>   While the holiday season means shopping, celebrating, bowl games
and bad TV specials, the jingle bells also are a warning to use up
medical and dental benefits before the year ends.</LD>
<LD>   It's just a fact of life for doctors and others whose offices,
already crowded with the usual outbreak of cold and flu cases, fill
to the brim with these last-minute callers.</LD>
<TE>   "No family doctor in their right mind takes off this time of
year," said Dr. Tim Huston, who has a practice in Laguna Niguel.
"Your patients will kill you."</TE>
<TE>   There are a host of reasons for it: People need to spend the cash
remaining in their flexible spending account or lose it; they want to
use up annual dental benefits; or maybe they've exceeded the
deductible on their health insurance and they want to get procedures
covered before the new year and a new deductible.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach obstetrician/gynecologist Jonathan Wheeler says he
works 20% to 25% harder this time of year. Once he had to cram for
finals. Now he has to cram in his patients.</TE>
<TE>   He had to close his practice to new patients at the end of last
year to catch up with his regular patients.</TE>
<TE>   At Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach,
mammograms are up 25% this month.</TE>
<TE>   And Fountain Valley dentist Steve Underwood figures he will work
an extra three or four days this month to accommodate the avalanche
of patients. The usual Wednesday off is a dental insurance casualty.</TE>
<TE>   As the calendar pages turn and appointments become more scarce,
patients get more desperate.</TE>
<TE>   Doctor can't fit them in for a complete exam? How about a partial
physical in, say, 15 minutes?</TE>
<TE>   Patients who have been putting off arthroscopic surgery to repair
that torn meniscus or fix that troublesome rotator cuff suddenly
decide it needs to be done -- now!</TE>
<TE>   "I've had people ask me if they can make an appointment in January
but list it as being done in December," Huston said. "I tell them,
'That's insurance fraud.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some dentists, knowing that insurance companies cap benefits,
encourage patients to take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Your Dental Insurance ... Use It or Lose It," reads the postcard
Long Beach dentist Joel Landers sent to his patients this year and
last. "Your dental insurance benefits expire each year if not used.
Call today for an appointment before the end of the year.
Appointments are going fast."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Estrella, Landers' office manager, said patients start
calling in October to find out how much money they would need to
spend before they reach the annual limit.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets crazy," Estrella said.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Stangler, events manager at UCLA's International Institute,
knew she would need oral surgery eventually to repair her receding
gums, but she didn't need it right away. Her dentist called her
insurance company to find out how much money she could spend. She
scheduled the surgery for Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Many people try to spend any money remaining in their flexible
spending accounts. Employees can set aside up to $5,000 before taxes
to be spent on medical bills that insurance doesn't cover. Whatever
isn't spent is turned over to the employer.</TE>
<TE>   "People in my experience still underutilize the advantages of
routine medical exams and screenings, so I'm very happy when patients
say to me, 'I have money left over in a flexible account, and I'm
coming in,' " said Dr. Daniel Bowers, a family practitioner in
Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The flexible accounts are behind the sudden splurge in designer
eyewear purchases this time of year, optometrists say.</TE>
<TE>   "People call and say, 'I have $500 to use in benefits; what should
I do?' " said Cecelia Patino, who manages the Long Beach optometry
office of Darlene Fujimoto.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Akey, spokesman for the Health Insurance Assn. of America in
Washington, D.C., said the industry is well aware of the phenomenon
and has urged Congress to change the law so a portion of the flexible
spending money can be rolled over.</TE>
<TE>   One way to spend it is on a full body scan, which cost about $800.
Ernie Nava, a scheduler at HealthView Center for Preventive Medicine
in Newport Beach, said about 10% of callers seeking appointments say
they are using flexible accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman said, 'How soon can I get it? Can you get me in this
year? Otherwise I won't be able to use it,' " Nava said.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health therapists said although the holidays are a busy

appointments to use up their benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But that gave psychologist Stephen Berger an idea.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a good way to get an initial start, particularly if
you have a reluctant partner [for couples counseling] or a resistant
teenager," Berger said.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles city firefighter and his wife face arraignment today on
charges that they repeatedly sexually abused a girl, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrested Charles
Wesslund, 63, of Crestline on Friday morning as he drove to work.</LD>
<LD>   Later that morning, deputies arrested Patricia Wesslund, 51, in
her home.</LD>
<TE>   The Wesslunds have been the subject of an ongoing investigation by
the sheriff's Crimes Against Children Unit, department spokeswoman
Cindy Beevers said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department would release no information on the
nature of the alleged relationship between the couple and the girl.</TE>
<TE>   The Wesslunds were booked on suspicion of continuous sexual abuse
against a child under the age of 14, which is punishable by up to 16
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   They are being held in lieu of $200,000 bail each at the West
Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Wesslund also will be arraigned today in San Bernardino
County Superior Court on charges of having a controlled substance
while armed, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies who pulled him over Friday found an unspecified amount of
methamphetamine, according to the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies also found a gun, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesslund is a 41-year veteran of the city Fire Department. He has
been on paid administrative leave since his arrest, a standard
procedure.</TE>

<HD>Small Riverside County Agency Aids Teenage Parents</HD>
<DH>With a staff of eight and a $410,000 budget, the group
tries to prepare youths for challenges and responsibilities of a
family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After careers as a businesswoman, a paralegal and a community college
teacher, Phyliss Sunins knew exactly what challenge she wanted next:
to create an organization that would provide education and other
services for pregnant teenagers and teenage parents around her home
base in Riverside County.</LD>
<LD>   As the end of 1999 approached, Sunins was closing in on her goal;
the only problem was what to call her nonprofit agency.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly the flow of ideas that had consumed her for months failed
her, and when the papers were finally filed to make the agency a
reality, the name at the top was something short of inspiring, or
even explanatory: Nonprofit Management Services Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to do something about that someday," said
Sunins, 38. "But we've done good work here, and we want to do more."</TE>
<TE>   The Temecula agency, with a staff of eight and a budget last year
of $410,000 raised largely through private and corporate donations,
focuses on helping teenage parents and pregnant teenagers cope with
the new problems they will face.</TE>
<TE>   The young people learn parent skills, personal financial
management, goal setting, and how to access information and
resources.</TE>
<TE>   The program's goal is to ensure family stability and enhance the
relationship between parent and child.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty percent of these young parents' children will end up in
foster homes," said Sunins, who added that she wants to expand to
include help for foster children nearing emancipation from the
system. But that will take more money.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, the agency's Angelo Reyes has just completed a
grant proposal that, if accepted, would increase its annual budget to
$750,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a 17-year-old who has been in the foster care system
for a number of years, they are often overwhelmed and unprepared to
handle the responsibilities of a healthy adult," said Sunins.
"Without a support system in place, they suffer short- and long-term
health and developmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We would assign a life coach to them to guide and support them,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The coach "would also work with the foster parent as emancipation
approaches. And that way, the foster parent will be better prepared
if they get another child. Social workers are overwhelmed; we need
something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofit Management Services received a $15,000 grant from last
year's Times Holiday Campaign. During this holiday season, The Times
is featuring programs that have benefited from the fund-raising
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Holiday Campaign raised $653,000, which was shared by
56 charities serving Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino and
Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign was established in 2000 as part of the Times
Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation. The
Foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on the
dollar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO GIVE</TE>
<TE>   Donations (checks or money orders) supporting the Holiday Campaign
should be sent to: L.A. Times Holiday Campaign, File 56986, Los
Angeles, CA 90074-6986. Do not send cash. Credit card donations can
be made on the Web site: www.latimes.com/holidaycampaign.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Contributions of $25 or more may
be published in The Times unless a donor requests otherwise;
acknowledgment cannot be guaranteed. For more information call (800)

<HD>Ventura County Homicide Rate Falls</HD>
<DH>Oxnard, with 11, and Santa Paula, with six, had about
two-thirds of the 23 slayings, as gang-related violence was on the
upswing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of homicides in Ventura County fell sharply this year,
even as gang violence ticked upward.</LD>
<LD>   The 23 homicides in 2002 -- including the bludgeoning of a Santa
Paula couple and a rash of gang-related deaths in Oxnard -- were the
fewest since 1999 and eight below last year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always difficult to explain why numbers like these go up or
down," said Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman for the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department. "One thing that we point to, though, is the
strong commitment by peace officers, support staff and the public,
who all want to keep crime low."</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard and Santa Paula accounted for about two-thirds of the
homicides in the county, although the two cities make up about
one-quarter of its population.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard logged the most homicides, with 11, and Santa Paula had its
deadliest year on record with six.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike 2001, when half of Oxnard's 12 homicides were
officer-involved incidents, this year's slayings were primarily
gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Three homicides occurred in Ventura and one each in Port Hueneme,
Camarillo and El Rio. Simi Valley, which recorded six homicides in
2001, had none in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most we've had in the history of the city," Santa
Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said. Santa Paula reported no
killings in 2001 and three in 1999 and 2000 combined. The majority of
killings throughout the county involved one or more of the following:
alcohol, drugs, gang warfare, robbery or domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Robbery and joyriding were cited as motives in a case that
Gonzales called the most heinous of his career.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 21, Santa Paula residents John M. Ramirez, 59, and his
wife, Joann Wotkyns, 55, were bludgeoned to death in their bed.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks later, police arrested Adam Sarabia, 16, whose
alleged motive was robbery and a cruise in the couple's Special
Edition Chevy Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia has pleaded not guilty and remains in juvenile hall,
pending a Jan. 15 preliminary hearing. He will be tried as an adult
and, if convicted, faces life in prison without the possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests were made in three other homicide cases. A case in Oxnard
was ruled accidental, and an officer-involved incident in Ventura was
ruled as justified. The remaining cases are unsolved.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Officer Is Arrested in Weapons Probe</HD>
<DH>West Valley patrolman allegedly failed to book into
evidence guns given to him for safekeeping. Silencer, assault rifles
reportedly confiscated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to an anonymous tip, Los Angeles police arrested a West
Valley Division patrol officer on suspicion of possessing an illegal
weapon after he allegedly failed to book into evidence guns that had
been turned over to him for safekeeping.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Baubak Piffard, 29, was arrested without incident Dec. 14
on a West Valley street, and booked on suspicion of possessing an
illegal silencer, police said. He was released after posting $20,000
bail.</LD>
<LD>   Piffard, who joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1995, has
not been charged with any offense, but officials said he could face
weapons charges, including possession of illegal assault rifles. The
case is being reviewed by the Los Angeles County district attorney's
Judicial System Integrity Division.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said, "If there's a silver lining
to any of this, it's that the person reporting it felt confident
coming to the department, knowing that the matter would be fully
investigated."</TE>
<TE>   Police said they received a tip several weeks ago that Piffard
might possess illegal weapons. A source said that a San Fernando
Valley woman had asked the officer to remove weapons from her home,
but later called the LAPD and asked that they be returned. Unaware of
the weapons, Piffard's supervisors contacted the LAPD's Internal
Affairs Division, which investigated.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, police set up a sting in which Piffard
picked up weapons from another house. He was arrested after he
allegedly failed to turn them in. Police served warrants on Piffard's
locker at the West Valley station, his home, car and other locations,
Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the search, we discovered evidence suggesting that he had
a storage space in Las Vegas," Frank said. There, LAPD officers,
teamed with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and agents
from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, recovered
numerous weapons, including an automatic MAC 11, AK-47 assault
rifles, a Glock handgun and a .22-caliber long rifle equipped with a
silencer.</TE>
<TE>   The officer has been relieved of duty with one month's pay,
pending the outcome of the internal affairs investigation. In
addition to possible criminal charges, he could face LAPD
administrative charges. Piffard is due to appear in Los Angeles
County Superior Court on Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Darryl E. Mounger, said he was unable to comment
Monday because "I have not seen any of the paperwork."</TE>

<HD>Pilot Lands Disabled Plane on Interstate 15</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim man piloting an experimental, home-built airplane was
forced to make an emergency landing Monday on Interstate 15 near
Corona, then walked away without serious injury despite clipping a
motor home on the way down, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board and local authorities
were investigating the crash late Monday, but officials said the
plane appeared to lose oil pressure, forcing the emergency landing.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot, who was alone in the plane, was identified as Kenneth
Nicholson, 82.</LD>
<TE>   He had taken off earlier Monday from Chino Airport and was heading
to a small airport near Temecula, said Corona Fire Department
Battalion Chief Ted Yancu. After detecting trouble on board, the
pilot headed for the nearest airstrip, near Corona, then "realized he
wasn't going to make it," Yancu said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before noon, several drivers called 911 on their cellular
telephones to report that a small airplane was fluttering above and
appeared to be in trouble, said California Highway Patrol dispatcher
Aileen Munoz. Minutes later, "the plane fell," Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot elected to land in the northbound lanes of Interstate
15, about three miles south of the Riverside Freeway. On the way
down, the plane struck a white motor home, then hit the center
divider of the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked away," Yancu said. "It was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the motor home also was unhurt, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Yancu said he wondered why Nicholson was so calm after the
incident, until he was told that Nicholson was a pilot in World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   "So he's probably seen it all," Yancu said. "This was probably
nothing for him."</TE>
<TE>   No further details about the plane were available, but it appeared
to be home-built and propeller-driven, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP closed two northbound lanes of Interstate 15, and traffic
backed up for several miles during the afternoon. The plane was to be
loaded onto a flatbed truck and taken to Chino Airport for
investigation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Local NTSB officials could not be reached for comment, and NTSB
officials in Washington said they had not been briefed on the
incident late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jerry Snyder said pilots
can be held liable for damages resulting from an improper landing,
but it remained unclear whether that would happen in this case,
officials said.</TE>

<HD>Torrance Rest Home Fire Kills 2</HD>
<DH>A neighbor enters the burning building and saves a man.
Authorities say a space heater apparently caused blaze.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A late-night fire sparked by a portable heater at a Torrance
board-and-care home killed two residents and critically burned a
third, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth resident was hoisted by the waist and carried to safety
by neighbor Ken Roberts, who heard screams about 11 p.m. Sunday and
rushed across a cul-de-sac to the Anchor Guest Home on Fonthill
Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts said the live-in caregiver, Evelyn Refuerzo, 55, was
standing outside the bedroom where the fire had started, screaming
and unable to get into the window she had smashed to try to reach a
man she identified as Fred Savage.</LD>
<TE>   "Her hands were cut from breaking the window, but she said the
smoke came blowing out and she couldn't get in. She was devastated,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department senior inspector Mike Friege said the caretaker's
son, John, 25, who also lives at the home, first heard the smoke
alarm and woke his mother. Refuerzo ran down the hall and, from the
doorway of Savage's room, saw a space heater on fire between her and
Savage, who was calling for help. She called 911, but, when she
returned to the bedroom, she could not overcome the heat and smoke,
and ran outside to enter from a window.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her son rushed across the hallway and tried to wake the
two men who shared that room. He could not rouse Edward Dunn, but
grabbed Thomas Short, estimated to be between 60 and 70, and led him
to safety, Friege said.</TE>
<TE>   "John, bless his soul, held that man's hand and walked him through
the smoke and out of the house," Friege said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had by now entered the house, where dense smoke shrouded
the ceiling. Despite resistance from Albert Arnold, he carried the
man outside. Some of the 32 firefighters who arrived prevented
Roberts from re-entering the house.</TE>
<TE>   Also rescued from the house was Emma Fine, thought to be between
80 and 90, who suffered second and third-degree burns over 20% of her
body. She remained in critical condition at Torrance Memorial
Hospital, Friege said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire moved so swiftly that in the six minutes before
firefighters arrived, the interior of the six-bedroom house was
completely gutted, said Fire Capt. Leigh McArthur.</TE>
<TE>   "The little space heater was the culprit as far as the source of
ignition for the fire," McArthur said. "Given the speed of the fire,
we believe the two men who died probably had perished before we even
got on scene."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County coroner did not release victims' names, but
Friege, neighbors of the longtime board-and-care facility and its
licensed operator, Gertrude Brito, identified them to the degree they
could. Savage was in his early 60s, and used a wheelchair because of
multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   Refuerzo told Roberts and his wife, Sherry, that she loved Savage
like family.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like a grandpa to me," Roberts recalled her saying.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled that Refuerzo's lively karaoke sessions with her five
residents could be heard all down the 16800 block of Fonthill Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Brito, who with her husband also operates two other homes also
named Anchor Guest Home, said she sold the Fonthill facility about
six months ago. The new owners are in the process of taking over the
board-and-care license.</TE>
<TE>   Friege said the operation had complied with state laws and its
license, and had passed inspection in November.</TE>
<TE>   "The state does not require more than one caretaker for six
residents, which this home was licensed to care for," Friege said.
"And if you look at what happened here, three people were rescued by
three people. It is unfair to expect a caretaker like this, who is
100 pounds, to rescue up to six people who are, in the case of the
men, 180 to 200 pounds each."</TE>

<HD>Skid Row Strays Have Best Friends</HD>
<DH>A group helps canines belonging to homeless people by
providing food and services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lori Weise and Richard Tuttelmondo fight homelessness on skid row
with dogged determination.</LD>
<LD>   Good thing, too. It takes a certain tenacity to prowl the streets
of downtown Los Angeles dispensing kindness to street people -- and
kibble to street puppies.</LD>
<LD>   The two are managers of a furniture factory. They are also
founders of Downtown Dog Rescue, a 5-year-old volunteer program that
finds homes for strays roaming alleys and provides veterinary
services to pets kept by the city's two-legged homeless population.</LD>
<TE>   Behind their Modernica Co. manufacturing plant, they have built
their own animal shelter to house dogs in need of immediate care.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the busy factory, they have built a reputation for hiring
homeless dog owners who are willing to work to get themselves and
their pets off skid row.</TE>
<TE>   Part of their crusade includes offering free spaying and neutering
of transients' pets in hopes of slowing downtown's puppy population
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the dog police. We don't take pets away," said Weise,
37, the factory's general manager. "We are there to help dogs and
their owners."</TE>
<TE>   Weise and 40-year-old plant manager Tuttelmondo are dog lovers who
live a few blocks apart in Altadena. They created the rescue service
after joining the furniture company and experiencing the inner-city
subculture of homelessness for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither one of us had ever worked downtown before. We had no clue
what it was like. It was depressing. It was overwhelming," Weise
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing dogs completely abandoned on the streets was terrible. You
could tell they once had owners," Tuttelmondo said.</TE>
<TE>   They started the rescue service after noticing that one transient
near the factory seemed to always be engulfed in little dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a beautiful male pit bull and a female mix and they would
have puppies every six months," Tuttelmondo said. "We were always
finding homes for them."</TE>
<TE>   "We decided something had to stop," added Weise.</TE>
<TE>   As they launched Downtown Dog Rescue and began checking areas
around their 7th Place plant, they were appalled at what they found.</TE>
<TE>   "Businesses would close and leave junkyard dogs tied up to fences
as 'watch dogs,' " Tuttelmondo said. "Dogs were hit by cars. People
who couldn't take their dogs with them into shelters or Section 8
housing would let them loose on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Maneuvering through the encampments of cardboard boxes and tents
took some getting used to, they found.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the homeless have mental problems. A lot of times Richard
and I don't talk to the person. We talk to the dog," Weise said.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner will hear us talking and will poke their head out of
the tent to see what's going on. That's when we ask them if it's OK
to give their dog a treat. Once we get them talking, we ask if they
need food for their dog or if it needs vaccination. We tell them we
can get their dogs licenses and shots."</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the homeless now trust dog rescue volunteers
enough to report injured or abused animals to them, many pet owners
were fearful at first that their street dogs were going to be
permanently confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of one alley, we found four generations of dogs -- 16
of them. A homeless couple had beds and water for all of them. But
they didn't want us to spay and neuter," Tuttelmondo said.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought one of our plant employees who speaks Spanish to
translate, and I drew a diagram on a piece of paper. I told them if
they are not careful, they are going to have 60, 70, 80 dogs before
they know it."</TE>
<TE>   The rescue service has found homes for hundreds of puppies over
the years -- some through a twice-monthly adoption day it holds
Saturdays at a Petco store in Pasadena. It has spayed or neutered
about 100 dogs kept as pets by downtown homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Dog Rescue spends about $60,000 a year. It accepts
donations through the nonprofit North Hollywood-based Friends for
Animals group at www.friendsforanimals.org.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, professionals such as Boyle Heights veterinarian
Dr. Edward Simon and Mount Washington dog trainer Lezle Stein have
joined the crusade.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has offered discounts on treatment and stayed open late for
rescued dogs. Stein does temperament assessment of dogs being put up
for adoption and helps them learn how to behave indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach them how to walk on a leash and house-train them. Most
have never been in a house," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten homeless dog owners have been given jobs at Modernica. Those
without skills are hired to sand wood furniture for the company's
line of classic modern reproductions. Others are matched up with
slots elsewhere in the 65-employee plant. Their pay lets them rent
apartments that allow pets.</TE>
<TE>   Dog owner Mark DeCicco, 40, works in the plant's shipping and
receiving department. He said he went on the street after losing his
job as a personal assistant following his conviction for punching a
sheriff's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought things would go so low for me," he said. "I'm
getting a second chance here."</TE>
<TE>   Modernica's owners, Jay and Frank Novak, say the changes that
Downtown Dog Rescue have made at their plant are positive. They pay
no attention to Sinbad, an aging rescued dog that meanders through
company offices and often dozes in the corner during client meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel this place is more of a part of the community,"
Jay Novak said. "Of course, we lost our liability insurance because
of the dogs out back," said Jay's brother, Frank, grinning. "But we
got other coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Weise said only a few canines at a time are housed in the rescue's
two-cage shelter behind the plant's paint shop. Most of the rescue
group's work is done off hidden alleyways, like the fenced-in alcove
where homeless Benny Joseph lives with his three dogs, Ironhead,
Terry and Lizzie.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Weise and Tuttelmondo have helped the 56-year-old
Joseph find permanent homes for 10 dogs and about 40 puppies. "Now he
knows that puppies aren't for entertainment," Tuttelmondo said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love dogs. They're just attracted to me. And people bring
them to me to keep," said Joseph, who has been on the streets for 15
years. "Dogs are like my children. They're like me: I don't like to
work in a building, and my dogs don't like being locked up."</TE>
<TE>   Besides being companions he can relate with and talk to, Joseph
said, his dogs are lifesavers. Ironhead once chased away a transient
who attacked him with a pick handle.</TE>
<TE>   And those from Downtown Dog Rescue are lifesavers, too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people are beautiful," he said. "They've helped my dogs and
other dogs. And me."</TE>

<HD>Floral Designer Gives Cars in Parade a Dutch Treatment</HD>
<DH>Els Hazenberg travels from The Netherlands to Pasadena each
December to do up the Rose Parade's autos. Tulips? Of course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the clock strikes midnight and 2003 reaches Pasadena tonight,
Rose Parade organizers will be too busy lining up floats along Orange
Grove Boulevard to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, they will have already raised glasses at 3 p.m. -- the
precise moment that the new year hits Holland.</LD>
<LD>   This synchronizing of the world's most watched floral parade with
the capital of the world flower markets is the work of a Dutch flower
designer named Els Hazenberg.</LD>
<TE>   A resident of Aalsmeer, the Netherlands, Hazenberg and her
husband, George, are nonetheless Pasadena fixtures. For the last 25
years, they have traveled to Pasadena right after Christmas to
provide the parade a specialty service organizers say they haven't
been able to find domestically: decoration for the classic cars that
the Tournament of Roses president, the Pasadena mayor and the grand
marshal ride in the parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Artistically, she is quite capable, really one of a kind," says
Don Murphy, who chairs the Tournament committee that supervises the
official cars. "I've told the Hazenbergs that as they get closer to
the point when they may think about retiring, they need to take
another florist and teach them the art of affixing the flowers to the
cars."</TE>
<TE>   Els Hazenberg was living with her husband, a professional orchid
grower, in Aalsmeer, site of the largest flower auction in the world,
when a floral designer friend invited her to the Rose Parade in 1977.
She was both awed by the spectacle and intrigued by the possibilities
of the official cars, which were then draped in conventional flower
blankets.</TE>
<TE>   She asked parade officials if she could come back the following
year and decorate the vehicles in a Dutch fashion, and they agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to give the parade a European touch," she says. "And
to do so in a way that doesn't damage the cars."</TE>
<TE>   Hazenberg, with the assistance of her husband, creates not
blankets but elaborate floral arrangements for the cars' exteriors.
To keep the heavy arrangements from flying off, she takes several
blocks of floral foam, soaks them in water, wraps them in green moss
and ties them firmly onto parts of the car with electrical cords. Not
only does the foam prevent the flowers from scratching the car
surfaces, but the water inside helps keep the flowers fresh.</TE>
<TE>   For her first 15 years, Hazenberg's fee and her flowers were
provided by Dutch flower growers. FTD now sponsors her work. She
tries to make half the flowers on the car roses, mixing in a healthy
supply of tulips, carnations and other varieties.</TE>
<TE>   This year, she is decorating four vehicles, including a 1967 fire

Juan and Evita Peron for the grand marshals, and a 1952 Chrysler
Imperial for the mayor of Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Each car is typically dominated by a certain color of flower.
Hazenberg has been known to advise the dignitaries who ride in the
car what to wear so they match her arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   The Hazenbergs arrive in Pasadena on Dec. 26 and work 12-hour days
through Jan. 1. At their first parade, the couple took a break at 3
p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Dec. 31 -- midnight at home -- to toast
the new year with a small bottle of wine and a little Dutch cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The party has grown modestly since then, with a few dozen parade
officials coming by. There is wine and cheese and oliebollen, a
doughy Dutch delicacy with raisins and powdered sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a tradition over the years," Hazenberg says. "With
all the work there is to do with the parade, it's a good idea to stop
for a few minutes and celebrate."</TE>

<HD>No Bash in the Boulevard for 2003 Revelers</HD>
<DH>Organizers of past street parties in Hollywood are denied
permits. Other businesses get OK to stage a sidewalk march to ring in
the New Year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While tens of thousands of revelers will ring in 2003 in grand style
in New York's Times Square and on the Las Vegas Strip, that won't be
the case in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   After staging celebrations the past two years on Hollywood
Boulevard, which organizers say raised nearly $590,000 for local
youth charities, their hopes of staging another New Year's Eve bash
on the boulevard ended when the city refused to grant them permits.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, a parade with an anti-drug theme will be staged through a
six-block stretch of the boulevard by some area bar and restaurant
owners.</LD>
<TE>   It's seen as a way for them to drum up business on their busiest
night of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The sidewalk procession, which won't require street closures, will
begin at 11:30 p.m. at Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of the New Year's Eve bash has led to angry barbs
between some movers and shakers in Hollywood over the value of a New
Year's Eve celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, the driving force behind the last two New Year's
events, has lashed out at opponents who he said torpedoed the event.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra singled out Kerry Morrison, the executive director of
Hollywood Boulevard's business improvement district, for criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world saw Hollywood in a positive light," La Pietra
said. "To have these shenanigans going on, Kerry Morrison should be
ashamed of herself for fighting the one event that delivered for
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   He also accused Morrison and others of opposing the event to
retaliate against him for his stewardship of the failed Hollywood
secession effort.</TE>
<TE>   Told of his remarks, Morrison -- who wants an independent audit to
find out how much money has gone to charity from the previous events
-- retorted:</TE>
<TE>   "No one on Hollywood Boulevard has any desire to emulate [New
York's] New Year's Eve. Most of America is in bed by the time we
celebrate New Year's Eve in California.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no special media attention that will come our way,"
Morrison said. "Instead, it merely clogged the streets and frustrated
the ability of legitimate businesses to celebrate what is arguably
their biggest night of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The decision against an outdoor New Year's Eve party on the
boulevard comes at a time when, for the present, no more events will
be staged requiring prolonged closure of Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Morrison and others acknowledged that the Hollywood
Halloween event on Oct. 31, which required a two-day shutdown of the
street to set up a gated family-oriented festival of rides, stages
and booths, lost money and clogged traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Many merchants along Hollywood Boulevard complained that the
prolonged closure hurt their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood business owners and residents are meeting with city
officials to figure out how best to stage organized celebrations in
Hollywood without creating further problems for merchants, who have
to put up with periodic street closures for the filming of movies and
related industry events.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Hollywood, the decision against the New Year's Eve event
on the boulevard has attracted little attention. But it has been a
source of unusual buzz in and around Tinseltown.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, La Pietra, who owns two nightclubs in
Hollywood, gathered signatures for the third annual bash, figuring
there would be little problem in obtaining approval since City Hall
had helped out before.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of bar and restaurant owners, including Joel Fisher of
the Palace nightclub, complained that the event, staged in front of
many of the area's eateries, charged admission and directly competed
with them by serving food and alcohol. They gathered their own
signatures for a sidewalk march.</TE>
<TE>   They also did it to demonstrate, in part, their consternation that
La Pietra did not obtain official city approval for last year's event
until Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The business improvement district's Morrison said signatures from
59% of the business owners and more than half of others who owned
property in the area were collected for the sidewalk march.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Bureau of Street Services determined that many of
the signatures La Pietra turned in to support his application for a
street closure also appeared on the competing application. To sort
things out, city officials canvassed the area and concluded that a
majority of the property owners and business owners were indeed
opposed to La Pietra's event.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the Board of Public Works rejected the permit for La
Pietra's New Year's Eve celebration, spokesman Mike Qualls said.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra appealed to Mayor James K. Hahn to reverse the decision,
but Hahn took no action.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission then approved the permit for the sidewalk
march.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, still smarting over the defeat of the Hollywood
secession measure, said his opponents "gathered their signatures
through intimidation and threats.</TE>
<TE>   "[City Councilman] Eric Garcetti's position is that we should move
our event off Hollywood Boulevard," La Pietra said. "That's like
moving New Year's Eve in New York off of Times Square."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not opposed to it," Morrison replied. "It should be moved to
maybe Santa Monica Boulevard, which is less affected by parking and
traffic issues."</TE>

<HD>Revelers Warned to Check Gunfire</HD>
<DH>Mayor Hahn, police chief and sheriff tell of consequences
of New Year's celebratory shots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newly arrived Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said Monday
there are some West Coast traditions he can do without.</LD>
<LD>   "This is my first New Year's in Los Angeles," Bratton said. "I'm
still getting used to some of your quaint little customs, such as
going to your front door and shooting your gun into the air."</LD>
<LD>   Bratton's disdain came with a warning issued jointly with Mayor
James K. Hahn, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo at a news conference at the Los Angeles Police
Academy.</LD>
<TE>   "Here's the message," Hahn said. "You will be arrested. You will
be prosecuted."</TE>
<TE>   For Bratton, the oddity of celebratory gunfire, which studies
indicate has killed at least 40 people in Los Angeles County since
1985, comes with a twist.</TE>
<TE>   "While some of these characters may not have learned that in
school, what goes up must come down. Unfortunately it does not come
down on the person shooting it up in the air," the police chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The plea for an end to random gunfire is a familiar one for city
and county officials who have worked for more than a decade to
curtail the dangerous practice. A state law enacted in 1988 made
firing a gun into the air a felony punishable by as much as a year in
county jail or imprisonment in a state penitentiary.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, police say, added enforcement and public
education have made a substantial difference. In addition, a 1990 ban
on the sale of ammunition in Los Angeles between Christmas and New
Year's Day made it more difficult to acquire bullets on the spur of
the moment, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be so much gunfire, parts of the city were shut
down to police, areas we couldn't even get into," said LAPD Lt. Doug
Young, who is assigned to the 77th Division in South Los Angeles,
where officers once tape-recorded an evening of New Year's gunfire
and played it back to city officials. The gunfire was so relentless
that one councilman said it sounded like the streets of war-torn
Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Young, who has worked to combat the practice for more than a
decade, called the joint effort by area law enforcement officials a
true success story.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, area law enforcement officers have
responded to nearly 1,000 calls from residents reporting gunshots
between 8 p.m. Dec. 31 and 4 a.m. Jan. 1, according to the Sheriff's
Department. In contrast, in 1992 alone, Los Angeles police responded
to nearly 800 reports of the firing of illegal shots.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bratton said, no level of random gunfire is acceptable. He
said he believes a "total demise" of the "foolishness" could be
achieved soon.</TE>
<TE>   Bullets have dropped to earth after reaching as high as 2 miles in
the air and traveling at speeds more than sufficient to penetrate the
human body. Three years ago in Los Angeles, 9-year-old Brian Perez
was killed when a bullet fell from the sky and struck him in the head
as he watched fireworks from the front porch of his parents' home on
75th Street. The homicide remains unsolved, police said. On the
Fourth of July in Orange County, a 9-year-old Buena Park boy was
critically wounded at a crowded park by a shot apparently fired
randomly.</TE>
<TE>   For the third year in a row, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department
plans to use a gunfire location system known as Shotspotter.</TE>
<TE>   It allows officers to pinpoint the location of the firing of
bullets and immediately to dispatch units to look for the shooter. In
the targeted areas, sheriff's officials said, the technology helped
to reduce New Year's Eve gunfire incidents from several hundred in
1999 to four a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said his deputies have responded to incidents in which
individuals fire assault weapons in the air and have an arsenal of
guns on hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't hesitate to call us and let us know exactly where someone
is shooting," Baca said. "Do not allow your neighborhood to
degenerate into neighbors who will carelessly shoot their weapon."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials said they will have 50 teams of 10 officers each
who are specially trained to respond to random gunfire incidents on
the streets tonight and into early Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, extra law enforcement personnel will be on duty to
handle drunk-driving infractions, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A range of free transportation options will be available to
partygoers who are unable to drive home. In Los Angeles, free rides
will be offered on the MTA's bus and rail systems. Subway trips will
be free from 9 p.m. until closing -- about 1:30 a.m. The Metro bus
system will offer free rides from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Transportation Authority will offer free bus
rides from 6 tonight until 4 a.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Automobile Club of Southern California is offering
free "Tipsy Tow" rides home for drinking drivers and their vehicles
between 6 tonight and 6 a.m. New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   The service can be requested by motorists, bartenders, restaurant
managers, party hosts or passengers of a drinking driver by calling
1-800-400-4AAA. The service is free for tows of as long as 7 miles to
the driver's home. Passengers are not allowed.</TE>

<HD>Rancho Rehab Hospital Has Backer and Believer</HD>
<DH>Having watched a friend rehabilitated there, Supervisor
Knabe works to keep it open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the five county supervisors who voted on the fate of Rancho Los
Amigos National Rehabilitation Center last month, only one had been
driving behind Alex Beanum the night he lost control of his Volvo and
suffered a paralyzing back injury.</LD>
<LD>   Four supervisors voted to close or privatize the county hospital
to help bridge a health department budget deficit of several hundred
million dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Don Knabe, who two decades earlier had come upon Beanum's accident
and witnessed his rehabilitation at Rancho, voted against the
proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Though a colleague said Knabe wasn't "willing to stand up to
reality," the supervisor defended his steadfast support of the
hospital as the product of firsthand experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've touched it, and felt it and seen it," Knabe said of Rancho.
"I know what they do there."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Downey hospital sits in Knabe's supervisory district,
his support for Rancho is not surprising. But the prism of
constituent services offers only a partial view of his ties to the
hospital, which extend back to a clear Palm Springs night on March
26, 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe and Beanum, friends and members of the Cerritos City Council
at the time, were there on city business. Following Beanum back to
the hotel after dinner, Knabe rounded a corner to find Beanum's car
off the road and overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In the time it took the Volvo to tumble onto a rocky outcropping,
where it landed upright, Beanum's back was broken, paralyzing him
below the chest. The accident would profoundly change his life and
have a lasting effect on Knabe as well.</TE>
<TE>   Although not the most outspoken or visible of Los Angeles County's
five supervisors, Knabe has become a central figure in Rancho's
survival. As the county has faced periodic health-care crises, Knabe
has been Rancho's principal champion, purposefully resisting any
attempt to reduce or eliminate the hospital that gave his friend a
second chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Knabe and Beanum became friends after moving to Cerritos in the
early 1970s, during its transition from dairy town to bedroom
community.</TE>
<TE>   That they lived within a block of each other and had children of
roughly the same age mattered more than Beanum's being an African
American Democrat and Knabe a white Republican. When Beanum decided
to join the Optimists Club, Knabe sponsored him. When Knabe ran for
City Council in 1980 against a Democrat, Beanum, elected two years
earlier, voted for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I backed my friend, and he won," Beanum said.</TE>
<TE>   The two often voted together on the council, helping to bring
Cerritos its first auto mall and watching as their city became one of
the fastest growing in the country.</TE>
<TE>   On their trip to the annual meeting of contract cities in Palm
Springs in March 1980, Knabe and Beanum made a bipartisan decision to
sneak away from the dinner table to catch a Lakers game. They left
together, Knabe following Beanum, and made it only a few miles before
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Beanum was rushed to a Palm Springs emergency room that night and
spent six weeks there. Then he was transferred to Rancho, which even
then was a leader in the specialized field of treating victims of
head, neck and spinal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   For six months, Beanum learned how to function in a world tailored
to the needs of other people.</TE>
<TE>   His physical limitations transformed the most mundane tasks --
bathing, making his bed, getting dressed -- into awkward, frustrating
ordeals.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a completely new set of necessities to attend to:
building enough arm and shoulder strength to propel a wheelchair,
waking every hour or so at night and shifting his body position to
avoid bedsores. And physical survival skills were only part of it.
Rancho psychologists helped Beanum cope with the emotional toll of a
paralyzing accident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a part of your body is dead, but you can't bury it," he
said. "You have to learn how to love a part of yourself that's no
longer useful."</TE>
<TE>   Knabe was a frequent visitor. Though he had never spent much time
in a hospital, he did what he could to look after his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd sneak him chili dogs sometimes," Knabe said. "He was pretty
sick of hospital food."</TE>
<TE>   "He'd sneak me hamburgers and sometimes beer," is how Beanum
remembered it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a telling term in Rancho parlance, used by doctors,
patients and therapists alike. It's called "building a bridge to
independence" -- shorthand for the thousand small tasks a patient
must master for rehabilitation from a paralyzing injury. If a patient
can regain enough strength and mobility to maneuver into a car from a
wheelchair, the chasm is nearly crossed.</TE>
<TE>   When Beanum's training for the "transfer" was done and the day
came to do it for real, it was Knabe's car that he hoisted himself
into.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still see the car and Don and Alex," said Robert Waters,
who was chairman of Rancho's surgery department during Beanum's stay.
"That day was Alex's passage out of the hospital and back into the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Beanum returned to his council seat. He returned to his private
consulting business, to church, to friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe began attending Rancho fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   He was hired in 1981 by then-4th District Supervisor Deane Dana,
and when redistricting in 1990 landed Rancho in Dana's district,
Knabe relished the opportunity to help the hospital at the county
level.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know the battles that were ahead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 114-year-old hospital remained an innovative leader,
pioneering surgical techniques and teaching patients how to paint --
some with brushes held between their teeth.</TE>
<TE>   But changing times created new difficulties for the hospital. When
gang warfare and the crack cocaine epidemic ravaged the county in the
late 1980s, many of the casualties ended up at Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, the percentage of Rancho patients with insurance -- 12%
the year Beanum was admitted -- had dwindled nearly to zero, leaving
taxpayers to foot patients' bills.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a crippling budget deficit of its own, the county
decided to privatize Rancho, or to close it if a buyer couldn't be
found.</TE>
<TE>   County law required a public hearing on the matter, and as Dana's
chief of staff, Knabe helped arrange for the hearing to be held at
the hospital, where the supervisors heard hours of testimonials from
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe was elected to the Board of Supervisors when Dana left
office in 1996 and, according to Connie Diaz, the hospital's chief
executive, the new supervisor immediately started working on Rancho's
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   He began emceeing Rancho's annual Amistad fund-raising event. He
put on an apron on employee appreciation day, serving food for hours
to janitors, therapists and doctors. He started collecting art by
Rancho patients. And in his role as a county supervisor, he fought
each attempt to cut the hospital, appointing former patients such as
Beanum to a citizens committee that reviewed proposals from companies
interested in taking over Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a passion for Rancho, and he doesn't just talk about it;
he lives it," Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   The county backed away from the privatization plan after a 1997
audit said it didn't make sense. But with the latest budget crunch,
the plan was dusted off.</TE>
<TE>   When the issue came to a vote last month, dozens of Rancho
patients approached the dais to plead with the Board of Supervisors,
again, to spare Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe interjected several times during the procession, noting
which speaker was a world-class artist, which a wheelchair basketball
Olympian. For him, each speaker who crossed the bridge to
independence at Rancho was one fewer person lounging in a nursing
home, one more argument for keeping the hospital a county facility.</TE>
<TE>   He reflected afterward on the time and effort it had taken each
patient to get to the meeting, reminded of what had struck him about
his experiences at Rancho.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't demand anything. They never say, 'You owe us
something,' " Knabe said. "All they ask is for the opportunity to
live an independent life."</TE>
<TE>   Another audit is being done to determine whether the hospital can
generate enough income to remain part of the county system. Failing
that, legislation is pending that would appoint an independent
authority to run the facility. It could end up being privatized, but
Knabe says he will continue to resist any move to close it.</TE>
<TE>   "Something has to be done to keep it open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beanum, an active advocate during the last privatization effort,
has been less visible and less vocal this time around. He's retired
now, and doesn't talk much about his accident.</TE>
<TE>   He still visits Rancho as an outpatient, and sometimes when he
meets people and says his name, there's a flash of recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll say 'Oh, you're Mr. Beanum,' and their faces will light
up," Beanum said.</TE>
<TE>   It's in those moments that he realizes someone else has heard his
story -- because Knabe continues to tell it to make the case for
Rancho's future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a compliment; it's genuine," Beanum said. "I feel
honored by it."</TE>

<HD>Molestation Scandal Wrenched Church Hierarchy and Faithful</HD>
<DH>New L.A. cathedral, legal rulings and interfaith efforts
were muted by the crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The agonies of the Roman Catholic Church, which was wracked by a
yearlong sexual-abuse scandal, overshadowed other religion news in
California in 2002, and even muted the September opening of the
church's $189-million cathedral in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Among the stories relegated to near-footnote status this year:</LD>
<LD>   * A plan by Catholic bishops to better serve Spanish-speaking
parishioners and bring more Latino priests into church leadership.</LD>
<TE>   * A legal tussle over the annual Hollywood Bowl Easter sunrise
service. The evangelical Trinity Broadcasting Network of Orange
County won rights to televise the service, and then withdrew in the
ensuing controversy -- too late for organizers to restore traditional
broadcast arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   * A district judge's ruling in a widely watched case that
temporarily barred Cypress from seizing a church's land for
redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   * The continued integration of the Muslim community into Southern
California's interfaith movement and general society, a trend that
symbolically could be seen two days before the Sept. 11 anniversary
at an interreligious prayer service at the Islamic Society of Orange
County mosque. American Muslim leaders honored more than 20 people
outside their faith who came to their defense after the terrorist
attacks in New York and at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the Catholic Church scandal also swamped other
religious news. In a vote this month by the members of the Religious
Newswriters Assn., four of the year's top five stories involved
sexual abuse by Catholic priests or the fallout. The fifth story was
the controversy generated by Franklin Graham and other evangelical
ministers who called Islam evil.</TE>
<TE>   Since January -- when abuse by priests in Boston and a cardinal's
cover-up were first exposed -- the scandal has engulfed the U.S.
Catholic Church. Aggressive plaintiffs' attorneys, empowered victims
and their advocates, outraged laity, an entrenched church hierarchy
and a relentless news media all played roles.</TE>
<TE>   The storm left in its path the resignations of Cardinal Bernard F.
Law and two bishops, hundreds of lawsuits, multimillion-dollar
settlements, priests in handcuffs, public apologies from prelates,
new church codes of justice for victims, increased power for the
laity and threats of church bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "Much as I tend to avoid such inflated rhetoric, any sober
assessment would rank it as the greatest scandal in the history of
the American Catholic Church," said Father John Coleman, a professor
of theological studies and social values at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the impact of the scandal could become stronger
starting this week. A new state law takes effect Wednesday that will
temporarily lift the statute of limitations on many lawsuits against
the church. Lawyers for the 12 dioceses in the state say they expect
hundreds of suits to be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has already been among the regions hit hardest
by the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, word leaked that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
had quietly acted on a court-imposed zero-tolerance policy and let go
seven priests with molestations in their past. Two were convicted sex
offenders. The Diocese of Orange fired one priest.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations about the ousted priests triggered a months-long
tug-of-war between Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and law enforcement
officials over church personnel records.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the church's behind-the-scenes struggle with the tangle of
legal issues was revealed in April when a series of confidential
e-mails written by Mahony and others within his inner circle were
leaked to radio station KFI.</TE>
<TE>   In the communications, church leaders worried about the public
relations fallout of the scandal advised Mahony to remain vague about
where the seven priests served before they were fired, and gave
instructions to limit responses to police queries.</TE>
<TE>   One e-mail showed tension between Mahony and his advisors. The
cardinal was so upset by the failure to turn over the names of
several dismissed priests to police that he warned his general
counsel he might be subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't, today, 'consult' with the [detective] about those
three names, I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into a grand
jury proceeding and I will be forced to give all the names, etc.,"
Mahony wrote to his top lawyer, Sister Judith Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   Also contained in one of the e-mails was news that authorities
were investigating a claim by a Fresno woman with a history of mental
problems that Mahony had molested her many years ago. Within three
weeks, the cardinal, who denied the allegations, was cleared by
police.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony used this incident at the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops in June to argue that accusations can easily be proved false,
and that a tough set of reforms, including a one-strike provision for
priests who sexually abuse minors, should be enacted.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops agreed and overwhelmingly voted for the new standards.</TE>
<TE>   A second molestation allegation was leveled against Mahony in June
by a man who said he was sexually abused 20 years ago in Stockton,
where Mahony was a bishop. But in September, Stockton police arrested
Loren Mitchell Saffels on suspicion of extortion and filing a false
police report.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mahony's relationship with law enforcement remained rocky.
Since June, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury has issued subpoenas
for files on at least 17 priests. The archdiocese agreed, but the
priests' attorney has blocked the release, pending a ruling from an
appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   And last month, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury
demanded that Mahony surrender documents related to at least 15
clergy sex-abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   In a strongly worded letter, Bradbury told Mahony that despite
promises to assist law enforcement, the nation's largest archdiocese
"remains an obstacle, protecting priests while endangering future
victims."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan officials said they had turned over all of the
information in their possession.</TE>
<TE>   According to Los Angeles law enforcement agencies, about 70
current and former priests are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In September, authorities made the first of a series of arrests
involving priests or former clerics charged with molestation. Since
then, six more Los Angeles-area priests have been arrested on
sexual-abuse charges, including an 82-year-old retiree who was
plucked off a cruise ship in Alaska in September.</TE>
<TE>   One former Orange County priest, wanted by authorities in two
states on more than 40 felony counts, is eluding authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Details of sexual abuse, emerging mostly in lawsuits, have
sickened, saddened and angered both Catholics and non-Catholics. The
relentless drumbeat of the scandal marred the opening of the
$189-million Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles
in September. Partly because of the scandal and partly because of
money woes, the ceremonies surrounding the grand opening were toned
down.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week after the opening, the archdiocese unexpectedly
announced a series of budget cuts that included the elimination of
seven church ministries, retrenchment in others and layoffs of at
least 60 workers. Protests from priests and others followed, along
with the resignation of Mahony's top five lieutenants.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has refused to release its financial statements
since the scandal broke, making it impossible to determine how much
of the red ink is the result of sexual-abuse settlements or a
decrease in donations.</TE>
<TE>   The much smaller Diocese of Orange said in November that it had
lost $28 million in the last two years, some of it because of payouts
to sexual abuse victims, but mostly because of stock-market losses.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese reported one piece of good news in December,
announcing that its parishioners had pledged $16 million to aid needy
parishes and schools -- the highest figure in the annual fund-raising
campaign's 10-year history.</TE>

<HD>Missing Front Plate Can Bring $25 Fix-It Ticket</HD>
<DH>State requires motorists to display numbers on both ends of
a vehicle. Police say some are removed to avoid traffic camera
citations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After actress Winona Ryder was convicted of taking a "five-finger
discount" at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills, she hopped into the
sports car of her attorney, Mark Geragos, and sped away from the
courthouse without comment.</LD>
<LD>   Justice may have been done for Ryder, but it seems now that
Geragos has some explaining to do.</LD>
<LD>   Joanne Crisci, a reader from North Hills, wrote to say that she
noticed something missing in a newspaper photo of Ryder being whisked
away in Geragos' Porsche: The car had no front license plate, and
Crisci suspects a law has been broken.</LD>
<TE>   Question: What is the law in California regarding license plates?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The state vehicle code requires motorists to display
plates on the front and rear of a vehicle. The penalty: a $25 fix-it
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that some motorists remove the front plates to thwart
those automatic cameras that snap photos of drivers who run red
lights at intersections. The penalty for running a red light: a $271
citation.</TE>
<TE>   In many cities, police need a clear photo of the driver and the
front plate to identify the violator. So, no front plate, no ticket.</TE>
<TE>   No one is suggesting that Geragos purposely removed his plate to
thwart such cameras. Perhaps his plate simply fell off and he didn't
notice.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the plate was pilfered by some deranged kleptomaniac.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, such a thing could happen, even in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has the most extensive carpool lane system in
the country, but it is not always the easiest to use.</TE>
<TE>   Mona Field, who described herself as a "frustrated carpooler in
Southern California," wrote to complain about several spots where the
exits from the carpool lanes do not line up with the exits from the
freeway. At these locations, Field said, it is impossible to get out
of the carpool lane in time to cut across traffic to get to the
freeway offramp.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is Caltrans doing to make sure that, if you are in a
carpool lane, you can legally exit in time to reach your designated
freeway exit?</TE>
<TE>   A: State Department of Transportation officials say the carpool
lanes generally have fewer exits than the freeways have offramps
because the carpool lanes are designed for the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic moves more smoothly if motorists are not cutting in and
out of the carpool lanes every few hundred feet.</TE>
<TE>   So, how do you know when to get out of the carpool lane in time to
make your offramp? The freeway should have posted signs on the median
giving such information. If there is no sign, call Caltrans at (916)
654-5266 and request one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Harvard University study recently suggested that traffic deaths
involving cell phones have increased dramatically in the last few
years.</TE>
<TE>   This charged up the nationwide debate about banning cell phones in
the car.</TE>
<TE>   Constance Damey of Seattle wrote to ask if such bans actually
work.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has there been any proof that these laws do improve anything?</TE>
<TE>   A: So far, New York is the only state in the nation to ban the use
of hand-held phones while driving. Hands-free phones are OK. New York
lawmakers won't get a report on the effectiveness of the law until
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety couldn't wait, so it
conducted a study this year. The institute watched motorists at
various locations in New York before and after the ban took effect in
November 2001. The results: The number of motorists spotted using
cell phones dropped about 50%.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question cell phones can be a distraction, but how
much of a distraction is in debate.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 2001 study by the University of North Carolina,
cell phones are responsible for only a fraction of the
distraction-related accidents.</TE>
<TE>   If we really want to crack down on behind-the-wheel distractions,
the study seems to indicate that we should instead ban car stereos,
drive-thru meals, annoying passengers and screaming children in the
back seat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Duffy of Van Nuys wonders why motorists who are involved in
minor fender-benders on the freeway don't get out of the traffic
lanes to exchange insurance information, thus helping to keep the
freeways moving.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I believe the law should be rewritten [so] that, when there is
no serious bodily injury involved and the vehicles are roadworthy,
they should be moved out of the traffic lanes and the matter resolved
at the side of the road, rather than in the midst of traffic during
rush hours.</TE>
<TE>   A: That is such a good idea that, well, someone already did it.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time that state law required motorists to immediately
stop in traffic lanes and exchange information after a traffic
accident. But that changed in 1999 with the passage of Senate Bill
681, a law that allows motorists involved in minor, noninjury
accidents to drive off the road to a safe location without clouding
the question of who was at fault.</TE>
<TE>   By moving your cars off the road after a minor accident, you also
can greatly reduce your chances of becoming road kill.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Officer Jack Richter recommends that motorists
involved in fender-benders pull as far out of traffic as possible,
especially at night, when speeds are fast and visibility is low. "It
comes down to common sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A recent Behind the Wheel column about a plan to launch a
safe-driving campaign in Los Angeles prompted several readers to
submit their ideas for a campaign slogan.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   * If you drink and drive, you're a bloody idiot.</TE>
<TE>   * Hang up and drive.</TE>
<TE>   * What's your hurry? Death is a long time.</TE>
<TE>   * No hospitals nearby. Watch your driving.</TE>
<TE>   * Drive with care. The life you save may be your own.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle recalls some of the
favorite quotes of the sports year:</LD>
<LD>   "Empty Cup(p): A 53-year-old insurance auditor from Raleigh, N.C.,
hopes the Carolina Hurricanes win the NHL title some day.</LD>
<LD>   " 'I've been looking to get back something for all the harassment
I've been getting all these years,' said Stanley Cupp.</LD>
<TE>   "Awareness: Miami Dolphin Coach Dave Wannstedt has a one-track
mind. When he looked around his house, he knew something was
different but he didn't know what. Finally, he realized something had
been added: a grand piano.</TE>
<TE>   " 'How long has that been there?' he asked his wife Jan, who
replied, 'Two months.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the Pacific 10 Conference record
for net yards rushing in a bowl game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's only a game, pal: Greg Cote of the Miami Herald, commenting
on the Dolphins' season-ending 27-24 loss in overtime to the New
England Patriots on Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   "Choke, collapse, calamity. Embarrassment, disgust, humiliation.
Ridiculousness, absurdity and a partridge in a pear tree. I mentioned
'choke,' right?</TE>
<TE>   " ... Inexcusable. This was stunning, unfathomable and, in a
football sense, nearly criminal, the Dolphins finding it impossible
to hold an 11-point lead with five minutes to play against the
Patriots at snow-banked Gillette Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What? Me again? Phil Moffat of Stanford holds the Pac-10 record
for most punt returns in a game, 13, against Dartmouth in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   It's a record that probably will never be broken.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are you ready for this? Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "With
corporate names on anything and everything these days, here's one we
can't wait to hear: Ex-Lax. Official sponsor for the Olympic
movement."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hard road: ESPN's Beano Cook on USC's demanding football schedule:
"Nobody has played a tougher schedule since Germany in World War II."</TE>
<TE>   Long ago and far away:  There are 28 college football bowl games
this year, but a few games are no longer scheduled. The Bluegrass
Bowl was played once, in 1958 at Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Aviation Bowl, hosted by Dayton in 1961. Don't
forget the 1937 Bacardi Bowl at Havana or the Dixie Bowl at
Birmingham in 1948-49.</TE>
<TE>   Other short-lived events include the Cigar Bowl in Tampa, Fla.;
the Camellia Bowl in Lafayette, La.; the Delta Bowl in Memphis,
Tenn.; the Raisin Bowl in Fresno, and the Salad Bowl in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1977, USC defeated Texas A&amp;M, 47-28,
in the Bluebonnet Bowl at the Astrodome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA, 423 yards, in the 1986 Freedom Bowl game
against Brigham Young.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Simmons, ESPN.com columnist:</TE>
<TE>   "After the Rockets drafted Yao Ming last summer, I wrote that he'd
get dunked on more than a cup of coffee at Krispy Kreme.</TE>
<TE>   "I called him 'a disaster waiting to happen,' even throwing in the
portentous phrase, 'Mark my words.' The lesson, as always? I'm an
idiot."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gentry Is Fed Up With Bad Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer is playing time guaranteed.</LD>
<LD>   That was Coach Alvin Gentry's message at practice Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Guys have to be accountable," he said. "If guys are constantly
getting beat [on defense], then we're going to try somebody else.
I've been more than patient. If guys can't keep guys in front of
them, we'll try somebody else. It's not a threat. We're not going to
tolerate guys driving by and leaving them in the game."</LD>
<TE>   What angered Gentry was the Clippers' inability to keep several
Golden State Warriors from driving for easy baskets Saturday. Golden
State's Gilbert Arenas took Keyon Dooling to the basket continually.
Jason Richardson also had a red carpet rolled out for him by Clipper
defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just one player," Gentry said. "It wasn't one guy.
There were a bunch of guys driving to the basket. If a guy can't do
it [play sound defense], we've got to take him out and go with
somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also remained concerned about the Clippers' play on the
other end, harping about their inability to solve the double- and
triple-teaming defense of the Warriors and Phoenix Suns against power
forward Elton Brand and center Michael Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   He at last acknowledged that a string of injuries this season has
had an impact on the team's disjointed offensive execution. He
refused to use injuries as an excuse for sloppy defensive play,
however.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers must give a better effort, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We get people back [from the injured list] and it's OK to
struggle here and there, but we can't struggle defensively," Gentry
said. "Injuries have nothing to do with how you play defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The 76ers failed to reach 80 points in losses to Atlanta
and Utah before losing, 104-98, to the Warriors on Monday night at
Oakland. They held a players-only meeting after a 98-69 loss Saturday
against the Jazz. The Clippers have won seven of the last eight
against the 76ers in Southern California. Allen Iverson led
Philadelphia with 34 points during a 101-99 overtime victory Nov. 6
over the Clippers.</TE>

<DH>Quentin Griffin's shifty style has earned him a place among
the Oklahoma greats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plenty of people have questioned Oklahoma running back Quentin
Griffin about his height, but this was the first rodent.</LD>
<LD>   As Griffin stood onstage during an appearance in Anaheim the other
day, Mickey Mouse sidled up close.</LD>
<LD>   "Mickey was giving me a hard time," Griffin said. "But I think
I've got him by a couple of inches."</LD>
<TE>   The truth of it: only if you don't count the ears.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 feet 7 and 195 pounds, Griffin is Oklahoma's little big man,
a 1,740-yard rusher this season with 3,612 career yards.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers put him in the company of such Sooner greats as
Billy Sims, Greg Pruitt, Steve Owens and Joe Washington -- all that
by a player who didn't even start his senior year at Nimitz High in
Aldine, Texas, outside Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I saw him when he visited, I thought, 'Are you
sure we want to recruit this guy?' " said Merv Johnson, a longtime
assistant coach under Barry Switzer who still works as director of
football operations and as the color analyst on the Sooner radio
network.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think you've got to put him right there with all those
running backs who've had those numbers in the past," Johnson said. "I
think it's quite remarkable what he's accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin's numbers will grow Wednesday in the Rose Bowl, as the
NCAA moves to include bowl games in the official records for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, he needs only 23 yards to pass Sims for the Oklahoma
single-season rushing record. But Oklahoma, unlike the NCAA, will
take the logical step of retroactively updating its records to
include bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   That will put Sims at 1,896 yards, with Griffin 156 behind.</TE>
<TE>   Sims will hold the career record at 4,118, followed by Washington,
Owens and then Griffin, at 3,794 and counting.</TE>
<TE>   You could quibble about the number of games today's players play
and question whether Griffin belongs in such company, but Johnson
points out another issue.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin's accomplishments have come in an Oklahoma system in which
the forward pass is no longer an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those players played when they were throwing it three or
four times a game," Johnson said. (Oklahoma attempted only three
passes in the 1979 Orange Bowl, during Sims' career.)</TE>
<TE>   "And those guys didn't have to pass protect or catch the football,
either," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Take note: When the bowls are included, Griffin ranks as
Oklahoma's all-time leader in receptions -- regardless of position --
with 167.</TE>
<TE>   It's all heady stuff for Griffin, who rushed for more than 1,000
yards his senior season in high school but had to share time with the
starter, Maurice Harris, who went on to Sam Houston State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great, coming from being on the 'B' team in high school
to being able to play in the Rose Bowl," Griffin said. "That's an
awesome experience."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, he honed his game in a way fewer and fewer players do
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, they probably play video games," Griffin said. "When I was
younger, I was always playing sandlot ball. I played in my
neighborhood. We had this big field, and we'd play a game where you
just tried to kill the man with the ball. It was pretty rough. Guys
would come at you pretty hard."</TE>
<TE>   The recruiters did not come at him hard, however. Only Oklahoma
and Texas A&amp;M offered scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really feel short until I came to college," Griffin
said. "Now, most people bring it up."</TE>
<TE>   His freshman year at Oklahoma, he was designated to redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries and his performance on the scout team changed that.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't tackle him," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The redshirt came off, seven games into the season.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in those sandlot days, Griffin developed the quick step
and the elusiveness that are his trademark to this day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shifty," Oklahoma offensive lineman Mike Skinner said. "He
does things that surprise me, and I watch him every day. You think
he'll be almost on the ground, and somehow he'll put a hand down and
be off."</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Trent Smith has seen it too.</TE>
<TE>   "I was blocking a guy in practice one day, and Quentin made a cut
and went between me and the defensive guy and underneath our arms.
And he never touched me."</TE>
<TE>   There have been faster Oklahoma backs.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran a 4.37 [40-yard dash] once, but I was about 170 or 180
pounds then," Griffin said. "Most of that stuff is overrated. Like
Jerry Rice wasn't that fast, clock-wise, but you don't see guys
catching him."</TE>
<TE>   There's an almost-automatic inclination to compare any short,
shifty back to Barry Sanders, who played at rival Oklahoma State, but
Johnson refuses it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'd be remiss if I tried to compare anyone to Barry
Sanders," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What Quentin does have is the ability to change directions at 90
degrees and never lose speed. A lot of backs have to slow down and
chop their steps and then take time to regain their speed."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State has impressive numbers against the run, but
everybody knows that 82.3-yard opponent rushing average was compiled
mostly against Pacific 10 Conference teams that were passing the ball
to try to catch up after falling behind.</TE>
<TE>   The one really ugly game was against Ohio State, when Maurice
Clarett ran for 230 of the Buckeyes' 292 rushing yards. Clarett had
194 rushing yards in the second half, after injuries thinned the
Cougar linebacking corps.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State defensive tackle Rien Long, the Outland Trophy
winner, said the Cougars are better than they looked against Ohio
State.</TE>
<TE>   And he insists they aren't fooled by Griffin's lack of size.
They've seen the string of nine 100-yard games, including the
Sooners' entire Big 12 schedule, and noted that 248-yard game against
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tremendous back. You've got to be sure you wrap him up,"
Long said.</TE>
<TE>   "He might be as tall as Mickey, but he's a strong, explosive back.
I think he's got Mickey in that department."</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Clemens wants to say goodbye to baseball with the New York
Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   The six-time Cy Young Award winner agreed Monday to a
$10.1-million, one-year contract and probably will retire after next
season, his 20th in the major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   "My feeling is right now that I don't anticipate playing past this
year," Clemens said. "I plan on going out the right way -- like I
always have, full throttle."</LD>
<TE>   An eight-time All-Star who turns 41 in August, Clemens has gone
60-27 during four seasons with the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   With a 293-151 record, Clemens has a chance to overtake Tom Seaver
(311) and Gaylord Perry (314) next season, which would put him in
15th place on the career wins list.</TE>
<TE>   After going 20-3 in 2001, Clemens was 13-6 with a 4.35 earned-run
average in 29 starts last season, battling leg problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plugged one of their bench holes, signing free-agent
outfielder Eric Owens to a one-year contract for $925,000.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, 31, can play all three outfield positions and runs well,
providing the Angels with a pinch-running threat and with the option
to increase Tim Salmon's time at designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Owens hit .270 for the Florida Marlins last season, with four home
runs and 33 strikeouts in 385 at-bats. He stole 26 bases, more than
any Angel.</TE>
<TE>   He selected the Angels after discussions with the Seattle Mariners
and Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A meeting between Hall of Famers and Commissioner Bud Selig to
discuss Pete Rose was postponed at the request of baseball officials.
The Hall had been contacting its 58 living members about a possible
gathering in Los Angeles on Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, asked the Hall
to delay the session. Hall spokesman Jeff Idelson said that the
meeting would not take place, but would not go into the reasons, and
DuPuy declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Three Down, More to Go?</HD>
<DH>Cowboys, Jaguars and Bengals fire coaches; Seahawks, Lions
are thinking about it. Dallas, Parcells talking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a flurry of NFL firings Monday, Dallas cleared the way for Bill
Parcells, Jacksonville made franchise history, and woeful Cincinnati
went from worst to first.</LD>
<LD>   First to get rid of its coach, that is.</LD>
<LD>   But the biggest news of the day wasn't the Bengals firing Dick
LeBeau, or the Jaguars firing Tom Coughlin -- the only coach they
have ever known -- but the Cowboys firing Dave Campo apparently in
order to hire Parcells, perhaps as soon as today.</LD>
<TE>   Still uncertain is the job status of Seattle's Mike Holmgren and
Detroit's Marty Mornhinweg. Both coaches have said they're confident
they will be back next season, even though neither team came close to
making the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Campo was fired, conflicting reports swirled as to
whether Parcells had already filled the Cowboy coaching vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Morning News reported on its Web site Monday afternoon
that Parcells had agreed to a four-year contract that will pay him
roughly $4.5 million a season, and that he will be introduced today
as the team's sixth coach. The newspaper cited a source close to
Parcells and Cowboy owner Jerry Jones.</TE>
<TE>   But ESPN, which employs Parcells as a studio analyst, countered
that report with one citing his agent, Jimmy Sexton, and two other
unnamed sources who said there was no deal.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, fed up with three consecutive 5-11 seasons, has spoken at
least twice with Parcells, 61, who has been out of coaching since
ending a three-year stint with the New York Jets after the 1999
season. He won two Super Bowls as coach of the New York Giants, and
took the New England Patriots there in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   He also has a history of abruptly quitting jobs and turning down
offers at the last minute, as he has done twice with Tampa Bay, most
recently last spring. The Buccaneers, who eventually hired Jon
Gruden, say they have a signed contract with Parcells and contend
they should have been asked permission before Parcells and the
Cowboys talked. Tampa Bay wants compensation, and that could
complicate a deal with Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said one of the reasons for making a coaching change is he
wants a proven coach. All five of the men who coached the Cowboys had
no prior experience as an NFL head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "This change is more about a change in philosophy, not about what
Dave didn't do," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   In Cincinnati, there are indications the Bengals are taking a long
look at Coughlin, who is more of a disciplinarian than LeBeau. People
familiar with the situation say Cincinnati players have asked owner
Mike Brown to hire a coach willing to enforce rules.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals did not pick up the option in LeBeau's contract,
letting him go after a 2-14 season, the worst in franchise history.
Owner Mike Brown, who has not had a winning season since taking over
in 1991 for his late father, Paul, told reporters he has no plans to
hire a general manager. Brown has been widely criticized for being a
better businessman than a judge of football talent.</TE>
<TE>   In three seasons under LeBeau, the Bengals went 12-33 (.267), the
worst winning percentage by any of the eight coaches in team history.
He was known as a "player's coach," who was friendly and possibly too
soft on his team.</TE>
<TE>   Two Bengal assistants rumored to be potential replacements for
LeBeau are running backs coach Jim Anderson and defensive coordinator
Mark Duffner.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin, Jacksonville's coach and general manager since the
franchise was formed eight years ago, was fired after three
consecutive losing seasons. Even though the Jaguars made it to the
AFC title game twice under Coughlin, they were 6-10 this season and
19-29 over the last three. Said Jaguar owner Wayne Weaver: "There's a
point in this business where you have to say, 'We need innovative new
ideas, new fresh approaches, and we need to move in a different
direction.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Green, former coach of the Minnesota Vikings, has been
mentioned as a possible replacement for Coughlin. Green told ESPN
that he might be interested in the Jacksonville job if it included
general manager responsibilities. But Weaver has made it clear he
wants a separate coach and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Other possible candidates for the Jacksonville job are Oklahoma
Coach Bob Stoops and Pittsburgh Steeler offensive coordinator Mike
Mularkey, a former Florida tight end.</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit, team President Matt Millen and Mornhinweg kept their
jobs Monday despite a 3-13 season, and a 5-27 record over the last
two years. Lion owner William Clay Ford is on vacation in Florida and
said two weeks ago that he will make a decision on Millen and
Mornhinweg after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Holmgren met Monday night to discuss his future with Seahawk
President Bob Whitsitt. There are reports Holmgren will stay as coach
but will be asked to relinquish his duties as general manager.</TE>
<TE>   He will address the media today at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not speak with reporters Monday, Holmgren told
players he expects to be back.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be back. We're too good," running back Shaun Alexander told
reporters. "You don't give away talent like this for someone else to
go win a Super Bowl. I think we're going to win the Super Bowl,
either next year or the year after."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLEROI, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Former University of Pittsburgh football player Jo Jo Heath was found
stabbed to death Monday near a wooded side street about 20 miles
southeast of Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Heath, 45, starred for the Panthers as a four-year letterman from
1976 to '79. He was a defensive back on Pitt's 1976 national
championship team and captained the 1979 squad that went 11-1 and
beat Arizona, 16-10, in the Fiesta Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Heath was a sixth-round draft choice of the Cincinnati Bengals in
1980 and played one year there before joining the Philadelphia Eagles
in 1981.</LD>
<TE>   State police didn't immediately return calls. County Coroner Tim
Warco ruled Heath's death a homicide, caused by multiple stab wounds
to the torso. It was not clear whether police have made any arrests.</TE>

<HD>USOC Members Divided on Ward</HD>
<DH>Some want chief executive to resign, but others want a
'measured review.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Olympic Committee was roiled Monday by disclosures of ethics
concerns linked to Chief Executive Lloyd Ward, with detractors
calling on him to resign immediately, but supporters urging a
measured review of the extent of Ward's involvement in a Detroit
company's bid to supply power generators to organizers of the 2003
Pan American Games.</LD>
<LD>   "If Lloyd was smart, he would resign now," one member of the
USOC's policy-making executive committee said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. "He's going to go one way or the other. I don't think
he can survive this."</LD>
<LD>   However, another member of the 22-person board, who also asked to
remain unnamed, countered: "It seems to me that if you read really
close and you know our ethics guidelines, there are some things he
shouldn't have done. But I'm not sure he should be fired for it."</LD>
<TE>   The executive committee is due to meet Jan. 13 in the wake of a
report Monday in The Times that Ward earlier this year directed USOC
staff to introduce the company, Energy Management Technologies, to
organizers in the Dominican Republic, site of the 2003 Pan Am Games.
The sole agenda item for the Jan. 13 meeting: Ward's future as CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Ward's brother, Rubert, is identified on at least two company
documents as EMT's president; one of the brothers' childhood friends,
Lorenzo Williams, is identified as CEO. Earlier this month, at a
meeting in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, Williams offered
what Lowell Fernandez, the Games' project manager, described as a
bribe in a bid to win a deal; Williams denies offering any bribe.
Williams also said that Rubert Ward "has no title now" with EMT. No
contract has been signed.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Ward has no financial interest in EMT. He did not return
phone calls Monday to his cellular phone and his Florida home.</TE>
<TE>   A former Maytag CEO with a reputation as a marketing guru, Ward
has for some time had a marketing-related trip to Santo Domingo
scheduled for Thursday. It remained unclear Monday whether he would
still make that trip.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, Ward signed a USOC form that said he had no real or
potential conflicts of interest. In it, he acknowledged that
conflicts may involve "placement of business in, or favorable
treatment of, a firm owned or controlled by a volunteer, family
member or personal friend."</TE>
<TE>   The matter was brought several weeks ago to the attention of the
USOC's ethics compliance panel, and in a letter delivered Monday to
the 22-member executive committee, USOC President Marty Mankamyer
indicated that the ethics board is due shortly to issue a review
"substantiating an ethics violation by Lloyd Ward." Members of the
ethics board could not be reached Monday for confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Ward took over as the USOC's CEO in November 2001. His tenure has
been controversial -- but he has also demonstrated ample political
skill and infighting know-how, particularly in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   One of a handful of African American members at Augusta National
Golf Club, which does not have a female member, Ward was able Nov. 1
to convince the USOC's executive committee to issue a statement of
support for his "principled position on the issue," an apparent
reference to his Oct. 7 statement pledging to "aggressively work" for
reform from within. Augusta plays host each spring to the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   One of the central issues confronting Ward now is how much
political capital he has expended over the Augusta issue. Mankamyer's
letter said the Jan. 13 meeting is to be a wide-ranging "performance
review" of Ward's 14 months on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team, for instance, won a record 34 medals at the Salt
Lake Winter Games in February. But the USOC has announced few major
sponsorship deals since.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC's budget now runs to more than $100 million annually. It
remains uncertain if it will be solidly in the black heading into the
2004 Athens Games; in a recent issue, Forbes magazine advised
would-be donors to be wary of contributing to the USOC.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is the matter of consistency, particularly regarding
the USOC's mission to set an ethical example. For instance, Arizona
real estate executive Sandra Baldwin, elected in 2000 as the USOC's
first female president, resigned May 24 after admitting to
discrepancies in her USOC biography. She had listed a doctorate in
American literature she didn't earn.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said Monday in a telephone interview, "I resigned because
I felt the USOC needed to be held to the highest standard. To this
very day, I feel good about what I did, because I believe I did
something that was the right thing for the U.S. Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope he would show the same sort of courage."</TE>

<HD>Carroll May Have Some Work to Finish</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>During the Orange Bowl's opening news conference Sunday afternoon,
Pete Carroll was watching film.</LD>
<LD>   "I found a TV and checked out that Miami-New England game," he
said.</LD>
<LD>   After the news conference, he watched more film.</LD>
<TE>   "Did you see what the Jets did to the Packers?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, even more film.</TE>
<TE>   "That Bucs game, did you see what they were doing with that
defense?" he added.</TE>
<TE>   When the Trojan coach emerged on the practice field Monday
morning, his head cloudy with memories, one thing became clear.</TE>
<TE>   USC's biggest opponent this week is not Iowa, or overconfidence,
or even O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Its biggest opponent is the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   With three coaches fired Monday, and at least a couple of others
seemingly doomed, there will be a handful of vacancies this winter.</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans finish as the second-ranked team in the country,
Carroll will emerge as one of a handful of legitimate candidates.</TE>
<TE>   He has been there, with four seasons as an NFL coach and six
seasons as an NFL coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   He has won there, with .500 or better records in three of four
seasons as coach.</TE>
<TE>   And he wants to go back there ... maybe.</TE>
<TE>   He says no, but his body language says yes.</TE>
<TE>   He says forget it, but his eyes say he will never forget.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired after only one season with the New York Jets simply
because the owner had fallen in love with a colossal bust named Rich
Kotite.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired after three seasons and two playoff berths in New
England simply because the owner was still heartsick about losing
Bill Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with an NFL coaching record of 33-31, and dozens of
lingering what-ifs.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of me will always know what occurred," he said. "There is a
dark side of all this that motivates the heck out of me. Being able
to prove I can do something for a long period of time is very
important to me."</TE>
<TE>   Translated, that means he wants to stay at USC and finish the
rebuilding he has started, right?</TE>
<TE>   Or does it mean he wants to go back to the NFL and finish that
job?</TE>
<TE>   History shows that once an NFL guy, always an NFL guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, it's like the NFL around here now," receiver Mike Williams
said. "From what I understand, we practice like an NFL team. Coach
takes care of us. That's why we like it so much."</TE>
<TE>   While USC privately claims it will pay whatever it takes to keep
Carroll from leaving, the Trojans apparently also are hedging their
bet.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Chow, the offensive coordinator, became one of the first
career assistants in history to turn down a head-coaching job when he
recently rebuffed Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stunning decision. Or was it?</TE>
<TE>   Some say Chow was told he would be a leading candidate for the USC
job if Carroll left.</TE>
<TE>   "Things just didn't feel right, that's all it was," Chow said of
the Kentucky job.</TE>
<TE>   As for Carroll going to the NFL, he smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "I think teams would be crazy not to go after him," Chow said.
"The guy's a heck of football coach."</TE>
<TE>   The rumors of Carroll's return to the NFL actually began earlier
this season. Quarterback Carson Palmer heard one, and immediately
confronted his coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wasn't going anywhere," Palmer said. "He's told me
that a number of times since then.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got an opportunity to do something really special here, to
be the guy who brings us back on the national scene, and he's so
close right now ... he would never leave."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's son, Brennan, a graduate assistant coach, has been
telling players the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he can't imagine his father leaving this for the salary
caps, the holdouts, all that NFL stuff," Williams said. "He says his
father is really happy here."</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that Carroll has been sincere in all those
comments.</TE>
<TE>   But that was before he reappeared on the NFL radar screen with his
quick renovation of a messy Trojan situation.</TE>
<TE>   That was before he behaved like another former NFL
assistant-turned-college coach.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Butch Davis, University of Miami, two seasons ago?</TE>
<TE>   Davis turned around the program, coached them to a No. 2 national
ranking, and was promptly hired by the Cleveland Browns for around
$3.5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll has done virtually the same thing here this season.</TE>
<TE>   And you think if somebody shows up offering to triple his
around-$1 million salary, he won't take it? Or that he shouldn't take
it?</TE>
<TE>   The NFL could double Carroll's salary, which is not among college
football's elite, and he probably would take it. Wouldn't you?</TE>
<TE>   His players, who can leave school early, should understand. Their
parents, who don't think twice about changing jobs for big raises,
should understand.</TE>
<TE>   The new reality in college sports has been a reality for years in
the workplace. Nothing personal. It's just business.</TE>
<TE>   "SC has given me the opportunity of a lifetime, I'm having a
blast, and I don't want it to end," Carroll said. "I want to stay. I
want to keep growing. I want to finish the job."</TE>
<TE>   It's an admirable desire.</TE>
<TE>   But let's see how muffled it sounds beneath $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll has three years left on his contract, but there is little
doubt that a lucrative NFL job could allow him to escape.</TE>
<TE>   So Mike Garrett, be warned.</TE>
<TE>   The sound of O.J. Simpson walking on to your field is nothing
compared to the fury if Pete Carroll walks off.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>What a Wonderfully Wacky Time It Was</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The calendar on the wall says Dec. 31, if that still means anything
in a year when sports rendered the calendar meaningless.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 364 days, in arenas and stadiums from Salt Lake City
to South Korea, it has been April 1 on an endless loop, "Groundhog
Day" with a whoopee cushion, the world's longest practical joke on a
broken record.</LD>
<LD>   The New England Patriots beat the St. Louis Rams in the Super
Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   And the Rams never won another game with Kurt Warner at
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes won the Olympic gold medal in women's figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   And the Russians won the gold medal in pairs figure skating ...
and so did the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   The United States almost made the semifinals of soccer's World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   And lost three games and finished sixth at the men's World
Basketball Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's All-Star game ended in a tie when both teams ran out of
pitchers with the score frozen at 7-up.</TE>
<TE>   And Ted Williams remains on ice in a cryogenics lab in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods shot an 81 in the third round of the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   And shot a 67 in the final round of the PGA Championship and lost
to a former electronics salesman named Rich Beem.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer won the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   And USC and Iowa will play the best-looking Rose Bowl in years in
the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Day after day, week after week, upstarts and underdogs played a
never-ending game of Can You Top This? Indiana stunned Duke in the
NCAA men's basketball tournament. Pete Sampras stunned everybody by
winning the U.S. Open. The New Jersey Nets reached the NBA Finals.
The Carolina Hurricanes played in the Stanley Cup finals. Jerry West
went to work for the Memphis Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Expect the unexpected became the daily morning mantra before
cracking open the sports page. Glass-slipper Cinderella stories
became old hat. Shocks to the system began to fizzle because the
system had built up a jaded immunity.</TE>
<TE>   But then came the evening of Oct. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Dateline, Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Lofting fly ball to Darin Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck is narrating in English, but the words, even when
repeated two months later, seem from another galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels! World Champions!"</TE>
<TE>   The.</TE>
<TE>   Angels.</TE>
<TE>   World.</TE>
<TE>   Champions.</TE>
<TE>   And monkeys will fly high above the outfield fences.</TE>
<TE>   (Actually, that happened too, in the form of a video primate often
seen hopping up and down on the scoreboard during Angel home games.
Local baseball enthusiasts took to calling the mangy thing "the Rally
Monkey" and if the Angels were ever trailing after the fifth inning
... ah, we all have had enough of that bit to last us till 2202.
Future historians seeking further knowledge about this bizarre
seasonal ritual, you're on your own.)</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Six words previously strung together only by science fiction
novelists and comedy writers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (Luis Sanchez to Cecil Cooper!) qualified for their
first playoff berth since 1986 by winning 99 of 162 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (Donnie Moore to Dave Henderson!) defeated the New York
Yankees in the first round of the American League playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (Mark Langston to Luis Sojo!) defeated the Minnesota
Twins to win their first AL pennant in 42 years of trying.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (An 11-game lead in '95!) rallied from a 5-0,
seventh-inning deficit in Game 6 of the World Series and defeated the
San Francisco Giants, 4-1, in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   It was the event of a lifetime, of 6 billion lifetimes, because no
one on the planet honestly expected to live long enough to see it
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Stranger still was the sight of Jackie Autry, who ran the
franchise into the ground before selling it to Disney, and Michael
Eisner, who had hoped to dump the team on some poor sucker long
before October 2002, standing on the championship podium taking bows
for eight months of hard work they had absolutely nothing to do with.</TE>
<TE>   The victory belonged to 25 players who were overshadowed every
step of their remarkable climb -- by the Dodgers during the regular
season, by Yankee aura and Twin hoopla during the playoffs, by Barry
Bonds during the Series.</TE>
<TE>   It belonged to Manager Mike Scioscia and his coaches, who kept the
team focused during a 6-14 start, which was an unprecedented
franchise low, even for the Angels, and emphasized smart, fundamental
baseball -- all but waving the textbook written by the Dodgers in the
faces of their freeway rivals.</TE>
<TE>   It belonged to Bill Bavasi, the former general manager who
assembled the basic framework and decided to resign rather than break
up the core, as certain Disney executives wanted.</TE>
<TE>   And it belonged to the front-office tandem of Paul Pressler, who
rattled the Angels' tin cup loudly enough for Disney to capitulate
with a few more dollars, and Bill Stoneman, who used those funds to
bolster the roster with the likes of Kevin Appier, Aaron Sele and
Brad Fullmer.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' improbable championship was the crown jewel in a
rousing comeback year for the Southland, which had been subsisting on
the Lakers, bread and water for far too long.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did their part again, winning their third consecutive
NBA championship, although the Sacramento Kings and their followers
will forever credit the officials working the Western Conference
finals with the essential push over the top.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks won their second WNBA title, repeating the all-gender
basketball sweep they and the Lakers first managed in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, on the verge of being branded the Buffalo Bills of
soccer, finally broke through in its fourth appearance in the Major
League Soccer championship final, in overtime, on a goal by
Guatemalan rookie Carlos Ruiz, to defeat the New England Revolution,
1-0, for its first MLS Cup.</TE>
<TE>   USC won 10 of 12 football games, including routs of UCLA and Notre
Dame on national television, the latter giving Trojan quarterback
Palmer the cross-country exposure he needed to become the first West
Coast player to win the Heisman Trophy since Marcus Allen in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   All told, in terms of trophies won, the Los Angeles-Anaheim
sporting empire has never had a better year than 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the Dodgers and the Lakers won championships and USC's
Rodney Peete finished second to Barry Sanders in the Heisman voting.
But the Angels were awful, the Raiders missed the playoffs, the Rams
lost their wild-card game to Minnesota, UCLA failed to qualify for
the NCAA basketball tournament and the Kings still were getting used
to the absurd notion of Wayne Gretzky skating for the good guys at
the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Dodgers won the World Series and Allen won the Heisman.
But the Angels were awful, the Lakers were eliminated in the playoffs
by Houston, the Rams were 6-10, the Raiders were still in Oakland,
the Kings lost in the first round of the playoffs and UCLA lost to
Brigham Young in the second round of the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the Lakers won their first championship in Los Angeles,
John Wooden won his eighth at UCLA and USC went 12-0 to earn the
national championship in college football. But the Angels were awful,
the Kings were too, the Dodgers finished third in the NL West and the
Rams went 6-7-1.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the Sparks and Galaxy joined the neighborhood after 1995,
widening the channels for potential success. But before them, the
region went through the comings and goings of the Sun, Surf, Stars,
Amigos, Aztecs, Express and Dreams, and all they left us with was a
solitary North American Soccer League championship, courtesy of the
1974 Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' triumph embodied a baseball season in which anything
and everything seemed possible.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Commissioner Bud Selig was booed in Milwaukee after shutting
down a 7-7 All-Star game, forever debunking the notion that there's
no tying in baseball. Yes, the ready-for-contraction Twins reached
the AL championship series. Yes, the Oakland A's won 20 games in a
row. Yes, Seattle's Mike Cameron and the Dodgers' Shawn Green hit
four home runs in a game in the same month. Yes, Selig and Players
Assn. chief Don Fehr saved the season by forging a new labor
agreement Aug. 30 -- hours before the strike deadline, hours after
angry Angel fans pelted Edison Field with debris as a work stoppage
seemed imminent.</TE>
<TE>   (Did the Angels vote Selig and Fehr playoff shares? Because
without that historic accord in late August, the Angels would be
spending their 42nd consecutive off-season wondering, "What if?")</TE>
<TE>   The NFL, addled after so many years of obsessive-compulsive
attention to leveling the playing field, completely went off the
rails.</TE>
<TE>   For most of four decades, the Patriots couldn't do anything to
help themselves. So, in consecutive postseason games in January, the
Patriots received handouts from the referee in a divisional playoff
game against the Raiders (an apparent game-losing fumble negated by
an obscure "tuck rule"), the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC
championship game (the Steelers started Kordell Stewart in a big
game) and the Rams in the Super Bowl (St. Louis Coach Mike Martz
mysteriously decided to use Marshall Faulk as a decoy).</TE>
<TE>   In the regular season that followed, absolutely nothing made
sense. The Rams couldn't win with Warner, but went 6-0 with a
third-stringer named Marc Bulger. The expansion Houston Texans netted
47 yards and three first downs against Pittsburgh, in Pittsburgh, and
won by 18 points, costing the Steelers home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs. The Miami Dolphins finally traded for a
franchise running back, Ricky Williams led the league in rushing ...
and the Dolphins slipped from 11-5 in 2001 to 9-7 and out of the
playoffs in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the 16th week of a 17-week season, no AFC team had
clinched a playoff berth. By the end of the 17th, no team had more
than 12 victories and no team, with any degree of confidence, could
consider itself the team to beat in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Lakers, a bastion of dependability after Phil Jackson
came aboard, succumbed to the nasty karma. In fact, after winning
their third consecutive league title by sweeping New Jersey,
absolutely nothing went right for them.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn, the team's legendary play-by-play broadcaster, died
Aug. 5 after hitting his head during a fall in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal postponed surgery on his arthritic big toe until
late summer, causing him to sit out the first 12 games of the Lakers'
2002-03 season. Predictably, the Lakers floundered without him, but
even after O'Neal's return, the team continued to lose. Now 13-19,
the Lakers have dropped into a virtual 10th-place tie in the Western
Conference with the Clippers, now in their third season of being Just
On The Brink.</TE>
<TE>   And out there on the horizon, a legitimate threat to O'Neal's
baddest big man title has been detected. His name is Yao Ming, he
comes from China, he was the top pick in the NBA draft and he has
spent his first three months in America swatting away shots and
doubts that he'd ever make it in this league because, hey, he's from
Asia and this is our game.</TE>
<TE>   At least it was in the 20th century. Welcome to the new
millennium, in which the United States takes a squad of NBA All-Stars
to Indianapolis, takes on the world with the home-court advantage and
gets taken out by Argentina, Yugoslavia and Spain, finishing in sixth
place.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it went for the United States in international team
sports. Ice hockey? The American men and women both lost to Canada in
the Olympic gold-medal round. Tennis? Our men lost to France in the
Davis Cup semifinals, our women to Austria in the first round of the
Fed Cup. Golf? The U.S. women had to rally to win the Solheim Cup,
but the U.S. men were outplayed and outsmarted by the Europeans at
the Ryder Cup, losing to Sam Torrance's front-loaded squad on the
final day, 15 1/2-12 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer, that's our new sport. Three years after the United States
won the Women's World Cup, the American men shattered long-held
perceptions around the globe, and sleep patterns in their own
country, by beating Portugal and Mexico to reach the World Cup
quarterfinals, where they outplayed Germany but were denied a penalty
kick despite an apparent hand ball by German defender in the goal
mouth and lost, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   We're also not bad at halfpipe snowboarding, short-track
speedskating and a maniacal, head-first sledding sport called
skeleton. Americans won gold medals in each of these activities at
the Salt Lake City Olympics en route to a U.S. Winter Olympics record
haul of 34 medals, more than doubling our previous high of 13.</TE>
<TE>   (This does not include the gold medal won by the American media on
behalf of Canadian pairs skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, who
finished second to the Russians before NBC and U.S. newspapers began
crying "No fair!" After a week of heated news conferences and
accusations of vote-swapping by skating judges, the International
Olympic Committee decided to clone the pairs skating gold medal and
dole out a second set to the Canadians. Assist, us.)</TE>
<TE>   And, as the rest of the world has grudgingly come to accept, we
rule the Tour de France. Lance Armstrong won his fourth consecutive
Tour in July, putting him in position to tie Miguel Indurain's record
of five in row in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Consistency. Dependability. Reliability. That was Armstrong on his
bicycle in the French countryside, relentlessly churning his way to a
result everyone has anticipated for weeks, reminding and reassuring
us all of what was still possible in a sports year when so much else
strayed far off course.</TE>

<HD>No. 1 Alabama Falls Flat to Utah</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alabama's first trip to the top of the Associated Press rankings will
probably end when the next poll comes out.</LD>
<LD>   The top-ranked Crimson Tide missed nine of their first 10 shots,
shot 41% overall and scored a season-low points in Monday night's
51-49 loss to Utah at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   "I never get into that No. 1 stuff. I'm happy the team showed
heart," Utah Coach Rick Majerus said. "The wins count all the same.
Until they count one win for two wins, I won't give it any more
attention."</LD>
<TE>   Nick Jacobson led Utah with only 13 points, and he sealed the
1,500th victory in school history by making two free throws with 24.2
seconds left. Tim Frost had nine points for the Utes (8-3).</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (9-1) had a chance to tie the score in the final seconds,
but Erwin Dudley missed a putback in the lane. Utah's Richard Chaney
grabbed the rebound as time expired. Chaney hugged the ball and

<HD>Clarett Always Has Teams on Red Alert</HD>
<DH>Ohio State tailback's speed bewilders opponents; his
comments bother Buckeyes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Miami defenders can only hope they stick to tailback Maurice Clarett
as well as controversy does.</LD>
<LD>   Clarett may already be the most dynamic lightning rod in Columbus
since Woody Hayes and gives Ohio State its best -- only? -- chance of
defeating Miami in Friday's Fiesta Bowl, quite a feat for a kid who
just turned 19.</LD>
<LD>   Clarett can't run around end or walk around a corner without
making news and he added to his clip file Monday, lashing out at his
school for not allowing him to return home to Youngstown, Ohio, to
attend the funeral of a slain friend.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess football's more important than a person's life to them,"
Clarett said. "That's why I just want to get this game over with and
go back home."</TE>
<TE>   Clarett's comments sent Ohio State officials running for cover,
not for the first time this season; but there appears no simple way
of containing this freshman phenom--on or off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett's 1,190 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns have helped put
Ohio State in position to claim its first national title since 1968,
with words gushing from Clarett's mouth almost as readily.</TE>
<TE>   The questions, heading into Friday's national championship game,
were supposed to concern Clarett's injured left shoulder, but he said
the shoulder was fine. Instead, Clarett spoke of another pain.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the tough streets of Youngstown, a one-time delinquent
who found refuge in football, Clarett was reminded this holiday
season that not everyone makes it out alive.</TE>
<TE>   He had already, by his estimation, attended 10 funerals of friends
and said he would have attended No. 11 had it not been for the matter
of Friday's national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett would not identify the friend he said was shot and killed
Dec. 21 in Youngstown -- Associated Press reported it was 23-year-old
Juan Bell -- and was short on details.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go that deep or that far," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett said he'd asked Ohio State if he could return home for
Monday's funeral but was told it was a compliance issue.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend had a funeral today at 11 a.m. and they wouldn't put me
on a plane to go back," Clarett said. "They basically gave me the
runaround. The funeral's over now. That was their way of telling me I
couldn't go."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Geiger, Ohio State's athletic director, said Clarett could
have returned home for the funeral but failed to fill out the
required NCAA paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel briefly addressed the Clarett issue
after Monday's practice, saying, "The best thing for all involved is
to say it didn't work out."</TE>
<TE>   As he sat for a mandatory media session interview in a posh
Phoenix hotel, Clarett tried to make sense of his life now and the
one he left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "We hold the national championship high, but they won't talk about
the homeless and the poor," Clarett said. "We're sitting here in this
grand hotel but we can't feed the homeless or the poor. That's real
life, this is a game."</TE>
<TE>   This has already been a newsmaker-reel season for Clarett, who
burst onto the Buckeye stage by rushing for 175 yards in the opener
against Texas Tech. He followed with a 230-yard effort against
Washington State on Sept. 14 and was a leading contender for the
Heisman Trophy until knee and shoulder injuries cut into his playing
time.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Clarett had to play word defense after an article in
ESPN the Magazine quoted him as saying he might challenge the NFL's
rule that requires a player to be three years removed from high
school before becoming draft eligible and declare for the draft after
his freshman season.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think about it?" Clarett said to the magazine. "It's got to
go through your head, man."</TE>
<TE>   More than Clarett's words, Ohio State officials and fans were
offended by the magazine's staged cover shot: Clarett tossing his
jersey away under a headline "One and Done?"</TE>
<TE>   Clarett received dozens of hate e-mails from Buckeye fans.</TE>
<TE>   He said Monday the ESPN photographer had set him up.</TE>
<TE>   "I make one mean face and they put it on the cover," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett quickly retreated from his comments, though, when a series
of subsequent injuries made it clear the freshman was not ready for
the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett said as much Monday, saying he needs to get much stronger
as a player.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the pounding on your body, I don't think it is physically
possible," he said of the NFL question.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett started only eight of his team's 13 wins because of
injuries. Minor knee surgery forced him out of a game at Cincinnati
on Sept. 21 and the Buckeyes nearly lost. Clarett injured his left
shoulder against Wisconsin on Oct. 19, and had only four carries the
next week, against Penn State, before leaving the game in pain.</TE>
<TE>   The shoulder plagued him the rest of the season, although he came
off the bench to rush for 119 yards Nov. 23 to help lead his team to
a 14-9 win over Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett has tried to downplay his impact on Friday's national
title game against Miami, but the prevailing opinion says Ohio State
has no chance unless Clarett can control the game and the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we have to stop Clarett," Miami Coach Larry Coker said.
"He is a guy who, if he can run the ball on us and make first downs,
they will be in a position to score touchdowns or score with their
great field goal kicker."</TE>
<TE>   Football, though, seemed the last thing on Clarett's mind Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He questioned what he was doing in sun-splashed Phoenix while his
friend was being laid to rest back home. He questioned the economics
of big-time college football relative to the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   "All the money is going to the wrong places," he said. "They take
care of us, but I'd rather give it back to the people who really need
it. I wish I could funnel it to the people who really need it. If you
go through downtown Columbus, you have people sleeping on sidewalks
and they're giving us scholarships and they sell 100,000 tickets
every game.... You walk past bums and homeless people -- this is
wintertime, it's like 19 degrees out, and they're sleeping in boxes
with little covers. It doesn't make any sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   These are penetrating issues, beyond the scope of most
19-year-olds, but Clarett seems to think he has to do what all great
tailbacks do: carry the load.</TE>

<LD>ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The Mighty Ducks may not be in over their heads,
but it's time to start bailing.</LD>
<LD>   Three consecutive losses have taken the luster off what had been
two of their best weeks. The Ducks play today at Minnesota, one of
the teams they are chasing for a playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   "When you go through an 82-game schedule, you're not going to be
at your best night in and night out," team captain Paul Kariya said.
"But you can't have these long stretches of bad games."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks are at three and counting. They came out of the
Christmas break and were manhandled by San Jose, 4-1. Two nights
later, Vancouver routed them, 7-3. A weary Duck team then gave
Calgary a 4-2 victory Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't find out anything about your team when they're loosey
goosey," Coach Mike Babcock said before the Vancouver loss. Two
defeats later, his tone became more serious.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when adversity hits, you find out something about your
team," Babcock said after his team had lost to Calgary. "When things
go right, you have the momentum. When things go wrong, there's
momentum too and that takes more to change that."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>West Virginia Gov. Bob Wise wants an apology from the University of
Virginia after a halftime show by the school's pep band in the
Continental Tire Bowl lampooned West Virginia's rural image.</LD>
<LD>   "This type of performance merely perpetuates the unfounded
stereotypes that we in West Virginia are fighting so hard to
overcome," Wise said Monday in a letter to Virginia President John T.
Casteen. "The incident on Saturday was conduct unbecoming of the
University of Virginia."</LD>
<LD>   During the Cavalier-Mountaineer matchup at Charlotte, N.C.,
Virginia's independent pep band staged a parody of "The Bachelor,"
with a male Virginia student choosing between two female contestants.</LD>
<TE>   One female, purported to be from West Virginia, had blue overalls,
pigtails, a talent for square dancing and a dream to move to Beverly
Hills -- a reference to "The Beverly Hillbillies."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baylor offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin will be Michigan State's
new offensive coordinator. The former San Jose State and Cal State
Northridge head coach spent the 2001 season as the Cincinnati
Bearcats' offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia co-defensive coordinator Todd Graham will become
Tulsa's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. Graham starts
work at Tulsa next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rich Brooks is returning to football, introduced as Kentucky's new
head coach after two years away from the game.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, who previously coached Oregon and the St. Louis Rams, has
been out of football since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of a nuts-and-bolts football coach," Brooks said. "I
believe in blocking and tackling and throwing and catching. Those
things don't change."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin player Brett Bell pleaded innocent to misdemeanor
charges that he attacked a man near campus. Bell was charged with
disorderly conduct, battery and bail jumping. Coach Barry Alvarez
suspended Bell the next day, and Bell missed the Badgers' 31-28 win
over Colorado in the Alamo Bowl on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Captain Kirk</HD>
<DH>Architect of Iowa's stunning turnaround had to endure 2-18
start</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Four years ago, when Iowa was set to replace
retiring Hayden Fry as football coach, the popular choice was
obvious.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkeye fans clamored for the hiring of Bob Stoops, a former Iowa
player and assistant coach who had made his mark as defensive
coordinator under Steve Spurrier at Florida.</LD>
<LD>   But when Iowa officials didn't move fast enough, Stoops went to
Oklahoma and won a national championship in his second season.</LD>
<TE>   Iowa settled for Kirk Ferentz, an obscure but respected NFL
assistant who had coached under Fry. Ferentz promptly lost 18 of his
first 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," he said. "Nobody likes to lose. But it's like I
tell our players, you usually get what you deserve in sports. And
quite frankly, at that time we just weren't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "But the important thing is, the attitude was good enough. No one
got discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Least of all Ferentz, who has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround
at Iowa by preaching hard work and patience.</TE>
<TE>   How have the Hawkeyes improved in four seasons under Ferentz?
Let's count:</TE>
<TE>   1. From 1-10 in his first season to 11-1.</TE>
<TE>   2. From 0-8 in the Big Ten to 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   3. From unranked to No. 3 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   4. From nowhere to the Orange Bowl against USC on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Fans who once complained that Iowa had botched the coaching search
were calling sports radio shows in a dither last winter when Ferentz
was rumored to be a candidate for the Indianapolis Colts' head
coaching position.</TE>
<TE>   None of it fazes Ferentz, who said he has no plans to leave. Nine
years as the offensive line coach at Iowa (1981-89) gave him an
understanding of Hawkeye fans, whom he described as realistic and
appreciative. He said he never considered himself on the hot seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I know what the people in Iowa want," he said. "And we've
tried to give that to them. I think they realize we've worked at it
methodically. We've put in an honest day's work every day along the
way."</TE>
<TE>   When Ferentz was named national coach of the year by the
Associated Press, beating out Ohio State's Jim Tressel and Notre
Dame's Tyrone Willingham, Iowa Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby might
have summed up the feelings of all Hawkeye supporters when he said in
a statement: "Kirk and his staff represent the best in college
athletics in the way they have built our program."</TE>
<TE>   Seated in his office at the Hayden Fry Football Complex, a relaxed
Ferentz speaks articulately in rapid-fire bursts. With his slim
build, boyish face and full head of brown hair, he looks younger than
his 47 years.</TE>
<TE>   His youthful enthusiasm and work ethic were needed to rebuild a
program that had slumped by the time Fry stepped down in 1998, after
20 seasons as Iowa's coach.</TE>
<TE>   "People always ask me, 'How does it feel to replace Coach Fry?' "
Ferentz said. "You don't replace a guy like Coach Fry, you follow
him. Twenty years earlier, when he came to Iowa in the '70s, they had
poor facilities. They had no tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt so fortunate because I came here and we had great
facilities and we had demonstrated success in football. So that gave
me a chance to recruit a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Ferentz recalled his first coaching stint at Iowa as a "magical
part" of the school's football history. During his nine years as an
assistant, the Hawkeyes played in eight bowl games, twice in the Rose
Bowl, 1982 and '86. Iowa's record in those nine years was 73-33-4 and
included two 10-win and two nine-win seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He left Iowa after the 1989 season and was head coach at Maine for
three seasons, compiling a record of 12-21, before moving to the NFL.
He was assistant head coach and offensive line coach of the Baltimore
Ravens before returning to Iowa in December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Ferentz coached in the NFL for six years, a learning experience
that taught him the importance of conditioning and special teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are two things that we really were going to hang our hats
on when we got here," Ferentz said.</TE>
<TE>   The work of Chris Doyle, Iowa's strength and conditioning coach,
is cited for helping turn the Hawkeyes into one of the most physical
teams in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   The special teams, coached by Darrell Wilson, have flourished.
Iowa ranked first in the Big Ten in kick coverage and net punting,
second in kickoff returns and third in punt returns. Kicker Nick
Kaeding is an All-American.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his attention to detail, though, Ferentz needed time to
mold Iowa into a competitive team. Transfers and injuries,
particularly among offensive linemen, hurt the Hawkeyes during their
1-10 season in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, Ferentz continued to steer Iowa on a steady
course.</TE>
<TE>   "I had great faith that we would have every chance to be
successful," he said. "I also knew that I had no timetables to work
with. We never had a set formula. All I knew was that we were going
to work hard every day, and our players have done that."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa improved to 3-9 in 2000 and began its turnaround late in the
season with a double-overtime victory at Penn State. The Hawkeyes
have gone 20-7 since then, their 7-5 record last season capped by an
Alamo Bowl victory over Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Players credit Ferentz and his staff for forging a winning
attitude that led to this season's unprecedented success. The 11
victories and 8-0 Big Ten record are firsts for Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Coach Ferentz says, 'If you do things right, good things are
going to happen to you,' " said receiver Ramon Ochoa, a junior from
Maywood. "He's preached that since the day he got here, and look at
us now."</TE>
<TE>   With his family settled -- son Brian, the oldest of his five
children, is a redshirt freshman offensive lineman for the Hawkeyes
-- Ferentz said he is content in his situation and has no immediate
aspirations to return to the NFL as a head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a great situation professionally, personally," he said.
"The only complaint I have is the weather here at times can be a
little tough and there are too many stop lights between [the
university] and my house."</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, life is good for Ferentz, the consolation prize
who became a prize catch.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Don't bother looking for Chris Gamble on the Ohio State sideline
during Friday night's Fiesta Bowl because, except for quick pit
stops, he won't be there.</LD>
<LD>   "Drink a little bit of water, and I just go right back out there,"
he says.</LD>
<LD>   Gamble is the Buckeyes' starting wide receiver ... and cornerback.</LD>
<TE>   He also returns punts and kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   This is no gimmick to get a star-starved player some extra film
for NFL scouts. Rather, as the Ohio State coaching staff figured out
midway through the season, keeping Gamble on the field was the best
way to win a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone talks about how you need speedy guys from Florida to beat
teams from Florida, right?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Gamble, who arrived to Columbus from the Sunshine state,
gives the speed-challenged Buckeyes two starters from Florida in one
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State is hoping that's enough to keep pace with Miami in
Friday's national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble was a fine receiver, mind you, but not fully utilized on a
Big Ten team that was built to run the ball.</TE>
<TE>   So why not play him on defense too?</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State threw Gamble out on the field against Cincinnati in
September and he responded with an interception on the first play.</TE>
<TE>   By season's end, you couldn't drag this lanky sophomore off the
field. He has started the last five games at receiver and cornerback
and has become a throwback player on a throwback team. In fact, it's
a wonder Gamble even bothers wearing a face mask.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, of course, two-way players were the norm in college and
the pros, but were weeded out as the game became more specialized and
sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   Players have since dabbled at double duty -- it helped Charles
Woodson win the Heisman Trophy at Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, no one in recent times has done it the way Gamble has.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three games, he has logged more than 100 plays on
offense, defense and special teams, including an incredible 128-play
effort against Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Michael Doss calls Gamble the team's "Deion Sanders
factor."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, after he made his first two-way start against
Penn State, on Oct. 26, Gamble went home and slept for about 16
hours.</TE>
<TE>   As a receiver, Gamble has 29 catches for 430 yards, but he has
made the most impact at cornerback, leading the team with four
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   His 40-yard interception return for score was the difference in a
13-7 victory over Penn State and he made another key interception in
a 10-6 victory over Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of running, lot of conditioning," Gamble says of his
two-way duty. "But I'm all right. Long as I drink a little water, I'm
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Dantonio, the Buckeyes' defensive coordinator, says Gamble's
offensive skills give him an advantage on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's also a receiver, so he knows that end of the game a little
bit, what people are trying to do against him," Dantonio said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Gamble will be assigned to stop speedy Hurricane receiver
Andre Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Miami players just can't wait until game time.</TE>
<TE>   Question to receiver Johnson: Do you think you're faster than Ohio
State?</TE>
<TE>   Johnson: "I don't know. I don't know how fast they are. They look
like a fast defense. We'll find out when we play against them on
Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   Unless there's a warm-up we don't know about, Andre, the Fiesta
Bowl game will be played Friday.</TE>

<LD>Seven football players from the Southland, including Glenn Davis
Award winner Whitney Lewis of Ventura St. Bonaventure, will
participate in the third U.S. Army All-American Bowl on Saturday at
the Alamodome in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   "He has about 80 people in Texas, mostly relatives, who will get a
chance to see him play," St. Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack said of
Lewis' decision to play in the all-star game.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, a wide receiver recently selected the top player in the
Southland by The Times, will be joined by wide receiver Steve Smith
from Woodland Hills Taft, tight end Chris Barrett and offensive guard
Sam Baker from Tustin, offensive tackle Drew Radovich from Mission
Viejo, defensive lineman Matthew Malele from Carson and Quintin
Daniels from Los Angeles Loyola.</LD>
<TE>   The game features 78 of the top high school football players from
around the country in an East vs. West format and will be televised
live by ESPN2, beginning at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's game, Lorenzo Booker, also of St. Bonaventure,
carried 12 times for 66 yards and two touchdowns to help the West to
a 26-6 victory before a crowd of 17,185.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the West won the inaugural game, 18-15, behind the play
of Dominic Robinson, a defensive back from Diamond Bar, who was named
the game's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   -- Bob Rohwer</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Rooney of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame has been selected the
football coach of the year by CalHi Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, in his 23rd season at Notre Dame, led the Knights to a
14-0 season and the Southern Section Division IV championship. Since
1994, when Notre Dame last won a section title, Rooney's teams have
gone 102-13-1, winning at least 10 games each season.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney was also named The Times' coach of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Coley Candaele of Carpinteria was chosen coach of the year for
small schools and Tom St. Jacques of Susanville Lassen was selected
for medium schools.</TE>
<TE>   Candaele, a former championship quarterback for Carpinteria in
1989, is 51-24-2 since taking over his alma mater in 1989. The
Warriors finished 14-0 and won the Division XI title.</TE>
<TE>   St. Jacques took the Lassen job in 1995 after serving as an
offensive coordinator at Corona High. In seven seasons, he is 67-22.
Lassen has a 24-game winning streak and captured the Northern Section
title with St. Jacques' son, Shawn, at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Loumena</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the Woodland Hills El Camino Real girls' soccer
team came away with the Hart tournament championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Conquistadores, two-time defending City Section champions,
defeated Crescenta Valley, 2-1, on Saturday, on a goal in the 15th
minute by Kandice McLaughlin and by a second-half goal by freshman
Katie Oakes.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, the Conquistadores (9-1-2) redeemed themselves
after Santa Monica took the title from them last year in a
penalty-kick shootout.</TE>
<TE>   "What's been funny is, my assistant [Shanna Sarris] has been
telling the girls all week, 'If you don't win, you're going to be
running. I'm not going to be talking to you.... so you better go out
there and win this thing this time,' " said Scott Holloway, in his
fourth season as El Camino Real's coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have to do anything. I just kind of sat back and
watched."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the season, the Conquistadores lost to North Torrance,
2-0, in the South Torrance tournament final while playing without
several players who were on family vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway was nonetheless pleased with the play of junior outside
back Jennifer Stadheim, who entered the South Torrance tournament as
a reserve.</TE>
<TE>   She is now a starter, and Holloway said he plans to keep her
there.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Kate Hutchinson of Pullman (Wash.), the seventh-best returning
discus thrower in the nation with a best of 160 feet 5 inches, has
transferred to San Clemente, where she will be coached by Hugo de
Groot.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, under the guidance of de Groot, Natalie Kaaiahawia of
Fullerton set the still-standing national high school shot put record
of 53-7 3/4.</TE>
<TE>   Kaaiahawia also had a best of 174-9 in the discus, a mark that
still ranks in the top 20 all time.</TE>

<LD>It's time to dust off my crystal ball and take a look at what the new
year has in store for high school sports. The images are becoming
clear:</LD>
<LD>   Running back Terrell Jackson of Corona Centennial, who scored 50

higher level than any freshman quarterback seen in the last 10 years
at the varsity level.</TE>

John Barnes, if he can have a raise in his allowance after the
Griffins defeat Newhall Hart in their season opener.</TE>

with the Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Golfer Scott Hoch of Granada Hills will play like his namesake on

<TE>   The only way to prevent Mater Dei from winning the Division II

<HD>Murray Faces Tough Choice</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a dilemma Coach Andy Murray wished he didn't have.</LD>
<LD>   "You wonder how hard you can skate the guys in practice," said
Murray, who had nine injured regulars not in the lineup Monday
against Chicago. "We've consistently have had five guys out of the
lineup and four or five others that are hurting, so you don't want to
work them in practice.... It's a real catch-22 this year."</LD>
<LD>   Although the NHL was forced into a condensed schedule last season
because of an Olympic break, Murray said he feels the Kings' schedule
for the first three months of this season has been tougher.</LD>
<TE>   "We think that we work hard most days and some days you want to do
a little bit extra," Murray said. "But I am not a big believer in
punishment skates when you put the puck away and skate for 45 minutes
and bag your team for the next week.</TE>
<TE>   "You're trying to make a point, but I think those bag skates come
back to haunt you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Lubomir Vishnovsky, who sat out Sunday's loss at
Colorado because of flu-like symptoms, returned to the lineup Monday.
But the Kings still played without Bryan Smolinski (eye), Alexander
Frolov (cheek), Jason Allison (knee), Adam Deadmarsh (dizziness),
Eric Belanger (back), Erik Rasmussen (back), Aaron Miller (foot),
Steve Heinze (post-concussion) and Ken Belanger (post-concussion).</TE>

<HD>Kings Are Powerless in a 2-0 Loss</HD>
<DH>L.A. falls for fourth time in five games, despite
outshooting the Blackhawks, 33-14.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the injury-plagued Kings didn't think they had problems before,
their view may be a little different this morning after a 2-0 loss to
the Chicago Blackhawks Monday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   In one of their more disappointing losses, the Kings outshot the
Blackhawks, 33-14, but could not get the puck past goaltender Jocelyn
Thibault as they suffered their fourth defeat in five games before
18,118, their 11th sellout.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a tough game Sunday [a 6-1 loss at Colorado] and we came
out hard tonight, showing [the Blackhawks] that we were ready to
play," winger Craig Johnson said about the Kings, who had an 18-2
edge in shots in the first period.</LD>
<TE>   "A couple of breaks here or there on one of our chances in the
first period and it's a different game."</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings, who played without nine injured players, including
Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh, Bryan Smolinski, Eric Belanger and
Aaron Miller, had their four-game home winning streak come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   It got so bad for Coach Andy Murray, who had to go with a lineup
filled with recent minor-league call-ups, he pulled starting
goaltender Felix Potvin after he gave up his second goal early in the
third period.</TE>
<TE>   "They're NHL guys now," Murray said about such players as Jerred
Smithson and Jared Aulin, who made their Kings' debut this month.
"We've had games before where we had all types of chances with Jason
Allison and Adam Deadmarsh in the lineup and we haven't won. It was
one of those situations tonight."</TE>
<TE>   After losing by five goals to the Avalanche on Sunday, the
patchwork Kings fired shot after shot at Thibault, but the Chicago
goaltender was up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   At one point nearly nine minutes into the first period, the Kings
held a 13-1 advantage in shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had their best chance to score late in the period with a
two-man advantage for nearly a minute -- thanks to consecutive
penalties on Mark Bell and Lyle Odelein -- but came up empty.</TE>
<TE>   With Chicago's Theo Fleury in the penalty box for cross-checking
Ian Laperriere with 34.9 seconds remaining in the first, Los Angeles
opened the second period on a power-play but again came up
empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after Fleury's penalty ended, Chicago defenseman Nathan
Dempsey charged up ice with the puck while fighting off a back-check.
From the right circle, Dempsey got off a shot that squeezed by Potvin
to give the Blackhawks a 1-0 lead 2:21 into the second.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings struggled to regain control for the remainder of the
period but they did receive a lift from hard-working forward Derek
Armstrong, who drew a penalty on Chicago captain Alex Zhamnov for
holding at 12:27. But again, the Kings' power-play was powerless
against Thibault.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, which had not lost at Staples Center since a 4-2
setback to Columbus on Dec. 5, gave up a goal to Chicago right wing
Steve Sullivan early in the third to give the Blackhawks a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's goal was set up by a great play from defenseman Eric
Daze.</TE>
<TE>   By holding on to the puck for as long as he could, Daze was able
to entice King defenseman Mathieu Schneider and Potvin to him before
delivering a pass to Sullivan, who scored easily from the right side
of the crease 56 seconds into the period.</TE>

<LD>Thursday, vs. Philadelphia, 7 p.m., Fox Sports Net, ESPN2 -- Coach
Ken Hitchcock has done a good job turning the Flyers into one of the
best defensive teams in the league, giving up only 75 goals heading
into Monday's game at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, vs. Dallas, 7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net -- Former King
assistant Dave Tippett has coached the Stars into first place in the
Pacific Division, thanks to a dominating 11-1-3-1 home record. But
Dallas has struggled on the road (8-9-6) and already been shut out
twice by the Kings this season.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, at Minnesota, 5 p.m., Fox Sports Net -- Wild Coach Jacques
Lemaire continues to rotate goaltenders Dwayne Roloson and Manny
Fernandez and they have responded with the third-best combined
goals-against average at 2.11. Forward Marian Gaborik is one of the
game's best young talents and he leads Minnesota in goals and points.
The Kings lost to Minnesota, 5-2, at Staples Center on Nov. 4 and
tied the Wild, 2-2, at Minnesota on Nov. 19.</LD>

<HD>Some Holiday Cheer? At Least O'Neal Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twelve Lakers gathered at their El Segundo gym Monday morning, five
days before their next game, and Coach Phil Jackson put one hour on
the scoreboard on the far wall.</LD>
<LD>   He told them to do as they saw fit -- weights, basketball,
whatever -- and when the buzzer sounded, well, he'd see them all on
Thursday morning. Then he started the clock.</LD>
<LD>   By noon, half the parking lot was empty and Shaquille O'Neal was
standing before the opened door of his unmarked, souped-up,
crime-fighting Ford Taurus, saying, "Gotta go. Some of us hafta work
for a living."</LD>
<TE>   Port Authority business, apparently. As he left the lot, he gave
the siren a little twist, thrilling the autograph seekers who gather
at the gate every day, no matter the conditions. No signatures, but
at least they got blared at.</TE>
<TE>   Before he left, O'Neal had said he was feeling a bit more
optimistic about the team, that his toe hurt but it wasn't anything
he couldn't handle, and that there would be no immediate honeymoon
for him and bride Shaunie Nelson, because, "being with her is a
honeymoon in itself."</TE>
<TE>   He grinned.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said the short-term goal was to be back to .500 (for the
first time since they were 2-2) by the All-Star break, a modification
of Robert Horry's prediction of .500 by the end of January.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to get my guys on track," he said. "The last two
games, we've started to look better. Hopefully, this is the start of
something."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In their longest break of the season, the Lakers don't play until
Saturday night in Phoenix. Jackson said he hoped the time would allow
Horry and Brian Shaw to regain their legs, Samaki Walker to recover
from tonsillitis and Devean George's sore ankle to heal.</TE>
<TE>   Walker was said to be improved Monday and there was hope he would
practice Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, rookie Kareem Rush has played 40 minutes at shooting
guard in the last two games while Shaw has played 14, and Tracy
Murray has played 24 minutes at small forward, some of them in place
of George.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he thought Shaw, at 36, needed the down time. George
twice has sprained the same ankle, and Jackson fears old doubts are
beginning to cloud his game.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that Tracy's right on his back now," Jackson said. "He's
got to behave [within the system]. If he's going to have that posture
and mind-set out there, he's going to lose his place on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   George is important because he is young and athletic on a roster
that often has looked slow en route to its 13-19 record.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he would avoid lineups that make the Lakers
vulnerable to high-energy, quick-tempo teams. Thus, the rush to Rush
and the surge in minutes for power forward Mark Madsen, who plays
frantically.</TE>
<TE>   He said if his forwards could not provide that energy, he would
look harder outside the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time we've got to go," Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Finishes Season in Style</HD>
<DH>Rams defeat the San Francisco 49ers, 31-20, by rallying for
28 points in the fourth quarter after gaining only 33 yards in the
first half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>In their season finale, the St. Louis Rams looked more like defending
NFC champions than the underachievers who finished two games below
.500.</LD>
<LD>   Dre' Bly returned a fumble 20 yards for a touchdown and the Rams
scored 28 fourth-quarter points to go out as winners, defeating the
playoff-bound San Francisco 49ers, 31-20, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish we'd have played a little better in the first half," Ram
Coach Mike Martz said. "But what the heck."</LD>
<TE>   Bly stripped Garrison Hearst after a screen pass for the first
scoring return this season by the Rams (7-9).</TE>
<TE>   "It ended the season in a perfect way," Bly said. "It's a
tremendous way to finish and it's a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The NFC West-champion 49ers (10-6) played a game of keep-away in
the first half, taking a 17-0 lead in a tune-up for a wild-card
playoff game against the New York Giants on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 33 yards at halftime," Martz said. "I was getting ready to
check the paper to look for a job."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Rams rallied against a 49er defense largely manned by
backups.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach you want to keep playing, put the pedal to the metal
so to speak," Coach Steve Mariucci said. "Then there is the side of
you, in the back of your mind, that says, 'Get these guys fresh and
healthy and not produce any more injuries for the next game.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Martin, who didn't start because of a bruised left knee that
kept him out of three practices last week, hit Brandon Manumaleuna
for a six-yard touchdown pass and Isaac Bruce for a 26-yard score
that cut the Rams' gap to three points with 7:09 to go.</TE>
<TE>   On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Bly put them over the
top.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst's fumble with 2:51 to go, forced by Leonard Little and
recovered by Dexter McCleon at the St. Louis 49, finished off the
49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who completed 22 of 35 passes for 245 yards and a
career-best three touchdowns, tacked on a 32-yard scoring pass to
Ernie Conwell with 1:53 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Garcia opened by directing the league's longest-lasting drive
of the year, with the 49ers chewing up 12:07 on a 20-play, 81-yard
march capped by Jeff Chandler's 19-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom-used quarterback Tim Rattay then took over, throwing
touchdown passes of two and 27 yards to Tai Streets for a 17-0
halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers had the ball for nearly two-thirds of the first half,
19:29 to 10:31 for the Rams, and outgained them, 224 yards to 33.</TE>
<TE>   The opening drive surpassed one of 10:04 by Jacksonville in the
first week of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun," Rattay said. "It was good to get out there and move
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco dominated in the first half without two offensive
linemen nursing minor ankle injuries, guard Ron Stone and tackle
Derrick Deese. The 49ers also were without receiver Terrell Owens,
who sat out the last two games because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams got 23 of their 33 first-half yards on two completions
from Martin to Torry Holt near the end of the half. Martin had a pass
intercepted by Ronnie Heard at the 49er 19 to end the brief threat
with 10 seconds to go.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota Gives Arkansas the Boot</HD>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>If Minnesota Coach Glen Mason had his way, Dan Nystrom would not have
been named the most valuable player of the Music City Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Nystrom tied an NCAA record by kicking five field goals Monday as
Minnesota upset No. 25 Arkansas, 29-14, for the Golden Gophers' first
bowl victory since 1985.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish he was standing next to me and we were scoring touchdowns.
I've got a lot of respect for this guy. He's had some slumps and he's
had periods where he kicked well," Mason said of the senior kicker.
"He had a great day today."</LD>
<TE>   The Gophers (8-5) had lost three consecutive bowls since defeating
Clemson in the 1985 Independence Bowl. They entered the game having
blown their best start since 1961 by losing their final four games of
the regular season and finishing seventh in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas (9-5), the Southeastern Conference's Western Division
champ, was seeking its first 10-win season since going 10-2 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   But Minnesota, with only two senior starters, dominated the
Razorbacks. Arkansas is 1-10 in its last 11 bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   The Gophers controlled the ball and forced four turnovers,
including two interceptions by senior cornerback Michael Lehan.</TE>
<TE>   Asad Abdul-Khaliq threw for a touchdown in the third quarter and
Thomas Tapeh added a 33-yard run in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "If Danny wasn't on the top of his game, then it would've been a
lot tougher to win," said Abdul-Khaliq, who was 16 of 31 for 216
passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   Nystrom had kicks of 24, 45, 21 and 22 yards in the first half for
a 12-7 halftime lead and added a 29-yarder in the fourth. His first
three kicks made him the Big Ten Conference's career field-goal
leader, passing Travis Dorsch, who had 68 at Purdue.</TE>

<HD>Trail Blazer Streak Reaches Eight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rasheed Wallace heading to the bench in the opening seconds wasn't
exactly how the Portland Trail Blazers wanted to start their quest
for an eighth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, though, it didn't matter.</LD>
<LD>   After picking up two fouls in the first 42 seconds, Wallace came
back to score 19 points, and Bonzi Wells had 17 as the Trail Blazers
beat the Detroit Pistons, 85-74, Monday night at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't want to have Rasheed on the bench like that, but we
responded," Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks said. "Zach Randolph came
in and did a great job. That's how he has been pretty much all year.
He has stepped up and responded when we needed him."</TE>
<TE>   Portland blew a 13-point third-quarter lead, allowing Detroit to
tie the score at 68-68 with 8:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers then scored the next 15 points, holding the
Pistons scoreless for over six minutes. Wallace and Dale Davis each
had four points in the run, and three other players scored.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, when adversity strikes, we are coming together like a
family," Wells said. "I'm just a role player; Rasheed's our guy. I
work off him, and whatever I can do to help him, I'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 110, Dallas 107 -- Tim Thomas made a three-pointer from
the left corner with 9.9 seconds left at Dallas and the Bucks rallied
from a 17-point second-quarter deficit to hand the Mavericks their
second home defeat of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki, who matched his career high with 40 points, made
two free throws with 2.9 left to cut the deficit to 109-107, but
Thomas made one of two free throws with 2.6 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 107, Toronto 85 -- Andrei Kirilenko scored 20 points and
blocked five shots at Salt Lake City and the Jazz handed the Raptors
their seventh straight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone led Utah, which won for the fifth time in six games,
with 24 points in 28 minutes. Matt Harpring had 11 points and 10
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 79, Denver 77 -- Desmond Mason scored 23 points and Gary
Payton had 21 at Seattle to lead the SuperSonics over the Nuggets,
who lost their 10th in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Anderson's jumper from the corner made it 73-67 with 2:13
left, and Mason's two free throws gave Seattle a 79-73 lead with 7.2
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 112, Washington 95 -- Michael Jordan had 21 points, nine
assists and eight rebounds in his final regular-season game in
Orlando, Fla., but Tracy McGrady scored 32 points as the Magic beat
the Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Garrity had 21 points off the bench and Mike Miller had 20 for
Orlando, which has won five of its last six. Darrell Armstrong had
eight points and 11 assists, leading the Magic bench to a 47-23
scoring edge over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 102, Cleveland 88 -- Kenyon Martin celebrated his 25th
birthday with 28 points and 10 rebounds at East Rutherford, N.J., and
the Nets tied a franchise record with their 13th straight home win.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd had 17 points and 10 assists and Richard Jefferson had
19 points for the Nets, who have won seven in a row overall and 18 of
19 at the Continental Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 93, Atlanta 84 -- Eddie Jones scored 23 points and Travis
Best had 20, including four three-pointers to lead the Heat at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Caron Butler scored 21 as Miami won for the sixth time in
eight games. It was the first loss for Atlanta under new Coach Terry
Stotts, who replaced the fired Lon Kruger on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   New York 96, San Antonio 95 -- Allan Houston scored 28 points,
including the game-winning free throws with 5.4 seconds left at New
York, and Michael Doleac had a season-high 16 to lead the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan, who had 31 points and 17 rebounds, made a short jumper
while being fouled with 6.8 seconds left. His free throw gave the
Spurs a 95-94 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 104, Phoenix 98 -- Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 14
rebounds at Minneapolis and the Timberwolves ended the Suns'
five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Amare Stoudemire had a season-high 38 points and had 14
rebounds for the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 104, Philadelphia 98 -- Jason Richardson scored 26
points, including four free throws in the final minute, and the
Warriors won at Oakland for their third straight win.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson missed four shots in the last 2:16 and had his
second consecutive poor shooting game, finishing eight for 23 for 23
points. The 76ers have lost six in a row on the road.</TE>

<LD>Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb has been exercising on
his broken right ankle and may be ready for the divisional playoffs
in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb, who earlier this season signed a $115-million contract,
broke his ankle on the third play of Philadelphia's 38-14 victory
over Arizona Nov. 17. He played the rest of that game but has been
sidelined since.</LD>
<LD>   "[McNabb has] been running around and throwing the football, and
he'll continue to get better," Coach Andy Reid said Monday. "It's not
a guarantee, obviously, that he plays in the game. He's going to give
it his best shot."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are counting on Brad Johnson for the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jon Gruden said that he expects his starting quarterback to
practice this week and return to the lineup when the Buccaneers
(12-4) play host an NFC divisional playoff game the weekend of Jan.
11-12.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has sat out because of a severe lower back bruise,
although some reports said Johnson might have a cracked vertebrae.
Gruden said those reports were inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Smith has been talked out of retirement three sacks short of
the NFL record. For now, at least.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year veteran had planned to announce his retirement but
postponed his plans after meeting with Washington Redskin owner Dan
Snyder, defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis and Gerry Snyder, the
owner's father and partner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Raider tight end Roland Williams might play in the
postseason despite a serious knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee, a complete tear of the medial collateral ligament and
possible meniscus damage.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bill Callahan said that the team's trainers believe Williams
could be ready when the AFC's top-seeded team opens the playoffs in
two weeks. No surgery is scheduled, but Williams would probably need
to wear some sort of a protective brace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Lion cornerback Todd Lyght retired one day after his 12th
NFL season ended. Lyght, 33, spent his first 10 seasons with the Los
Angeles-St. Louis Rams, helping the Rams win the Super Bowl during
the 1999 season, before signing with the Lions as a free agent two
years ago.</TE>

<HD>Brodeur Strong Again for Devils</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Brodeur is still the strongest part of the New Jersey Devils'
stingy defense.</LD>
<LD>   Brodeur made 33 saves in recording his fourth shutout of the
season as the Devils beat the Boston Bruins, 1-0, Monday night at
Boston. He is 17th on the NHL career list with 59 shutouts.</LD>
<LD>   "The Devils don't have a weak blue-liner back there and they go
six deep," Bruin captain Joe Thornton said. "It's tough when they
score that first goal because Brodeur plays the puck so well that it
limits your offense."</LD>
<TE>   Brodeur began this season with a 2.21 goals-against average, the
lowest in the modern era.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Pandolfo scored the only goal at 16:13 of the first period
when John Madden's shot from in close deflected off of Pandolfo's leg
and beat John Grahame.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Madden just shot the puck and backhanded it off my leg,"
Pandolfo said. "I'll take as many of those as I can get."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' best chance to score was with 2:54 left when Glen
Murray took a feed from Thornton and Brodeur made a blocker save
during a flurry in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough game, but we survived," Brodeur said. "These type
of games remind you that every little mistake, you might pay the
price."</TE>
<TE>   It is the third time the Devils have won 1-0 this season. New
Jersey has given up only 73 goals this season, the fewest in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Boston has won only two games since Dec 8th.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Philadelphia 1 -- Rookie Jonathan Cheechoo scored the
go-ahead goal from an improbable angle early in the third period at
San Jose, and Evgeni Nabokov made 24 saves to lead the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring only twice in his first 19 NHL games, Cheechoo has
scored key third-period goals in the Sharks' last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Edmonton 3 -- Daymond Langkow scored late in regulation
and again in overtime as the Coyotes won at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Burke made 31 saves to win for the second time in two games
since his return from an ankle sprain. Burke, who missed 29 games,
shut out Philadelphia on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Buffalo 3 -- Dainius Zubrus had a goal and an assist
at Washington in his return from the injured list and the Capitals
extended the Sabres' losing streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Jaromir Jagr broke a 2-2 tie early in the third period, and Mike
Grier and Ivan Ciernik also scored for Washington.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 2, Florida 1 -- Roman Hamrlik scored his second
goal of the game with 56.9 seconds left in overtime to give the
Islanders the victory at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders have won three straight, all at home. They took all
seven shots in overtime to move within one game of .500 (15-16-5-0).</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- Ilya Kovalchuk scored on a breakaway
with 20 seconds left in overtime at Pittsburgh to lift the Thrashers
to their first victory over the Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta had lost all 14 previous games against the Penguins since
joining the NHL three seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Ottawa 2 -- Bill Houlder broke a third-period tie at
Nashville with his first goal in 145 games to lift the Predators.</TE>
<TE>   Denis Arkhipov and Andy Delmore also scored for the Predators.
Houlder's game-winner came in his 200th consecutive game.</TE>

<LD>Judging from the last few weeks, NHL coaches are hired merely to be
fired -- unless you're Ted Nolan, who can't get hired in the first
place.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal of Atlanta's Curt Fraser last Thursday and the
Calgary Flames' hiring of former San Jose bench boss Darryl Sutter on
Saturday to replace Greg Gilbert were the latest maneuvers in the
game of musical coaching chairs. And after uttering the usual cliches
-- Atlanta General Manager Don Waddell said the Thrashers "got a good
guy fired and now they've got to perform," and Calgary General
Manager Craig Button declared Sutter is "perfect for our team," --
the Thrashers and Flames dutifully won their next games.</LD>
<LD>   Teams are 6-0-0 in the first game after a coaching change,
including interim coaches. Need two quick points? Can't dump a big
contract or pull off a deal? Fire the coach and get a win.</LD>
<TE>   Sutter has never missed the playoffs as a player or coach, and he
worked wonders in guiding the Sharks to higher point totals in five
straight seasons. But with the Flames, who were 11 points out of the
final West playoff spot when he took over, he has little depth or
offensive punch. Jarome Iginla, last season's NHL leader in goals
(52) and points (96), has struggled, and it will be tough for Sutter
to assemble two decent lines.</TE>
<TE>   "They can challenge teams in terms of work ethic," Sutter said,
perhaps identifying the only area in which they can hope to match
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Who's next? Bobby Francis of the flailing Phoenix Coyotes? Lindy
Ruff of the nearly bankrupt Buffalo Sabres? Barry Trotz of the
Nashville Predators, who have growing pains and shrinking crowds?
Rick Kehoe of the sputtering Pittsburgh Penguins? How about Mario
Lemieux as an owner, player and coach?</TE>
<TE>   As for Nolan, he interviewed for the Flame job and won several fan
polls but Calgary newspapers said he was eliminated because of a "bad
interview." Translation: He has been forever branded a back-stabber
and won't get another NHL job. The Thrashers will probably hire a
retread such as Terry Murray, who had lost his players' respect in
Philadelphia even before he'd said they were "in a choking situation"
facing a 3-0 deficit in the 1997 Stanley Cup finals. No matter who's
hired, if there's hockey after the 2004 labor negotiations and the
Thrashers are still in Atlanta, someday he'll be fired too.</TE>
<TE>   Coach in Training?</TE>
<TE>   After the Kings bought out his contract last summer and no one
else was interested in him, winger Nelson Emerson reluctantly
accepted the notion that his career was over.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was done, I wanted to sit back and take a year or two off
and play golf," he said, "but this is my life."</TE>
<TE>   He got a lifeline from the Kings about six weeks ago, when Coach
Andy Murray offered him a chance to scout opponents and watch King
games and practices to look for things that could help the team.
Emerson, 35, attends the coaches' meetings and occasionally offers
his observations. He's not getting paid, but he's finding the
experience invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be an outstanding coach someday," said Murray, who has
known Emerson since he played in Winnipeg and Murray was an assistant
coach there. "I think he could be coaching in this league next year
if he wants to. He's a real good hockey person.... He's very sharp.
He pre-scouted some games in Anaheim and did well. We're giving him a
taste of what it's like."</TE>
<TE>   If he can't play, this is the next-best thing. After seeing Tony
Granato go from the broadcast booth to an assistant coaching job and,
last week, the head coach's job in Colorado, Emerson appreciates the
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like it," said Emerson, who was glad he didn't have to
uproot his wife and four children from their Manhattan Beach home. "I
like going to the rink every day and being involved. The assistant
coaches have been wonderful and Andy's made me feel comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize now how much hard work assistant coaches put in, and
the amount of time they and Andy put in at the rink. It really opened
my eyes. I enjoy seeing how they organize practices and games. Who
knows where it will lead? It keeps my hand in the pot a little bit
and keeps my face out there. I never realized how much I liked the
game until I was away from it for a couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   No Bang for the Buck</TE>
<TE>   The New York Rangers are so awful, it's doubtful first-year coach
Bryan Trottier will finish out the season. Or that he should.</TE>
<TE>   They've been hammered by injuries to winger Pavel Bure, goalie
Mike Richter and defenseman Brian Leetch, but if the Rangers expected
the injury-prone Bure (knee surgery) to play a full season, they were
fooling themselves. Besides, which team hasn't lost a key player at
some point? Depth, discipline, and the ability to handle adversity
are the fundamentals of success, and the Rangers are glaringly short
in every department, despite a league-high $69.1-million payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Messier, a warrior but all but spent at nearly 42, is
averaging almost as much ice time as Eric Lindros. The Rangers are
2-8-1-1 in their last 12 games and are clueless defensively, which is
odd because Trottier was an outstanding defensive player and so were
assistant coaches Jim Schoenfeld and Terry O'Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   During a 6-1 loss to the Penguins on Thursday, Bobby Holik sank to
the level of slew-footing Lemieux, and he wasn't the only Ranger to
take a run at the NHL scoring leader. Playing a physical game is
fine, but Holik, with the tacit backing of Trottier, showed no
respect for the game, and that's despicable.</TE>
<TE>   Despite working with an apparently unlimited budget, General
Manager Glen Sather has lost the genius reputation he earned in
Edmonton. The Rangers are a mismatched bunch being guided by an
overmatched coach, and Sather, in overpaying players who lack
chemistry and structure, is the symbol of the spending excesses that
have many clubs forecasting trouble when the collective bargaining
agreement expires in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   The talk of the world junior tournament has been 5-foot-8,
185-pound forward Jordin Tootoo of Canada, a 2001 fourth-round pick
by Nashville who was the player of the game in Canada's 4-0 rout of
the Czechs on Saturday. Crowds love him for his punishing hits,
fearlessness and the way his name sounds when it's chanted. (Try it.
It sounds like a train buffs' convention). He's from Nunavut, an area
carved out of Canada's Northwest Territories, and grew up hunting
caribou and whales. He also sells caribou jerky (gulp) on his Web
site, www.teamtootoo.com.</TE>
<TE>   Mighty Duck winger Paul Kariya doesn't forget his friends. After
the Ducks' game at Chicago on Dec. 6, he took time to offer
encouragement to Blackhawk winger Theo Fleury, who had just returned
from a suspension for violating the terms of his substance-abuse
aftercare program. Kariya and Fleury were teammates on Canada's
triumphant Olympic team at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Theo since my second year in the league," Kariya said.
"We have the same agent [Don Baizley] and we always hang out at the
All-Star game," Kariya said. "I just told him to try to enjoy the
game again, to just go out and have some fun playing hockey."</TE>
<TE>   The Tom Barrasso experiment in St. Louis has come to a merciful
end. Barrasso, signed Nov. 4 while the Blues' goaltending depth was
thinned by injuries, played only six games and went on the disabled
list Nov. 29. With Brent Johnson's ankle strong enough for him to
play, the Blues jettisoned Barrasso.... Alexandre Daigle's comeback
attempt also appears over with his demotion to the American Hockey
League. Daigle, the first overall draft pick in 1993, was out of
hockey the last two seasons before the Penguins signed him as a free
agent this summer. He had a good start but faded fast.</TE>
<TE>   Landon Wilson's career-threatening eye injury has inspired Phoenix
General Manager Mike Barnett to advocate making visors mandatory for
players joining the NHL after a certain date, while allowing current
players to choose whether to wear eye protection. It's a noble aim,
but the NHL Players Assn. has resisted previous efforts by saying
equipment is a personal choice for each player. The real problem is
eliminating the Neanderthal thinking that anyone who wears a visor is
less than manly.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers are 1-6-4-1 in their last 12 home games,
hardly helping a dwindling fan base. After their 2-1 loss to the
Rangers on Saturday, Coach Mike Keenan hinted that shakeups were in
the offing because, "We played scared.... You can convince the people
you have to do it, or you can get people that will do it. And that's
an organizational decision." Keenan has turned around a variety of
teams and players, but he might have met his match.</TE>

<KH>OKLAHOMA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Stoops Is Not Open to Discuss Pro Job</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Oklahoma's final practice at Loyola Marymount on Monday, Coach
Bob Stoops found himself answering questions not about his team's
readiness, but about reports that he is considered a candidate for
the Jacksonville Jaguars' open coaching spot.</LD>
<LD>   Stoops refused to comment on what he characterized as innuendo and
rumor.</LD>
<LD>   "Usually about this time of year, all that junk starts," he said.
"I'm not even dealing with it. I'm talking about the Rose Bowl and
that's it."</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of which, Stoops said he was pleased with his players'
effort the last two days. The practices were brisk, he said, and no
one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing left to decide was a location for the team's
walk-through at the hotel today. Stoops said he was considering an
empty ballroom or a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's emphasis has shifted toward running back Quentin
Griffin and the ground attack this season.</TE>
<TE>   The running game accounted for half of the team's yards this fall,
a big change from 2001 when the Sooners were heavily weighted toward
the pass.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's offensive line is all in favor of the change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot easier attacking than it is retreating for pass
protection," center Vince Carter said. "That's what you want to do,
run 30 times a game."</TE>
<TE>   The surprising part is, the team's receivers seem to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "While my receiving numbers are down, I feel like I'm playing the
best football of my life," tight end Trent Smith said. "I'm proud of
myself for the way I've learned to block."</TE>
<TE>   Even smaller guys, such as 6-foot, 180-pound receiver Curtis
Fagan, have been getting into the act.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a block that frees Quentin for 60 yards, you feel
good," he said. "That's like catching a big pass."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Teddy Lehman has a national reputation as an
All-American and anchor of the Sooner defense, but it wasn't always
that way.</TE>
<TE>   Playing high school football in Fort Gibson, Okla., Lehman wasn't
recruited by many schools and figured he needed to make the rounds of
summer camps to get noticed.</TE>
<TE>   His first stop was Oklahoma, where he introduced himself to
co-defensive coordinator Brent Venables before the players ran
40-yard sprints.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think you're going to run?" Venables asked.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman said 4.4 seconds, easily. The coach didn't believe him,
suggesting that 4.6 might be a more reasonable guess for a
linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "If I run a 4.6," Lehman shot back, "I'll quit football."</TE>
<TE>   Venables liked the cockiness in that answer. He liked it even more
when Lehman ran a 4.4 not once but twice. The small-town kid walked
away from camp with a scholarship offer.</TE>

<LD>Two days after meeting with O.J. Simpson, USC players seemed
unaffected by the stir it caused back home.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't heard any negative reaction," said Justin Fargas, who
met Simpson for lunch after Saturday's practice. "I don't see what
the big deal is. I looked at him like a former football player, one
of my heroes."</LD>
<LD>   Simpson, who showed up at Fargas' invitation, shook hands and
signed autographs during the practice. His appearance drew the ire of
many who feel he was wrongly acquitted of the double murder of Nicole
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to understand, to us, he's just a former star," Fargas
said. "To me, he's a great running back who can teach me some things.
I think most of us are too young to see him in any other way."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas said they discussed running techniques during the lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to find out what made him such a great running back," he
said. "I didn't ask him anything else. I didn't care about anything
else."</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer, whose photograph with Simpson also caused a stir,
agreed with Fargas.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome seeing him," Palmer said. "I remember him as a
football star and a movie star, as a celebrity, nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   USC officials said that once Simpson began walking into their
practice facility unannounced -- and once players saw him and started
cheering -- they had little choice but to admit him.</TE>
<TE>   They said they wished he had stayed away. But once he arrived,
they felt it would have caused a bigger scene to escort him out in
front of players who were in grade school at the time of his trial.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This is USC's third bowl-game appearance since Malaefou MacKenzie
began his Trojan career in 1997. But it is the first bowl experience
for the sixth-year senior running back.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie suffered a season-ending knee injury in the 1998 opener
against Purdue and did not accompany the Trojans to El Paso for the
Sun Bowl. USC lost to Texas Christian, 28-19.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie missed last season's 10-6 Las Vegas Bowl defeat against
Utah because he left the team at midseason after his father's death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been pretty awesome," MacKenzie said. "I don't think I
missed much in El Paso."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Trojans went through their workout Monday, injured
defensive tackle Shaun Cody and cornerback Ronald Nunn continued
their rehabilitation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Both players had season-ending knee surgery, Nunn after the third
game against Kansas State, Cody after the sixth game against
California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to not be out there on the field," Cody said while
icing his knee on the trainers' table. "Guys always shoot the jokes
my way. 'You just came for the vacation,' they say.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK. It's part of the deal. I used to do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Nunn said he would be ready to participate in noncontact drills
during spring practice. Cody will not return until training camp in
August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu missed part of Monday's practice
to receive treatment on his left hamstring. Polamalu said the problem
has nagged him throughout the season. Polamalu eventually returned
and finished the workout.</TE>
<TE>   He received more treatment afterward.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans attended the NBA game between the Miami Heat and
Atlanta Hawks. They will have a New Year's Eve celebration tonight at
the team hotel.</TE>

<HD>Pollard Has Been Waiting for This</HD>
<DH>USC linebacker has had injuries and missed opportunities,
but final game of his college career will be his most important.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Mike Pollard and USC Coach Pete Carroll are counting the days.</LD>
<LD>   Pollard is calm, Carroll nervous.</LD>
<LD>   Pollard, the Trojans' rickety and resourceful middle linebacker,
knows his football career will probably end on Thursday in the Orange
Bowl game against Iowa.</LD>
<TE>   Carroll, with his linebacker corps thinned by injury, hopes the
quiet senior can weather two more practices to get there. Last
season, Pollard was hurt on the eve of the Las Vegas Bowl and had
knee surgery for the third time in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about it," Pollard said after Monday's practice.
"I'm going to play, and play well, in the Orange Bowl. I can't think
of a better way for this story to end."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard's tale is full of twists and turns, three of which landed
him on the operating table. But for the last two seasons, he has been
right in the middle of the Trojans' resurgence into a national power.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker coach Nick Holt said Pollard, "is always in the right
place at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case before Carroll arrived in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, 6 feet, 225 pounds, played behind junior Chris Claiborne
as a freshman in 1998 and, after missing the 1999 season because of
knee surgery, could not crack a 2000 lineup that included seniors
Zeke Moreno and Markus Steele. All three former Trojans play for NFL
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard said he was buried, "deep in the archives," by former
coach Paul Hackett and his staff after tearing knee ligaments during
spring practice in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a blessing in disguise that I got injured when I did," he
said. "I needed Coach Carroll to come in and give me a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, who had surgery on his right knee during his junior year
at Long Beach Poly High, was originally recruited by former coach
John Robinson and signed a letter of intent with USC in 1997. But he
did not qualify academically and attended Cypress College.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurt not being able to play," he said. "But it's what you do
with adversity. You just have to overcome it."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard improved his test scores and enrolled at USC in the spring
of 1998, three months after Hackett had replaced Robinson. Pollard
learned at the knee of Claiborne, the Butkus Award winner, and
appeared on track to compete for a starting position in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Then he tore ligaments in his left knee during spring practice and
red-shirted after undergoing surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "That one was tough to take," he said. "I thought I was on the
verge of really making an impact."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard showed up overweight for spring practice in 2000, but
slimmed down by the time training camp started. It was not enough.
Moreno and Steele were entrenched and Kori Dickerson moved from end
to strong-side linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, angry that he was not playing, took his frustration out
on the first-unit offense. He wound up on special teams, played in
seven games and made only two tackles.</TE>
<TE>   One of those hits, however, left an impression.</TE>
<TE>   When Carroll replaced Hackett, he began evaluating players by
watching tape.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught a play Michael made on special teams where he just lit
up a guy," Carroll said. "From that moment on, my thinking was,
'Somebody who could do what he did has got something special.' So we
went about finding it."</TE>
<TE>   Holt remembered Pollard as an extraordinary high school player.
But like almost all of the linebackers Holt inherited, Pollard's
college game experience was limited. His desire was not.</TE>
<TE>   "When the new staff came in, I think Mike saw some light at the
end of the tunnel and said, 'Hey, this is my shot,' " Holt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard played weak-side linebacker during spring practice, then
displaced Aaron Graham as the No. 1 middle linebacker a few days into
training camp. Last season, he made 81 tackles, second on the team
behind safety Troy Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   "And then," he said shaking his head, "another knee injury."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard was still recovering from arthroscopic surgery when
training camp began last August. Through the first five games, he
played below the level of the previous season.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Trojans' 30-27 overtime loss at Washington State on
Oct. 5, Pollard returned to form. Flanked by All-Pacific 10
Conference performer Matt Grootegoed on the strong side and talented
transfer Melvin Simmons on the weak side, Pollard helped the Trojan
defense stifle its next seven opponents.</TE>
<TE>   He tied his season high with six tackles in the regular-season
finale against Notre Dame and also intercepted the first pass of his
career as the Trojans completed a 10-2 regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "He plays his best in big games," Holt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard's performance against Iowa is considered key for USC.
Freshman Oscar Lua, who backed up Pollard and replaced him in certain
situations, injured his knee during an early bowl practice and had
surgery last week.</TE>
<TE>   That means Pollard will play more snaps when the Trojans meet the
Hawkeyes at Pro Player Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard said Carroll should stop fretting.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you kidding?" he said. "I wouldn't miss this one for the
world."</TE>

<HD>MacPherson Goes Out Throwing</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>For his last game at Wake Forest, James MacPherson was grateful that
the game plan called for a bit more passing than usual.</LD>
<LD>   MacPherson completed nine of 16 passes for a season-high 241 yards
and two touchdowns, and the normally grounded Demon Deacons defeated
Oregon, 38-17, Monday in the Seattle Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "Going into the game, I knew there were going to be opportunities
to throw a couple of deep passes on them, and maybe score a few
touchdowns," the senior said. "Luckily, we were able to do that."</LD>
<TE>   MacPherson, who also ran for a touchdown, connected with Jason
Anderson on touchdown passes of 57 and 63 yards, helping Wake Forest
(7-6) finish with a winning record for the second consecutive year.
The Demon Deacons last had consecutive winning seasons in 1987 and
1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't ask for a better game to finish out my career here at
Wake Forest," MacPherson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks (7-6) started 6-0 and were ranked as high as No. 6, but
they weren't the same without quarterback Joey Harrington, a 2001
Heisman finalist now with the Detroit Lions. The team lost five of
its last six a year after finishing 11-1 and winning the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Seattle Bowl, Wake Forest was ranked eighth in the
nation in rushing, averaging 239.9 yards. The Demon Deacons ran for
256 against yards against Oregon, even with their early emphasis on
passing.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon starter Jason Fife completed only one of seven passes for
four yards before he was replaced late in the first quarter by
redshirt freshman Kellen Clemens, who completed 19 of 31 passes for
161 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon tailback Onterrio Smith, who sat out three of the last four
games because of a knee injury that required surgery in late
November, had 62 yards in 18 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest defensive end Calvin Pace remained one sack short of
the school record of 30 set by Mike McCrary.</TE>

<HD>Romario Still Hopes to Play for Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While World Cup titleholder Brazil is set to end its championship
year without a coach, an icon from the team's past is holding out
hope of playing again for the champions.</LD>
<LD>   Romario, who turns 37 next month, has missed out on the last two
World Cups and last two Olympic games. Not that he's bitter.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't let it get to me anymore," Romario told Reuters.
"Whatever comes along from now will be a bonus."</LD>
<TE>   Since leading Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title with five goals,
Romario has had a bittersweet international career. A calf muscle
injury cost him the 1998 World Cup and then-Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari
left him off the 2002 team, which caused a great outcry among
Romario's fans, who considered him to be Brazil's best striker at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   A tearful public plea from Romario, who was also left off Brazil's
1996 and 2000 Olympic teams, failed to sway Scolari, who stepped down
as coach in early August.</TE>
<TE>   Romario, who won a silver medal with Brazil in the 1988 Olympics,
scored 15 goals and led Fluminense to the Brazilian semifinals this
year. But his six-month contract is up.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to sort it out quickly because I miss playing football,"
he said, "and I want to keep playing."</TE>
<TE>   Keep Searching</TE>
<TE>   Since winning the World Cup, Brazil has split two friendlies,
falling 1-0 to Paraguay at home in Scolari's farewell, then defeating
host South Korea, 3-2, with Mario Zagallo, who led Brazil at the
1970, 1974 and 1998 World Cups, coaching in tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Among the people being mentioned most as Scolari's long-term
replacement: Santos Coach Emerson Leao, Corinthian Coach Carlos
Alberto Parreira, Sao Paulo Coach Oswaldo Oliveira and former Brazil
coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo.</TE>
<TE>   Leao coached Brazil before and was fired in 2001 by Brazilian
Federation President Ricardo Teixeira after only eight months.
Reuters reported that when Leao was asked if he would like to reclaim
the job, he said, "No, not with [Teixeira] in charge."</TE>
<TE>   Parreira led his club team to titles in the Rio-Sao Paulo
tournament and the Copa Brasil, and finished second to Santos in the
Brazilian championship. But he coached Brazil to the 1994 World Cup
championship and has said that he has had enough at that level.</TE>
<TE>   Oliveira, then, would seem to be the favorite by attrition.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian media are not discounting a comeback, of sorts, for
Luxemburgo, who was fired in disgrace after the 2000 Olympics. The
flashy Luxemburgo, known for wearing expensive jewelry and designer
suits, was told by a Congressional commission that his income was not
compatible with his profession and that his answers to the origins of
his wealth were not convincing.</TE>
<TE>   He has also since admitted that he used a fake birth certificate,
which made him three years younger and misspelled his first name as
Wanderley.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso Injured, Out</TE>
<TE>   Spanish leader Real Sociedad suffered a blow to its chances when
it was announced Monday that midfielder Xabi Alonso would be lost
four to six weeks because of an ankle injury he suffered playing for
a Basque team.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso, 21, strained ligaments in his right ankle Saturday against
Macedonia and, as a result, will sit out at least four league games,
including the heavily anticipated match against second-place Valencia
in mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   Report on Break</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Report will take a holiday hiatus and will not return
until an undetermined date. Some key events to keep in mind: The U.S.
women's national team will play a friendly against Japan on Jan. 12
in San Diego before playing in a four-team tournament in China
beginning Jan. 23 against Norway, Germany and China. The Mexican
women's team will play in a similar tournament beginning Jan. 26 in
Australia against South Korea, Sweden and Australia. The U.S. men's
team will play Canada on Jan. 18 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>

<HD>No Matter Who Starts, UC Irvine Keeps Winning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt, Eric Stephens,</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine continues to prove it's not whom you start, but how you
finish. Against Florida Atlantic on Monday night, the Anteaters
started a true freshman and a sophomore who recently completed a
two-year Mormon mission, but that didn't keep Irvine from winning for
the sixth time in seven games, 87-70, at Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Pat Douglass penciled freshman Mike Efevberha and sophomore
forward Greg Ethington into the starting lineup for the third
consecutive game and both responded with key points during an early
second-half run that put the game away.</LD>
<LD>   Ethington scored all four of his points on consecutive baskets
during a 10-0 run at the start of the second half that gave Irvine a
47-33 lead. After the Owls cut the deficit to 10, Efevberha, a guard,
made consecutive three-pointers to put the Anteaters ahead, 55-41,
with 14 minutes remaining.</LD>
<TE>   Efevberha and Ethington "give us more intensity defensively,"
Douglass said.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Parada, who fouled out in four of the first eight games,
finished with 13 points and six rebounds in 18 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (6-3) was unable to put Florida Atlantic away in the first
half, despite holding the Owls to 30% shooting. A big factor was the
performances at the free-throw line, where the Anteaters made just
three of 10 shots and Florida Atlantic made 16 of 19.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Portland 54, Long Beach State 49 -- Portland dealt the struggling
49ers their seventh consecutive loss, using a late 8-0 run to post a
nonconference victory before 1,632 at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   The losing streak is the longest for Long Beach (1-8) since it
dropped the final eight games of the 1986-87 season.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Darden's three-pointer gave the 49ers a 46-45 lead but it
would prove to be the last advantage as they had only one field goal
in the final 5:05.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Adam Quick's 12 points, Portland (6-5) scored its final
nine points at the free-throw line. The Pilots turned up their
defensive pressure after 49er point guard Darnell Thompson fouled
out.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, it was a bad day for the 49ers. Senior forward Lemi
Williams, who sat out last season after surgery to repair the tibia
in each leg, left the team because of lingering pain.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm dealing with more pain that I can take," Williams
said. "Basically, it's hard to even walk after practice or after a
game. After a game it takes me two days to recover."</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount 74, South Carolina St. 69 -- Andy Osborn scored
22 points as the Lions won the consolation game of the Holiday
Stores/Big R Classic at Bozeman, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (6-7) trailed by as many as nine points in the
first half. But the Lions closed the half with a 16-5 run and led,
32-31, at the break after Osborn's layup and free throw with 26
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina State (2-7) closed to within 65-63 on Dustin
Braddick's free throw with 2:47 left. But another layup by Osborn put
the Lions up by four.</TE>
<TE>   Thurman Zimmerman, who led the Bulldogs with 22 points, made a
jumper to close the gap to 67-65 at the 2:15 mark.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Ramsey made a shot off the glass to cut the lead to 69-67 with
1:50 remaining. A pair of free throws by Wes Wardrop at the 1:15 mark
and two more by Worthy with 23 seconds remaining put the Lions on
top, 73-67.</TE>
<TE>   Worthy finished the night with 13 points. Braddick scored 16 for
the Bulldogs.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Two Assistants Staying, Two Come With Dorrell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first four assistants hired by UCLA Coach Karl Dorrell are a
blend of the old and new. Gary Bernardi and Don Johnson were retained
and Jon Embree and Eric Bieniemy will leave the University of
Colorado staff to come to UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Bieniemy, 33, is a former Bishop Amat High and Colorado running
back who had a nine-year NFL career. He is Colorado's all-time
leading rusher and was third in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1990. He
will coach Bruin running backs, the same position he held at Colorado
the last two years. His oldest child has cerebral palsy and Bieniemy
and his wife have family in Southern California that can help with
his care.</LD>
<LD>   "This will take stress and pressure off my wife," he said. "But
it's my relationship with Karl that created this opportunity. It will
be an intriguing challenge to come to a prestigious university to
work with an African American coach in Los Angeles."</LD>
<TE>   Embree, 37, will become the UCLA receivers coach, the same
position he held at Colorado the last two years. He has also coached
tight ends and defensive ends. Like Bieniemy, Embree has had a long
friendship with Dorrell, who was the Colorado offensive coordinator
in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Bieniemy and Embree, who will start working at UCLA next week, are
enthusiastic coaches who are animated on the sidelines. "I like being
with the kids and helping them through the ebb and flow of the game,"
Embree said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardi, 48, will begin his 10th season as Bruin recruiting
coordinator and tight ends coach. He helped in the coaching
transition from Terry Donahue to Bob Toledo after the 1995 season and
now will do the same. "I feel like we are real compatible," Bernardi
said of Dorrell. "We have the same goals and desires."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 48, will begin his fourth season as defensive line coach.
His recruiting responsibilities include Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Retaining Johnson enhances the prospect of defensive tackle Rodney
Leisle returning for his senior season rather than jumping to the
NFL. The junior, who sat out several games because of a broken foot,
is enrolled for the spring quarter, which begins Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is in his best interest to come back next year and
play a full season, completely healthy," Johnson said. "We've got
mixed signals from him. He'll visit with me and Coach Dorrell and
make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Bernardi are devoting their time to recruiting. UCLA
has commitments from eight players and could sign as many as 20.
There are NCAA restrictions on recruiting until Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have about 10 recruits visit on Jan. 10-11," Bernardi
said. "After that, Karl will get out to meet recruits and committed
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell has five more spots to fill on his staff. Idaho Coach Tom
Cable, who met with Dorrell on Saturday to discuss the offensive
coordinator opening, said Monday he will not come to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Additional members of the current staff who might be retained are
Mark Weber, Todd Littlejohn and Ron Caragher.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult time," Bernardi said. "There is elation for Don
and I, but guys I worked with for a long time are out of a job.
Everybody knows the nature of the game. They are happy for me but the
misery of it is difficult."</TE>

<PH>ROSE BOWL / WASHINGTON STATE vs. OKLAHOMA</PH>
<KH>WASHINGTON STATE REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gesser's Injured Ankle Is Good Enough to Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington State's preparations for the Rose Bowl are essentially
complete, with only a walk-through in the hotel ballroom scheduled
for today.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Price called the final full session at the Coliseum on
Monday an "excellent, excellent practice" and assessed the status of
quarterback Jason Gesser's ankle.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he's 90%. He says 80," Price said. "It's as good as it's
going to get."</LD>
<TE>   Gesser suffered a high ankle sprain Nov. 23 against Washington,
and played against UCLA two weeks later at considerably less than
full speed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably 25% or 30%," Gesser said. (He still passed for 247
yards in a 48-27 victory.)</TE>
<TE>   Price said Gesser's diminished mobility isn't all bad.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to stay in the pocket a little more than he'd
like to," Price said. "He's kind of changed his style of play since
he's been injured, and been just as effective."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser's history of playing hurt -- with cracked and dislocated
ribs, the ankle sprain, etc. -- has been widely glorified.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, he had developed two new ailments: interview fatigue
and a stuffy nose.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he's got a cold. He can fight through that adversity," Price
said, noting that Gesser is receiving medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "He's good enough. I think we caught it early."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monday's practice also was Price's final full practice as
Washington State coach, something he's trying not to dwell on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not allowing any feelings about that right now. I can't look
at [offensive coordinator Mike] Levenseller's face without crying,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Price will be immersed in all things Alabama, including an
office a little more posh than the one to which he is accustomed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was walking around looking for the men's restroom, and they
said, 'Well, why don't you use the one in your office?' " Price said.</TE>
<TE>   "I opened the door and there's a little kitchen, a restroom, a big
meeting room. I felt like an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Devard Darling, a transfer from Florida State, will be
playing against Oklahoma in a bowl game for the second time.</TE>
<TE>   Darling was a special teams player for Florida State in the 2001
Orange Bowl, which Oklahoma won, 13-2, clinching the national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backup quarterback Matt Kegel, slowed somewhat by a sore back over
the weekend, has been pronounced ready to play if needed.</TE>

<LD>   Small teams of Special Forces soldiers and CIA paramilitary
officers targeted the enemy for U.S. warplanes while giving millions
of dollars in cash and weapons to proxy forces headed by commanders
of the Northern Alliance resistance. In a matter of weeks, the
Taliban and Al Qaeda were routed and a pro-American government was
installed. It was an improvised strategy that hitched U.S. combat
technology to Afghan boots on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the postwar phase of Operation Enduring Freedom is still
being improvised, but with less dramatic results and with long-term
success far from certain.</LD>
<TE>   As American policymakers lay plans for a possible invasion of
Iraq, the Afghan experience is a reminder that the toughest war is
often waged long after the fiercest combat ends. Even with the enemy
defeated on the battlefield, the fight to stabilize and rebuild a
fractured nation can be as draining as any battle fought with
infantry and warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. commanders in Afghanistan are being asked to direct an
ambitious effort at nation-building -- the ambiguous and taxing
Clinton-era policy ridiculed by candidate George W. Bush. The United
States is doubling the number of civil affairs officers assigned to
help build schools and clinics, dig wells and provide humanitarian
aid in a country where most people are illiterate and live in mud
huts.</TE>
<TE>   American combat units, meanwhile, are harassed almost daily by
haphazard rocket fire and hit-and-run attacks. Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters enjoy freedom of movement in the lawless tribal highlands of
Pakistan, aided by sympathizers in Afghanistan's rugged eastern
border regions. Though several top Al Qaeda leaders have been killed
or captured, Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar
are still at large.</TE>
<TE>   Like U.S. troops in Vietnam, American soldiers here find it
difficult to distinguish ordinary villagers from enemy operatives.
Lt. Col. Martin Schweitzer, a battalion commander in eastern
Afghanistan, says the enemy hides among civilians and spies on
American troop movements and methods from villages across the border
in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The operatives use cell phones, walkie-talkies, whistles and even
mirrors to warn confederates of U.S. combat patrols, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They may not have the same type education that we have, but they
are incredibly smart," Schweitzer said. "They are not chumps."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, security is tenuous. Two Afghan government
ministers have been assassinated; their killers remain free.
President Hamid Karzai, who has survived an assassination attempt, is
guarded by an American security detail. His government has yet to
extend its authority beyond Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military commitment is open-ended. Lt. Gen. Dan K.
McNeill, commander of coalition forces here, said it will probably be
18 months to two years before U.S. troop levels, now at about 8,000,
can begin to be reduced. He said he expects American forces to remain
in Afghanistan, at gradually diminishing levels, for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   A Year of Upheaval</TE>
<TE>   From reporting across Afghanistan over the past year, a portrait
emerges of an American effort that has produced profound changes in
the lives of ordinary Afghans but also has left a residue of
bitterness and mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   The oppressive Taliban regime has been overthrown. Al Qaeda
terrorist camps have been dismantled. Twenty-three years of war have
come to an end, and one of the world's poorest countries is inching
toward modernity.</TE>
<TE>   But a military campaign that began with a flourish has evolved
into a sometimes intrusive police action in a nation with a tradition
of fierce resistance to outsiders and a virtually endless supply of
weaponry. U.S. forces are seizing and destroying arms caches -- 1.5
million pounds so far -- but warlords' militias continue to rule by
the gun in the absence of government authority.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of airstrikes in the fall of 2001 that killed, by
various estimates, several hundred to a few thousand civilians, there
is lingering resentment of Americans -- especially in ethnically
Pushtun areas in the east and south. While Afghans express gratitude
to the United States for ridding the country of the Taliban and Al
Qaeda, some say they fear U.S. troops will become a long-term
occupying army like the Soviet forces that invaded more than 20 years
ago and remained for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Those misgivings have been compounded by American military support
for warlords, most of them Tajiks from the Northern Alliance who
helped defeat the Pushtun-dominated Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The Karzai government is dominated by Tajiks from the Panjshir
Valley, stirring further skepticism among Pushtuns about its
commitment to the stated U.S. goal of a democratic, multiethnic
government.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of popular sentiment is the photos hanging in
Afghanistan's many bazaars. Outside the capital, there are far more
photos of local warlords than of Karzai. Even inside Kabul, shops and
public spaces are dominated by photos not of the president but of
Ahmed Shah Masoud, the Tajik who commanded the Northern Alliance
until his assassination by Al Qaeda two days before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill calls the warlords "regional leaders." In a recent
interview, he said the U.S. military will continue to work closely
with them because they provide stability and security. The U.S. goal,
he said, is to dismantle the militias once the U.S.-trained national
army is deployed and the central government projects authority
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the warlords enjoy robust American support. U.S.
Special Forces teams conduct operations accompanied by warlords'
militiamen and live in compounds guarded by them. Because many
warlords also serve as provincial governors, U.S. military civil
affairs teams must work with them to set up reconstruction and
humanitarian projects -- thus burnishing their images among the local
population.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said the warlords back the central government and have
promised to disband their private armies or integrate them into the
evolving national army -- though they have collected an estimated
$300 million in taxes and duties that should have gone to the Karzai
government they claim to support. The government is so strapped for
cash that workers are paid only sporadically.</TE>
<TE>   "They each have interests that are particular to their regions,
but they are also interested in seeing this country move forward,"
McNeill said of the warlords. "They realize that a centrally
controlled army will likely bring more security and stability than
anything they've seen in the last 23 years.... They're simply waiting
for the central government to show how this will work."</TE>
<TE>   Four battalions of the nascent national army, with 300 to 400 men
each, have been trained by U.S. Special Forces troops since last
summer, and two more are in training. Some units have been posted
outside the capital for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, army trainees reject tribal and ethnic ties and
express loyalty to the national government.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our homeland, and I want to defend it," said Farhid
Sharzai, 26, a Pushtun recruit. Abdul Hanan Mufakir, 32, a Tajik,
said: "The country is like a mother who must be protected by all her
children."</TE>
<TE>   In Lebanon 20 years ago, recruits in a U.S.-trained national army
also repudiated narrow ethnic interests. But that army, dominated by
Christian officers from a Christian government supported by the
United States, collapsed along ethnic and religious lines in a civil
war in which American military personnel were killed by Muslim
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   A Population in Need</TE>
<TE>   As the Afghan army slowly develops, the civilian population
remains mired in poverty. At least 1.3 million Afghans will need food
aid to survive the winter, according to the United Nations' World
Food Program. Afghanistan, a country of about 27 million, has been
overwhelmed by 1.8 million returning refugees, many of whose homes
were destroyed or overrun by squatters.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $1.8 billion in aid promised by donor nations this year,
$1.5 billion has arrived -- but little has reached rural areas where
needs are greatest. A total of $4.5 billion has been pledged over the
next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Economic constraints and the lack of central authority have been
keenly felt by Zaira Mahdat, headmistress of a small girls school in
the provincial capital of Chaghcharan in central Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has not been paid for six months. Local officials
steal the meager supplies sent by the Education Ministry or foreign
aid groups, Mahdat said as she stood in a classroom devoid of desks,
chairs or books. Islamic fundamentalists are trying to shut down the
school, saying girls should not be educated.</TE>
<TE>   Grappling With Graft</TE>
<TE>   Corruption is endemic, complicating the jobs of the 350 to 400
American civil affairs soldiers in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In Herat, a civil affairs officer said that two Western aid
organizations have left the city because of thefts of relief supplies
and kickback demands by functionaries appointed by Ismail Khan, the
regional warlord. A warehouse guarded by Khan's gunmen was looted of
wheat one night, the officer said, and medical supplies donated to a
hospital turned up for sale in a pharmacy. It is common to see bags
of donated wheat sold in bazaars.</TE>
<TE>   Civil affairs projects are limited to $300,000 each. The Pentagon
has provided a civil affairs budget of about $10 million, versus
$12.6 billion for Afghan combat operations in the fiscal year that
ended in September. The U.S. has contributed $455 million in Afghan
aid this year.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. military official said the American effort is not
"nation-building." He described it as "helping provide the Afghan
people assistance for their own growth."</TE>
<TE>   Col. Roger King, the chief U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan,
described the current mission as "to kill or capture Al Qaeda and
those who support them, train the [national army] and deny the use of
Afghanistan as a sanctuary by the terrorists. In support of this
mission, we work to provide an environment where Afghanistan can
rebuild."</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, U.S. combat forces -- assisted by 4,700
troops from the International Security Assistance Force of
peacekeepers -- are trying to hold the country together until the
central government can step in.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the American military focus is in the east, where Al Qaeda
and Taliban holdouts slip back and forth across the Pakistani border,
moving weapons, money and bomb-making materials.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. infantry units mount combat sweeps through the same border
areas again and again. Villagers say Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters,
assisted by local sympathizers, return as soon as the American forces
leave -- though the senior military official said that "each time we
go back, the conditions improve."</TE>
<TE>   Under military rules of engagement, U.S. units can enter Pakistan
only if fired on by enemy forces that are inside Pakistan or are
fleeing there. But because Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is
threatened by Islamic fundamentalists, the United States has limited
its forces in Pakistan to small teams of FBI and CIA agents and
Special Forces troops.</TE>
<TE>   The situation requires substantial U.S. military operations on
Afghanistan's eastern flank because, as Col. James Huggins, a U.S.
commander, put it: "I don't have enough soldiers to set up a picket
line along the border." (The U.S. plans to finance 177 border
stations, to be manned by Afghan border police who are now being
trained.)</TE>
<TE>   The enemy's refusal to fight American forces face to face has left
troops frustrated. Capt. Clay Novak, who has led an airborne company
on sweeps along the Pakistani border, said he once assumed that
Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts would challenge the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "They preach a good game about dying for their cause, but the fact
is they've run away every time," Novak said after a mission in which
his men found weapons but no enemy fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to go up against us," said Spc. John Ferrante,
dressed in body armor and hauling weapons during a combat mission a
mile from the Pakistani border. "So as long as we're here, these
areas will be cleared."</TE>
<TE>   With land mines, snipers, car bombs and tons of unexploded
ordnance, Afghanistan remains a dangerous place. Earlier this month,
two Special Forces soldiers were wounded when a grenade was tossed
into their parked car in downtown Kabul. The same week, an American
soldier on patrol was shot and killed by a sniper in eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Since Operation Enduring Freedom began, the U.S. has suffered 26
combat deaths and 137 wounded. An additional 28 soldiers have died
and 114 have been injured in aircraft crashes and other accidents.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to Afghanistan this month, Gen. Tommy Franks, head
of the U.S. Central Command, said threats remain despite the decisive
U.S. military victory more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "While things seem to be OK for Afghanistan ... we still see a lot
of problems," Franks said. "The truth of it is that while a lot has
been done, this is Afghanistan. We're going to have to stay with it
for as long as it takes."</TE>

<HD>End of the Line for a 'Martyr'</HD>
<DH>Before his arrest, a Palestinian helped found an infamous
militia. His saga shows how ragtag gunmen became a brigade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>In the hours before his capture, Maged Masri paced the floor, smoked
cigarettes and drank small cups of coffee. He was nervous. He knew
his time was running out.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I'm going to get caught," he told the family in whose
house he'd sought refuge.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't worry," one of them responded. "The army never comes here."</LD>
<TE>   Little did they know that the Israeli army had already surrounded
the neighborhood in an effort to find Masri, the last key commander
of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade who remained free.</TE>
<TE>   Masri, 30, helped found the militia that, more than any other
single force, transformed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade had a direct tie to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. It was loyal but not always obedient. It
carried the tactic of suicide bombing out of the realm of radical
Islamists to the wider, more- difficult-to-track secular mainstream.
It militarized Palestinian resistance in ways never before seen in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with Masri and other militiamen over a period of 2 1/2
years revealed their group's evolution from a disjointed band of
gunmen to the dominant guerrilla force in the fight for Palestinian
independence.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, Israel's aggressive clampdown on Palestinians
has gone a long way toward crushing the militancy. But it has also
enraged and inspired future recruits who may yet strike back.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade was founded in the seething Balata
refugee camp on the eastern flank of Nablus a few weeks after the
current intifada, or Palestinian uprising, began in September 2000.
Its founding members came from Arafat's Fatah movement. Some, but not
all, had once supported the Oslo peace process with Israel but had
concluded that it was no longer benefiting Palestinians. Israel had
stopped turning over major portions of land by 1998, Jewish
settlements in the West Bank continued to expand, and prosperity for
Palestinians was mostly limited to a few senior, corrupt leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The men who became members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
initially were as determined to overthrow the old Palestinian guard
as they were to eject Israel. They had cut their teeth as teenagers
throwing stones at Israeli soldiers in the 1980s, been hardened by
time spent in Israeli prisons or in exile, and then trained as
professional warriors after joining the Palestinian Authority's
security forces in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by what they regarded as Fatah's original revolutionary
zeal, they fancied themselves the new elite -- an elite not of money
and political clout but a more radical force empowered by weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Well before there was an Al Aqsa brigade, or even an intifada,
Masri was armed and ready to fight. He first spoke to The Times in
spring 2000, several months before the collapse of the Camp David
peace talks gave way to a war that is now in its third year.</TE>
<TE>   Wire-thin and tightly wound, he strode into a Nablus office near
the Balata camp and announced his determination to defend his people
against Israel and even against the Palestinian Authority if need be.
With an M-16 slung across his back, a Czech-made automatic pistol at
his hip and two cellular telephones, Masri dared anyone to disarm him
or his men.</TE>
<TE>   Impatient, frustrated and cocky, he represented a generation of
Palestinians who had become convinced that armed resistance would
have to replace what they saw as sterile negotiations that were only
deepening Palestinian misery.</TE>
<TE>   Balata, the largest West Bank refugee camp, with an estimated
20,000 people crammed into less than one square mile, has always
maintained a streak of independence. Its sons refused orders from the
Palestinian Authority when those were not to their liking. They
launched the first intifada, which dragged on for nearly six years
before ending with the 1993 Oslo peace accords.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Balata's militants were well armed, thanks to a
proliferation of guns -- legal and illegal -- purchased from Israeli
gunrunners or smuggled into the West Bank from Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Masri and his men were quick to leap into the fray when fighting
erupted again on Sept. 29, 2000, after Israel's then-opposition
leader, Ariel Sharon, marched onto a disputed holy site claimed by
both Jews and Muslims. In the ensuing days, Israeli troops shot and
killed scores of Palestinian demonstrators across the West Bank and
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, the men who would become the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
began laying siege to an Israeli outpost that was both religious
shrine and military bunker. Night after night, Masri and the others
staged hit-and-run attacks on Joseph's Tomb, a well-guarded site that
included a Jewish yeshiva and that many Jews believed to be the
burial place of the biblical owner of the coat of many colors.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, Madhat Yusef, a 19-year-old corporal with the
paramilitary Israeli border police, was killed defending the tomb. He
bled to death when the Palestinians refused to allow an Israeli squad
into the area to rescue him.</TE>
<TE>   Yusef was the second Israeli killed in a conflict that by now has
claimed nearly 700 Israeli lives and about 2,000 Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, the Balata gunmen overran the tomb as Israeli
forces withdrew. It was a seminal event for the Palestinians, a
"victory" over the more powerful Israelis that crystallized the
formation of the militia. Masri was especially jubilant that day. He
swaggered around the shrine and received congratulations as other
Palestinians dismantled the concrete and brick structure and trashed
Hebrew books left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, they began using the name Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, in honor of the revered mosque in Jerusalem that had been
the site of the intifada's first day.</TE>
<TE>   Cells were formed throughout the West Bank and Gaza. They quickly
boasted the best-trained fighters but remained largely decentralized.
That forced the Israeli army to carry its battle against them from
village to village, refugee camp to refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   While the cells pledged nominal allegiance to Arafat and the
Palestinian leadership, they made many of their own decisions and
planned their own actions. Masri said on several occasions that he
would obey a cease-fire order if Arafat gave one but that he was sure
Arafat would do no such thing. As fighting escalated, Masri became
adamant about not stopping unless Israelis quit the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we see Israelis, we will shoot at them," he said at
one point last year.</TE>
<TE>   A former policeman, Masri also maintained close ties with Marwan
Barghouti, the top Fatah leader in the West Bank and a key lieutenant
to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the official Fatah line, the cells initially
confined their attacks to the West Bank and Gaza, targeting Israeli
soldiers, Jewish settlers and other symbols of occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's assassination of Raed Karmi, a popular militia commander
in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, last Jan. 14 changed that. Al Aqsa
fighters launched a sustained series of attacks inside Israel,
including the first suicide bombings by women, quickly outpacing the
radical Islamic groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   "Our civilians are being killed by soldiers from Tel Aviv, so we
will hit Tel Aviv," one of Masri's deputies, who used the nom de
guerre Abu Samud, said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Masri would later say he did not initially approve of the change
of tactic. But over time, he too came to blur distinctions. For
example, Israeli security sources say Masri was behind the shooting
last month of a young mother and her two sons on an Israeli kibbutz.</TE>
<TE>   Al Aqsa's use of suicide bombings altered the conflict, forcing
Israel to rethink the profile of the bombers. No longer was the
tactic confined to radical Muslims fueled by religious fervor; no
longer were bombers just young men from impoverished homes.</TE>
<TE>   Potential bombers were volunteering in droves. The Palestinians
had a tool that they felt gave them an edge over their enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have so many resources to fight the Israelis," said
another of Masri's cohorts, who asked to be identified only as
Nasser. "The martyrdom operations [suicide bombings] served Al Aqsa's
goals. It is the most powerful weapon, because it has created fear in
the hearts of the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Al Aqsa claimed responsibility for half of the nearly 40 suicide
bombings this year alone.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, most of those who were interested went first to Mahmoud
Titi, the top Al Aqsa commander in Balata, who would send them to a
member of the militia's suicide squad, according to militiamen who
agreed to discuss the process. The volunteer's background would be
carefully reviewed because the militia feared collaborators who might
be trying to infiltrate the organization. Once screened, the
volunteer would be trained in suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   One volunteer was Dareen abu Aisheh, a 21-year-old English major
from a Nablus university and one of only three known female suicide
bombers in the current intifada. Her sympathies lay with Hamas and
other Islamic groups. But Hamas operatives told her a suicide assault
was no job for a woman.</TE>
<TE>   So she turned to Al Aqsa. She was checked out, trained and given a
belt of explosives and an assignment, said Nasser. Women are thought
to have a better chance of reaching Israeli population centers. She
was to travel to Jerusalem, change into an Israeli soldier's uniform,
penetrate a base for female soldiers and blow herself up.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 27 of this year, she began the journey. But when she
reached a checkpoint between the West Bank and the Israeli city of
Modiin, she apparently thought she was about to be caught. She
detonated her bomb, killing only herself.</TE>
<TE>   Her family, interviewed soon afterward in their home in a village
just outside Nablus, said they had been shocked by Dareen's action.
Their stories resembled those told by the relatives of almost every
other suicide bomber in the last two years: Morose over the deaths of
so many young Palestinians, and convinced she had no future,
relatives said, Dareen chose to become a human bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to get dozens" of volunteer suicide bombers, Masri said
in March, two weeks after Abu Aisheh's operation and as Israeli
forces were raiding much of the West Bank. "But now we are getting
hundreds."</TE>
<TE>   The first major setback for Masri came when his partner, Yasser
Badourie, was killed in August 2001. Badourie had been greatly
admired by his comrades; he had a sharp strategic mind, was at the
top of his school class in the late 1980s until repeated arrests
forced him to drop out, and possessed a special knack for making
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   A bomb he was preparing exploded in his lap, and he died five days
later. Masri, at his side when the blast occurred, was wounded in the
leg, giving him a limp that still slows him down.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Army Retaliation</TE>
<TE>   In February of this year, after retaliation for Karmi's death
claimed scores of Israeli victims, the army launched its first raids
on refugee camps, thrusting deep into Balata and the Jenin camp in
search of fighters from Al Aqsa, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   Masri vowed to "fight to the death" -- even as he and the others
slipped out of Balata and into Nablus and scattered hide-outs. Once
again, they had, in their minds, triumphed.</TE>
<TE>   As the Israeli military was declaring its own success in wiping
out "terrorist cells" in Balata and Jenin, Al Aqsa struck again.
Palestinian gunmen killed 13 soldiers and three Jewish settlers in
two operations. The assailants escaped both times. More suicide
bombings followed.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, by now the prime minister, declared he had had enough, and
on March 28 he launched Israel's largest military offensive in the
West Bank in more than three decades. This time, the army swept into
cities as well as refugee camps. By June, most of the territory that
had been under Palestinian control for the previous seven or eight
years was reoccupied.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive was devastating for the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.
Ferocious battles in Nablus' ancient center killed about 80
Palestinians -- both fighters and civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Hiding became more difficult. Israelis could hunt down their
wanted men one by one or in wide sweeps that netted several suspects
at a time, along with numerous innocents.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser Awais, a commander and founder of Al Aqsa, was captured and
is in prison. Titi was killed May 24 when an Israeli tank fired on
him and two companions seated at the edge of a cemetery. All three
died, as did another man in his 50s who was sitting in his living
room.</TE>
<TE>   Masri dropped out of sight. With most of the Al Aqsa hierarchy
dead or detained, he was next in line. It became more difficult for
reporters to meet with him, and interviews were reduced to brief,
furtive telephone conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Word went out that he was retiring from militia duty, then that he
was attempting to negotiate safe passage to a different country. His
wife, Zainab, says she never believed any of it.</TE>
<TE>   "He chose this path a long time ago," she said in an interview at
her parents' home. She and Masri had met in a computer class, and she
frequently implored him to give up the guerrilla life. She said that
she had not seen him in six months but that they spoke on the
telephone every other day. He worried about their two little girls.
The couple last spoke just as Israeli troops were closing in on him
Nov. 29. He was telling her to take care of herself when the phone
went dead.</TE>
<TE>   It was the final Friday of Ramadan, close to dusk, when people
share dates and tea to break the fast.</TE>
<TE>   The army surrounded the well-to-do Refadiya neighborhood in
Nablus. Swiftly the troops reached the nine-floor, 29-unit apartment
building where Masri sometimes lived. They moved from apartment to
apartment, searching those that were inhabited, blowing in the doors
of those where no one was home.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't find him.</TE>
<TE>   Masri had already moved about 300 yards down a stony hill and
through a stand of olive trees to the nearby three-story home of the
extended Freitekh family, some of whose members were old-time
activists in the Palestinian resistance.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening wore on, the troops moved closer. It grew dark. The
Freitekh family doused the lights. Rana Freitekh, 33, saw jeeps and
soldiers outside her front door. Masri watched from the living room,
where two chandeliers hung above polished-wood furniture and
gold-trimmed throw pillows.</TE>
<TE>   "Act normally," he told his hosts. "If they ring the bell, open
the door immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Masri realized that there would be no escape, Rana said. The house
was surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   Near-Accidental Arrest</TE>
<TE>   At first, apparently, the soldiers did not realize whom they were
confronting when they reached the room where Masri and others were
seated. They led him into the street, cuffed but not blindfolded.
There, an army officer who knew Masri from the first intifada
recognized him.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers began shouting, shoving their guns at the family and
demanding information about Masri.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know this is the biggest terrorist in Palestine?" shouted
one Arabic-speaking Israeli soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Masri was hauled back into the living room, blindfolded and
interrogated, according to Rana, who watched from the hallway. The
soldiers asked about weapons, and other things she couldn't hear. He
swore on his daughters' lives that he was not armed.</TE>
<TE>   The mood eased, she said. The soldiers were jubilant, some
applauding and singing. Masri was now calm. It was over.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken away around 10:30 p.m., nearly seven hours after the
operation began. So were Rana's husband, brother-in-law and cousin.
Those three returned three days later. Masri remains in an Israeli
prison and after extensive interrogation will probably be put on
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy they caught him instead of killing him," Rana said.</TE>
<TE>   How the Israelis finally got him is a matter of much speculation.
Some Palestinians are convinced that Masri was turned in by top
Palestinian Authority figures angered by a Nov. 28 attack on a
polling station of Israel's governing party during primaries in the
Israeli town of Beit Shean. Six people were killed. Al Aqsa claimed
responsibility, and many in the Palestinian Authority were furious
about such a provocative attack inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, though, is that it would have been simply a matter of
time before the army caught up with Maged Masri. Now the question is
whether someone will rise up to take his place.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Official Calls for Artifacts' Return</HD>
<DH>Culture minister says the nation is ready to care for items
stolen during decades of war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An Afghan official appealed Monday for the immediate return of
antiquities and artwork spirited out of the country during more than
two decades of war, saying the nation is now ready to protect them.</LD>
<LD>   "When the present Afghan government came to power, we had nothing;
everything was destroyed," Information and Culture Minister Raheen
Makhdoom said at the inauguration of an Afghan cultural center in
this city near the Afghan border. "Now we are trying to preserve our
history and culture for the next generation."</LD>
<LD>   Makhdoom said the Afghan government is in talks with UNESCO, the
U.N. cultural agency, on how to preserve, display and protect its
antiquities.</LD>
<TE>   Stolen artifacts include bronze, stone and ceramic pieces from the
4th century BC -- when Alexander the Great swept through southern
Asia -- and rare Buddha carvings in the Gandhara style, a school of
carving popular in northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan about
2,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only during the last few years that they were stolen,
damaged and plundered," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After guerrilla fighters forced Soviet troops out of Afghanistan
in the early 1990s, rival groups began fighting among themselves,
looting artwork and antiquities and selling them.</TE>
<TE>   The situation worsened under the Taliban in the mid-1990s, which
banned music, some art, and destroyed antiquities it said were
offensive to Islam. Some Muslims believe that artwork should not
include depictions of the human figure. In March 2001, the Taliban
destroyed two ancient cliff-side Buddhas.</TE>
<TE>   UNESCO in April 2001 decided to temporarily relax its
long-standing position against the purchase of artifacts that have
been exported illegally and took the unprecedented step of
encouraging the purchase of Afghan treasures by nongovernmental
organizations in a bid to protect what was left of the country's
historical riches.</TE>
<TE>   "We appeal to all those who possess antiques and the pieces looted
from Kabul to return them to our Afghan people," Makhdoom said,
"because they're not the property of any individual. These things
belong to the Afghan nation."</TE>

<HD>Fires Set in Protest at Illegal-Migrants Camp</HD>
<DH>Arson attack is the latest by detention center inmates
upset by refugee policies in Australia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CANBERRA, Australia</DL>
<LD>Firefighters in Australia battled new blazes today set by detainees
at a much-criticized detention center for illegal immigrants as an
outbreak of unrest continued at the country's refugee camps.</LD>
<LD>   At first, staff members at the Woomera camp in South Australia
state tried to put out the fires, but they fled after detainees,
armed with metal bars and stones, began an attack, officials said.
The blazes destroyed or damaged 43 buildings before they were finally
brought under control.</LD>
<LD>   The arson attacks, which authorities blamed on detainees
frustrated by the government's rejection of their asylum
applications, followed a spate of fires over the weekend at the new
Baxter detention center, also in South Australia state.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters were called early Monday to douse blazes in two
unoccupied buildings at Western Australia state's Port Hedland center
and Sunday to put out small fires at Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   Woomera, where 121 illegal immigrants, mostly from the Middle East
and Afghanistan, are being held, has been plagued by a spate of
hunger strikes, riots and escapes this year as the government
prepares to mothball it.</TE>
<TE>   The total damage is estimated at more than $3.5 million, and extra
guards have been put on duty to try to prevent further outbursts of
violent protest.</TE>
<TE>   The fires again threw a spotlight on Australia's hard-line stance
against illegal immigrants and its long-standing practice of
detaining all illegal arrivals -- including women and children -- at
remote, guarded camps. Migrants arriving on boats are usually
diverted to holding centers on Pacific islands. Asylum applications
can take years to process.</TE>
<TE>   These policies have been sharply criticized by international human
rights groups and the United Nations. But the government's tough
position has broad public support.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of unrest from people who are I guess protesting
against judgments that they are not entitled to stay in this country.
That is something that we are not going to allow to alter our
policy," Prime Minister John Howard told Australian radio.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there are many people in Australia, whatever their
politics are, who believe that people who, having gone through a
process of review and are deemed not to have what they asked for,
that they are therefore justified in burning the place down."</TE>

<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>A fire broke out in an Iranian prison early Monday, killing 27
prisoners and injuring 50 others, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire erupted about 3:20 a.m. in the prison in Gorgan, the
capital of northern Golestan province on the Caspian Sea, prison
director Abbas Ali Arab said.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, at least 27 prisoners were killed and 50 others
injured in the incident," Arab said, adding that the death toll was
likely to rise.</LD>
<TE>   The official said the victims were all inmates, aged 20 to 69,
convicted by local courts on various charges, including drug
smuggling, theft and robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters extinguished the blaze, and the injured were taken to
several hospitals in different provincial cities, Arab said.</TE>
<TE>   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted provincial
official Hossein Rafati as saying the fire was caused by a short
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have launched an investigation, IRNA said.</TE>

<HD>Inspectors 'Have Zilch' Thus Far</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sergei L. Loiko and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>In their search for hidden Iraqi arms, U.N. inspectors have so far
faced little conflict, have found little evidence and have received
little outside intelligence to guide them, said one inspector. The
teams have discovered two technical matters that could be considered
violations of U.N. resolutions but have yet to find a smoking gun, a
trace of radiation or a single germ spore.</LD>
<LD>   "If our goal is to catch them with their pants down, we are
definitely losing," the inspector said on condition he wouldn't be
named. "We haven't found an iota of concealed material yet."</LD>
<LD>   In one of the first glimpses of the inspection process from inside
Iraq, the inspector described a team of experts who have been
thwarted by Iraqi authorities who have better preparation, equipment
and intelligence than the inspectors. Their minders have faster cars
and better radios with which to alert others that they're on their
way and, of course, know just where they're going and what they're
looking for.</LD>
<TE>   The list of Iraq's violations is short. During the four years in
which inspectors have not been allowed in the country, the Iraqis
tried to procure missile parts and altered others without notifying
the U.N., the inspector said -- two incidents that could be
considered a breach of U.N. resolutions, though perhaps not large
enough to justify military action.</TE>
<TE>   But the inspectors' roster of frustrations is long. There are 110
U.N. weapons experts in Iraq, 100 searching for chemical and
biological weapons and 10 looking for evidence of a nuclear program.
Their mission is nearly impossible -- trying to find suspected caches
of material or documents in a country about the size of California.</TE>
<TE>   Their work is relentless -- sometimes the different teams conduct
seven inspections a day, which means early wake-up calls, long drives
and intense searches. Monday was that kind of day as inspectors made
seven visits, including one to a water-purification plant and one to
a missile factory.</TE>
<TE>   To keep their plans secret from wiretaps, moles or eavesdropping
devices, inspectors operate like spies, passing notes about the day's
plans rather than speaking aloud, and driving their U.N. jeeps in
circles to confound those trying to determine their destination.</TE>
<TE>   But often, inspectors say, by the time the U.N. convoys arrive at
a site, the gates are open and the workers are waiting. The Iraqis
have been obliging, even eager to please, allowing the inspectors to
wander through the bedrooms of a once off-limits presidential palace
"like idle museum-goers," the inspector said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even private facilities which are not part of their state-run
military industrial complex open up for us -- like magic," he said.
"But even if they open all the doors in Iraq for us and keep them
open 24 hours a day, we won't be able to find a black cat in a dark
room, especially if it is not there. We need help. We need
information. We need intelligence reports if they exist."</TE>
<TE>   The inspector said he and his colleagues feel acute pressure from
Washington to find something soon. But if the U.S. has provided its
long-promised intelligence, they haven't seen it yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't look for something which we don't know about. If the
United States wants us to find something, they should open their
intelligence file and share it with us so that we know where to go
for it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official said Monday that the U.S.
has passed along "high-quality" information regarding suspected
chemical or biological sites but that the inspectors haven't acted on
it yet.</TE>
<TE>   "They have gotten some intelligence, and they will get more," the
official said. But what the U.S. intelligence community is concerned
about is whether the information can be used fruitfully and not
compromised so that it loses its value, he said. "It is as much a
test of the inspectors as it is of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Past inspection teams were infiltrated by moles who reported the
U.N. experts' plans to Iraqi authorities. This time, the demands for
secrecy are intense.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not allowed to say a word about what we are doing," said
the inspector, noting that the Iraqis, in contrast, usher journalists
into just-searched sites and describe in detail what questions the
experts asked and what they were looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "By being silent, we may create the false illusion that we did
uncover something," the inspector said. "But I must say that if we
were to publish a report now, we would have zilch to put in it."</TE>
<TE>   The chemical experts haven't found a trace of the tons of chemical
agents that Iraq is suspected of having, he said. The biologists are
taking air samples to find spores, but the biological agents don't
have a long shelf life and probably have long been buried or disposed
of.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear inspectors found that the massive installations used
to enrich uranium were practically undisturbed since they were
decommissioned and sealed by the previous inspection team. They are
convinced that the old facilities are not being used. But the
inspectors are still searching for secret stores of enriched uranium,
small caches of which could be hidden almost anywhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The only possible breaches, the inspector said, might come from
Iraq's handling of aluminum tubes that experts suspect were to be
used as part of a centrifuge to enrich uranium. The Iraqis say that
the tubes were meant for helicopter-launched air-to-ground missiles
but that when they didn't work as expected, they were altered for use
in antiaircraft rockets. Altering the tubes without informing the
U.N. violated previous resolutions about dual-use goods.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Iraq used foreign-registered front companies to buy
replacement tubes without informing the U.N. -- another breach of
U.N. sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the inspectors' best source of information came from
defectors who had worked on the weapons program, and U.S. officials
are pressuring the U.N. teams to take scientists and relatives out of
the country for interviews. Last week, Iraqi authorities provided
inspectors with a list of 500 scientists who headed or worked on
weapons programs. Probably 1,000 more have knowledge of weapons work,
the inspector said.</TE>
<TE>   The interviews are "a very difficult and complex thing," he said.
"I took part in such interviews in 1998. It is a spectacle, not for
people with poor nerves. It was happening in the presence of Iraqi
generals, in the lights of the cameras. You could see large drops of
sweat streaming down the forehead of a mature middle-aged scientist.
These interviews didn't get us anywhere then. They will not take us
anywhere now. The risk for their lives and the lives of their
relatives is great, and we can't do anything to create a normal
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The first interview this time produced nothing, the
inspector said, because the minders were all security service officials,
keeping careful track of what was being said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid to think that we can offer them to go abroad to
testify. Once any of them expresses a desire to go abroad for an
interview, his brains will be kicked out in no time -- his and his
entire family's," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors said his colleagues think it possible that Iraq
really has eliminated its banned materials. But, he noted, it still
has its scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't cut off heads," he said. "They can gather all the
intellectual potential together and start their deadly work again."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Hints It Was Ready for Nuclear War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's president seemed to suggest Monday that he had been
prepared to use nuclear weapons against India this year, but a
spokesman later said that was not what he meant when he spoke of
unconventional war.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech to Pakistan Air Force veterans, President Pervez
Musharraf said he personally sent messages to Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee through visiting leaders that if Indian troops
moved a single step across the border, "they should not expect a
conventional war from Pakistan."</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf's comments appeared to confirm fears voiced last winter
that the world was close to witnessing war between the two
nuclear-armed rivals. But hours later, army spokesman Maj. Gen.
Rashid Qureshi said Musharraf meant that the people and the army
would "neutralize the enemy's offensive."</LD>
<TE>   "Nowhere did he say that Pakistan would use nuclear weapons at
all," Qureshi said.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan sent hundreds of thousands of troops to their
disputed border after a deadly attack on India's Parliament last
December.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi blamed Islamabad for helping to mastermind the assault.
Pakistan denied playing any part.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions eased recently as both sides said they were pulling back
troops.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Reservists Can't Refuse to Serve in West Bank and
Gaza Strip</HD>
<DH>Court rules against those who say the occupation is
illegal. Violence kills four more Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's Supreme Court ruled Monday that army reservists cannot
refuse to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, four
Palestinians were killed by troops, and a fifth died under unclear
circumstances, purportedly after an encounter with Israeli police.</LD>
<LD>   In its ruling, the court sidestepped a decision on whether
Israel's 35-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza violates
international law. Eight reservists contended that Israel's
occupation of the territories is illegal and that they therefore have
the right to refuse duty there. The court ruled that reservists
cannot choose their assignments.</LD>
<LD>   Since the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September
2000, more than 500 Israeli soldiers have refused to serve in the
West Bank and Gaza, saying they are unwilling to help perpetuate
military rule over another people. Dozens of soldiers have been sent
to military jails.</LD>
<TE>   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East War but
withdrew from Palestinian population centers as part of interim peace
deals in the mid-1990s. It reoccupied most areas last June as part of
an offensive against Palestinian militants who have been attacking
Israelis with bombs and guns.</TE>
<TE>   The court said accepting the reservists' demands could further
deepen the rifts in Israeli society.</TE>
<TE>   In violence Monday, a Palestinian was killed and three wounded in
an exchange of fire with undercover Israeli forces in the Khan Yunis
refugee camp in Gaza, Palestinians said. The military had no
immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, a Palestinian gunman fired at soldiers after
breaking through a fence separating Israel and Gaza, the army said.
Soldiers returned fire, killing the attacker, a Hamas militant who
wore an Israeli army uniform and carried two assault rifles, grenades
and ammunition clips, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In a clash in the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers killed a
20-year-old with a shot to the head. The man was lighting a
protester's firebomb when he was killed, witnesses said. Army
regulations permit soldiers to shoot those holding firebombs.</TE>
<TE>   Near the West Bank town of Jenin, soldiers killed an unarmed
Palestinian motorist after his car rammed a jeep parked near a
checkpoint. The 37-year-old driver emerged from his car and
approached the jeep, and soldiers opened fire, assuming he was trying
to attack them, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinians said a 17- or
18-year-old was taken away by Israeli border police for a curfew
violation and beaten, then was brought back and died. The Israeli
military had no immediate comment.</TE>

<HD>Hand-Over Applauded in Kenya</HD>
<DH>A crowd of more than 100,000 attends inauguration of
opposition leader as president. His predecessor is jeered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>More than 100,000 Kenyans roared their approval as Mwai Kibaki was
sworn in as their president Monday, watching history in the making as
autocrat Daniel Arap Moi bowed out after almost a quarter-century in
power.</LD>
<LD>   Many people climbed up trees and lampposts in Nairobi's Uhuru Park
to witness the inauguration of the man they are counting on to
rebuild this once-prosperous East African nation. Kibaki, 71, a
former vice president and finance minister, promised not to
disappoint them.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd jeered and heckled Moi as he arrived and sat next to his
successor. Moi listened stone-faced as Kibaki highlighted the
failings of his government.</LD>
<TE>   "I am inheriting a country which has been badly ravaged by years
of misrule and ineptitude," Kibaki told the crowd. "You have asked me
to lead this nation out of the present wilderness and malaise on to
the promised land, and I shall do so."</TE>
<TE>   When Kibaki told the crowd that government should not be a burden
on the people, one man shouted, "Tell him!" and pointed at Moi.</TE>
<TE>   "We never dreamed of this day," said Esther Macharia, 31, a
secondhand-clothes seller in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a new beginning in Kenya," she said, smiling excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki pledged to create jobs for millions of unemployed, provide
free primary education and lead a government that won't be run on the
"whims of individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition won a landslide victory in
elections Friday, defeating Moi's handpicked candidate, Uhuru
Kenyatta, and ending 39 years of rule by the Kenya African National
Union.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker
welcomed the election as having been free and fair. He praised Moi
and Kibaki for an orderly change in Nairobi.</TE>
<TE>   Moi, 78, was forced to step down by a 1991 constitutional
amendment that limits presidents to two five-year terms. In
complying, he paved the way for a peaceful transfer of power, rare in
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Many Kenyans blame Moi, whose blanket use of patronage resulted in
crippling mismanagement, for the culture of corruption that has
plunged Kenya into its worst economic crisis since independence from
Britain in 1963 and frightened away much-needed foreign investors.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the population of 30 million lives on less than $1
a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great day in the history of Kenya because it's like a
second independence for Kenya. For the first time, our wishes as an
electorate have gone through successfully," said Ferdinand Makokha,
26, an office messenger. "It's been a dream for every Kenyan."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki was Moi's vice president from 1978 to 1988.</TE>

<HD>White House Downplays N. Korea Issue</HD>
<DH>Having earlier called for swift U.N. censure of Pyongyang,
officials now say they prefer to deal with the matter more
deliberately.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- In a shift in policy, the Bush administration said
Monday that it is in no rush for U.N. Security Council action on
North Korea's nuclear program and played down emerging differences
with key allies over the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Three days after signaling a desire for swift council condemnation
of the North's resumption of its nuclear program, officials said they
now intend to follow the lead of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the
International Atomic Energy Agency.</LD>
<LD>   And they insisted that the Bush administration, despite its
declared desire for a program of pressure known as "tailored
containment," is not pushing allies to apply sanctions.</LD>
<TE>   "The secretary of State has not asked any nation to take economic
actions against this desperately poor country," State Department
spokesman Philip T. Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   The shift suggested that the administration wants to slow the pace
of developments on the North Korean arms issue at a time when the
government in Pyongyang, the capital, has been trying to urge the
United States to make concessions on economic assistance and
suspended fuel oil deliveries, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, which suspended its nuclear weapons program in 1994
under international pressure, has in the last two weeks taken steps
to restart its nuclear power facilities at Yongbyon -- which could
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons -- and has ejected the three
IAEA inspectors who had been monitoring activities there.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the inspectors arrived this morning in Beijing, en route to
Vienna. The third left Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts speculated that the administration's desire to put
off Security Council deliberations may also reflect allies'
resistance to the U.S. effort to cobble together a program of
international sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Russia and South Korea warned that taking a hard line
against the isolated and impoverished nation could be
counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the latest pronouncements out of Washington make
it even less clear how the White House hopes to get Pyongyang to
abandon its nuclear arms programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know: What are we intending? It's just very confusing,"
said Joel S. Wit, a top State Department specialist on Korea during
the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   In television appearances Sunday, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell sought to reduce tensions by saying that Pyongyang's recent
actions had not created a crisis. He said the United States was not
contemplating military action.</TE>
<TE>   L. Gordon Flake of the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs in
Washington said it appeared that U.S. officials are determined "not
to do anything to precipitate a crisis. So if they can use the cover
of the IAEA process to give themselves more time, that's what they'll
do."</TE>
<TE>   IAEA officials have said that at a board meeting Monday, they plan
to discuss North Korea's violations of its promise not to pursue
nuclear arms. But diplomatic sources at the U.N. said Monday that the
agency hopes to resolve the issue without taking it to the Security
Council, which agency Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei said last
week would be the next step.</TE>
<TE>   China, one of North Korea's strongest allies, is a veto-wielding
council member and has signaled that it prefers to apply diplomatic
pressure discreetly. In the Security Council spotlight, Chinese
diplomats might feel compelled to publicly defend North Korea,
diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, who had been loath to
criticize the United States in public, on Monday rejected the Bush
administration's strategy of "tailored containment."</TE>
<TE>   "Pressure and isolation have never been successful with communist
countries. Cuba is one example," Kim told his Cabinet, according to
the presidential Blue House.</TE>
<TE>   Kim said that although his country would firmly oppose North
Korea's nuclear program, it would also seek peace.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President-elect Roh Moo Hyun told reporters in Seoul
this morning that he expected the United States to closely coordinate
its position.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a matter of life-and-death policy for the United
States, but it could be for us," Roh said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, meanwhile, warned North Korea not to withdraw from the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, an agreement designed to halt the
spread of nuclear weapons. North Korea's official news agency hinted
over the weekend that the country might take that step.</TE>
<TE>   In his strongest condemnation yet of North Korea's actions,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Pyongyang's decision to
expel the inspectors and prepare to resume unmonitored work at its
nuclear energy complex "cannot help but provoke regret." But he also
urged Washington to tone down its "aggressive rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, where President Bush is spending the holiday,
officials insisted that there is no split between allies.</TE>
<TE>   Scott McClellan, the deputy White House press secretary, said:
"The international community is unified and is in agreement that
North Korea's actions are a challenge to all responsible nations. And
it has made clear that North Korea's relations with the outside world
hinge on the elimination of its nuclear weapons program."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said another reason the administration may prefer to
avoid U.N. deliberations on North Korea is the approach of Security
Council discussions on Iraq that could help determine whether the
U.S. goes to war.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Council Approves Tighter Controls on Iraqi Imports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council approved tighter controls on Iraqi imports
Monday, including limits on purchases of speedboats, pesticides,
radio broadcast equipment, flight simulators and dosages of
antibiotics that the United States and Britain say could be used by
the Iraqi military in a war.</LD>
<LD>   Some diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saw the
changes as another sign that Washington and London are preparing for
the possible use of force in Iraq, but U.S. and British diplomats
said the amendments to existing controls were routine and necessary.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. wanted to eliminate what Ambassador John D. Negroponte
called "loopholes or omissions" in the U.N. "oil for food" program,
which allows Iraq to sell oil to buy food, medicine and oil-industry
spare parts. Iraq said the resolution would aggravate the suffering
of its people, who have been under U.N. economic sanctions since Iraq
invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   "This will hinder and create obstacles in the implementation of
the oil-for-food program," Deputy Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Ali said.
"This program has not been able to respond to the needs of the Iraqi
people, and nothing but the lifting of sanctions will end their
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Russia and Syria were the only abstentions in the 13-0 vote on the
resolution, which expands an existing list of items that require U.N.
approval before they can be purchased by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Russia refused to support the resolution because the measure does
not ease controls on sales of Russian-made heavy trucks, which the
United States and Britain say could be used by the Iraqi military.</TE>
<TE>   Syria, Iraq's closest council ally, complained that one month of
negotiations to add dozens of items to the "goods review list" wasn't
enough time for Damascus to assess whether the changes would be
harmful to Iraq's humanitarian situation.</TE>
<TE>   France supported the measure but expressed annoyance at U.S.
pressure. Deputy French Ambassador Michel Duclos said more time
should have been taken to negotiate an agreement acceptable to all 15
council members.</TE>
<TE>   "We also had questions, to put it mildly, regarding the method by
which this negotiation was being conducted," Duclos said, referring
to U.S. pressure.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials wanted to push through the resolution before the
council year came to an end and five new countries -- including
Germany and Pakistan -- join Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. says many of the items added to the list could be used to
produce biological or chemical weapons or to protect Iraqi soldiers
from exposure to them. The U.S. said that pesticides containing
phosphorus could be used to make chemical weapons and that Iraq could
use antibiotics to protect its soldiers from biological weapons.</TE>

<HD>Chechen Blast Deaths Could Exceed 80</HD>
<DH>Despite revision of toll from attack, Putin says Russian
policy toward republic won't change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Russian officials said Monday that the death toll from
Friday's double suicide attack on the headquarters of the pro-Moscow
government in Chechnya could be well over 80, but President Vladimir
V. Putin insisted that separatist rebels would have no impact on his
policy toward the strife-torn republic.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials repeatedly refer to the "normalization" of
Chechnya, but a tough military approach has failed to subdue the
rebels. Guerrilla attacks, mine explosions and skirmishes occur
daily, while the rebels stage headline-grabbing attacks every few
months.</LD>
<LD>   Monday was a typical day: Four service personnel were killed. Two
Russian servicemen were shot dead by snipers in a market in Grozny,
the capital; another Russian serviceman died in a mine explosion; and
a Chechen policeman was killed by a mine. There were also overnight
clashes in Grozny between rebels and Russian forces.</LD>
<TE>   Meeting with members of his government, Putin said Monday that the
rebels would not be allowed to derail the normalization of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   The Kremlin has announced that a referendum will be held in the
republic in March to confirm Chechnya as a part of Russia, set down a
constitution and establish elections, thus sidestepping the rebels
who vehemently oppose Moscow's rule.</TE>
<TE>   Russian media reported Tuesday that the death toll from Friday's
bombing had reached 83, up from 61 a day earlier, and Chechnya's
Moscow-appointed prime minister, Stanislav Ilyasov, said the number
could be well over 80.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorist attack by Chechen rebels on a Moscow theater in
October resulted in the deaths of 129 people, but all but two of them
were killed by the sleeping gas used when Russian authorities stormed
the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "It is overwhelmingly clear to politicians and ordinary citizens
alike -- we are talking about another attempt to derail the political
process in Chechnya," Putin said of the attack in Grozny.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists are using the cruelest methods to achieve that,
but they will fail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Putin has faced international criticism over the actions by
Russian troops in Chechnya, but he argues that the rebels there are
akin to Al Qaeda. Since the attack, Moscow has renewed its
accusations that the rebels are part of the international terrorist
network and are receiving funding from Arab countries.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials continued Monday to try to link the attack to
Aslan Maskhadov, a prominent rebel leader who was formerly the
elected president of Chechnya. His spokesman has denied he had any
role.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Turkmen Official Gets Life for Plot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan</DL>
<LD>In a trial of less than a day, a former Turkmen foreign minister was
convicted and sentenced to life in prison for plotting to assassinate
the president.</LD>
<LD>   The government says President Saparmurad A. Niyazov's motorcade
came under fire Nov. 25. He was unhurt, but four police officers were
wounded, officials have said. Niyazov blamed former Foreign Minister
Boris Shikhmuradov for masterminding the alleged attack.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the People's Council, an assembly of Niyazov loyalists,
watched a videotaped confession by Shikhmuradov, excerpts of which
had been aired on state TV the day before. Shikhmuradov, his eyes
down and his speech halting, took blame and renounced the opposition,
calling it a criminal gang.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not a person who is capable of running the state, but on the
contrary, a criminal who is capable only of destroying the state," he
said. He said he had not been tortured into giving a confession.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly later watched a video hookup with the Supreme Court,
where a prosecutor read out the charges against Shikhmuradov, who
said he had no objection. He was then sentenced to 25 years in prison
after a trial lasting less than a day.</TE>
<TE>   As Niyazov looked on from the podium and his giant portrait smiled
down from the wall, the delegates increased the sentence to life in
prison, declaring Shikhmuradov and two alleged co-conspirators
traitors. Critics said the proceedings were reminiscent of the purges
under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   Some assembly members called for Shikhmuradov to be shot, but
Niyazov reminded them that Turkmenistan eliminated the death penalty
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't have death, but they won't have forgiveness, either,"
Niyazov said. "Let them see all the harshness of prison."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Police detained a dissident general Monday as a nationwide strike
against President Hugo Chavez marked its 29th day.</LD>
<LD>   The strike has shut off shipments from the world's fifth-largest
oil exporter, and police used tear gas Monday to separate opponents
and supporters of Chavez outside the state oil monopoly's
headquarters in Maracaibo, the hub of the country's oil-producing
west.</LD>
<LD>   Strike leader Carlos Ortega, who heads Venezuela's largest labor
federation, called on all citizens to stop paying their taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Secret police arrested national guard Gen. Carlos Alfonso
Martinez, one of dozens of dissident military officers who have
occupied a square in Caracas, the capital, for three months in
rebellion against Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 people protested the arrest outside the headquarters of
the secret police. Officers tried to disperse the protesters with
tear gas. An ensuing rock fight between protesters and Chavez
supporters injured 10 people, city Fire Chief Rodolfo Briceno said.</TE>
<TE>   The government accuses Martinez and other officers of involvement
in an April coup that briefly toppled Chavez before he was restored
to power by loyalist troops. A lawyer speaking for Martinez said the
general had not been charged and that his detention was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever is responsible for this, whether it's Hugo Chavez, the
interior minister or the head of the national guard, we'll identify
and charge them," lawyer Cipriano Heredia said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, himself a former paratrooper, has kicked many renegade
officers out of the armed forces and threatened to chase them from
the square, but detaining Martinez is the toughest act against them
so far.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition, backed by business groups and unions, accuses
Chavez of authoritarianism, corruption and economic incompetence in
what it says is a quest to establish a Cuban-style dictatorship.
Chavez says he is trying to reform the country and lift millions of
citizens out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders are demanding immediate elections and have
refused Chavez's offer of a referendum on his rule in August, saying
that if they wait that long, he will ruin the country. Chavez says
that under the constitution, August is the earliest date an election
may be held to assess popular support for his rule.</TE>

<HD>Paris Airport Worker Arrested; Arms Seized</HD>
<DH>A witness allegedly heard the baggage handler loading a gun
in a parking lot. Police say explosives and weapons were confiscated.</DH>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Stoking fears of terrorism in a nation already on edge, French police
on Monday were interrogating an airport baggage handler who was
arrested at work with explosives and guns in his car, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Abdrazak Bessighir, 27, in a parking lot at
Charles de Gaulle Airport on Saturday, authorities said. Officers
found five bars of Yugoslav-made plastic explosive, two detonators
and a fuse in the trunk of the car, along with a machine gun and a
Colt .45 pistol, according to authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Bessighir's father, two brothers and a family
friend and were questioning them Monday. It is not unusual for police
here to round up relatives and associates of suspects during
investigations of suspected terrorism, and authorities said nothing
indicating that Bessighir or the others have ties to Islamic
extremists.</LD>
<TE>   Bessighir, a French citizen of Algerian descent, has worked for
three years for Europe Handling, a company that employs 1,100 people
at France's biggest airport, according to a company spokesman. The
baggage handler has an excellent work record, said the spokesman,
Robert-Noel Castellani.</TE>
<TE>   "He worked on the runways loading and unloading luggage onto
planes," Castellani said during a news conference. "His access badge
to the security zone was renewed without problems in November. This
young man has never drawn any kind of attention to himself."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of lethal explosives in the possession of an airport
employee with access to planes alarmed police and the public here.
France and neighboring nations are on high alert because of arrests
and intelligence reports suggesting that Islamic terrorists have been
preparing a strike during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, French, British and Spanish police
pursuing interconnected cases have arrested several dozen people
accused of being Al Qaeda terrorists. Many of the suspects, including
eight detained in the Paris area this month, are Algerian veterans of
combat in Chechnya and training camps in Afghanistan and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris-area suspects allegedly belonged to a network that was
plotting an attack in France using explosives or chemical weapons and
possibly focusing on Russian targets, according to the Interior
Ministry. Searches turned up bomb-making materials, an
anti-contamination suit and formulas for preparing toxic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas those operations resulted from lengthy surveillance
involving intelligence services in other countries, authorities said
a tip from an alert traveler brought about the weekend arrest at the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The tipster, a military veteran, was walking through a parking lot
before dawn Saturday when he heard a noise he recognized as a gun
being loaded, police said. The traveler saw Bessighir handling a gun
by his car and decided to report him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police followed the baggage handler and arrested him after he
worked a shift from 5:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Bessighir lives with his
parents, three brothers and four sisters in a small,
middle-class-looking house in Bondy, a suburb in a heavily North
African area northeast of Paris where a number of terrorism-related
arrests have been made recently.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Bessighir was polite, worked hard and did not wear
a long beard or otherwise dress or behave like an Islamic
fundamentalist. He is apparently not among the known extremists in
the voluminous files of counter-terrorism agencies, according to law
enforcement sources. Some extremist groups active in immigrant
communities and prisons here cultivate non-Islamic appearances,
undercover-style, and use ideological and ethnic appeals to recruit
young men who are not particularly religious.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nightmares of counter-terrorism experts here is that
terrorists will infiltrate airports or rail systems, in which
scrutiny of employees is always a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The matter is especially delicate in France because the
maintenance and service work force at airports includes a
considerable number of Muslims and North Africans.</TE>
<TE>   In Belgium, investigators this year discovered that suspects
linked to an Al Qaeda plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris had jobs
and badges that gave them access to secure zones of the Brussels
airport. In Paris, airport security became a hot issue a year ago
when Richard Reid, a Briton now imprisoned in the United States,
managed to talk his way past police screeners onto an American
Airlines flight to Miami and tried to ignite explosives rigged in his
shoes while the plane was over the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Paratroopers carrying automatic weapons patrol French airports,
and security officials have toughened screening of employees. Just
last week, a Moroccan-French systems engineer formerly assigned to
the air traffic control area of Charles de Gaulle went public with
his complaint that he had been barred from work because he is a
devout Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Identified in press reports as Said, the 27-year-old engineer
accused police of investigating him and revoking his access to
top-security areas after he reported that his airport credentials had
been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the interrogation period for the jailed baggage handler
can continue until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Under anti-terrorism laws, investigators have four days to
question Bessighir and the other detainees before giving them access
to a lawyer and deciding whether to arraign them.</TE>

<HD>Attacker Disguised Gun as a Baby</HD>
<DH>A missionary group that runs a hospital in Yemen says a man
pretended to seek care before killing three Americans and wounding a
fourth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A missionary group that runs a Yemen hospital where three Americans
were killed and a fourth was wounded said the gunman disguised his
weapon by swaddling it like a baby before he opened fire Monday in an
attack that is likely to further destabilize the troubled Arab
country.</LD>
<LD>   A suspect arrested immediately after the shooting in the southern
city of Jibla allegedly told Yemeni officials that he was a devout
Muslim and that he shot the hospital workers to "cleanse his religion
and get closer to God."</LD>
<LD>   Yemeni officials said the gunman had ties to extremists, but U.S.
officials stopped short of calling it a terrorist attack.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know if it's an anti-American attack, an anti-Christian
attack or an anti-foreigner attack," an administration official said.
"It's just too soon to say."</TE>
<TE>   The four victims were among about a dozen Southern Baptist
missionaries who staff the 80-bed hospital in Jibla, more than 100
miles south of Sana, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old hospital had drawn controversy in the region,
where some Muslims objected to what they described as Christian
proselytizing. The International Mission Board, the missionary branch
of the Southern Baptist Convention, had been planning to turn over
administration of the hospital to a Muslim group in the coming year
in response.</TE>
<TE>   "We're grateful God spared the lives of others and pray that his
spirit will meet the needs of everyone touched by this crisis," said
Larry Cox, spokesman for the board.</TE>
<TE>   According to accounts by the missionary group, the gunman passed
through security by wrapping his weapon in a blanket and carrying it
beneath his coat as if it were a child as he entered the hospital,
pretending to seek medical care. The gunman then burst into a room
where three of the hospital's senior staff members were meeting and
opened fire at close range. After leaving the room, he shot and
seriously wounded a fourth American missionary who was working in the
pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   The dead were identified as Martha Myers, 57, a physician from
Montgomery Ala.; William Koehn, 60, a hospital administrator from
Arlington, Texas; and Kathleen Gariety, 53, a purchasing agent from
Wauwatosa, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded man is pharmacist Donald Caswell, 49, of Levelland,
Texas. He was shot in the stomach and underwent surgery at the
hospital. He was expected to make a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   All of the victims had worked in the hospital for years; Myers had
served since 1977 and Koehn since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman surrendered to Yemeni hospital guards, who turned him
over to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly condemn and deplore the murder of three American
citizens who were providing humanitarian assistance to the Yemeni
people," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan, who spoke near
Crawford, Texas, where President Bush is spending an extended New
Year's holiday at his ranch. "This underscores the world we're living
in these days, the dangerous world we live in these days.... We take
this very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni authorities identified the gunman as 30-year-old Abed Abdul
Razak Kamel, and gave conflicting accounts of his alleged ties to
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni Interior Ministry official told Associated Press that
Kamel claimed to have planned the attack in concert with Ali
Jarallah, a suspected assassin arrested Saturday in the slaying that
day of a leader of Yemen's Socialist Party. A report by Reuters
quoted officials who said Kamel told them he was part of a group
called Islamic Jihad, apparently unconnected to the Palestinian group
of the same name.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they had no confirmation of either account and
said it was possible he acted independently or on behalf of a tribal
group.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just no answer to what his motivation was," a senior U.S.
intelligence official said. "It could be a lot of things. Whether it
was a lone operator or done for religious reasons, we just don't know
yet. There's no clear terrorist connection."</TE>
<TE>   Yemen is a poor, tribal Arab country -- the poorest on the Arabian
Peninsula -- sandwiched between Saudi Arabia to the north and the
Gulf of Aden to the south. The central government has no authority in
large swaths of the desert country, where tribes rule much as they
did in ancient times.</TE>
<TE>   For years the poor security situation strained relations with the
United States, especially when American citizens were held hostage by
various tribes. However, relations have improved since the Sept. 11
attacks, when the government declared its full support for the United
States' war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in recent years, many impoverished Yemenis have
joined up with terrorist organizations, including Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda network. Two recent attacks on Western vessels -- a bomb
attack on a French tanker in October and the bombing of the U.S.
destroyer Cole in October 2000 -- have been blamed on militants
linked to Bin Laden's group.</TE>
<TE>   Two incidents in recent months threatened the rapprochement
between the U.S. and Yemen. In early November, a U.S. Predator drone
fired on a vehicle in the Yemeni desert, killing six men believed to
be Al Qaeda figures, one of them a senior member. The Yemeni
government said for the first time Monday that it had asked for the
attack, a request that had been widely assumed.</TE>
<TE>   And this month, North Korean-made Scud missiles were intercepted
off the coast of Yemen. The Yemeni government said the shipment was
legal, and the U.S. released the vessel, allowing delivery of the
missiles to Yemen's army.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh denounced Monday's attack and
pledged new efforts to work with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We condemn this heinous act ... which will strengthen our united
stand against terrorism," Saleh said in a message to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Christian missionaries walk a delicate line in Muslim countries,
most of which outlaw any form of proselytizing.</TE>
<TE>   In Yemen, the Southern Baptists had run the hospital since 1966
with the permission and support of the Yemeni government.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Norvelle, a spokeswoman for the International Mission Board,
said hospital workers were sensitive to local feelings about
proselytizing but were also open about the religious motivations for
their work.</TE>
<TE>   "We're believers of Jesus Christ. All of us are commanded to share
that with others as we go about our work," Norvelle said. The
hospital workers "would be there in Christ's name and would share
their medical care in Christ's name."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, religious discussions were likely to be private, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we feel it is most effective is in one-on-one
conversation with people as they come in for medial care," Norvelle
said.</TE>
<TE>   The mission board is "grieved" by the attack, said its president,
Jerry Rankin, but it has no plans to withdraw from the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Our personnel, as Americans and Christians, are well aware of the
risk of living and serving in a place like Yemen," he said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet their love for the Yemeni people and obedience to the
conviction of God's leadership has been expressed in a willingness to
take that risk and give of their lives."</TE>

<HD>Court Ruling Jeopardizes Coastal Panel</HD>
<DH>Judges uphold decision that Legislature's sway over members
violates the state Constitution. The agency is expected to appeal
further.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court in Sacramento on Monday ruled that the
California Coastal Commission violates the state Constitution by
allowing the Legislature broad authority to appoint and remove a
majority of the commissioners, who wield executive powers.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the commission immediately began devising strategies
for suspending the court's order, pending a certain appeal to the
state Supreme Court. Otherwise, the order from the 3rd District Court
of Appeal will in effect shut down the commission's power to regulate
development along the state's 1,150-mile coastline and throw
thousands of pending building permits into limbo. The ruling will
take effect in 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, if the order were to take effect immediately, that would
mean chaos," said Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director.
"The commission wouldn't be able to function. We would have to cancel
our meetings because the commission couldn't make any decisions."</LD>
<TE>   The commission also would be unable to weigh in on federal
proposals, such as the Bush administration's push for more oil
drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel, and to determine if such plans
comply with state environmental protection laws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous day for us," said Ronald Zumbrun, a property
rights lawyer who has raised constitutional arguments in this case
and other lawsuits against the commission for more than a dozen
years. "We finally found a trial judge who agreed with our kooky
ideas, and this Court of Appeal's ruling certainly gives the case
credibility that the Coastal Commission has to pay attention to."</TE>
<TE>   The three-justice panel agreed unanimously to uphold a lower
court's ruling that the commission violates the state Constitution's
separation-of-powers doctrine. The Legislature controls the positions
of eight of the 12 members of the commission, which operates within
the executive branch. The governor appoints the other four.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-page ruling focused specifically on one aspect of the law:
that the Assembly speaker and Senate Rules Committee not only have
the power to appoint a majority but, more important, have the
authority to remove those commissioners "at will."</TE>
<TE>   "The flaw is that the unfettered power to remove the majority of
the commission's voting members and to replace them with others ...
makes them subservient to the Legislature," the ruling said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a practical sense," the justices wrote, "this
unrestrained power to replace a majority of the commission's voting
members, and the presumed desire of those members to avoid being
removed from their positions, allows the legislative branch not only
to declare the law but also to control the commission's execution of
the law and exercise of its quasi-judicial powers."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Uelmen, who follows the state Supreme Court from his post
at Santa Clara University's law school, predicted that the state's
highest court will take the case on appeal. "I don't think this is
the final word on the matter, he said. "I cannot imagine the Supreme
Court will leave it up to the Court of Appeal to invalidate the
entire Coastal Commission."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen R. Barnett, a state constitutional expert at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall School of Law, who had predicted the appeals court's
conclusion, expects that it will be upheld by the state Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   But Barnett said he was surprised that the Court of Appeal did not
simply strike the provision in the state Coastal Act that permits
lawmakers to withdraw coastal commissioners at will, rather than
issue a ruling that jeopardizes the future of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling, the justices italicized the words "may be removed
at the pleasure of the legislative branch," he said. "They almost
invite the Legislature to lop off that language. What surprises me is
that they didn't do it themselves by lopping off the provision in the
statute."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said the Supreme Court could take that step. He pointed
out that the high court also faces a thorny issue that was
sidestepped by the Court of Appeal: Will ruling the commission
unconstitutional be retroactive, thus undoing more than 100,000
building permits granted or denied by the commission in the last 27
years?</TE>
<TE>   "While Zumbrun and his friends will argue strenuously that the
decision would be retroactive, I doubt they will be," Barnett said.
"As a practical matter, those permits will not be undone. A lot of
parties have relied on those decisions and made substantial
investments. It would be legal chaos to undo them."</TE>
<TE>   Zumbrun, co-founder of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation,
said he has raised the same separation-of-powers arguments in
lawsuits over the years against the commission.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he presented them as part of a lawsuit he filed on
behalf of the Marine Forests Society, a nonprofit group that built an
artificial reef of old tires, plastic jugs and PVC pipe off the coast
of Newport Beach without getting the required permit from the Coastal
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission, which took a dim view of building a reef
with discarded tires and other "trash," issued a "cease and desist"
order for removal of the reef. Zumbrun argued in the case that the
commission cannot issue such an order because its makeup is an
unconstitutional intrusion by the Legislature into the executive
branch.</TE>
<TE>   The argument was embraced in April 2001 by Sacramento County
Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi, an appointee of then-Gov.
George Deukmejian, who sought during the 1980s to dismantle the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Kobayashi's order was upheld Monday by appeal court
Justices Arthur G. Scotland and Rodney Davis, both Deukmejian
appointees, and by Justice Ronald B. Robie, recently appointed to the
appeals court by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In targeting the makeup of the commission, the ruling turns what
had been thought to be the agency's strength into its Achilles heel.
The architects of the commission sought to make it independent of
political pressure by dividing the powers to appoint commissioners
among the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate Rules
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's independence has infuriated a succession of
governors as they found that they could not control an agency that
belongs to the executive branch. Even former Gov. Edmund G. "Jerry"
Brown Jr., an early champion of the Coastal Commission, grew angry
when he could not intervene on behalf of this then-girlfriend, singer
Linda Ronstadt, who wanted to build a seawall next to her Malibu
Colony home.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was cautious in his appraisal of the ruling, saying through
a spokesman that the commission must decide for itself what is the
best next step. "Gov. Davis recognizes that the Coastal Commission is
an independent body," said Bryon Tucker, an aide. "It provides a
valuable function in safeguarding our coast."</TE>
<TE>   During its monthly meetings, the commission acts like a planning
commission responsible for development decisions along the entire
coast. It routinely determines the fate of building permits for
oceanfront homeowners and real estate developers who often have
better luck gaining the assent of local planning commissions. But
many applicants have found it difficult to win over a majority of
coastal commissioners for projects that conflict with protections
outlined in the 1976 Coastal Act.</TE>
<TE>   Zumbrun, the building and real estate industries, the state Farm
Bureau and property rights advocates have long argued that the
commission has trampled on the rights of landowners and is
accountable to no one.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling stands, Zumbrun said he believes that such building
permits would be handled the way they were before the enactment of
the Coastal Act -- by city councils or by county boards of
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the old system argue that it resulted in unchecked
growth along the coast and prompted the voters in 1972 to approve
Proposition 20, the ballot initiative that first established the
coastal protections that the commission is supposed to enforce.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Massara, manager of the Sierra Club's coastal programs, said
he expects the Legislature to fix the constitutional problem by
forfeiting their power to remove commissioners at will.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Legislature will provide for fixed terms," Massara
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This case, ironically, could have the effect of making the
Coastal Commission more independent, and that was certainly not the
goal of Ronald Zumbrun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Commission Chairman Mike Reilly said the commissioners
would consider all of their legal options at their meeting in Los
Angeles, scheduled for next week.</TE>

<HD>New Law Gives Sex-Abuse Plaintiff the Means to Fight</HD>
<DH>A police officer who says he was molested by a priest
expects challenges to his faith -- and job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An hour or so before midnight, the two Oxnard police officers pulled
their cars alongside each other on a deserted road. Childhood friends
and former altar boys, they now patrolled the streets of La Colonia,
the working-class Latino neighborhood of their youth.</LD>
<LD>   That evening last fall, Manuel Vega bypassed the usual small talk
and asked his buddy about something that had been bothering him
lately. He wanted to know if his friend was also sexually abused by a
priest from their childhood.</LD>
<LD>   "Did Father Fidencio molest you?"</LD>
<TE>   Vega said his friend looked stunned, and then replied, "Springtime
in the sixth grade."</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, Vega found six other former altar boys who said
they had been molested by Fidencio Silva, a priest who was last
reported working in Mexico for his order, the Missionaries of the
Holy Spirit. In a television interview this year, Silva denied the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   But in the following months, Vega couldn't find an attorney to
take the case. Half a dozen lawyers turned him down, most saying he
didn't have a chance because his statute of limitations had run out.</TE>
<TE>   Then last March, one of the nation's more aggressive attorneys in
sexual abuse cases against the Roman Catholic Church agreed to take
up Vega's cause, playing the odds that California lawmakers would
pass a bill that would lift the statute of limitations in molestation
lawsuits for one year, beginning Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the gamble has paid off. With Vega and other survivors
acting as lobbyists, the California Legislature unanimously passed
the law this year.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of lawsuits are expected to be filed beginning Thursday.
But for the church, Vega may be among the most formidable of the
plaintiffs whose cases can now go forward: a lifelong Catholic,
married to a devout Catholic and father of two; winner of the Navy
and Marine Corps Medal for Heroism, the service's highest peacetime
award; police officer of the year; Navy reservist; revered in
Oxnard's Latino community; unafraid to speak publicly about his
claims of sexual abuse by a priest; and a police officer who has
found nine others with similar stories of alleged abuse by Father
Silva.</TE>
<TE>   "I give Manny Vega credit. If he can do it, others can," said an
alleged victim of another priest who decided to come forward because
of Vega's public stance. (The Times doesn't identify victims of
molestation if they prefer to remain anonymous.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vega's voice never falters when he talks about the details of the
alleged abuse or the ripple effects it has had on those around him,
including his mother, a lifelong Catholic. She wonders if she's to
blame for her son's alleged abuse. She has stopped going to church
and cries as she drives by her former parish.</TE>
<TE>   "In my job, I see a lot of victims -- from someone who loses their
cell phone to people dying in my arms," said Vega, a compact man with
a military-style haircut, wide face and friendly smile. "I'm not
going to be a victim. Something inside of me said, 'No, I'm not going
to let it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Archdiocese said it will contest the new law,
arguing that lifting the statute of limitations is unconstitutional
and unfairly singles out the Catholic Church. Still, officials say
they are committed to helping molestation victims, no matter how old
the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to providing counseling and support, the archdiocese
believes that legitimate victims of sexual abuse by clergy deserve
consideration of compensation for their suffering," spokesman Tod
Tamberg said. "This was true prior to the passage of [the new state
law], and it is true today."</TE>
<TE>   As an altar boy, Vega said, he was molested by Father Silva from
about age 12 to 15 in a variety of settings: the church, the
sacristy, the rectory and on outings to the beach and mountains.</TE>
<TE>   For almost two decades, Vega said, he pushed the memories into his
subconscious. After graduating from high school in 1984, he spent
close to nine years in the Marines, working as a sniper. In 1989, he
rescued men from a helicopter crash that killed 19 Marines. It wasn't
until he left the military in 1992 and entered the Los Angeles Police
Academy that memories of the alleged molestation began to surface
during training classes on how to handle incidents of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife were married in the Catholic Church, but he kept
making excuses for not attending Sunday Mass. Two years ago, he told
his wife about the alleged abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a relief because I didn't have to continue making
excuses," Vega said. "But it bothered me then and bothers me now that
the church that had been a staple of my life was taken away from me."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last year, he weighed the potential fallout from his
public disclosure , and decided to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I lose respect on the street?" Vega recalled asking
himself. "What will my fellow officers and family say? How is this
going to test everyone's faith?"</TE>
<TE>   Vega said the emotional effects of childhood molestation don't
necessarily conform to the current statute of limitations, which
allows lawsuits to be filed until the age of 26 or three years after
you first realize the link between physical and emotional damage and
the sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "At least for me, it wasn't until this particular year that I
realized exactly what happened," said Vega, 36. "And there was no
ignoring it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After finding seven other alleged victims, Vega met with them
around the dining room table in his Oxnard home. The group included
two other police officers, two corporate executives and an attorney.
Eventually, two more alleged victims came forward. Vega and the other
men filed suit in May, knowing that they could not proceed very far
without a change in the law. So Vega went to Sacramento to lobby
lawmakers and testify before committees for the need for legislation
that allowed the statute of limitations to be lifted in molestation
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I personally helped get that law passed," Vega said. "The
new law ... will bring a sense of closure to the victims but not to
the priests. They will still have to answer to God. "</TE>

<HD>Avalanche Victim Was 'Very Fond' of Outdoors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A lifelong outdoorsman, Donald J. Dovey had climbed nearly every
major mountain in the Northwest, from Mt. Hood to Mt. Rainier.</LD>
<LD>   But on a no-name mountain in the Cascade Range, the 37-year-old
was one of a group of backcountry skiers caught up in an avalanche
Sunday that killed the Seattle man and injured another man on a trip
organized by the Mountaineers, a Seattle-based outdoor recreation
club.</LD>
<LD>   "He was very fond of the mountains, summer and winter," said his
mother, Ellen Dovey, of Keizer, Ore.</LD>
<TE>   Dovey had been in a group that was skiing down a slope in the
Norse Peak Wilderness Area, just east of the Crystal Mountain ski
area, when the avalanche occurred.</TE>
<TE>   A witness perched on a ridge top watched as the skiers made their
way down the slope, said the ski area's general manager, John
Kircher, who spoke with the witness. The last pair appeared to
trigger the avalanche, which enveloped one of those skiers as well as
three others. Three of the skiers were able to dig themselves out.
They found the fourth, Dovey, buried under 5 feet of snow. Dovey's
companions attempted CPR, but they were unable to revive him.</TE>

failing to ensure the safety of 14 migrant workers who died in a van
crash north of Portland.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department also said it has begun working to revoke the

<HD>Reelection Strategy Alters Bush Team</HD>
<DH>The president administration prepares for 2004 with new
economic policymakers and the departure of aides ready to serve him
outside of government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>With careful pruning and a shifting of responsibilities, the Bush
administration is transforming itself as the White House prepares for
the 2004 presidential campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Showing that it has learned from the failure of the president's
father to win reelection in 1992, the administration has weeded out
members of the economic team who weren't supportive enough of
President Bush's program.</LD>
<LD>   But beyond the economic issue, so often cited as the reason for
the failure of the elder Bush that it has become a political cliche,
the administration learned the importance of organizing the staff --
both inside and outside the White House -- long before the reelection
campaign actually begins.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, a lineup that remained largely unchanged for two years has
been reshaped by the departure of several of its top members -- some
voluntarily, some under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a White House staff focused on the top priority --
winning Bush's reelection, should he seek a second term -- with some
of the departing members positioned to work on the campaign from the
outside, free of the constraints on political activity while on the
government payroll.</TE>
<TE>   According to Paul C. Light, an expert on government staffing at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, this White House has taken a
page from the Clinton administration's playbook in which successful
politics means governing while conducting a "permanent campaign."</TE>
<TE>   During its first two years, the Bush White House was well staffed
with the veterans -- Karen Hughes, Mary Matalin, Joe Allbaugh and
Karl Rove -- who helped elect a Texas governor with only one term in
office when he began his quest for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," said Light, "there's a logical reshuffling outward toward
the political apparatus, and a gut-check about who's able to go the
distance for 2004."</TE>
<TE>   But, he asked, is it necessarily the right lineup?</TE>
<TE>   New Kind of Campaign</TE>
<TE>   "The team that gets an obscure governor from Texas elected
president is not necessarily the right team to get a sitting
president reelected," Light said. As "the personification of the
government, not an outsider, Bush will need a more sophisticated
strategy this time around," he added.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, each of those leaving has individual reasons: Hughes,
counselor to the president, headed back to Texas during the summer so
her son could attend high school in his home state; Matalin,
counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney, is leaving early next month
to spend more time with her young daughters and return to the
lucrative political punditry circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Both will be available if Bush seeks their help. Hughes, for
example, was frequently at the president's side during his extensive
travels during this fall's congressional campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   And Allbaugh, who served as chief of staff when Bush was governor
and then managed the 2000 presidential campaign, is leaving as head
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in March, with the
widespread anticipation that he will be deeply involved in any
reelection drive.</TE>
<TE>   Only Rove, Bush's senior political counselor, will remain on the
government payroll, positioned to oversee the work of the White House
where policy and politics intersect.</TE>
<TE>   But Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey,
the president's chief economic advisor, were given no choice about
their departures. Looking for representatives of the administration's
economic policy who were more in sync with cutting taxes and
stimulating economic growth, the president and his political aides
decided that those two had to go.</TE>
<TE>   A veteran Republican lobbyist who has served in two
administrations and counseled two others put the departures of
O'Neill and Lindsey earlier this month as one of the most important
early campaign moves Bush could make. Assembling an economic team for
2004 means that Bush must have "the right image and the right
spokespeople" in an arena that is consistently one of the voters'
greatest concerns, the lobbyist said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the two were pressured to leave, Bush named railroad
executive John W. Snow as his choice for Treasury secretary and
Stephen Friedman, a Wall Street chieftain, as his economic advisor.</TE>
<TE>   John Podesta, who served multiple roles in the Clinton White House
and completed his tenure there as President Clinton's last chief of
staff, said the economic team's transformation "was absolutely
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   "The only real question was, would Bush's vaunted loyalty to his
staff overcome political sensitivity?" he asked. "They proved that
political sensitivity took precedence."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton underwent a similar Cabinet shift in 1994, two years
before his reelection campaign, though his first Treasury secretary,
Lloyd Bentsen, resigned voluntarily. Robert E. Rubin, who had been
head of Clinton's national economic council and the public face of
the administration's successful effort to revive the economy in 1993,
stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   But Clinton, too, tuned up the West Wing: Thomas "Mack" McLarty
was replaced as chief of staff by Leon E. Panetta, director of the
Office of Management and Budget and a former Democratic congressman
from California. Harold M. Ickes, a longtime Democratic activist, and
Douglas B. Sosnick, a national party official, also took senior
roles.</TE>
<TE>   That meant two trusted political operatives were within feet of
the Oval Office. And in Panetta, Clinton had the advice and political
sensitivities of an expert on the budget and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The political team was strengthened," Podesta said. "There was a
strong integration of the communications side with the policy
development side, and Clinton was out on the road talking about his
initiatives."</TE>
<TE>   Podesta looks with respect on the way Bush and his advisors are
positioned, calling them "a muscle-bound political team." The first
President Bush brought in Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire as his
initial chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   When Sununu flamed out, he was replaced with a Chicago utility
executive, Samuel Skinner. He too, failed.</TE>
<TE>   With only months until the election in 1992, in came Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, returning to the position he held at the
start of the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too late," Podesta said. Too much ground had been lost.</TE>
<TE>   But the need to put an effective team in place within the White
House and beyond at the very start of a reelection drive has not been
lost on those who would follow.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking privately about the importance of having the right staff
conveying the right message -- and having both in place long before
the voters are thinking about an election -- one senior Bush advisor
reflected on the elder Bush's campaign, through which a number of
current White House aides had struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "We learn from our mistakes," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Gone, but still players</TE>
<TE>   The Bush White House has been reshaped by the departure of several
top advisors. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Joe Allbaugh</TE>
<TE>   Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency. Leaving in January.
Allbaugh served as chief of staff while George W. Bush was Texas
governor and managed the 2000 presidential campaign; he is expected
to play an important role in any reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Hughes</TE>
<TE>   Counselor to the president. Went back to Texas last summer so that
her son could attend high school in his home state. She remains close
to Bush and played an active role in the 2002 congressional campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Matalin</TE>
<TE>   Counselor to the vice president. Leaving in January to spend more
time with her two young daughters; she is expected to return to the

<HD>Freedom Like a Holiday, Dissident Says</HD>
<DH>'It's like the Big Apple dropping in my heart,' Xu Wenli
says from New York, where he is celebrating his release from a
Chinese prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enjoying his first tastes of Western freedom with a holiday visit
here, prominent Chinese dissident Xu Wenli said Monday that his
release last week from prison felt like a holiday celebration of his
own.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like the Big Apple dropping in my heart," he said in Times
Square, a day before the traditional Big Apple ball was set to drop
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   China freed Xu, 59, on Dec. 24, when he left a Beijing prison
boarded a flight to the U.S. with his wife, He Xintong, 55.</LD>
<TE>   He had been jailed since 1998 for helping to organize an
opposition party. He had earlier spent 12 years in prison on a 1982
conviction for activities stemming from participation in the 1979
Democracy Wall movement.</TE>
<TE>   "In jail, because I was a dissident, a political prisoner, I was
very isolated. I was in a jail within a jail," Xu said, adding that
he was observed constantly by eight cameras in his cell.</TE>
<TE>   Now missing several teeth and suffering from Hepatitis B, Xu is
nonetheless quick to smile and happy to be reunited with his wife and
daughter, Xu Jin, 30, a teacher in Providence, R.I., where he plans
to live. With his daughter acting as interpreter, Xu said one of the
first clues of his release came from guards who took his photo Dec.
17.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, they ordered him to pack his books, shower and
change into new clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "They never told me where I was going or that I was released," he
said. "I got on the plane, and my wife was there and I was very happy
to see her, and about a half minute later we took off."</TE>
<TE>   Xu said he wanted to send a message to those left behind: "I would
like to say to my friends who are fighting for Chinese democracy and
still in jail to remember that we, the ones on the outside, in
Western society, will try our best to help and support their families
and their release."</TE>

<HD>5 Use Copter to Break Out of Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>Five prisoners broke out of a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico
on Monday, clambering onto a roof where a helicopter landed to swoop
them away, local authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police described the prisoners as "very dangerous" and said they
were all serving sentences in excess of 100 years for murder and
other crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Two unidentified men rented the helicopter from Caribbean Helicorp
in San Juan, telling company representatives they needed to inspect
construction work in the southern city of Ponce.</LD>
<TE>   As they approached Ponce, they forced the pilot at gunpoint to
land on the roof of Las Cucharas prison, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The prison break occurred during a morning recreation period. The
five prisoners fled the recreation area and scrambled onto the roof,
where the helicopter was awaiting them.</TE>
<TE>   The copter flew them to a remote area in the Caribbean island's
central mountains, where the group escaped, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot, whose name was not released, then called police with
his cellular telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extremely worrisome event," said Corrections Secretary
Miguel Periera, a former police chief who took over his new post
earlier this month. "In no way will the Corrections Department rest.
We will work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until we find the
fugitives and arrest those responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Periera promised an exhaustive investigation of internal security
at the prison, because authorities believe the fugitives may have had
help from guards within the institution.</TE>
<TE>   One guard was immediately suspended for failing to properly
supervise the recreation area.</TE>
<TE>   Periera said police and correction agents were conducting a large
manhunt in the area where the fugitives are believed to have been
released.</TE>
<TE>   They identified them as Orlando Valdes Cartagena, Jose A. Perez
Rodriguez, Victor Gonzalez Diaz, Hector Marrero Diaz and Jose M.
Rojas Tapia.</TE>

<HD>Filipino Indicted in U.S. Election Case</HD>
<DH>The lawmaker is accused of making campaign donations to

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Filipino congressman accused of making illegal campaign donations
to former President Clinton and other Democratic politicians appeared
in court Monday for the first time since arriving in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   Mark B. Jimenez, dressed in an olive jail uniform, spoke only to
identify himself during a brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Ted
Bandstra. Lawyers for Jimenez are scheduled to request his release on
bond today.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a U.S. extradition request, Jimenez, who turns 56 today,
voluntarily left the Philippines last week. A federal indictment
alleges that Jimenez used corporate money to reimburse employees for
illegal donations to Clinton and other politicians.</LD>
<TE>   The employees worked for a computer-parts distribution business
owned by Jimenez and a company owned by a relative; both were based
in Miami. Jimenez was accused of illegally routing $50,000 to the
Democratic National Committee and $33,500 to campaign committees.</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 to 1996, the money went to Clinton, Sens. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Senate
candidates Roger Bedford in Alabama and Thomas Strickland in
Colorado, and House candidate Ann Henry in Arkansas, the indictment
said.</TE>
<TE>   As a citizen of the Philippines, Jimenez could not legally
contribute to American political campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing Monday, attorney Abbe Lowell asked prosecutors
to release records of a medical exam conducted after his client
arrived Sunday at Miami International Airport. Lowell later declined
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez, who is being held at a federal facility in Miami, faces
arraignment Jan. 13. Two Filipino congressmen -- Prospero Pichay and
Willie Villarama -- have traveled to Miami to support Jimenez.</TE>

<HD>Poll Finds Most Wary of Tax Cuts, War</HD>
<DH>Public fears deeper deficits, effects of Iraq conflict.
Many also voice spending worries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two out of three Americans believe it's prudent to hold off on more
tax cuts, a centerpiece of President Bush's domestic policy agenda,
an Associated Press poll found.</LD>
<LD>   They greet the new year more cautious about their personal
spending, yet almost 44% were somewhat optimistic that their
financial situations will improve.</LD>
<LD>   On the international front, the poll found people wary of a war
with Iraq and much more likely to view Osama bin Laden and his Al
Qaeda network as threats than Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   Those anxieties were voiced by Joanne Arriola, a 62-year-old
retiree from a utility company in Butte, Mont. She's seen her
retirement fund reduced sharply by the troubled economy, worries
about the effects of a war in Iraq and is convinced that war will
return to America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a scary new year," she said. "My children are too old to go,
but a lot of young people aren't.</TE>
<TE>   "When the war starts, it will start here too. I think that once
we're in the war, we're going to see something on our soil."</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds said they were worried that war with Iraq would
increase chances of a terrorist attack in the United States, said the
poll conducted by ICR/International Communications Research of Media,
Pa. The poll of 1,008 adults was taken Dec. 13-17 and has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   On economics, even most Republicans interviewed said it would be
better to hold off on tax cuts to avoid deeper deficits. The White
House is putting together tax cuts that could total $300 billion.</TE>

<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A 68-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter for allegedly
punching an older man as they stood in a line for movie tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Irving Rosenberg, 74, who reportedly had told Seymour Schuss' wife
to "shut up," hit his head on the pavement when Schuss allegedly hit
him Nov. 8. He died Nov. 24.</LD>
<LD>   Schuss, who was arrested on a battery charge Nov. 18, surrendered
Monday after the charge was upgraded. He was released Monday on
$10,000 bond, a Broward County sheriff's spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, Schuss could face up to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Schuss is a decent, nonviolent man who's terribly broken up,"
said his attorney, David Sale. "Two families have really been
destroyed as a result of this unfortunate incident."</TE>

<HD>New York Law to Stamp Out Most Public Smoking</HD>
<DH>Citing worker health, mayor signs one of the nation's
toughest bans on lighting up in public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday followed California in signing
one of the nation's most stringent antismoking laws.</LD>
<LD>   The measure bans smoking in all restaurants, most bars and
virtually all public places. It takes effect in 90 days.</LD>
<LD>   "The bill puts New York City in the forefront of the global effort
to protect workers from the deadly effects of secondhand smoke and to
stop the epidemic of tobacco-related illnesses," the mayor said
during a City Hall ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody knows the success of the California prohibition against
smoking in bars and restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   New York's law was passed after fierce opposition from the tobacco
industry and some bar owners. These bar owners had claimed that their
businesses would suffer, while some smokers argued that their civil
rights would be violated.</TE>
<TE>   But Bloomberg said Monday that the new law doesn't take away
anyone's rights.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was forced to cut back his proposal for a complete
smoking ban after he faced significant opposition in the City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a compromise. Unlike California and Delaware, which
have all-encompassing statutes, New York's law contains exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking will still be allowed in owner-operated bars with no
employees, cigar bars and in separate rooms in bars with special
ventilation systems and other safeguards. The law forbids employees
from entering these rooms. Smoking also is permitted in private clubs
with no workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's bill signing is a historic event in New York City," the
mayor said. "No one should have to choose between their health and
their work."</TE>
<TE>   The bill that Bloomberg signed expanded a 1995 law that banned
smoking in restaurants containing more than 35 seats. That law
allowed smoking in stand-alone bars, the bar areas of restaurants,
private offices and in lounge areas of performance halls and sports
arenas.</TE>
<TE>   These and some other exemptions were eliminated. The new measure
completely forbids smoking in all restaurants, office buildings,
sports arenas, auditoriums, billiard and bingo halls, and bowling
alleys.</TE>
<TE>   A number of City Council members who supported the new legislation
spoke along with Bloomberg at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   But the most vivid language warning of the dangers of smoking came
from Dr. Colin McCord, assistant commissioner for chronic disease and
tobacco control at the city's Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 40 years before I took this job, I practiced
surgery -- mostly chest surgery," the physician said. "During this
span, at a conservative estimate, I have personally cared for more
than a thousand persons dying from tobacco-related disease. Usually,
there was nothing much the medical profession could do to help them.</TE>
<TE>   "This story is not unusual. Most doctors who have practiced in the
last 50 years have had a similar experience."</TE>
<TE>   Health department statistics show that 10,000 New Yorkers die of
tobacco-related causes each year. One thousand of these people died
because of exposure to secondhand smoke. McCord said the health
department conducted a survey this year which showed that 400,000 New
Yorkers are exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg gave up smoking cigarettes and cigars 17 years ago.</TE>

<HD>They Had a Commitment to Yemen, Despite Danger</HD>
<DH>The victims thought of coming home, but their focus always
remained the people they served.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the Southern Baptist hospital in the remote Yemeni town of Jibla
entered its final shaky week of existence, three of its American
stalwarts talked openly about coming home.</LD>
<LD>   Still enamored of Yemen after 24 years of living there, Dr. Martha
Myers dropped hints that she wanted to return stateside to visit her
ailing mother. Administrator William Koehn planned an October
retirement. And Kathleen Gariety expected she would not last long in
her purchasing agent's job once the hospital's Baptist officials
turned over its administration to a Yemeni charity.</LD>
<LD>   The transition was less than two days off when the trio sat down
Monday in a conference room on the edge of the hospital's fraying
quarters. Within minutes, they were gunned down at close range by a
suspected Islamic extremist -- a searing act of violence that
traumatized Baptist missionary officials and relatives of the victims
thousands of miles away in the U.S. It also left the hospital's
future in further doubt.</LD>
<TE>   "These were wonderful people who realized they were in a dangerous
place," said John Wikman, a retired missionary doctor who worked in
the Jibla hospital and recently tried to find another American
charity to run the facility there. "They were willing to put their
lives on the line because they loved the people they helped."</TE>
<TE>   Myers, 57, was known for driving alone for miles into Yemen's
dangerous hill country, setting up impromptu clinics for women and
children desperate for immunizations and checkups. Koehn, 60, was a
steady financial hand who delighted Yemeni families with gifts from
his wood-carving shop. Gariety, 53, had urged friends at home to find
a way to keep her hospital intact as a Baptist institution.</TE>
<TE>   The missionary hospital in the distant mountainous central region
of Yemen had survived nearly 40 years of shaky funding, rising
Islamic fundamentalism and growing international tension only to
succumb in recent months to an internal decision by Southern Baptist
officials to pull the plug.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 1, Wikman said, the hospital was scheduled to be taken
over by a local Muslim charity. Missionary physicians would be
allowed to continue in their posts, but most of the administrative
tasks were to be assumed by Yemeni officials.</TE>
<TE>   The "unrealistic costs of owning a hospital like this" forced the
move, said Rick Evans, pastor of Dalraida Baptist Church, Myers' home
base in Montgomery, Ala. Southern Baptist Missionary officials "felt
we could better invest the money in other work and turn the hospital
administration over to the Yemeni people."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the hospital's missionary staff wanted to stay on in
Jibla, Wikman said, despite repeated alerts from U.S. Embassy
officials in recent months and mounting security concerns about
terrorism that forced hospital staffers to protect themselves with
teenage security guards armed with assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Myers had survived a kidnapping attempt by Yemeni bandits four
years ago but happily returned after a year of counseling in the
U.S., Evans said. Like many among the 40 American and international
missionaries working for the hospital, Myers was willing to stay on
after Jan. 1 and work for Yemeni administrators -- an indication,
Wikman said, of "their commitment to Yemen."</TE>
<TE>   But the Americans preferred to continue as a Southern Baptist
facility, disheartened as the end of the year's uncertainty neared.
"They were bouncing up and down hoping they could keep things the way
they were," Wikman said.</TE>
<TE>   Privately aching for a last-minute reprieve, Gariety's final
e-mails to Wikman grew pensive last week as it became obvious that
there were no financial angels willing to step in and retain the
facility's Southern Baptist affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   "She was kind of down, but she was still hoping," Wikman said.</TE>
<TE>   As the slain missionaries' fates became known Monday, friends and
relatives remembered them for their loyalty to the country and to
their patients. "This was an attack by some outside individual," said
Randal Pearce, who is married to Koehn's daughter, Janelda, "but it
wasn't the Yemeni people."</TE>
<TE>   Koehn and his wife, Marty, had lived in Yemen since 1975, a decade
after the hospital opened in Jibla. Pearce, who lives in Arlington,
Texas, said the Koehns' other daughter, Samantha, also lives in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Koehns stayed on in Jibla "through all the good times and
tough times," Pearce said, because "he loved the people there, he
loved the work he did."</TE>
<TE>   Once known as a surgical center and inpatient facility that served
Yemen's entire central region, the Jibla facility began scaling back
its operations three years ago after the Southern Baptist
Convention's International Mission Board in Richmond, Va., closed its
medical beds and shut down its obstetrics ward, Wikman said.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that the hospital soon would come under Yemeni control,
Gariety's family had urged her to come home after six years at Jibla.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned for several weeks last summer to pack medical
supplies collected in Milwaukee and bound for the Jibla hospital, "we
tried hard to get her to stay home," said her brother Jerome J.
Gariety Jr. "She wouldn't hear of that."</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Gariety told Wikman that she probably would be sent home
once her job was taken over by a Yemeni. But she wanted to stay,
hoping as late as last weekend that Wikman might find another
American or international missionary agency willing to take on the
hospital's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the downsizing, Myers kept up her perilous drives through
the mountains around Jibla, befriending scores of Yemeni families.
Myers, fluent in Yemen's language and culture, "not only was able to
say the words, she was able to get her heart across," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Myers' death stunned parishioners in Montgomery. "They're
heartsick," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   So were Myers' anguished parents. Her father, Ira Myers, retired
director of the Alabama Department of Public Health, stood, chin
trembling, inside Evans' church as he told reporters that his
daughter had come to feel that Yemen was her home.</TE>
<TE>   "She had the opportunity to talk to the native women. That would
not have been possible for a male doctor in that culture," Ira Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Myers had hinted by e-mail that she was planning to come
home in January to visit her mother, Dorothy, who had battled
pancreatic cancer for the last year. Instead, the parents learned at
1:45 a.m. from Southern Baptist officials that she had been shot to
death.</TE>
<TE>   When Evans came to their house in Montgomery on Monday, the
saddened mother was the first to speak. "Martha beat me home," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Passport Smuggling Inquiry Sparks Manhunt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Information from a passport smuggling investigation set off a
nationwide search for five men of Middle Eastern origin who may have
entered the United States from Canada on Christmas Eve, an FBI
official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A White House spokesman said the intelligence came from an
anti-terrorism investigation, but the official and an FBI spokesman
said they could not link -- or rule out -- a connection to a
terrorist plot or cell.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI released photographs of five men Sunday in hopes they
would be recognized. However, bureau spokesman Ed Cogswell
acknowledged that the FBI is not certain that the names and birth
dates released with the photos are correct, or that the men even
entered the country.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, federal and local officials are taking no chances.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Customs Service spokesman Dean Boyd said inspectors along the
U.S.-Canada border have stepped up their vigilance, asking more
questions and increasing the number of vehicle and cargo inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence information on the men came from an investigation
into a worldwide smuggling operation that brings individuals with
illegal passports into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects of the manhunt are not those who ran the operation
but likely are people who may have been smuggled across the border,
Cogswell said.</TE>
<TE>   The search comes just before large crowds gather for New Year's
Eve celebrations. The nation's color-coded terrorism alert system
remains at yellow -- the third of five levels.</TE>

42 years of wandering aimlessly in the desert, his Angels won it all.
He would have been thrilled by Manager Mike Scioscia's attention to
fundamentals, the team's refusal to quit, the red sea that engulfed
Edison Field in October and the fans' slow but sure mastery of
inflatable plastic "noise sticks." He probably would've had enough of
the Rally Monkey, though.</LD>
<LD>   2. Soccer Nation</LD>
<TE>   The United States in the final four of the World Cup -- the men's
World Cup -- in our lifetime? It almost happened. It should have
happened, with the Americans outplaying Germany in the quarterfinals
and putting such a scare into the perennial soccer power that several
German players fell to their knees to give thanks after barely
holding on for a 1-0 victory. Inspired, the Galaxy also went where it
had never gone before -- winning its first MLS Cup in four tries.</TE>
<TE>   3. Old Men at the Open</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras was done, washed up, over the hill, without a tennis
tournament championship in two years and headed for ESPN Classic when
the U.S. Open began. Six rounds later, Sampras was still there,
hanging around long enough to watch old rival Andre Agassi do him the
courtesy of dispatching dangerous Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals.
Then, in a final for the ages, the aged waged four sets of memorable
tennis before Sampras, incredibly, stood holding his 14th Grand Slam
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   4. The Carson Show</TE>
<TE>   Not much was expected of Carson Palmer and USC when the 2002
college football season began. Nothing much changed when the Trojans
lost to Kansas State and Washington State. But Palmer ran one great
half-season -- a sensational six-pack of games -- into some windfall:
a 6-0 finish, blowout victories over UCLA and Notre Dame, USC's first
Heisman Trophy in 21 years and the probable No. 1 pick in the 2003
NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   5. Red, White and a Shoe</TE>
<TE>   Nine months before the Angels, there were the snow angels, scraped
into the white-covered Foxboro Stadium turf after New England kicker
Adam Vinatieri had delivered the field goal to send the Patriots'
playoff game with Oakland into overtime, followed by the eventual
winner. Two weeks later, Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as
time expired to give the 14-point underdog Patriots a 20-17 Super
Bowl victory over St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   6. Tour de Lance 4.0</TE>
<TE>   That's some journey Lance Armstrong has traveled in winning four
consecutive Tour de France championships -- from miracle cancer
survivor in 1999 to proving it wasn't a fluke in 2000 to plowing
through what's-he-on? scrutiny in 2001 to winning over the skeptical
French in 2002. Next up: Miguel Indurain's record of five consecutive
Tour titles.</TE>
<TE>   7. L.A. Hoops (through Aug.)</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles swept the men's and women's pro basketball
championships for the second consecutive year, although the Lakers
had to struggle through Kobe Bryant's food-poisoning and Sacramento's
considerable home-court advantage to get to the finals, where they
swept just-glad-to-be-there New Jersey. Two months later, the Sparks
repeated as WNBA champions, capping an eight-month run in which UCLA
upset Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   8. Serena X 3</TE>
<TE>   French Open: Serena Williams over sister Venus in the final.
Wimbledon: Serena over Venus in the final. U.S. Open: Serena over
Venus in the final. Get used to it, because that is the future of
women's tennis, for as long as Venus stays interested and Serena buys
new cat suits she wants to trot out on her personal catwalks in
Melbourne, Paris, London and New York.</TE>
<TE>   9. Two at the Top</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods or Annika Sorenstam -- who had the better year? Woods
won the Masters and the U.S. Open, taking talk of a calendar-year
Grand Slam to the British Open, where all went well until the deluge
and his third-round 81. The next month at the PGA Championship, Woods
finished second, one stroke behind Rich Beem. Sorenstam won 11 LPGA
titles, among them the Kraft Nabisco Championship, leaving her within
two of Mickey Wright's 1963 record.</TE>
<TE>   10. Baseball Saves Itself</TE>
<TE>   Bucking odds and track records, and for once placing the game
ahead of their egos, Commissioner Bud Selig and players' union head
Donald Fehr hammered out an 11th-hour deal that spared baseball its
ninth work stoppage and kept the season going long enough for the
Angels and the Giants to salvage it with one of the sport's most
memorable endings.</TE>

<TE>   Foothill took on the region's best last weekend at the Corona del
Mar/Newport Harbor Holiday Cup and proved it's still the team to
beat. The Knights beat Newport Harbor, 8-7, in the title game, only a
few hours after defeating Corona del Mar, 10-7, in a morning
semifinal. In each game, the score was 7-7 in the fourth quarter, but
Foothill had the poise and experience to pull away. Santa Margarita
lost its final two games of the tournament, to Newport Harbor in the
other semifinal and Corona del Mar in the third-place game. Santa
Barbara, which lost in overtime to Santa Margarita in a nonleague
game Thursday, finished fifth in the tournament after defeating
Poway, 9-3.</TE>

rankings remain unchanged because the teams were in different
tournaments. Santa Ana won the Pacific Coast Championship in
Washington, Rosemead was fourth in the El Cajon Invitational, El
Modena finished sixth at the 89-team Sierra Nevada Classic in Reno
and Northview took second at the Leemore Bash. El Modena and Ayala
are among the 63 teams in this weekend's Ayala tournament, which also
includes San Diego Section power Vista and Central Section power
Clovis West. North Torrance and Rosemead will meet for the third time
this season during the 50-team North Torrance tournament, whose field

<HD>Rolly Polly to Be Challenged by This Well-Rounded Field</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>INSIDER TRAINING</AU>
<BD>BOB MIESZERSKI</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since coming to this country more than a year ago, Rolly Polly hasn't
lost in five sprints on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the Wildenstein Stable and trained by Bobby Frankel, the
Irish-bred filly hasn't exactly been dominant in those victories.</LD>
<LD>   Her 1 1/2-length win in the Safely Kept Handicap in her U.S. debut
Nov. 24, 2001 was her most decisive victory. Her four other wins have
come by less than a length. Two were by a nose.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Rolly Polly continues to get the job done and she will be
favored to close out 2002 with a win in the $100,000 Monrovia
Handicap at about 6 1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   A Grade III, the Monrovia drew 11 other fillies and mares -- after
also-eligibles Nanogram and Southern House were scratched --
including I'm The Business, who was a nose behind Rolly Polly in the
Sen. Ken Maddy Handicap on this course in October.</TE>
<TE>   Rolly Polly, a 4-year-old daughter of Mukaddamah, isn't the only
member of the Monrovia field who is unbeaten in three races on the
Santa Anita turf.</TE>
<TE>   Lil Sister Stitch, a 5-year-old Seattle Bound mare, also is
perfect and two of her wins have come at today's distance. Laffit
Pincay Jr., who scored his only Monrovia win with Little Happiness in
1978, will ride for trainer Doug O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Rolly Polly, three others in the field come off
wins.</TE>
<TE>   Pina Colada won a minor stake at Turf Paradise, Onslaught won over
a sloppy track at Golden Gate Fields and Miss Puzzle won her first
U.S. start last month.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Santa Anita's fifth, a $70,000 allowance at a
mile on the turf, attracted a quality field of 11, including I Love
Silver, Fighting Falcon, Sumitas and Surprise Halo.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. The jockey finished the first four
days of the Santa Anita meet with a triple Sunday, winning with
favorites Maria's Mirage, Red Vintage and A Shortt Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Pietro Fede. The Florida-based trainer is four for 108
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Pennysenyen, Heaven's Treat
and Bastion in the sixth, singling Himalayan in the seventh, Rolly
Polly, I'm The Business, Lil Sister Stich and Les Yeux Mauves in the
eighth and Dam Bustn, Shark Fin Soup and Jink Williams in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/8. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.80/$43.40. Total money bet: $70.</TE>

<HD>10 WORST</HD>
<DH>A look at the 10 worst stories of 2002:</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1. Skategate</LD>
<LD>   Corruption at a figure skating competition? Reports of collusion
among figure skating judges, vote-swapping and score-fixing? Yeah,
and ice is cold and Salt Lake City has many Mormons. Something should
have been done years ago, but the best Olympic officials, spurred on
by a frothing media, could manage in 2002 was to mint another set of
pairs skating gold medals and let the second-place Canadians share
the first-place glory with the Russians. Still waiting for their
second set of gold medals: the 1972 U.S. men's Olympic basketball
team.</LD>
<LD>   2. Ted-sicle</LD>
<TE>   Ted Williams, baseball's last .400 hitter, dies at 83 and how do
his children choose to preserve his memory? By squabbling for months
about what to do with Dad's remains after son John Henry, claiming he
was acting on Ted's wishes, arranges to have Williams' body
cryogenically frozen and stored ... until when? Until baseball
expands again, diluting pitching staffs to the point where Ted, once
thawed, might be able to make another run at .400?</TE>
<TE>   3. Baseball, Juiced</TE>
<TE>   Former National League MVP Ken Caminiti claimed 50% of major
league players were on steroids. Jose Canseco put the figure closer
to 80%. With their sport under suspicion, the owners and players gave
the steroid issue lip service during labor talks, agreeing on a
toothless compromise that will do little to curb abuse. In the
meantime, can any recent home run or RBI record be viewed without
skepticism?</TE>
<TE>   4. Baseball Fans, Juiced</TE>
<TE>   Frustration over a possible baseball strike spilled over into
ugliness at Edison Field and other ballparks. But those displays were
dwarfed by the on-field assault of Kansas City Royal first base coach
Tom Gamboa by a father and his 15-year-old son, both shirtless, at
Comiskey Park. After their arrest, the father, William Ligue Jr.,
claimed to have been on five drugs at the time.</TE>
<TE>   5. Hootie's World</TE>
<TE>   This year's biggest mountain out of a molehill can be found in
Augusta, Ga., where Hootie Johnson, Augusta National chairman, went
public with a written request to open his males-only club to women
from Martha Burk, head of the National Council of Women's
Organizations. Johnson had three options: a) agree to admit a female;
b) reply privately to Burk that someday we'll look into it; or c)
alert the media and throw a tantrum. Because Hootie went with the
worst option on the board, we might never hear the end of it.</TE>
<TE>   6. Team USA at Worlds</TE>
<TE>   After finishing an embarrassing third at the 1988 Olympics, the
United States pushed for the inclusion of NBA stars in international
competition. From 1992 on, a succession of U.S. "dream teams" went
58-0 ... until the 2002 edition lost early to Argentina at the World
Championship, then again to Yugoslavia and tanked against Spain. What
now? Force the rest of the world to use only amateurs?</TE>
<TE>   7. L.A. Hoops (after Aug.)</TE>
<TE>   It was a sad off-season for the Lakers, who lost their legendary
play-by-play announcer, Chick Hearn, on Aug. 5. The regular season
that followed has produced a funk so severe that every basketball
team in Los Angeles has spun out of sync. The Lakers are 13-19, the
Clippers 12-18 and UCLA and USC are a combined 6-8.</TE>
<TE>   8. Egregiously Self</TE>
<TE>   Promoting Network</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people watch ESPN, but no one loves ESPN nearly as much
as ESPN. From hyping celebrations to itself (the ESPYs, the 25,000th
"SportsCenter") to virtually unwatchable programming ("Season on the
Brink," "Around the Horn"), the network has become so obnoxious and
self-absorbed, it's almost enough to drive a viewer over to Fox.
Almost.</TE>
<TE>   9. Road To Pretty Good Bowl</TE>
<TE>   Mediocrity ruled the NFL in 2002, producing a regular season in
which anyone could lose to anyone, .500 teams stayed in contention
until the final Sunday, 11-5 earned the No. 1 seeding in the AFC and
no team emerged as "Most Likely to Win the Super Bowl." Well, it used
to be super.</TE>
<TE>   10. No Longer a Staple</TE>
<TE>   What if they threw a women's tennis tournament and nobody came?
Staples Center nearly found out, as the early rounds of the
under-publicized, over-priced, confusingly titled Home Depot WTA
Championships were played out in front of dozens of spectators. You'd
find bigger crowds shopping for paint rollers on a Thursday at Home
Depot.</TE>
