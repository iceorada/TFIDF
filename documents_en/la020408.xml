<HD>Alternative Medicine Report Criticized</HD>
<DH>Study: Dissenters say findings of White House fail to
distinguish between therapies supported by science and those that are
unproven or fraudulent.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years and $2 million, the White House Commission on
Alternative and Complementary Medicine Policy recently released its
report, and it's probably no surprise it has stirred up as much dust
as alternative medicine itself has.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Stephen Barrett, who runs the "Quackwatch" Web site and has
been a vitriolic critic of the commission, called the report a
"complete scam" and "intellectually dishonest." Asked what should be
done with it, he replied: "It should be burned."</LD>
<LD>   Two of the 20 commissioners filed a separate statement to Health
and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, criticizing the
underlying "advocacy tone" of the report, which is based, they said,
on a presumption that "most CAM [complementary and alternative
medicine] interventions will be proven to be safe and effective."</LD>
<TE>   But in a letter published recently in the Washington Post, the
head of the commission, Dr. James Gordon, a psychiatrist and director
of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., defended
the report, saying it reflected "emphasis on the need to
scientifically investigate complementary and alternative therapies to
find out if they are safe and effective and cost-effective."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the controversy, it's unclear what impact the report
will have--although Gordon said he hopes it will lead to
congressional hearings. In March 2000 then-President Bill Clinton
mandated the commission, composed of mainstream doctors, nurses and
alternative practitioners, to develop recommendations to help
lawmakers and administrators make policy that "maximizes the
benefits" of complementary and alternative medicine. But that was in
another time.</TE>
<TE>   "Circumstances are very different now. We were at peace then, and
we had a surplus budget, and there was no such thing as
bioterrorism," said Dr. Joseph Fins, director of ethics at New York
Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan and one of the commissioners who
sent a letter to Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   For 18 months the commission held town meetings around the country
that included the testimony of more than 700 groups or individuals,
and it read more than 1,000 written submissions.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an inch-thick document that Gordon calls "a road map
for taking the next steps to determine ... what we know and what we
don't know about the benefits and hazards" of complementary and
alternative medicine. The recommendations call for:</TE>
<TE>   * Allocating more funds for research.</TE>
<TE>   * Creating an office within HHS to coordinate complementary and
alternative medicine research and activities.</TE>
<TE>   * Educating conventional health professionals in complementary
medicine and educating alternative practitioners in conventional
health care.</TE>
<TE>   * Making accurate information about complementary and alternative
medicine available and ensuring that products are safe.</TE>
<TE>   * Improving access to alternative practitioners and ensuring they
are accountable to the public.</TE>
<TE>   * Broadening insurance coverage for those practices shown to be
safe and effective.</TE>
<TE>   * Looking at complementary medicine in promoting wellness.</TE>
<TE>   But the dissenters said, despite last-minute changes, the report
still reflects a pro-complementary medicine mind-set that isn't based
on much science.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem is that it was a commission of advocates,
myself included,'' said Dr. Tieraona Low Dog of Corrales, N.M., who
along with Fins sent the dissenting letter. As a result, the
commission wouldn't take a stand about which alternative therapies
have a growing body of science behind them and those that were
unproven, possibly unsafe or downright fraudulent, said Low Dog, an
expert in herbs.</TE>
<TE>   "To not take a stand on some of these things that are quackery is
just nonsense," she said. Fins agreed. "We should try to identify
those things that are promising, and the key element is objectivity
and science, not partisanship and advocacy," he said.</TE>

<LD>Some folks collect stamps. Others collect baseball cards.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. John Svirbely and M.G. Sriram are passionate collectors,
too--of "medical algorithms." For years, they've enthusiastically
amassed the many mathematical calculators, scales and flowcharts that
doctors use to help figure out things like a patient's body mass
index, how tall a kid is likely to be as an adult or the severity of
a case of yellow toenail.</LD>
<LD>   Svirbely, a pathologist at McCullough-Hyde Memorial Hospital in
Oxford, Ohio, and Sriram, a San Francisco computer scientist, have
thousands of these handy tools compiled in a giant database that can
be found at www.medal.org. It wasn't meant  to get so big: "When we
started off," Svirbely says, "we thought there would be a couple of
hundred. But I never cease to be amazed at how many there are once
you start looking."</LD>
<TE>   There are tools for deciding if someone's tongue is oversized.
There are systematic methods for identifying ticks, parasitic worms
and "arthropods of medical importance." Ways to calculate--with a
click of a button--how much blood a particular patient can afford to
lose, if an injured limb is likely to recover, or how much oxygen
someone is likely to consume while walking, running or stepping.</TE>
<TE>   The fruits of hours spent surfing the Internet, thumbing through
medical journals and leafing through textbooks is far-ranging:
calculators and scales for seemingly everything a doctor could want
to assess a patient, from foot ("Grading of a Lateral Ankle Sprain")
to face ("Clinical Score for Acne Scarring") and in between ("A
Practical Score for the Early Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis").</TE>
<TE>   Has the Guinness Book of Records been informed? That, says
Svirbely, is not the point. The aim is to build a sort of one-stop
shopping resource for doctors who need, for example, to calculate a
drug dose for a patient or figure out what's crawling in his or her
hair. This, he says, could help cut down on medical errors--and make
it easier for doctors to use all the calculators and scales
languishing in the literature.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them probably should languish, Svirbely concedes. "A
forensic pathologist friend of mine laughed at some of the stuff I
put in the forensic pathology chapter--he said no one who's a
practicing pathologist uses them."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the measures, however, are  commonly used. For instance,
Dr. William K. Averill, a Torrance cardiologist and American Heart
Assn. spokesman, says cardiologists often use body-surface-area
calculations to figure out if someone's heart is pumping as much
blood as his or her body requires.</TE>
<TE>   The origins of the body-surface calculations illustrate how much
effort people put into creating all these algorithms. Body surface
calculations come from a string of experiments from 1916 onward in
which intrepid investigators did things like wrap cadavers and people
in sticky paper or foil, then measured how much it took to cover
them. Because covering patients in sticky paper is not clinically
practical, they figured out math that related the surface areas they
found to the height and weight of the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Medical calculators and other algorithms can be really useful,
says Dr. David Schriger, professor of emergency medicine at UCLA.
He's devised one himself to track needle-stick incidents for hospital
staffers. You tap in info such as the type of needle, type of injury,
source of contamination and health of the victim and get advice as to
how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "The CDC publishes a book roughly 80 pages long that describes how
to manage this, but who's going to read the book and remember it all,
or have time to read it when they need it?" Schriger says.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, doctors have to remember that medical
algorithms aren't perfect, he says. And doctors can't go nuts looking
everything up. "If I had to check every fact for every patient,
people would be dying out there waiting to see me," he says. "Chaos
isn't good--but neither is regimentation. You have to learn to live
in the middle."</TE>

<HD>Treadmill Test May Predict Hidden Heart Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Treadmill testing is sometimes ordered when a person has a warning
sign of heart trouble, such as chest pain. The idea is to see how the
heart responds to the stepped-up demands of pumping harder and faster
when exercising. Recently, researchers announced at the annual
meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta that
treadmill tests may also predict hidden heart disease in people with
no symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   Reviewing data from a 1970s study, the researchers looked at
treadmill tests done when the study began and death rates and cause
of death among the nearly 5,800 participants during the ensuing 20
years or so. Though none of the men and women had symptoms of heart
trouble when the original study began, 10% of the men, whose average
age was then 45, had abnormal test results. Thirty percent of the
women, whose average age was 53, had abnormal results.</LD>
<LD>   Over the following years, those who had abnormal results on the
treadmill tests were twice as likely to die of heart or vascular
disease as those whose tests were normal. Despite the predictive
value of the treadmill testing in this study, researcher Samia Mora,
a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, is not
suggesting that middle-aged people with no symptoms jump on the
treadmill to test their hearts just yet. She and her colleagues are
now looking at the value of exercise testing for high-risk people.</LD>

<TE>   Value of Talking About Loss Is Questioned</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Sigmund Freud wrote about the value of grief work, many
experts have believed that people who can express their emotions are
able to come to terms with death more readily than those who keep a
stiff upper lip. Now European researchers have found that talking or
writing about one's grief wasn't especially helpful.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, the Dutch and Belgium researchers asked more than
100 recently widowed people to respond to questionnaires at intervals
over two years. Researchers asked the study participants whether they
talked about their feelings with others and also about their general
psychological health. The scientists found that sharing thoughts and
feelings with others didn't appear to reduce symptoms of depression
or make the adjustment any easier.</TE>
<TE>   The authors point out, however, that the kind of sharing that
these people did differed from earlier studies in which bereaved
people wrote about their feelings, a more active way of getting in
touch with one's feelings. So they did another study involving asking
about 100 other people. At four and eight months after the death, the
volunteers were asked to write about their loss or the problems of
day-to-day life that had resulted, or both. The researchers found
that expressing emotions on paper was of little benefit and that the
writers were no better off than the control group that didn't do the
essays. People who have trouble adjusting to their loss may be
different from these volunteers, but, the researchers write, those
whose bereavement is uncomplicated "will cope with their loss in
their own time and their own way." (Journal of Consulting and
Clinical Psychology 2002, 70 (1), pp. 169-178.)</TE>

<TE>   Pancreatic Cancer Responds to Laser Light Therapy</TE>
<TE>   One of the newer weapons used to fight the war on cancer is
photodynamic therapy, or PDT. The treatment involves injecting a drug
that is absorbed more readily by cancer cells than healthy ones. When
light hits the photosensitized cells, they self-destruct.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved PDT for
esophageal cancer, a type of lung cancer, and precancerous lesions on
the skin. Clinical trials to treat several other malignancies are
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Now, PDT has shown promising results in fighting one of the most
formidable malignancies, pancreatic cancer. Researchers at the
National Medical Laser Center in London gave 16 people with
inoperable cancer Foscan, a photosensitizer used in Europe for
advanced oral cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, several needles were inserted through the
patient's skin into the tumor. A laser light was beamed into the
tumor in the pancreas along an optical fiber running through each
needle. As the needle was pulled back, another blast of light was
delivered until the entire tumor was covered. The light therapy
shrank tumors in all the patients initially, and they were able to go
home within 10 days of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the patients were alive a year after treatment; two
patients lived two years, which is longer than the average survival
rate of six to 10 months when the disease has not spread. All of them
were able to spend at least some of their last days at home with
their families, and only three spent more than 20% of their survival
time in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   PDT has a long way to go from this small study to being an
approved treatment for pancreatic cancer, says Steve Bown, a
professor at the Royal Free and University College Medical School in
London. He says the next step would be a study comparing the
effectiveness of PDT to conventional treatment, probably
chemotherapy. (Gut 2002: 50:549-557)</TE>

<TE>   Study Takes the Knife to Plastic Surgeon Ads</TE>
<TE>   The smart way to go about finding a plastic surgeon is to first
make a list of candidates, then check their credentials. You might
ask your friends, your family doctor or an operating room nurse you
happen to know for the recommendations. Then again, you might just
scan the ads in the Yellow Pages.</TE>
<TE>   That's what doctors who pay a steep price for space in the phone
book are hoping you will do. But many of the doctors who advertise
this way may be treading a thin line between informing the public of
their services and deceptive advertising, according to research in
the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.</TE>
<TE>   University of Michigan researchers asked 50 men and women to look
at 104 ads from the Yellow Pages in 10 cities, including Los Angeles
and San Diego, and answer questions about them. In their opinion, one
in four of the ads included images that were deceptive and created
unrealistic expectations. They felt that about one in five of the ads
appealed to a person's fears, anxieties or emotional vulnerabilities.
In general, the participants found 18% of the ads objectionable.</TE>
<TE>   The American Society of Plastic Surgeons does have a code of
ethics. But Edward Luce, president of the ASPS, said the code
"doesn't set the bar high enough for what we'd like to see." One
thing to watch for, he says, are ads that claim the surgeon has some
superior skill. Then, trust your instincts.</TE>
<TE>   "If an ad raises a question in a person's mind, they should listen
to that part of their brain," Luce says. (Journal of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery, 2002: 109 (3): pp. 1,181-1,186.)</TE>

<HD>Low-Fat Cheese Provides the Good Without the Bad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheese and beef are two of the biggest sources of saturated fat in
the American diet. In fact, 3 ounces of cheddar cheese has almost
twice as many calories, six times the saturated fat, and more
cholesterol and sodium than 3 ounces of a trimmed, broiled steak.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, when asked, most consumers say that cheese gives a
dish more flavor and provides more nutrition. Such attitudes are no
doubt why Americans consume about 30 pounds of cheese a year.</LD>
<LD>   Look at these numbers for 3 ounces of cheese (the size of a deck
of cards):</LD>
<TE>   * Gruyere: 336 calories, 26 grams of fat, 19 grams of saturated
fat</TE>
<TE>   * Cheddar: 342 calories, 28 grams of fat, 18 grams of saturated
fat</TE>
<TE>   * Monterey Jack: 369 calories, 30 grams of fat, 19 grams of
saturated fat</TE>
<TE>   * Swiss: 321 calories, 23 grams of fat, 15 grams saturated fat</TE>
<TE>   Now look at the amount of calcium you get in a 3-ounce serving of
each of these cheeses:</TE>
<TE>   * Gruyere: 819 milligrams</TE>
<TE>   * Cheddar: 612 milligrams</TE>
<TE>   * Monterey Jack: 738 milligrams</TE>
<TE>   * Swiss: 816 milligrams</TE>
<TE>   Even though most people don't eat 3 ounces of cheese at a sitting,
these are significant calcium numbers, especially for teenagers and
post-menopausal women who often get far less calcium than they
should.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams of calcium per day are recommended
for children age 9 and older; 1,000 milligrams for adults; and up to
1,500 milligrams for older adults.</TE>
<TE>   How do you keep from trading strong bones for clogged arteries?
The answer lies in the fact that reducing the amount of fat in cheese
does not necessarily reduce the amount of calcium (most 3/4-ounce
slices still contain 15% of the recommended daily amount).</TE>
<TE>   But, though it is easy enough to produce cheese with less fat (or
even no fat), it is tough to do without losing so much taste and
texture that nobody will want to eat it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if you put enough flavor around nonfat cheese, you will
hardly know the difference. For example, try a turkey sandwich made
on whole-wheat bread with lettuce, tomato, mustard, a nonfat cheese
slice and pickles; you'll never miss the fat. A typical fat-free or
"lite" single has 25 to 30 calories.</TE>
<TE>   If you are trying to cook with low-fat cheeses, the results may
vary, but here are some hints that might make it easier:</TE>
<TE>   * Use the cheese when it is cold (right out of the refrigerator),
and shred it finely.</TE>
<TE>   * Try to use low-fat cheeses in recipes that have a lot of
moisture from other ingredients. Using low-fat grated cheese in
lasagna or other casseroles usually works, but it may not melt
properly as a topping on pizza or garlic toast.</TE>
<TE>   * If you are trying to melt low-fat cheese, do it slowly and for a
longer time, stirring frequently. If you are trying to do this in a
microwave, put the cheese in a dish, cover with plastic wrap and use
a low setting.</TE>
<TE>   If you're looking for cheese that is naturally low in fat, try
some of the soft, unripened fresh cheeses. Cottage cheese made from
skim milk, part-skim ricotta and farmer cheese (also known as hoop,
pot or baker's cheese) do not have nearly the fat and sodium as hard
cheeses or some other soft cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer cheese, in particular, is wonderful for crumbling over
salads. It can be sliced and put on a sandwich and makes some of the
best blintzes. You can also add fruit to make a sweet dessert cheese
or mix in chopped chives and herbs to make a savory cheese to serve
with vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   One of the other ways to use hard cheeses such as Parmesan, Romano
and Asiago is to grate them into salads and other recipes; a little
goes a long way without providing too much additional fat. The
stronger the flavor, the less you need.</TE>
<TE>   One little-known fact about cheese is that eating cheddar and
other aged cheeses after eating sweets seems to counteract the
potential for cavities. Nobody can explain this, although it may be
that cheese stimulates the production of saliva, which might rinse
away the sugar. Or it may change the pH of your mouth. In any case,
cheese's fat and calorie loads mean that it is not a good substitute
for a toothbrush on a regular basis.</TE>

<HD>Landmark Study Tracks Heart Disease in Blacks</HD>
<DH>Cardiology: Researchers plan to follow 6,500 African
Americans in project aimed at ending 'unchecked epidemic.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blacks in the United States are more likely than whites to die of
heart disease--and at a younger age--and yet no one can say precisely
why.</LD>
<LD>   Although earlier diagnosis and improved treatment have contributed
to an overall decline in U.S. death rates from cardiovascular
illnesses during the past 30 years, blacks haven't shared in those
improvements. They continue to suffer high rates of potentially fatal
cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and stroke. Black men are
twice as likely as white men to die of heart disease before their
65th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have been aware of the growing problem of heart disease
among black Americans for 30 years, but they have had little evidence
to help explain the phenomenon and find better ways to target
prevention and therapies.</LD>
<TE>   Now researchers hope to fill that knowledge gap by embarking on
the largest population study of this overlooked group. The
$33-million project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health,
represents the federal government's recognition of an "unchecked
epidemic of cardiovascular disease in the African American
population," said Dr. Herman Taylor, director of the Jackson Heart
Study.</TE>
<TE>   The study is taking place in Mississippi, a state in which blacks
die more often of heart disease than any place in the nation. Cardiac
death rates for Mississippi blacks are higher than they were in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Most of what scientists know about the cardiac risk factors of
smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes comes
from the landmark Framingham Heart Study, an ongoing project that has
tracked men and women living in Framingham, Mass., a predominantly
white Boston suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Begun in 1948, the Framingham study was a product of its times,
when there was a perception "that African Americans were not as
vulnerable to [heart disease] as the rest of the population," Taylor
said. Information from death certificates at the time seemed to bear
out the belief that white men were the most frequent victims of heart
attacks. Framingham researchers began their work 16 years before
President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which sought
to assure equal treatment for minorities.</TE>
<TE>   As doctors' knowledge of heart disease has grown in recent years,
they've come to better understand the subtle differences associated
with gender, race and nationality. Doctors now know, for instance,
that women's heart attack symptoms are different from men's, and that
people living in Japan have different rates of heart disease compared
to Japanese living in Hawaii or the U.S. mainland.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, blacks began dying at a greater rate from heart
attacks than whites. Yet despite warning signs of a burgeoning public
health problem, no one undertook a large-scale study to pinpoint how
blacks might be uniquely affected by race, culture, economic status
and other factors. Before the launching of the Jackson study, Taylor,
a Harvard-trained cardiologist, said that whenever he attended
national meetings of black physicians there would be talk about the
need for a "black Framingham."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors, he said, want to understand "the peculiar excess of risk
that African Americans experience." They suspected that diet, poor
access to medical care and inadequate health insurance were
contributing factors, but they also were interested in genetic
underpinnings and environmental influences like stress and
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the NIH's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
became the lead sponsor of the Jackson Heart Study, launched in 2000
at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and two predominantly
black schools, Jackson State University and Tougaloo College.</TE>
<TE>   So far, researchers have signed up 1,700 of the 6,500 African
Americans between the ages of 35 and 84 they hope to recruit. Their
goal is to tease apart how much each of the various risk factors
contributes to coronary artery disease, heart attacks, congestive
heart failure and strokes, and at the same time, train more African
Americans for careers in minority health research.</TE>
<TE>   While still expecting to reach their enrollment goals, the
researchers note that they have had to overcome a great deal of
reluctance among blacks to participate in clinical studies. Those
feelings stem in large part from the Tuskegee scandal in Alabama,
where from 1932 to 1972, poor black men suffering from syphilis were
deceived by doctors and nurses who claimed to be treating them, but
instead used them to chart the course of unchecked disease.</TE>
<TE>   But the Jackson Heart Study is beginning to catch up with
aggressive community outreach, said Sonja Fuqua, director of
recruitment, who added that a big selling point is that participants
"are getting $4,000 of free medical care."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Malcolm P. Taylor, president of the Assn. of Black
Cardiologists, suggested that racial bias was at play during the many
years when prominent white doctors believed blacks "couldn't get
coronary artery disease."</TE>
<TE>   Even when it became clear that blacks were at higher risk than the
majority of the population, doctors still were not being trained to
recognize specific warning signs. That has since changed, he said,
with aggressive education efforts by major organizations such as the
American Heart Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of cardiac care for African Americans has its roots in
many problems, including doctors' ignorance, some discrimination, and
a lot of fear and denial.</TE>
<TE>   Tuskegee, contends 64-year-old Betty Jacobs-Gray of Los Angeles,
is the main reason many blacks have wanted nothing to do with federal
health studies. Yet, Jacobs-Gray, a semiretired registered nurse who
was raised in Greenville, Miss., supports such studies but regrets
that they've come too late to benefit people like her. She and an
aunt suffer from heart disease, and a grandmother and uncle died of
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We all fall dead, just boom, the heart blows itself out," said
Jacobs-Gray, who has had two angioplasties for blocked coronary
arteries. She believes that stress, culture, education and ignorance
about the disease all play a part in the higher death rates among
blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Her physician, Dr. David Ciraulo, medical director of the
cardiology department at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in
Inglewood, is hopeful that the Jackson Heart Study will not only
reveal some of the causes of heart disease among blacks, but also
help public health officials design programs to reduce coronary
artery disease.</TE>

<LD>Here's one candy you won't be popping indiscriminately: lollipops
laced with nicotine, the latest entry in the stop-smoking derby.</LD>
<LD>   Independent pharmacists across the country are making these
nicotine lollipops and selling them under brand names such as
NicoStop, No Smoke, NicoPop and Likatine. Many of the pops are being
sold over the Internet through druggists' Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   Most sites say a prescription is required, but critics fear that
it is possible to buy the products online without a prescription or
proof of age. "Nicotine is a strong and addictive drug, and should be
used only under the supervision of a health professional," says Carlo
Michelotti, chief executive of the California Pharmacists Assn. in
Sacramento. The nicotine-laced suckers, which sell for $2 to $3 each,
have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and it is
still unclear whether the marketing of such products violates any
federal laws. So far, the nicotine lollipops have avoided regulatory
scrutiny because they're made by compound pharmacists, licensed
druggists who produce custom medications like old-time apothecaries.
These pharmacists are allowed to make special formulations when
doctors request them for their patients, say experts. However,
marketing these products over the Internet crosses into a gray area
of questionable legality.</LD>
<TE>   But sales of the products--sold in flavors such as apricot, eggnog
and tutti-frutti--are soaring, according to pharmacists. The pops are
designed to take the edge off a person's cravings for nicotine as
they attempt to stop smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Ads on the Internet claim the lollipops work better than patches
or gum because they not only suppress tobacco withdrawal symptoms,
but give people more control over dosages. Pharmacists selling the
products also say that the pops help satisfy the hand-to-mouth oral
fixation that's part of the cigarette habit.</TE>
<TE>   The suckers have drawn the attention of government officials. Brad
Stone, an FDA spokesman in Rockville, Md., said the agency is looking
into such issues as the safety of the products' active ingredient,
nicotine salicylate. He also notes that, unlike stop-smoking gum or
skin patches, the lollipop formulations have not undergone rigorous
safety testing.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) sent a letter last Wednesday
to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson asking that
the lollipops be removed from the market until they're proven
effective. Another concern, said Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of
staff, is that the lollipops might appeal to children who might eat
them inadvertently.</TE>
<TE>   Still, pharmacists say they seem more effective than
over-the-counter remedies, like the patch or nicotine gum. "We've had
very positive results," said Jeffrey Alan Barris, owner of Pacifica
Pharmacy in Torrance, which has been selling the nicotine lollipops
for about two years. He sells about 200 suckers a month and estimates
that "70% to 80% of the people who use these lollipops stop smoking."
But, he cautions, "they should only be sold by prescription. They're
not candy."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the baseball and grilling seasons more or less upon us, two
different groups of researchers recently published studies with a
common message: Hot dogs may be worse for us than we thought.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, neither of these studies singled out hot dogs, but
rather all processed meats, from bacon to baloney. But summer isn't
far off, and Americans eat about 7 billion hot dogs between Memorial
Day and Labor Day, according to industry estimates. What's a guy
supposed to munch on with his beer at the ballpark? Sushi? No one
took this news harder than I did. I've been a devotee of the tube
steak since my childhood. On more than one Thanksgiving Day, after
serving roast turkey to the rest of my family, my mother would
present her picky-eater son with the only dish he would deign to eat,
a frankfurter on a bun. I'm not so fussy at the dinner table any
more, but I still love hot dogs.</LD>
<LD>   And while I've never kidded myself that franks and salami are
healthy treats, I've always been able to brush aside past studies
linking processed meats to cancer, since they usually involved small
groups of people.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes a report by researchers in France, published in the
International Journal of Cancer, that's hard to ignore. The French
team, a unit of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (part
of the World Health Organization), looked at the diets of about a
half-million Europeans. They found that people who eat a lot of
sausage, bacon and luncheon meats increase their risk for colon
cancer by about 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have long suspected that eating too much meat of any
kind encourages tumor growth in the gut. The French study had a
twist, however: People whose meat menu is mostly limited to fresh
cuts--steaks, lamb chops and veal cutlets, for instance--didn't seem
to put themselves in much danger. Eating a lot of processed meat,
however, was associated with "a moderate, but significant increase in
colorectal cancer risk," according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   When these findings were initially presented at a conference last
summer, some scientists cautioned that a single study doesn't
exonerate fresh meat as a potential influence on colon cancer. But
the study does heighten suspicions about the processed variety, in
particular. (Food companies protect meat from bacteria and preserve
its color by adding a form of salt, sodium nitrite, and to a lesser
extent, sodium nitrate.) When nitrites hit your belly, they combine
with naturally occurring compounds called amines to form
nitrosamines. Studies have shown that nitrosamines cause cancer in
lab animals. Despite the findings by the French scientists, however,
there is still no conclusive proof that humans run the same risk by
occasionally chomping on a hot dog or ham sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   In the other study published last month, Harvard researchers
offered the first credible evidence that eating too much processed
meat may increase the risk for type 2 diabetes. The team followed
more than 42,000 men, aged 40 to 75, for 12 years, periodically
asking them to describe the foods they ate. They concluded that men
who consumed processed meat at least five times a week were 46% more
likely to develop type 2 diabetes than men who rarely or never ate
the stuff.</TE>
<TE>   One of the study's authors, Dr. Frank Hu, an assistant professor
of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that eating
a lot of salty meats may simply be a sign that your overall diet
stinks. After all, people who frequently feast on frankfurters,
sausages and cold cuts tend not to be devotees of nutritious foods,
such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Hu suspects, however, that processed meats contain ingredients
that raise the risk for type 2 diabetes. Again, the culprit may be
nitrites. More study is necessary to confirm his theory, but he notes
that scientists have already detected an association between nitrites
and type 1 diabetes, which is the kind that most often afflicts kids.</TE>
<TE>   Hu swears he isn't out to spoil anyone's fun at ballgames or
cookouts this summer. In his study, after all, only men who ate cured
meats practically every day had an increased risk for diabetes.
"We're talking about high-frequency eaters," said Hu. "For people who
eat processed meats one or two times per week this shouldn't be a
major problem."</TE>
<TE>   I asked Hu if it was OK to eat hot dogs made from chicken or
turkey, but he seemed to think I was missing the point. Some chicken
and turkey dogs, after all, contain nitrites. You can, however, find
nitrite-free franks and cold cuts in some supermarkets and natural
food stores, so you might want to check the labels. More important,
Hu feels it's wise to eat less processed meat, period, and balance
your diet with fish, lean cuts of poultry and plenty of produce, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it's OK to savor a hot dog at the ballpark or
enjoy a deli sandwich now and then, as long as you don't bring home
the bacon too often.</TE>

<HD>Mastering Memory</HD>
<DH>It's normal to grow more forgetful with age, but that
doesn't mean we have to like it. Books and supplements--and science--
try to offer answers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's a sign of a mature mind when some of life's bigger
questions -- about love, faith, ambition--suddenly seem more
manageable than smaller ones, such as: Why did I just open the
refrigerator? Where on earth did I park my car? Where did I write
down that phone number?</LD>
<LD>   Then again, maybe it's a sign of something else.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people can't find their keys, others are forgetting
everything. We see all kinds," said Celeste Bocian, who runs a free
memory screening program at Sherman Oaks Hospital. The program
attracts adults of almost all ages, even people in their 30s.</LD>
<TE>   Who can blame them? Starting around age 28, our scores on memory
tests decline steadily, researchers say; by 55, our ability to
associate names with faces or memorize new phone numbers has slipped
by about 20%. Almost everyone older than 40 has had a whopping lapse
or two.</TE>
<TE>   Yet our capacity for storing and retrieving information does not
sift away like sand through an hourglass, as neurologists once
believed. On the contrary, new research suggests that, when
stimulated in the right way, brains of almost any age can give birth
to cells and forge fresh pathways to file away new information. This
emerging picture has not only encouraged those who treat and care for
the 5% of older adults who have dementia such as Alzheimer's disease,
but it has also generated a wave of optimism among those studying
memory changes in the other 95%, as well as an increasing public
fascination with "memory enhancement" dietary supplements, books and
brain-boosting techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the hottest area there is right now: to identify the
brain changes that occur in normal, age-related memory decline, so
that we can do something about them," said Molly Wagster, grants
director of the neuropsychology program at the National Institute on
Aging, in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The lapses many of us attribute to a failing brain are often due
to something entirely different: anxiety, sleep problems, depression,
even heart disease. The biological nuts and bolts of learning and
memory in fact change little over time in healthy people, researchers
say. "There's very little cell loss, and structurally all the
machinery is there, even very late in life," said Greg Cole, a
neuroscientist with the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System.
It's the cells' speed and ability to send and receive signals that
taper off, which is what makes the mind go blank when trying to
retrieve familiar words and names. Neurologists have several theories
to explain why:</TE>
<TE>   * Free-radical damage. Created by normal body functions, free
radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and cell DNA.
Doctors know from autopsy evidence that brain cells are particularly
vulnerable. Researchers have tested the effect of a variety of
so-called antioxidants--which neutralize free radicals--with mixed
results. A substance called curcumin (from the herb turmeric)
significantly improves brain function in animals with memory
deficits, Cole said; so do preparations that include alpha-lipoic
acid and vitamins C and E, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence in humans is probably best for vitamin E, researchers
say. In a 1997 study, investigators at Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons showed that daily doses of vitamin E
significantly slowed the progression of disease in people with
advanced Alzheimer's. Some doctors believe that doses of the vitamin
could also preserve cognitive function in healthy older adults.</TE>
<TE>   * Loss of chemical messengers. People with Alzheimer's disease
show reduced levels of a chemical in the brain called acetylcholine,
which is involved in signal transmission. Using drugs that prevent
the breakdown of this messenger, doctors can slow the progression of
the disease. It's not yet clear how well similar substances would
improve memory in healthy people, doctors say. The National Institute
on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, is helping fund
a study of a moss extract called huperzine A, which also works on
acetylcholine, in people with Alzheimer's disease. Results aren't yet
in.</TE>
<TE>   * Changes in membrane composition. Neural membranes contain a
number of fatty substances critical to cell function that appear to
become more scarce with advancing age, researchers say. One of these
is phosphatidylserine, or PS. In a 1991 study, PS supplements derived
from cow brains produced significant memory improvements in
middle-aged and older adults who had normal age-related memory
problems. In a 1992 trial among 51 people with Alzheimer's symptoms,
those taking PS also showed some memory improvement, doctors
reported. Most researchers consider the evidence preliminary and in
need of better testing.</TE>
<TE>   * Reduced blood flow. In people with cardiovascular problems
especially, the brain doesn't get the same volume of blood flow it
did in young adulthood. Blood flow is thought to be critical to
neural function, which may be one reason why physical exercise can
enhance mental performance, doctors say. It's also one of the reasons
why the Chinese herb ginkgo biloba, which increases circulation to
the brain, is routinely prescribed in France and Germany for memory
problems. Intrigued by the European experience, the National
Institute on Aging is now helping fund a trial in which 2,000 older
adults at risk of dementia will take daily doses of ginkgo biloba or
a placebo. The great appeal of substances such as ginkgo biloba or
vitamin E is that they are not prescription drugs. They're also
relatively cheap and easily available. "Baby boomers are much more
likely than previous generations to try alternative therapies, and I
think the research is respectable for some of these supplements,"
such as vitamin E and curcumin, said Debra Cherry, associate director
of the Alzheimer's Assn. of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino
County.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many neuroscientists doubt that any one of these
supplements will turn out to be an all-purpose memory pill. For one
thing, memory includes a range of very different skills--from the
motor programs used to brush our teeth to narrative techniques we use
to tell a joke or story. It's unlikely that a single substance would
enhance them all.</TE>
<TE>   Said the VA's Cole, who is studying the antioxidant curcumin: "I
think what we'll find in the end is that a cocktail of some of these
things is what works best."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of consumers, however, aren't waiting for the research to
come in. Margo Lyons, 51, of Chatsworth, began taking ginkgo about a
year ago after a series of lapses in which she forgot directions and
everyday tasks. The memory problems cleared up before she began
taking the supplement. "I just want to keep myself sharp so I don't
forget something really important, like picking up my kid from
school," she said. "It can't hurt, and it might help; you just never
know."</TE>
<TE>   Many physicians tend to be more skeptical of supplements because
of the lack of safety information about many products. Ginkgo can
cause gastric bleeding, for instance, especially when taken with
aspirin. And little is known about the side effects of supplements
taken in large doses over a prolonged period of time. Because
nutritional supplements are not closely regulated by the federal
government, doctors have no good idea what's in the pills and powders
or how well the active ingredients are absorbed by the body. Many
herbs can also interact with drugs to cause side effects. "At best
you're wasting money" with many of these products, said Dr. Gary
Small, director of the UCLA Center on Aging, "and at worst you're
doing yourself harm."</TE>
<TE>   Like many doctors, Small favors a safer answer for age-related
memory decline: mental workouts. This is what some call the "use it
or lose it" approach.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, researchers have known that people who
have active, intellectually challenging lives are less likely to
develop dementia than those who do not. Part of this difference is
attributable to intelligence, some doctors believe: The more you
start with, the longer it takes to lose it. And new evidence suggests
that the act of using your brain is in itself protective, no matter
who you are.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published this February in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., investigators followed 801 older Catholic nuns,
priests and brothers for almost five years, tracking what they did
during the day and what happened to their cognitive function. The
researchers paid particular attention to everyday activities: reading
the newspaper, listening to the radio, playing games such as chess
and checkers, or watching TV. They found that those men and women who
did three or more of these things at least several times a week were
almost 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who
read, listened to the radio and played games only a few times a
month. "The encouraging thing was that these were easy, accessible
activities, available to just about anybody," said lead author Robert
Wilson, professor of neuropsychology at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Many brain-booster books and tapes attempt to push people a little
harder than that. In a book called "Stop Memory Loss," now on store
shelves, there's a range of mental exercises that include "pegging"
numbers to words for easier recall and visualizing pictures with
numbers and words. Other common recommendations from authors of
memory books include crossword puzzles; logic and graphic puzzles
reminiscent of high school SAT problems; and simple practice trying
to recalls grocery lists 10 or 20 minutes after seeing them.</TE>
<TE>   All of these activities can improve people's scores on standard
tests measuring recall of numbers and names, experts say. They also
acknowledge, however, that there's a big difference between playing
chess with a friend and doing a mental exercise, such as memorizing
numbers. One is an organic part of a person's life, the other a
purely intellectual exercise, done in isolation. The first is fun;
the second, often, is a chore. That's why many doctors who treat
memory problems are skeptical of programs that promise significant
improvements from mental calisthenics alone. "You shouldn't do mental
gymnastics just for the heck of it," said Dr. Barry Gordon, director
of the memory clinic at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in
Baltimore. "They are very specific. If you learn how to do crossword
puzzles and do a lot of them, well, you get very good at doing
crosswords. It doesn't mean that much for any other part of your
life."</TE>
<TE>   The crucial element for any new mental activity, then, is that the
person find it interesting or fun, or both. Learn German, play poker,
study baseball stats, make yourself a wine snob: anything that will
fit into your life and stay awhile, doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Nancy Levitt, 53, of Beverly Hills, whose father
died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, bought a memory book
full of tests and techniques and mental exercises. She flipped
through it once or twice but quickly lost interest. "I tried, but you
want to do something that's fun, and that was work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If such memory work makes people feel pressured or inadequate, it
may even be detrimental because research has shown that anxiety can
interfere with memory. Bocian, of the SAGE Center at Sherman Oaks
Hospital, guesses that about 80% of the people who come to the center
are the "worried well." "Especially when it's a younger person, in
their 30s or 40s, I check to see if there's something else going on,"
she said. "Often it's just stress ... and worrying about their memory
getting worse is making it worse."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overview: Women's sexual health will be the topic of discussion
every weekday evening on this new talk show hosted by sisters Laura
and Jennifer Berman, both sexual-health experts who practice in Los
Angeles. Taped in front of a live audience, the doctors will discuss
issues affecting women's sexuality. The show will include guest
experts and taped field segments.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: The Berman sisters are gifted communicators who bring
a sensible, comfortable approach to the sensitive topic of female
sexuality. How that will translate to television and an audience of
real women remains to be seen. Certainly, the sisters--Laura is a
therapist and Jennifer a urologist--have a good opportunity to help
women better understand the many physical and emotional issues that
affect sexual function.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm 66 and training for my first marathon with a running
club. My problem is that when I work out hard during the week, I'm
not adequately recovered for our Saturday or Sunday group
runs--unless it replaces one of my other weekly workouts. Do you
think I'm better off getting several good workouts during the week or
spacing them out over time and adding a weekend run? I'm the only old
guy training with this running club.</LD>
<LD>   ALFRED COX</LD>
<LD>   Answer: This is a dilemma all of us face as we get older--and we
all need to evaluate which workouts are most important and then focus
on enjoying them. Other than doing all we can to speed recovery
(diet, rest, stretching, massage, etc.), we have no other options.</LD>
<TE>   For your marathon training, the most important thing to remember
is that your workouts should become increasingly race-like. So ask
yourself: What will best prepare me for the stresses on race day?</TE>
<TE>   Many times, the most beneficial are combined workouts (power plus
anaerobic endurance plus muscular endurance all in one session). Two
of these weekly will do wonders for your fitness. It's far better to
do two high-quality sessions in a week rather than three mediocre
ones, even if you have to sit it out all weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Also, you may want to consider joining a runners club with a few
older runners; their experience and advice might prove helpful.</TE>

<HD>Meningitis' Risk Can Be Reduced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an age of antibiotics and immunizations, most doctors are fairly
confident about their ability to prevent and treat many infectious
diseases. But one particular infection that is both preventable and
treatable--meningitis--still strikes fear in the minds of doctors.</LD>
<LD>   This infection is especially worrisome largely because of its
location. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes (called
meninges) that surround the brain and spinal cord. The infection can
start innocuously but very quickly turn into a life-threatening
illness.</LD>
<LD>   The illness typically starts with what appears to be a common and
simple bacterial or viral infection of the nose or throat. Like
almost all such infections, there may be cold-like symptoms, a mild
sore throat or a cough--or there may be no symptoms at all. The
problem begins when the bacterium or virus responsible for the
illness enters the bloodstream and spreads to the meninges. Then the
picture changes dramatically.</LD>
<TE>   In adults, the most common signs of an infection involving the
meninges are fever, headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting.
Confusion and drowsiness may also occur, and bright lights may hurt
the eyes. In infants and small children, however, these classic signs
of meningitis may be absent or difficult to detect. The only early
signals that a serious infection is developing may be nonspecific
ones like irritability, tiredness or poor feeding.</TE>
<TE>   Although the symptoms of bacterial and viral meningitis are
similar, their treatment and prognosis are quite different. Bacterial
meningitis--the more serious of the two--requires treatment with
antibiotics, usually administered intravenously in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Bacterial meningitis is also associated with a significant risk of
serious complications; about 10% of people who develop meningococcal
meningitis die, and another 10% suffer severe complications including
hearing loss and mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Viral meningitis, however, usually improves with remedies such as
acetaminophen or ibuprofen, used to reduce fever and relieve
headache. It is rarely fatal in healthy individuals, and the vast
majority of patients will recover completely.</TE>
<TE>   Although meningitis is much less contagious than the common cold
or flu, it can be spread from one person to another, typically
through contact with infected oral secretions such as saliva or
sputum (because the infection actually begins in the nose and
throat). That's why people living in crowded conditions like college
dormitories and military barracks have an increased risk of
contracting meningitis. Some forms of viral meningitis are spread
through contact with infected fecal material.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, some preventive measures can be taken, particularly
against the bacterial form of meningitis. Vaccines are available
against three of the bacteria most commonly responsible for causing
meningitis: Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Haemophilus influenza.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is no way to completely prevent the
development of meningitis. The vaccines do not protect against all
forms of the bacteria and do not confer perfect protection against
the forms they do cover.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe, however, that the number of cases--and the
complications resulting from those cases--could be dramatically
reduced with proper immunization under the current guidelines and
with prompt recognition and treatment of disease when it does
develop.</TE>
<TE>   Pneumococcal vaccine protects against meningitis caused by
Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the leading cause of bacterial
meningitis in the United States. Until recently, vaccination was
recommended only for older adults and children over age 2 and young
adults at high risk of serious infection by the pneumococcal
bacteria. (Because the vaccine did not offer protection to young
children, it was not recommended before age 2.) However, a relatively
new vaccine is available that is safe and effective in babies.</TE>
<TE>   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine immunization
with three doses of the vaccine at two months, four months and six
months, and a booster shot between 12 and 15 months. The vaccine is
also recommended for children 24 months to 59 months of age who are
at high risk of serious infection from the pneumococcal bacteria,
including children with sickle cell disease and HIV infection, as
well as children whose immune systems are compromised. Recent vaccine
shortages have prompted some modifications to this immunization
schedule that aim to make the vaccine available to children at the
greatest risk.</TE>
<TE>   Because older people and individuals with weakened immune function
are more vulnerable to pneumococcal meningitis, vaccination (with the
"old" vaccine) is still recommended for men and women 65 and up,
children over 2 and young adults considered to be at risk. This
includes, for example, individuals with chronic cardiovascular,
pulmonary or liver disease, diabetes, alcoholism or poorly
functioning immune systems. People living in nursing homes and other
long-term care facilities should also be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   Meningococcal vaccine protects against meningitis caused by
Neisseria bacteria. Although young children have a higher risk of
this infection, the vaccine currently available does not offer them
significant protection and is not part of the regular childhood
immunization schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Routine vaccination should, however, be considered by other
at-risk groups, including college freshmen living in dormitories and
military personnel. (Several recent studies found the risk of disease
to be higher among college students living in dorms than among
students residing in other types of accommodations.)</TE>
<TE>   Hib vaccine is designed to protect against a bacterium called
Haemophilus influenzae type B. Before an effective vaccine was
introduced, H. flu was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis--one
in 200 children would develop a serious H. flu infection by age 5,
and 60% of them would develop meningitis. The Hib vaccine is now part
of the routine childhood immunization schedule, starting at 2 months.
The incidence of H. flu meningitis has fallen dramatically since its
introduction.</TE>

<LD>New research suggests that illnesses as diverse as Alzheimer's,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and adult-onset diabetes are caused by
proteins that fold themselves into defective shapes, rather than
proteins that have undergone harmful chemical changes.</LD>
<LD>   As they develop, these aberrant protein forms can clump together
and wreak molecular havoc on healthy cells, according to two studies
in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, scientists believed that misfolding was an unusual
occurrence limited to perhaps 20 or more protein types.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the effect may be common to any protein in the body, the
researchers reported. Why it occurs remains unclear, but the process
is believed to be associated with diseases that take decades to
develop.</TE>
<TE>   "There is lots of evidence that any protein can form these
structures in principle," said Christopher Dobson of the University
of Cambridge in England, who helped lead one of the studies.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Sudhof, a Dallas-based investigator with the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, called the paper a major advance because it
demonstrates the particular stage at which the toxic effects of the
misfolded proteins can be gauged.</TE>
<TE>   Proteins are the agents of change and chemical messengers in
cells, and they carry out the instructions encoded in genes. The
specific roles they play are dictated by both their makeup and the
three-dimensional shape they take on when folded.</TE>
<TE>   In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease--a degenerative brain disorder that
resembles mad cow disease in its effects--a type of misfolded protein
known as a prion may replicate itself and spread to other cells to
cause progressive neurological damage. In diabetes, protein
misfolding may be responsible for the blood-vessel damage, blindness
and other debilitating effects of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   In the Cambridge study, Dobson's team conducted a series of
experiments in which they coaxed otherwise harmless muscle and
bacteria proteins to take on misfolded, intermediate forms. Those
forms proved toxic to healthy cells in laboratory cultures, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate study, scientists in Boston showed that the
misfolded form of the amyloid beta protein disrupts the chemical
mechanism in the brain by which memories are stored. Amyloid beta
proteins are implicated in Alzheimer's. The study found that clusters
of an intermediate form of amyloid beta were toxic to cells.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the big guys that are causing trouble or the little
guys--it's the medium guys,'' said co-author Dennis Selkoe, a
neurologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. He said tests showed that drugs can reduce the
toxic accumulation of the intermediate form of amyloid beta in the
brains of rats. But others cautioned the studies were too basic to be
useful in developing new drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's miles from any potential clinical intervention," said Bill
Thies, vice president of medical and scientific affairs for the
Chicago-based Alzheimer's Assn.</TE>

<HD>Hospitals Are Writing Prescriptions for Patient Safety</HD>
<DH>Accidents: U.S. health facilities are beginning to admit
that doctors and others make mistakes, and are taking steps to
prevent them from happening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY WALDMAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Thirteen years have passed since Bob Fauber went to an emergency room
with chest pain and was almost mistaken for another patient scheduled
to watch a video on sex after a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Fauber was being stabilized in a Hartford-area hospital room when
a nurse arrived with a wheelchair to take him to the film.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'You have the wrong patient,'" Fauber's wife, Gloria,
told the nurse. The nurse apologized and left the room.</LD>
<TE>   It was the only comical error in a series of medical mistakes that
caused Fauber months of unnecessary suffering and may have
contributed to his death in 1989 after bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Fauber can laugh about that one incident now. But her
husband's experience still stings. And it amazes her that only now
are hospitals beginning to acknowledge that mistakes occur all the
time--sometimes with fatal consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Close calls are what you want to look at," said James P. Bagian,
a physician and former astronaut who is director of the Veterans'
Administration National Center for Patient Safety.</TE>
<TE>   But while industries such as aviation use mistakes and close calls
as opportunities to improve safety, the medical profession had
traditionally reacted to errors with denial and shame, Bagian said.</TE>
<TE>   And that has cost lives.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Institute of Medicine, a research arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 people die each
year and many more are injured from preventable mistakes made in
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, hospitals across the country are beginning to
acknowledge that accidents happen and that only by recognizing that
can patients be made safer in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to come to grips with the idea that there is more
harm being done to patients than we ever realized or cared to
realize," said Dr. Michael L. Therrien, a cardiologist at St. Francis
Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford.</TE>
<TE>   One focus of the St. Francis effort is to encourage doctors,
nurses and other health-care workers to report mistakes and close
calls so similar incidents can be prevented.</TE>
<TE>   At Yale-New Haven Hospital, one goal of a 2-year-old
patient-safety initiative is to triple the rate of reported
errors--not by making more mistakes but by being honest about those
that occur, said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, co-chairman of the
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Krumholz, a cardiologist, said a myth that physicians are
invincible super-humans who do not need checks and balances or
written reminders is at the root of the secrecy that often masks
preventable errors.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bagian, Krumholz would like to borrow a page from the airline
industry. "Pilots are very tough and macho, yet you don't think any
less of a pilot who has to go through a checklist before taking off,"
Krumholz said. "Up until recently, you would raise questions about a
doctor who does that."</TE>
<TE>   Yale-New Haven has identified four areas of vulnerability and has
made changes. The hospital also has set up anonymous hotlines for
reporting errors and close calls and is teaching patients how to look
out for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid misidentification of patients, such as the mix-up that
almost sent Fauber's critically ill husband to a sex film, Yale-New
Haven now makes sure that all patients have an ID band from the time
they come through the front door.</TE>
<TE>   Blood handling is also a potential minefield for errors, said
Sally Roumanis, who co-chairs the patient safety effort. It was not
uncommon at Yale-New Haven, Roumanis said, for the wrong patient's
blood to be sent to the lab for testing. More consistent use of ID
bands reduced mix-ups, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, blood might be ruined en route to the lab because a
nurse or technician forgot to put it on ice. Sometimes the wrong
tests are ordered. Now, each blood vial gets a computer-generated
label that contains handling directions and patient information.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most dreaded and infamous hospital errors involve
surgery on the wrong body part. To prevent that, Yale-New Haven and
other hospitals now mark the correct spot with an indelible marker.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a doctor scrawled a circle with the word "yes" on Andrea
Wyckoff's right foot. She was in the day surgery center to have the
crooked joints in her toes repaired. Wyckoff already had the toes on
her left foot straightened, so she said the gnarled condition of the
right toes should have made the surgical site obvious. Still, she
said she was comforted by the hospital's attention to detail.</TE>
<TE>   Yale-New Haven also has tried to get patients more involved. Each
patient is given a flier acknowledging that accidents happen and
urging patients to help prevent them.</TE>

<HD>Upper-Body Stretches You Can Do Wherever You Are</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has your back ever itched like crazy in a place that you couldn't
reach? Do you have to ask for a friend's help because it seems as if
your arms just aren't long enough? Maybe the problem is not that your
arms are too short, but that your arm muscles are too tight.</LD>
<LD>   You would be surprised how much your shoulder and arm muscles are
being used in everyday activities. For example, we think of bicycle
riding as a workout for your buttocks and legs. But your arms are
doing a lot of work too, especially if you tend to lean on the
handlebars when you get tired.</LD>
<LD>   Tasks such as lifting heavy objects in and out of the car require
your arms to be strong in awkward positions; walking an energetic dog
can be jarring to all the joints of your upper body. If these areas
don't get stretched on a regular basis you could end up with stiff
shoulders, sore arms and a tense neck. This not only drains your
energy but can also make you irritable and headachy too.</LD>
<TE>   It is always a good idea to take a few minutes to stretch your
upper body after lifting weights, but remember, when it comes to your
arms and neck, you don't always have to be dressed in exercise
clothes or attend a yoga class to get rid of the excess muscle
tension and tightness accumulated there. Whenever you think about it,
or if you notice a slight discomfort in or around your shoulders and
arms, make a point to practice these two simple stretches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Triceps Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Sit in a chair as straight as you can and place your left arm
behind your head. Start sliding the pinkie side of your hand downward
between your shoulder blades. Keep your thumb pointing outward. Use
your right hand to grasp your left elbow and gently bring it closer
to your head. You will feel a deep stretch in the back of your left
upper arm as you do this.</TE>
<TE>   Check your posture. You should still be sitting upright with a
very straight back while holding this stretch. Do not let head or
arms bend forward.</TE>
<TE>   Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds while you breathe
comfortably. Eliminate any extra movement or effort.</TE>
<TE>   By using your right hand to gradually move the left arm into a
deeper stretch, you can increase the intensity, but make sure don't
get overly ambitious. When you are done, release your arm slowly and
switch arms to repeat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neck and Shoulder Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Place your left arm behind your waist. Firmly grasp your left
wrist with your right hand and pull that hand toward the right side
of your body.</TE>
<TE>   Keep shoulders level as you begin to squeeze your shoulder blades
back and together. You will feel the stretch in your left shoulder
muscles. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds as you breathe and
relax.</TE>
<TE>   As you get familiar with this stretch, try the following
variations to intensify it. Tilt your head to the right. Think of
moving your left ear toward the ceiling as both shoulders move down
and away from your ears. Then change the angle of your head by slowly
rotating it down until your nose faces the floor. You'll feel a nice
stretch at the base of your neck. Repeat the sequence using the other
arm.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to move into and out of these stretches slowly and
gently. Never force movements. Any abrupt or quick changes will
negate the stretch and may also cause injury.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another tip: Do not expect both sides of your body to have
the same amount of flexibility. You will probably notice if you are
right-handed, your right arm will be stronger and less limber. Make
sure you stretch both sides and be patient when you come to the
tighter muscles. It is helpful to do the stretch twice on the tighter
side, because it needs more attention to bring your body into better
balance. Consistency is the key.</TE>
<TE>   Do these moves often to counteract all the tension that
accumulates in your upper body. Then the next time you have an itch
between your shoulder blades, you'll probably be able to reach it.</TE>

<LD>The old neighborhoods look pretty much the same as they did back
then, at a time when the whole world seemed younger.</LD>
<LD>   The houses that needed paint still need paint, and the sidewalks
are cracked where they always were cracked. The only big difference,
I guess, is that the vacant lot next to Tony Silva's place has a
duplex on it now, but even it looks old already.</LD>
<LD>   I'm in Oakland for a few days, wandering the streets of my
boyhood. I came up because my sister Emily, the one who always prays
for me, is ill, and I wanted to see how she was doing. All those
prayers deserve at least a visit.</LD>
<TE>   Emily is 80 and has had a mild stroke, but is just as full of
fight as she was when she was giving me the Dutch rub 60 years ago.
That was a form of mild punishment administered when no other form of
getting a message across worked. You rubbed a victim's scalp with
your knuckles until he cried uncle or help or something.</TE>
<TE>   Emily would chase me down the street when I wouldn't come home and
apply the Dutch rub with a vigor unmatched along 94th Avenue. But
that was long ago.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't walk too well anymore and has lived alone since her
husband, Eddie, died a couple of years ago. A son and daughter remain
in the Bay Area, but Emily is as independent as an old buffalo and
doesn't rely on anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Her house is the same one she and Eddie bought just after the
Second World War, when he came home from serving in the Army. It was
new when they bought it for $7,000, but the years are beginning to
tell.</TE>
<TE>   Houses, like people, get creaky and weathered as time passes.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time I've been back to some of the places we
occupied during my growing-up years. We lived all over East Oakland,
from 73rd Avenue to the San Leandro city limits, and from East 14th
Street to MacArthur Boulevard. It was during the Depression, and we
moved just about every time the rent came due.</TE>
<TE>   Life got better economically when the war started, ending the
Depression with explosive abruptness. The Kaiser Shipyards in
Richmond beckoned, and our family home became war housing slapped
together near the waterfront to accommodate welders and shipfitters
and the others turning out Liberty Ships in record time.</TE>
<TE>   I never considered Richmond my home and spent a lot of time living
with Emily and Eddie while I went to Castlemont High. It actually
looked like a castle back then, with turrets and arches, but an
earthquake damaged it so badly it had to be torn down. That's the way
it is with castles, sometimes. The new school looks like a state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   I knew East Oakland as well as I've ever known any place in my
life. I knew every family in the neighborhoods where I lived, every
kid, mother, father (where there was one) and every dog. I knew the
dogs because I delivered mail during the Christmas seasons, and had
to beat them off with a stick.</TE>
<TE>   I worked at a downtown Sears part-time during the rest of the
year, first in hardware and then in the garden department. The old
store is gone, and there's a kind of sadness to the building's
emptiness, like a house after someone has died.</TE>
<TE>   It was Thomas Wolfe who wrote that you can't go home again. As I
recall, he was using the phrase in an emotional sense, entwined with
nostalgia for the old homestead. I have memories of East Oakland but
not a lot of sentimentality attached to them. San Francisco is
something else.</TE>
<TE>   I went to college at S.F. State when it was at Haight and
Buchanan, where I met Cinelli. We "discovered" the city together,
riding trolleys, cable cars and buses from one end to the other, and
walking when we got there. I still know a lot of the alleys and small
side streets throughout North Beach and Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered San Francisco on this trip too, on a day when fog was
unfurling through the Golden Gate like strands of silver ribbon. A
chill was in the air around Lincoln Park and the Legion of Honor,
carried in by the ocean mist that gives San Francisco so much of its
mystique.</TE>
<TE>   I miss the fog and the mystery it creates as it slips quietly and
softly through the city's neighborhoods from the Sunset to the
Marina, and from Cow Hollow to Potrero Hill. Our first apartment was
in the Castro District after we were married, on a hillside above
Market Street. It was an old Victorian converted into apartments, and
it's still there, as stately and imposing as ever.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of our wandering on this trip, we dined at a small
French restaurant called Absinthe, not far from the Civic Center. One
never just eats in San Francisco. One always dines. A speaker system
played soft jazz into the foggy evening. The martini was perfect and

<LD>THE STRENGTH OF THE SUN</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Catherine Chidgey</LD>
<TE>   Henry Holt</TE>
<TE>   272 pages, $23</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The eerie beauty of a solar eclipse. The nocturnal dance of
fireflies. The gleam of gilded letters in a medieval manuscript. The
haunting look of a photograph that, on closer inspection, dissolves
into a lifeless pattern of black and white dots. A house destroyed,
then rebuilt. The diary of a teenage girl who disappeared. The
frangibility volatility and resiliency of the material world itself,
the world in which we live and die.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the images, objects, and concepts from which New
Zealand writer Catherine Chidgey has woven the shimmering fabric of
her second novel, an exquisitely written, curiously tantalizing book
that looks something like a mystery story, but is something far more
evanescent.</TE>
<TE>   "The Strength of the Sun" involves a complicated-seeming plot with
several story lines, odd coincidences and curious links between
characters on opposite sides of the globe. In 1999, a New Zealand
college girl named Colette receives a puzzling piece of mail from
England. It's been sent by an informal group calling itself "The
Friends of Patrick Mercer." A man in his 60s, Mercer is a curator of
medieval manuscripts. He has just been severely injured in an
automobile accident and his self-appointed friends have been getting
in touch with people mentioned in his diaries and address books,
encouraging them to visit, write or contribute to a fund to help him
if he is able to leave the hospital. The "friends" believe that
Colette was someone quite important to Patrick at some point in his
life. Colette, however, has no memory of meeting such a man.</TE>
<TE>   More than a decade earlier, in the New Zealand of 1988, where
people are coming from all over the world to view what promises to be
a spectacular solar eclipse, a 15-year-old local girl named Laura
Pearse sets off in her car to see it for herself. She never returns.
Her heartbroken parents, Ruth and Malcolm, have been trying to pick
up the pieces of their lives ever since. Eventually, they have
another child, Daniel, move out of their old house and rent it to
students. One of those students happens to be Colette, who also
becomes Daniel's baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   How does the medieval manuscript curator fit into all this? Well,
he did want to go to New Zealand to see the eclipse, but much to his
regret, he did not. And he did have a kind of disaster in his own
life when, as a boy holding out a magnifying glass to intensify the
sun's rays, he inadvertently started a fire that burned his family's
home.</TE>
<TE>   As the novel unfolds, links between its disparate characters
become evident. But the links are not causal and this book is no
mystery novel. Indeed, in some ways, this book is more poem than
novel. For if the creation of distinctive, memorable, complex
characters is one of the hallmarks of the classic novel, the
characters in this book are insubstantial and interchangeable. The
plot, too, is rather nebulous. Chidgey's interests seem to lie
elsewhere: in the relationship between human feeling and the material
world, in how we try to hold onto memories even as accidents,
disasters and time itself take their toll on us and all our attempts
to preserve or uncover the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Every contact leaves a trace," the police assure the parents of
the vanished girl. Her father assiduously follows up the clues and
details of the search, while her mother can no longer bear to read a
newspaper. As a child Patrick believes that fireflies are spelling
out messages. In the museum, he marvels at the intricacy of the
illuminations blending word and picture, the resiliency of the inks
and parchments that provide a window into the medieval world.
Decorated with images of fantastic flora and fauna, the manuscripts
on closer examination bear the traces of the animal skins from which
they were made. Yet, as Patrick later feels as he sorts through his
dead mother's bland belongings, a trace is not the same as real
contact.</TE>
<TE>   Deftly, in almost painterly fashion, Chidgey arranges her images
and themes in a balanced, aesthetically pleasing composition. It is
tempting indeed to pronounce her novel a veritable poem in prose
form. But the greatest poetry must contain fire as well as aesthetic
form, energy as well as imagery. Chidgey certainly succeeds in
conveying the emotional weight that physical objects have for her
characters and in evoking both the strength and the vulnerability of
the material world we inhabit. Yet the characters and their lives
seem pallid compared with their furnishings and paraphernalia. "The
Strength of the Sun" is a beautifully crafted, often poignant work
that nonetheless seems to lack the vital spark needed to transform it
into something even better.</TE>

<HD>She Knows Courtroom Drama</HD>
<DH>Y. Jessie Shaw's cultural background gives her an edge as a
divorce lawyer who represents immigrant clients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Divorce lawyer Y. Jessie Shaw was standing in a San Bernardino
courthouse, waiting for a signed order that would freeze the assets
of her client's husband, when she saw the man slip out of the
courtroom and sprint down the hall.</LD>
<LD>   She knew the couple had come here penniless from Vietnam, saved up
to buy a gas station and prospered. But as divorce loomed, the
husband sold the gas station and hid the $400,000 profit. Rumor had
him headed back to Vietnam to start a new life.</LD>
<LD>   Realizing her client would never see her share of that money if
the husband fled the country, Shaw decided to chase him. In her
3-inch heels, she ran stealthily after him, out the courthouse and
into the parking lot. Then Shaw, a brash Taiwanese immigrant who has
never let convention deter her on either side of the Pacific, hopped
into her car and tailed him to a bank in Redlands.</LD>
<TE>   As she drove, she called the courthouse on her cell phone, only to
learn that the judge on her case had left for the day. Somehow, she
convinced a clerk to contact the judge on the golf course, and get
the court order faxed to the Redlands bank. When Shaw ran into the
bank, she found the runaway husband clutching a wad of bills while
the teller counted out more.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop," she cried to the startled crowd, and proceeded to explain
the situation to bewildered bank officials, who held up the
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   It took most of the afternoon, but eventually the judge's fax came
in and the bank agreed to freeze the man's funds. In a safety-deposit
box within the bank's vault, Shaw and bank officials discovered
$350,000 in cash. A checking account held $50,000 more. She had found
the missing gas station proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   And Shaw, who had recently opened her own practice but didn't
speak fluent English, understand American customs or have much legal
experience here, was launched on an exhilarating career.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, Shaw is a seasoned litigator with sleek offices
in downtown Pasadena. She has come far from the days when she
interviewed at blue-chip California firms and was told that she
lacked the linguistic and cultural skills to make it as an American
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "People told me, even though you're smart enough to pass the bar,
you haven't been in this country long enough. You have no chance to
be a litigator in court," Shaw recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of letting such remarks offend her, Shaw only hardened her
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "I agreed with them," she says. "But I also felt I wouldn't be a
real attorney until I stepped into court. I wanted that validation.
But it took time, and I had to be patient. In the beginning, when I
formulated legal arguments in my mind, I used Chinese and translated
back to English as I spoke. I don't know when the wall came down, but
now I can speak directly in English."</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a detriment, her Chinese heritage has become an
asset. The growing number of Asian immigrants in Southern California
has created a larger pool of people seeking a divorce lawyer like
Shaw, who not only shares their language and culture, but can explain
how American laws differ from those of home.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a detriment, Shaw's Chinese heritage has become an
asset. "They feel comfortable seeing an Asian woman who understands
their values and their morals," says Shaw, a poised woman of 39.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of Shaw's clients are overseas Chinese (people from
Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and the Chinese diaspora, such as
ethnic Chinese from Malaysia) and 15% white. The balance is Latino.
She does a handful of pro-bono divorce cases each year for those who
can't afford divorce lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw's been in the trenches a long time, and like most divorce
lawyers, she's seen every kind of bad behavior: adultery, substance
addiction, gambling and even murder. But in Shaw's view, her clients'
human foibles are compounded by the difficulties immigrants face in a
new country, culture and language. There are often long separations,
as husbands toil in Asia at family businesses while wives and
children remain here.</TE>
<TE>   So Shaw, who recently completed the requirements to be certified
as a family law specialist, finds herself playing therapist, and
parental and financial advisor to immigrants bewildered by the legal
system and customs of their adopted land.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Representing the 'Second Wives'</TE>
<TE>   She represents husbands as often as wives, sometimes even
mistresses, whom she calls "second wives." Many have long
relationships and even children with the married lovers who have
brought them from China.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I met them, I thought they were frivolous creatures with
pretty faces," Shaw says. "But many are smart. They helped the men
set up businesses in China. But they also know that if they lose
their looks, the man will leave. They come to me and want to know how
they can safeguard their assets. They are worried for their
children."</TE>
<TE>   In general, she says, mistresses have few rights. In case of
divorce, wives can even demand the return of gifts bestowed by the
straying husband. The most mistresses can do is get support for their
children, if they can establish paternity.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw has better luck helping wives, such as Maggie Liu, a
small-business owner in Diamond Bar whom Shaw represented.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our assets were in Asia, and she knows my culture and how
to deal with Chinese people, and she also knows the law here," says
Liu. "I didn't know what my rights as a woman were here in the U.S.
She explained everything. She fights for us."</TE>
<TE>   Liu, who eventually reconciled with her husband, says she turned
to Shaw after unhappy experiences with several non-Chinese lawyers
who she said charged her a lot of money and did little work. She had
to bring translators to those meetings. With Shaw, she could converse
easily in Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, American lawyers can be eloquent, they're good
speakers, but Jessie's [English] language was not a problem, and she
was more aggressive than the American lawyers," Liu said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw grew up in a Taipei suburb with two older brothers. At age
21/2, she suffered burns over half her body when she fell into a pot
of boiling water. For years, she put up with bandages and doctors'
visits, refusing to wear shorts or skirts so classmates wouldn't mock
her scars. Shaw says she vowed to become a lawyer when she was
unjustly accused of cheating at her Catholic boarding school. But
after earning a law degree and landing a job with the biggest law
firm in Taiwan at age 21, she grew frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted me to serve tea in the conference room," Shaw says.
"I was supposed to take high-profile clients to nightclubs and
karaoke bars every night.... I didn't want to live my life that way."</TE>
<TE>   So in 1986, Shaw--the last name is transliteration of her Chinese
name--came to America, where she believed she would have more
opportunity, even though she'd have to work harder. She repeated law
school, at Temple University, and married a white man she met in
Philadelphia. But the marriage foundered.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of my looks and my nationality, he had misconceptions
about who I was," Shaw says delicately. When they divorced, Shaw was
so poor she did the legal work herself. In 1992, after working as a
"gypsy" lawyer for other firms, she launched her own.</TE>
<TE>   Now remarried to a Chinese American man, Shaw has two young sons
and lives in Arcadia with her family and her mother. Her father, who
once despaired that his blunt, headstrong daughter would fit in
anywhere, died about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Shaw's bluntness doesn't endear her to everyone. She's
assertive and direct, with the deadpan humor of a stand-up comic. But
her manner has helped her succeed in rough-and-tumble family court.
She calls them as she sees them. Take male-female relations. Shaw
says most husbands she works with, even those with mistresses, don't
want a divorce. But when wives file papers, husbands sometimes start
hiding assets.</TE>
<TE>   With business and property scattered across two continents, it can
be a nightmare to track down the accounts. But Shaw knows what she's
looking for, and how to get it.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been tenacious on behalf of her clients," says Los
Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner Robert Schnider, before
whom Shaw has argued many cases. "With Chinese cases, there are often
assets in other countries and various kinds of entanglements ... and
that can be interesting and challenging. Not only do you have to know
California law, but the law of other nations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Business Done on Handshakes</TE>
<TE>   Shaw says that some business in China is still done on handshakes.
The terms are then scribbled onto scraps of paper or whatever is at
hand. Often such deals lack dates and signatures but use "chops,"
official Chinese stamps. Some U.S. judges doubt the authenticity of
these documents, says Shaw, who has found herself explaining Chinese
business customs to American judges.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to tracking down assets in Asia, Shaw says it's too
expensive and unpredictable to hire a Chinese law firm. Besides,
corruption can be a problem overseas, she points out, and the firm
might sell the documents back to the husband and ruin her case.</TE>
<TE>   If clients request it, she'll go to China and conduct a search.
But she usually recommends that they do the investigation themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "They all have family and friends over there who can help," Shaw
explains. "And it's cheaper for them. I tell them what documents I
need, and explain how to get them authenticated through the U.S.
Embassy. And usually they come back to me with very, very good
documents."</TE>
<TE>   For example, businesses have to register with the Chinese
government and in many cases, especially joint ventures with an
American partner, must report their investment capital, projects and
profits. Tax returns offer a mother lode of information. "I'm
probably not able to put the whole puzzle together," Shaw admits,
"but I find some of the pieces. To demolish a house, you only need to
take down a few corners. Then the judge starts to believe you. You
have to be very creative."</TE>
<TE>   But each case brings its own drama and tragedy. For one
long-suffering wife Shaw represented, the final straw came when her
husband suggested that since their own children were grown, the wife
could care for the young children he had with his mistress. Another
woman, who had a San Marino mansion and eight cars parked in the
garage, wanted out of an arranged marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very patient and diligent and understanding," says Wong
Park, a Korean American lawyer who knows Shaw and has argued opposite
her in court. "She tries to find the right solution depending on the
person's background. For some, because of their culture, it's more
important to go after custody. For others, it's the money. She's able
to read between the lines."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Time Resolves Some Problems</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Shaw has found over the years, opponents can soften and
intractable situations can suddenly work out. That's what happened
when she represented a white American woman married to a Chinese
businessman she had met while teaching English in China.</TE>
<TE>   They had several children, but the husband had affairs and bragged
that he would buy off the judges to gain custody and take all the
money if she divorced him.</TE>
<TE>   The woman hired Shaw anyway. During a court recess, Shaw got
permission from the husband's attorney to talk to the husband in
Chinese. No important words were exchanged, but Shaw thinks the
informal chat in his native tongue didn't hurt: He later agreed to a
better financial settlement as well as giving his wife custody of
their children.</TE>
<TE>   That was a relief, because Shaw has handled many cases in which
one parent flees with the kids to another country. The remaining
parent isn't even certain of getting a U.S. court to order the return
of children, she says. In one of Shaw's saddest cases, an Indonesian
husband fled with the children back to Indonesia. The wife, an ethnic
Chinese Lao, couldn't get permission to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw says she often coaches clients on how to act in court, such
as answering questions directly, which can be considered rude in
China. Likewise, she says traditional Chinese parents who stress
obedience and academic excellence above all else can come off badly
in custody evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   "In their hearts, the parents are trying to do the right thing,"
Shaw explains. "But they look very uptight, nervous and inflexible. I
tell them they have to be more polished, more relaxed, but it's hard
for them. Often the parent who lives the more Americanized life wins
custody."</TE>
<TE>   For Shaw, this is a sensitive cultural problem that is not
adequately addressed in American courts. "I'm not saying the judge is
right or wrong, but I think they should give some more consideration
to the struggles that immigrants face, that these are their values,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Straddling two cultures, she knows this firsthand. Shaw
appreciates the freedom and the challenges her new life have brought
her. And she hasn't lost her sense of humor, even when she is
mistaken in court for the husband's mistress instead of the attorney
arguing the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a lot of anger. I'm just an immigrant, and you have
to be patient and persistent. But I've been lucky. I never would have
reached my potential if I had stayed comfortably in Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "But here I'm challenged. If a girl like me can make it here, then
anyone can."</TE>

<HD>Having a Grand(Parent) Vacation</HD>
<DH>More seniors are taking their grandchildren on major trips.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when Bernadette Folger thought grandparents weren't
supposed to do much more with their grandchildren than remember
birthdays and give big hugs. But last summer, after the 74-year-old
retired Reno schoolteacher found herself giggling like a teenager as
she whooshed down Idaho's Snake River with her two young
granddaughters, she realized what a different family portrait hers
had turned out to be.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was a young girl, my own grandparents seemed so old to
me," said Folger, who is planning a similar outing this summer. "I
remember they had to live with us because they were so frail ... I
just never dreamed I'd be out river-rafting or horseback riding with
my grandkids someday."</LD>
<TE>   But gathering the grandchildren for a rafting trip or a two-week
excursion to Europe is hardly out of the ordinary anymore. Because
they are living longer and healthier, because they are younger and
wealthier, today's grandparents are playing far more significant
roles in the lives of their grandchildren. A generation ago, adults
had only a one-in-five chance of having any living grandparents by
the time they turned 30, said Vern L. Bengtson, a USC gerontology
professor who has studied family sociology for 35 years. But for
children born today , by age 30, 76% will have at least one living
grandparent. In addition, the average life expectancy for people born
this year is 79, compared with 76 four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Data from the 2000 Census show that more than 4 million
grandparents now live with their grandchildren--and more than half
are the primary caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   With more parents continuing to work full-time outside of the
home, coupled with increased life expectancy among seniors and
decreased fertility among their children, the potential for
substantial grandparent-grandchild connections is stronger than ever.
Millions of baby boomers, the oldest of whom turn 56 this year, are
heading into grandparenthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to the once-popular opinion that old people are a
burden, grandparents now help with all aspects of child rearing,"
said Paul Kleyman, editor of the American Society on Aging's
newspaper, Aging Today. "And more than ever, they're doing all of
it."</TE>
<TE>   The way families are spending leisure time together illustrates
one of the most visible aspects of this shift. Nearly one-fourth of
all trips taken by kids are with grandparents, according to the
Travel Industry Assn. Businesses have started to pay close attention,
fanning the trend with tours and discounted packages for
"grandtravel," as it has become known in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Sept. 11, travel agents say, grandparents were among
the first to want to get moving again. Requests for trip brochures
and bookings have rebounded quickly among seniors, and not just
because they are seasoned travelers. "These vacations represent one
of the biggest ways in which grandparents are influencing, nurturing
and helping to raise grandchildren today," said USC's Bengtson.
"Never in human history have we seen this kind of shift, in which
[grandparents] are changing the face of American families so
dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   For grandparents, traveling with their children's children is a
unique opportunity to forge friendships, impart values and spend
uninterrupted time getting to know one another--all things they may
not have experienced with their grandparents, Bengtson said. In
return, children growing up with strong ties to grandparents will
look at aging in a new light.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect today's grandchildren will have an entirely different
image of aging than other generations," said Robert B. Friedland,
director of the Center on an Aging Society at Georgetown University.
"They'll be less afraid of it, they'll understand it more. Thirty
years from now when they think of growing old, they'll remember that
camping trip with grandpa or even that roller-coaster ride with
grandma. It's all part of this transformation."</TE>
<TE>   Most parents welcome the expanding role of their parents in the
children's lives. For some it's a matter of economics and time; with
most couples in today's households working--and working longer hours,
at that--parents are happy to let their children roam with their
grandparents, who are bent on leaving behind more than just trust
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Watching her 10- and 11-year-old grandsons fly-fish and learn to
use a lariat at a dude ranch last summer convinced Anabel Lindy, 73,
that such experiences were more valuable than any amount of financial
inheritance she could provide. "We connected with those boys and saw
them discover things that we'd never normally see in the daily course
of our lives," said Lindy, who lives in Philadelphia. "I want to
spend the time and money now, while we're able to, because what's it
going to matter when we're gone? They wouldn't have known us. Not
like this."</TE>
<TE>   Helena Koenig, a grandmother and owner of Grandtravel in Chevy
Chase, Md., remembers when traveling with grandchildren meant nothing
more than loosely planned day trips. Sixteen years ago she organized
a group outing with a handful of other grandmothers and their
grandkids to the Railroad Museum in Baltimore, and the response was
so great that Koenig decided she'd found an untapped market.</TE>
<TE>   As the years have passed, she's seen grandtravel evolve into
elaborate excursions all over the world. "I thought, 'Why should we
just send grandparents to Baltimore for the day?'" she said. "I
thought, 'We should go to Kenya!'"</TE>
<TE>   It was Grandtravel that got Anabel and Philip Lindy into taking
trips each year with their grandsons. Last year, they toured the
Western national parks for 10 days. They also have taken the
grandsons on a 10-day London-Paris trip and an 11-day excursion to
the Southwestern U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Although they live within a few miles of each other in
Philadelphia, Anabel Lindy said the boys are so busy that the
grandparents must schedule and reserve quality time. "What's
especially nice about our trips is that the grandsons come by
themselves, without their parents," said Lindy, noting that they are
better behaved. "Let me tell you, children are different when their
parents aren't around. Never, on any of our trips, have I ever heard
them say, 'I'm bored,' or 'Are we there yet?'"</TE>
<TE>   The Lindys' trips are structured in a way that keeps the
grandchildren entertained and supervised while the couple steals
much-needed naps. On their first day of the Western parks tour, the
group saw Mt. Rushmore, panned for gold, went horseback riding and
participated in a Native American hoop dance. "It can be tiring,"
sighed Philip Lindy, 73.</TE>
<TE>   Folger, who planned the Snake River trip with her husband, Dale,
as part of a weeklong vacation that included Yellowstone, said
traveling with their 9- and 10-year-old granddaughters gave them a a
priceless peek into each other's lives. The guided river-rafting
trip, with two other families on the same raft, she said, was a hit.
The result was a multi-generational collection of tourists--two
grandparents, two parents and four children--all of whom delighted in
Dale Folger's military stories as they rode the chilly rapids.
"Actually, it was more like a float down the river with a few hills
and splashes," Bernadette Folger said. "The girls couldn't believe we
wanted to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-old Heather said the raft trip was a highlight, because
she learned something about her grandparents she never would have
guessed: "My granny can go!" she exulted. "And Poppy can swim!"</TE>

<LD>Have you ever picked out a frame for a painting? If so, you've seen
how a frame can help make it look complete. Frames also protect the
edges of paintings, which makes them last longer.</LD>
<LD>   At the Getty Museum, selecting a frame is an important part of
getting a painting ready for display in a gallery. The museum's staff
tries to find frames that were made around the same time as the
painting because paintings often look best in frames from the same
period. They have to consider things like whether a frame from that
time would have been made of wood. Would it have been covered in
gold? Did it have a carved or flat surface?</LD>
<LD>   If the staff is lucky, they will find a frame that is the same
size as the painting. Usually, though, they need to buy a larger
frame that can be cut down to fit, or a smaller one that can be
enlarged. Next, an expert at the museum cleans or repairs it and puts
the picture into the frame. Then the painting is finally ready to be
hung on a wall.</LD>
<TE>   Come to the Getty and see the many different frames that the
museum has found for its paintings. The museum invites children ages
12 and younger to stop at the information desk in the entrance hall
to receive a free paper picture frame. For more information or
parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300 or visit www.getty.edu.
Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays and Sundays or after 4
p.m. weekdays.</TE>

<HD>Oprah Ends Book Club, With a Slap at Publishing World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was bad enough for the book industry that Oprah Winfrey announced
on Friday that she would not continue her star-making book club in
its current form. But in the eyes of some, the reason Winfrey
gave--after championing the book world for so long--smarts. "It has
become harder and harder to find books on a monthly basis that I feel
absolutely compelled to share," Winfrey said in a statement about why
she was ending Oprah's Book Club.</LD>
<LD>   Nora Rawlinson, editor in chief of Publishers Weekly, said she
found Winfrey's comment "very disappointing, and I think publishers
will, and should, take offense at that."</LD>
<LD>   Winfrey began her book club in September 1996, personally reading
and selecting each book that gets a featured spot on her TV show.
Each of her selections has become an instant bestseller. Her choices
have included books written by famous names such as Toni Morrison and
Isabel Allende.</LD>
<TE>   She also has singled out unknowns such as Christina Schwarz, who
wrote part of her first novel, "Drowning Ruth," while living in Los
Angeles; and Los Angeles writer Janet Fitch, a first-time novelist
whose "White Oleander" got the nod in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "For every book she picked," Rawlinson noted, "it was a guaranteed
sale of 600,000 to 800,000 copies on top of what the books already
sold. That's a significant number in publishing."</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey's influence is such that when one of the authors she
recently chose for her book club reacted with ambivalence--some would
say, a highbrow disdain--a huge to-do ensued. Last year, Winfrey
named the novel, "The Corrections," by literary hotshot Jonathan
Franzen, as one of her selections. But Franzen made comments for
which he later apologized, complaining for instance, that he wasn't
happy about having the Oprah Book Club sticker on his book, and that
some of Winfrey's choices have been "schmaltzy." As a result, Winfrey
canceled his appearance on her show, and Franzen was forced to defend
himself in the media.</TE>
<TE>   According to a New York Times story in October 2001, Farrar,
Straus &amp; Giroux published 90,000 copies of "The Corrections," and
printed 680,000 more after it made Oprah's list, 500,000 of which
could be attributed to the endorsement. At a retail price of $26
each, then, the endorsement has meant about $13 million in gross
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Winfrey's choices have been dismissed by some as
having a populist bent rather than a literary one. But whether one
agreed with her choices, no one can deny her impact, pointed out Toni
Garvey, president of the Public Library Assn., a division of the
American Library Assn., which works with Winfrey's staff. ( Winfrey
asks the publisher of her book club selection to donate 10,000 of the
books to libraries; the American Library Assn. helps distribute the
books).</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever anyone with that wide of an audience, when someone like
Oprah talks about books and reading, everybody benefits," Garvey
said. "The author benefits, the publishers benefit and public
libraries benefit. We might be scrambling to get enough copies of
[the choice], but, boy, isn't that a horrible problem to have."</TE>
<TE>   Though Winfrey will no longer make regular picks--her book club
selections had been less frequent, even before Friday's
announcement--she will consider featuring books that she feels
strongly about, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Winfrey has not closed the door is good news, said
Patricia Johnson, executive vice president of Knopf Publishing. "We
are clearly all very saddened," Johnson said. "Oprah ... did an
absolutely amazing job of bringing really good books to a breadth of
audience that many of these books would not have reached." Winfrey
steered readers to books like a trusted friend who manages to find
the gem that is overlooked by the book critics or the academics, said
Valerie Iravani, a San Diego fan. "She is so well grounded. She is
not afraid of life," said Iravani, 41, a customer service manager.
"Oprah gets right into your living room, and she's sitting on the
couch next to you."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Winfrey said she counted
her book club as among her greatest achievements. "It's one thing to
win an Emmy and special awards; it's another thing for somebody who
hasn't picked up a book since they were forced to in high school to
read 'Song of Solomon' and start thinking differently about their own
life as a result."</TE>

<HD>Springtime Brings Faire Days</HD>
<DH>Ye ol' Renaissance festivals, popular in the area this time
of year, combine history lessons and escapist entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE K. SCHENDEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You put on this shirt and you feel like such a man," says Curt
Rowley, showing off a rather blousy garment that matches his equally
blousy cotton knickers. Rowley's ensemble also includes a feathered
cap, leather boots laced to the knees and a handmade leather sheath
hanging off his hip. Manly? Yes, in a Robin Hood-meets-"Braveheart"
sort of way.</LD>
<LD>   It's a look that's endemic on the Renaissance festival circuit,
which runs February through November across the country and is most
prevalent in Southern California in the spring.</LD>
<LD>   For some, including Rowley, the appeal of the dozens of
Renaissance fairs that have sprung up across the country over the
past 10 to 15 years is in the role playing. For others, it's the
artistry of making period crafts and clothing or in learning about
the Renaissance period, encompassing the 14th to the 16th centuries.</LD>
<TE>   The success of the fairs is due, in part, to the escapism they
provide and because they are interactive, says Tom Wilson of
Crossroads Productions, promoter of festivals in Corona, Palm Springs
and Lake Havasu.</TE>
<TE>   "Movies are great but you just look at a screen. This way you can
actually be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   And for some, it's a way to find an interest for the whole family.
"I took my son to a Renaissance fair kicking and screaming about four
years ago," says Boo Price of Palm Desert, who was an exhibitor at
the recent Palm Springs Renaissance Festival. "We closed the fair,
and he wanted to come back in costume and perform," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Chance Price did just that. He honed his juggling
skills and now, at 16, he is half of the juggler-magician act "Chance
and Jasper," with 19-year-old David "Jasper" Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   "Some other kids might do football, Chance does juggling at
Renaissance festivals," Boo Price explains. She tags along to
chaperon, from Palm Springs to Corona to Las Vegas, dressed in
Renaissance-era dresses she makes herself.</TE>
<TE>   Hooking up with the Renaissance fair crowd might sound a lot like
running away to join the circus, except that most participants have
homes and day jobs. Some sell jewelry, armor or pottery for a living,
but most are bankers, engineers and teachers, many with wee ones in
tow.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley of Orange is a district manager for a linen company. His
wife, Karen, is a teacher, and both are members of the Archers of
Ravenwood, along with their children, Bryan, 19, and Kirstin, 10.
Putting on a costume gives Rowley license to shed his usual shyness.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never otherwise say the things I say here," Rowley
confesses.</TE>
<TE>   His rude and sometimes crude comments are meant to harass,
entertain and draw in visitors to the archers' encampment. It's out
of character for him--and that's what makes it fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, these are obviously people of great wealth and no ability, I
mean nobility," he shouts from his tower above the target range.</TE>
<TE>   Just two weeks before this Saturday's opening of the European
Renaissance Festival in Corona (running weekends through May 27),
jewelers, jesters, vendors and assorted villagers were busy
constructing booths and encampments beneath the oaks in rustic
Riverview Park, overlooking the Santa Ana River.</TE>
<TE>   About noon, everyone dropped the tools and picked up armor, drums
and steel-pointed weapons to take part in a battle reenactment dress
rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   Men, women and children marched to the permanent arena,
constructed of "Renaissance-era telephone poles," one warrior joked.
While authenticity in the eight-acre Renaissance village is desired,
for practical reasons, it's not always required.</TE>
<TE>   While spectators pay to eat, drink and join the merriment,
festival participants are sometimes their own best customers.</TE>
<TE>   When they're not manning a booth, they're bartering with other
vendors or watching a stage show, or their kids are playing on the
oversized swing and the giant wooden horse.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest Renaissance festival in the country is the Renaissance
Pleasure Faire in Devore, open May 4 through June 16. Phyllis
Patterson, a teacher, started the fair 40 years ago in North
Hollywood as a teaching tool, says Bud Coffey, general manager of the
Pleasure Faire.</TE>
<TE>   It eventually moved to Agoura and then to its current location at
Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore. It's now operated by Renaissance
Entertainment Corp.</TE>
<TE>   For many, harking back to the days of yore is a hobby or labor of
love, and not intended as a way to make money. It's not unheard of
for vendors/warriors to spend $800 to create the period clothing they
wear.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ravenwood camp, one of the largest at the Corona fair,
visitors can shoot bows and arrows at the targets (six arrows for
$2), or just visit the encampment and watch the residents of
Ravenwood cook over an open fire, make arrows by hand or construct
chain mail (a chain vest that warriors wear to deflect arrows or
blades).</TE>
<TE>   The Archers of Ravenwood set up camp at half a dozen fairs a year,
representing Scottish, Irish or Turkish folk, depending on the event.</TE>
<TE>   In Corona, the mix throughout the village will include German,
French and Celtic nations.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of Renaissance fairs has also had an impact on
businesses that range from Los Angeles costume and leather suppliers
to a 75-year-old fishing tackle company in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "About four years ago we caught on to the fact that Renaissance
people were buying our [products], so we started to advertise in
their publications," says Mike Bleem, vice president of Rosco, which
makes stainless steel offset rings traditionally used in fishing
tackle. Renaissance crafters join them together to make chain mail
and headgear.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Calvert of Anaheim started Musketeer to Cavalier, a mail-order
business for hand-hammered armor, after attending the fairs for
several years. A love of history prodded him to become a re-enactor,
which led him to start the business almost two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone considers Renaissance fairs to be family
entertainment because of the occasional bawdy behavior, but Calvert
says it depends on the fair.</TE>
<TE>   "Devore is like Disneyland, it's huge," says Calvert. "Corona is
much quieter, a little more family oriented, but both have an
excellent reputation for representing the period."</TE>

<HD>North Hollywood's Own Stonehenge: A Pile of Used Sofas</HD>
<DH>To protest people dumping furniture on the streets, a local
artist creates 'Sofa Henge.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK EHRMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I've been waiting for the sun to come out so we get some shadow
activity happening," says artist Barbara Freeman, impatient for the
night's marine layer to disintegrate under the morning sun. At 6
a.m., she and a few helpers had begun arranging old sofas in a ring
around a vacant lot adjacent to the Academy of Television Arts and
Science Complex in North Hollywood. Finally, three hours later, just
as the last pieces--a creamy floral coach and ratty black
loveseat--are set in place, long, double-fingered shadows creep
across the grass toward Lankershim Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   For all the religious awe and reverence surrounding it,
Stonehenge, the Bronze Age megalith on England's Salisbury Plain, has
spawned an equal amount of silliness, most familiarly perhaps, the
"Spinal Tap" song of the same title. And now, for an ephemeral moment
in early April, Freeman gives the people of North Hollywood and the
North Hollywood Arts District, "Sofa Henge," a replica of the great
circle of stones created completely out of--you've probably guessed
by now--discarded sofas.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm miffed by the amount of furniture that people dump on the
street and leave like 'it's not my responsibility any more,'" says
the "50ish" North Hollywood resident by way of an artist's statement.
"I wanted to advertise that there is an 800 number that you can call
and have your bulky items picked up by the city for free."</LD>
<TE>   Although her background is primarily in ceramics, most of her
artwork, she says, "deals with the curiosity of human behavior and
social issues." This, she says, is her first "ephemeral" work,
referring to the fact that 24 hours after the "monument" goes up, the
city is scheduled to come and cart everything to the dump.</TE>
<TE>   First, she and a fellow local artist, Susan Krieg ("Susan has a
truck and I don't," Freeman explains) scoured the streets for sofas.
"We were worried that we wouldn't have enough," she says. "We worried
needlessly." Even after 25 discarded pieces were quarried for her
creation, says Freeman, "I know of places right now where you could
pick up some more."</TE>
<TE>   The artist isn't much of a druid and, in fact, has never been to
Stonehenge, but "has seen a lot of pictures on the Internet." None,
however, were used as a guide. Instead, Freeman chose to wing it.</TE>
<TE>   "I am simulating it," she says. "I am not being true to probably
the size and the girth of it. But the sofas work well as posts and
lintels." Purists may be disappointed to find that the great
monument's lying stones and outer rings were not duplicated, and as
to whether any care was taken to orient the soiled davenports toward
specific points of the compass, Freeman answers, "not really."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the functionaries from the Community Redevelopment
Authority and state Sen. Richard Alarcon's office are on hand to
present "Certificates of Appreciation for Outstanding Community
Service." "I believe that NoHo is an arts incubator, so it's a place
where a variety of creative ideas can come together and to stimulate
more ideas," says Lillian Burkenheim, the CRA's project manager.</TE>
<TE>   "'Sofa Henge' is sort of fun, not a big deal, but it's something
that one person in the community wanted to do and they will pull
together and do it and so it's worthy of merit."</TE>
<TE>   Worthy of money too. Ken Banks, executive director of the North
Hollywood Community Forum, which has underwritten the project, says
Freeman received a grant of $2,500 for her effort, which "illustrates
that there are a lot of areas in North Hollywood that, on the first
and 15th of the month, become depositories for used sofas."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the creation of "Sofa Henge" had its unsavory moments,
most notably those having to do with the 7-footer the artist
describes as "puke green," for reasons having less to do with its
sickly colored vinyl upholstery than with the stain upon it. Still,
Freeman boasts that the entire project took about 5 1/2 hours to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   While a few friends and support-NoHo Arts District types turn out,
most of the attention to her "innovative and ecologically sensitive"
monument is in the form of turned heads in vehicles approaching the
light at Weddington Street. What little foot traffic happens by keeps
on going, despite an inviting spread of coffee, fruit and doughnuts,
though occasionally the event snags one of those chatty types glad to
find captive conversationalists.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, with such monumental art, there is a danger of the
medium overshadowing the message, as it were. Indeed, even the phone
number for bulky item pickup gets lost among the coffee and doughnuts
and the commendations. (It's [800] 773-2489 in the city of Los
Angeles, by the way.)</TE>
<TE>   "We were wondering why all the couches were being put up here,"
says Doug Kern, who works next door as an instructor at the L.A.
Recording Workshop. "We have a lot of students who live in dorms, so
my first thought was these were all the old couches from the dorms,
but hey," he adds, when apprised of the concept, "if this is trash
and you put it to good use, who can complain?"</TE>

<LD>Barry Oldman picked up the platter piled high with cookies and went
out the front door to where his friends were waiting on the front
steps with Sherlock the dog.</LD>
<LD>   "At last," cried Kyle Gorbash, Barry's best friend.</LD>
<LD>   Kyle and Alexis each grabbed a cookie from the platter while
Sherlock barked and leaped around excitedly. Barry threw Sherlock a
dog treat and he caught it on the fly. For a while, the only thing
Barry heard was munching and other appreciative noises. He was not
surprised. He knew he made good cookies.</LD>
<TE>   "Marble fudge," Alexis remarked. "How did you do that?"</TE>
<TE>   "I stirred in chocolate syrup instead of chocolate chips," Barry
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," both kids exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Barry shrugged. "SOS," he said. "Same old stuff."</TE>
<TE>   "Same old good stuff," Kyle reminded him.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cooking new dishes," Barry said sadly. "If I don't get
some new ideas soon I'll run out before I'm 11."</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to your parents," Alexis suggested. "They own Gusto, the
fanciest restaurant in town. They ought to have some new ideas what
to cook."</TE>
<TE>   "Their food is good," Barry agreed, "but they've been serving from
the same menu since before I was born."</TE>
<TE>   A man walked along the sidewalk toward them. He was known as Weird
Willie. No matter what the weather, he wore a long coat and a big hat
with the brim pulled down over his face. As far as the kids knew, he
was harmless.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlock frolicked out to say hello. Though Weird Willie tried
pushing him away, the dog grabbed his coat and pulled so hard it
ripped in two and came off. Weird Willie's hat blew away. He now
stood before the kids with nothing on but a tight silver suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosh," Kyle exclaimed. "Weird Willie's not human!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: What is Willie?</TE>
<TE>   Author Mel Gilden still makes crumbs when he eats cookies. He
likes writing stories that center on food. This story will be on The

<HD>Weekend Audiences Prefer to 'Panic'</HD>
<DH>Box office * The Jodie Foster thriller keeps its grip on
No. 1 spot against competition from 'High Crimes,' which stars Ashley
Judd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jodie Foster beat Ashley Judd in a battle of female thrillers.</LD>
<LD>   Foster's "Panic Room" took in $18.5 million to remain the No. 1
film at the box office for the second straight weekend, while Judd's
"High Crimes" premiered in second place with $15 million, according
to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Among other new movies, the gross-out campus comedy "National
Lampoon's Van Wilder" opened at No. 5 with $7.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The slapstick farce "Big Trouble," about a suitcase containing a
nuclear bomb that becomes a magnet for a gaggle of goofy characters,
became a real bomb at theaters, taking in just $3.7 million for
eighth place. The movie's ensemble cast includes Tim Allen and Rene
Russo.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, it was another up weekend for Hollywood. The top 12
movies took in $95.7 million, a 17% increase over the same weekend a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Movie-industry revenues are running about 15% ahead of last year,
when Hollywood's domestic grosses hit a record $8.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Panic Room," starring Foster as a single mother fighting
intruders in her Manhattan brownstone, pushed its 10-day total to
$58.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us hope we can reach that $100-million figure," said
Jeff Blake, president of worldwide marketing and distribution for
Sony, which released "Panic Room."</TE>
<TE>   "High Crimes" reunites "Kiss the Girls" co-stars Judd and Morgan
Freeman. Judd plays an attorney menaced by a possible military
cover-up when she defends her husband against charges of slaughtering
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   With similar audience appeal, "Panic Room" likely siphoned off
potential moviegoers from "High Crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "I think 'Panic Room' certainly had an effect on 'High Crimes,'
given they're both female-driven movies," said Bruce Snyder, head of
distribution for 20th Century Fox, which released "High Crimes." "But
we're pleased with $15 million."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 3,053 theaters, "Panic Room" had a solid $6,060 average
in its second weekend, compared with $5,526 in 2,717 cinemas for
"High Crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "Big Trouble" was among a handful of movies scheduled for release
last fall but delayed because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Though it is a lighthearted comedy, "Big Trouble" has potentially
touchy scenes about lax airport security and a nuclear device aboard
an airplane, images that prompted distributor Disney to temporarily
shelve the film.</TE>
<TE>   With $30.5 million since it was reissued last month, "E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial" is close to passing "Star Wars: Episode I The
Phantom Menace" on the all-time box-office list domestically. "E.T."
took in $3.3 million over the weekend to climb to $430.3 million,
just $800,000 short of "Phantom Menace," No. 3 on the all-time list
behind "Titanic" ($600.8 million) and the original "Star Wars" ($461
million).</TE>

<BD>TIMES MUSIC WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murray Perahia has been playing solo recitals in Los Angeles since
the 1970s, and a fortunate few have heard most of those programs.
Some of those longtime Perahia followers were again in Royce Hall
when the beloved American pianist returned Friday night. They could
not have been disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Everything Perahia played provoked the senses, titillated the
musical mind, flooded the emotional receptors. His daunting program
bestowed pleasure and variety on the listener while challenging the
pianist. Perahia conquered all, illuminated all. The playing was
beautiful, the experience exhilarating.</LD>
<LD>   Major masterpieces, played with spontaneity, occupied the first
half, which began with Beethoven's breathtaking (after all these
years!) 32 Variations in C minor and crested on the free-flowing but
profound A-major Sonata of Schubert, D. 959.</LD>
<TE>   The Chopin half of the program was bookended by two Ballades, the
F-major and the A-flat; in between came two Mazurkas, three etudes
and the rarely encountered B-major Nocturne, Opus 62, No. 1. The
first encore was the "Winter Wind" Etude.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrated heat, an emotional connection to every piece of music
and a sense of constant rediscovery were present in all these
performances. Perahia's trademark accuracy and technical security
also marked the entire recital.</TE>
<TE>   The pianist seems to live every bar of music he produces, yet he
does so without apparent strain or visible angst. This is his
paradox: making so much heat, but remaining outwardly cool.</TE>
<TE>   With Perahia, the listener finds himself in the presence of a
master performer who guides one patiently through thickets of
tradition and rituals of style while making it all seem natural and
inevitable.</TE>

<HD>A Duet of Poetry and Strings at Royce Hall</HD>

<LD>Suddenly UCLA has become a haven for world-class string quartets
trying to break out of their usual concert rituals. Following the
Emerson Quartet's riveting theatrical "The Noise of Time" two weeks
ago, the Takacs Quartet collaborated with former U.S. poet laureate
Robert Pinsky at Royce Hall Saturday night in a program titled "All
the World for Love." Sounds like a trend.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the two events had one striking thing in common: Both were
preoccupied with 20th century composers' last thoughts--the Emerson
with Shostakovich, the Takacs with Janacek and Britten. Yet the
Takacs' step away from routine was less radical; Pinsky would read
four or five works from a mostly glittering gallery of poets--Emily
Dickinson, Robert Frost, William Butler Yeats, to name a few--and the
Takacs would play a complete work on its own.</LD>
<TE>   The links between music and poetry could have been far tighter
without changing so much as a note or word. There were no texts of
the poems in the printed program, and intelligibility within Royce's
live acoustics was a sometime thing, so listeners mainly had only the
carefully formed sounds of Pinsky's syllables to grapple with. There
was not a word in the program about the music--and here there was a
lot to be said about the autobiographical content of Janacek's String
Quartet No. 2 and Britten's String Quartet No. 3 that would have
provided added resonance. (Ben Jonson's "His Excuse for Loving," for
one, had direct relevance to Janacek's love for a much younger woman,
which inspired his quartet.)</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, this format coaxed heated, gutsy, eloquent
performances from the Takacs, which nailed the obsessiveness of
Janacek, played Barber's famous Adagio with quietly throbbing
emotion, and captured the disturbed, decayed, enigmatic qualities of
late-period Britten. Essentially, the performers trusted their
listeners to get it--and judging from the Q&amp;A period afterward, some
did.</TE>

<HD>Growing Up With the McCourts</HD>
<DH>Humor spurs 'A Couple of Blagards,' a two-man play
recounting the brothers' gritty childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank McCourt turned his bitter Irish childhood into the Pulitzer
Prize-winning "Angela's Ashes"; his brother, actor Malachy McCourt,
wrote the bestseller "A Monk Swimming," about his struggling early
adult years. These master raconteurs then laced their combined
experiences into a vaudeville of comedy, Irish songs and a gallery of
relatives, rogues, fools and petty tyrants--priestly and otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The result is "A Couple of Blaguards," a touring two-man play that
had its Southern California premiere this weekend at Brea's Curtis
Theatre, its only local stop.</LD>
<LD>   On a stage empty but for a wooden table and two chairs, Malachy
(Howard Platt, who directs), and Frank McCourt (Jarlath Conroy) each
salute the audience with a hefty pint of dark, heady ale and a
curling Irish brogue, then launch into an hour and 40 minutes of
marvelous blarney and blather, winking sentimentality, lusty humor
and life stories that progress from Ireland to New York.</LD>
<TE>   Much lighter than "Angela's Ashes" and Frank McCourt's second
memoir, "'Tis," the brothers' tale of growing up in grinding poverty
and their years spent trying to cope with the scars of it all unfolds
through a series of narratives and characters, some more sharply
defined than others.</TE>
<TE>   We meet the mother--pious, defeated and irritating.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the moon landing at a saloon, she cuts off Neil
Armstrong's historic first words with a loud and plaintive demand for
a sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   There is the absentee alcoholic father, who at age 70 is found
drunk in bed with two elderly neighbor women--"on the pillow were
three bald heads and seven miles of gums."</TE>
<TE>   Although mincing movement and a simper are all that distinguish
some of the female characters played by Platt, he and Conroy score
laughs as kerchiefed Limerick gossips, and as the McCourt children
playing at being women at a wake, extolling the dubious virtues of
the deceased.</TE>
<TE>   Platt--big, broad-faced and red-haired, with the pouchy-eyed look
of a man who may indeed enjoy hoisting a few--amps up his energy in
the dynamic and hilarious second act recounting Frank and Malachy's
adventures in New York.</TE>
<TE>   As Frank, the dark and intense Conroy--a Broadway and Irish
theater veteran with mournful eyes and eyebrows quizzically
aslant--is a forceful presence throughout. Whether portraying young
Frank's horror that he can't swallow the dry wafer at his first
Communion ("I had God glued to the roof of my mouth"), or the adult
Frank's reaction when a comely librarian introduces him to the greats
of Irish literature, Conroy conveys the tears beneath the laughter.</TE>
<TE>   And, though this show is propelled by irreverent humor and
burlesque, that's what lingers afterward: the underlying reality of
two men who were shaped by life in a gritty little lane in Limerick.</TE>

<HD>Trail of Dead: Full of Life</HD>
<DH>With its textured sound, the band injects the rock scene
with a shot of passion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead has already earned a place
in rock history for one of the longest group names, but the Texas
quartet's frequently thrilling concert Friday at the El Rey showed it
also has a strong chance to make history in a more significant way.</LD>
<LD>   Like Detroit's White Stripes, Trail of Dead is one of a growing
number of bands that is reviving many of rock's most valuable traits,
including passion and creative ambition, during a period when both
those qualities are in pitifully short supply.</LD>
<LD>   It's a band with the punk-aligned independence and classic rock
sensibilities that would have made it fit in as an opening act for
the Clash in the '70s, U2 in the '80s or Nirvana in the '90s--but
it's apparent the band is going to do just fine headlining its own
shows during this decade.</LD>
<TE>   The most immediate element in "Source Tags &amp; Codes," the group's
major label album debut, is its striking sonic design. The twin
guitar-driven, multilayered assault has been compared with everyone
from Sonic Youth to the Stooges, but the most useful reference point
is Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, the great British band of the '80s and early
'90s.</TE>
<TE>   In such Mary Chain albums as "Psychocandy" and "Dark- lands,"
brothers Jim and William Reid combined brutal guitar distortion with
lovely, almost Burt Bacharach-like melodies to express the
desperation and doubts that separate us from our grandest desires and
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Trail of Dead places more emphasis on the forceful textures than
the comforting melodies, but the result is a more varied and
multidimensional sound.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the band doesn't fall into the contemporary trap
of using aggression only to express anger.</TE>
<TE>   There is a restraint onstage and on record that allows the music
to convey contrasting, even contradictory elements, providing intense
moments that are hopeful as well as anxious.</TE>
<TE>   The group's three lead singers--guitarist Conrad Keely, bassist
Neil Busch and drummer Jason Reece--join guitarist Kevin Allen with
an interlocking force that generates a white-heat power onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Trail of Dead comes out of the same Texas scene that produced At
the Drive-In, the promising hard-rock band that split up last year,
and it too is known for chaotic stage shows, where instruments are
often hurled and drum kits demolished.</TE>
<TE>   The latter could quickly become gimmicky, but the musicians kept
it to a minimum on Friday. Busch did throw his guitar across the
stage at the end of the blunt-edged "Mistakes &amp; Regrets" early in the
set, but it seemed a natural extension of the frustration of
musicians who can't always get all the intensity of a song from
instruments alone.</TE>
<TE>   On "Source Codes," the themes range from man's dark nature (the
pain and shame outlined in "Baudelaire") to tales of isolation (in
the apocalyptic "Heart Is the Hand of the Matter," there is talk
about wandering among vacant lots and fluorescent malls, one-room
coffins and crowded halls).</TE>
<TE>   At the El Rey, Trail of Dead mixed about half the songs from the
new album with material from earlier albums in a concert whose
ultimately idealistic tone was defined by "Relative Ways," an
exhilarating expression of the power of rock 'n' roll to uplift and
inspire.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of overly calculated mainstream bands, rock needs
groups that can restore belief in the future of the art form--and
Trail of Dead does just that.</TE>

<HD>Collision Course in 'Changing Lanes'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Roger Michell likens it to a "morality play" or a "parable
for our times." Producer Scott Rudin says audiences will not only
identify with the two leading characters but end up rooting for them.
The film is called "Changing Lanes," and although it has elements of
a thriller, it is really more of an adult drama that its creators
hope will prove thought-provoking.</LD>
<LD>   Debuting Friday, the Paramount Pictures release presents Ben
Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson as men involved in a rush-hour
fender-bender on New York City's crowded FDR Drive. What begins as a
minor collision, however, turns two complete strangers into vicious
adversaries. Still, the movie is more philosophical than
action-oriented--which makes it more of a marketing challenge for the
studio.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not really about road rage at all," Michell explains. "It's
just the tiny sparks that turn these two men's universe inside out.
They get thrown into a washing machine and tumble around all day and
come out at the other end."</LD>
<TE>   Rudin said he was drawn to the material (Chap Taylor and Michael
Tolkin receive screenplay credit) because it asks: What would happen
to two people if the rules didn't hold?</TE>
<TE>   "I live in New York," Rudin says, "and I sometimes walk around the
city and wonder why people aren't killing each other. And how
slightly below the surface the impulse to kill each other lies. I
think everybody who sees it is one of those two guys."</TE>

<HD>This Is Your Busy Life, Ozzy Osbourne</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans who rush out Saturday and get tickets for Ozzfest 2002 will gain
entree to see not just one of the elder statesmen of heavy metal but
also MTV's newest sitcom star.</LD>
<LD>   They are one and the same: Ozzy Osbourne. The weekly series "The
Osbournes" has turned into a major hit for MTV since its premiere
March 5. The first episode, an MTV spokeswoman says, was the
highest-rated series premiere in the history of the cable channel.</LD>
<LD>   Things have just gone up from there. As word of mouth and positive
reviews have circulated, ratings have increased each week. "The
Osbournes" has become the most watched program in its time
slot--Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m.--among viewers 12 to 34 years old, and
that covers cable or broadcast channels, the MTV spokeswoman adds.</LD>
<TE>   The show, which TV Guide calls "a cross between 'The Simpsons' and
'This Is Spinal Tap,'" revolves around the often surreal daily lives
of Osbourne, his manager-wife Sharon, their teenage children Kelly
and Jack, and their Australian nanny Melinda Varga. (The Osbournes'
eldest child, Aimee, opted out of the show.)</TE>
<TE>   The success of the series has rubbed off on Osbourne's latest
album, "Down to Earth." It sold 153,000 copies the first week it was
released in October but had settled into weekly sales of around
10,000 copies before the show came on. The week "The Osbournes"
began, album sales spiked more than 40%, to 14,000 copies. It's now
sold 705,000 copies since the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne-mania only figures to keep growing with Universal Music's
release last week of four of his earlier albums.How well those do on
Billboard's Catalog Albums chart will become apparent Wednesday when
first-week sales figures come in.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-pronged Ozz attack should certainly benefit Ozzfest,
which opens July 6 in Bristow, Va., and reaches Southern California
with an Aug. 31 stop at the Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore. The
seventh edition of the annual hard-rock blowout features Osbourne,
Rob Zombie, System of a Down, P.O.D., Drowning Pool, Adema and Zakk
Wylde's Black Label Society, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The MTV series, says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert
business weekly Pollstar, "certainly broadens the exposure for Ozzy,
not that he necessarily needs it. But I imagine the MTV demographic
skews pretty young, and Ozzy's core audience is older. One thing
about Ozzfest, it has the tradition of bringing along the best of new
music as well [as the veterans]. So that's allowed Ozzy to be exposed
to younger hard-rock fans who might not otherwise go to see him."</TE>

<HD>Lurie Plays Up Vocal Skills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seattle's history as fertile rock music territory is old news, but it
now seems to be producing some compelling, stylistically eclectic
jazz, as well. The Jessica Lurie Ensemble, which performed at Rocco's
in Hollywood on Friday and Saturday night, is a good example.</LD>
<LD>   Alto saxophonist Lurie has been a regular with the Billy Tipton
Memorial Saxophone Quartet and the trio Living Daylights, employing
her instrumental skills, vocal abilities and compositional efforts in
consistently cutting-edge fashion.</LD>
<LD>   In her own ensemble, she has the opportunity to stretch even more,
and Saturday night's performance was an exhilarating display of the
unheralded but impressive music that is being made--in Seattle and
beyond--by adventurous young artists.</LD>
<TE>   The Lurie ensemble also included tenor saxophonist Sue Orfield,
guitarist Jason Seed, bassist Reuben Radding and drummer Greg
Campbell, and much of the program traced to the group's first album,
"Zipa! Buka!"</TE>
<TE>   Lurie and Orfield, the band's front-line players, worked in
strikingly synergistic fashion, easily wending their way through the
often tricky lines and twisted meters of Lurie's originals.</TE>
<TE>   Both displayed an accomplished ability to interweave far-out,
avant-jazz excursions through the outer limits of their horns with a
more mainstream sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   Lurie's soloing, in addition, was tinged with an unusual seasoning
of Eastern European melody-making.</TE>
<TE>   Seed, reminiscent at times of John Scofield, primarily surveyed
the territory between electric rock and straight-ahead jazz, while
Radding and Campbell played largely supportive roles.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest surprise of the set, however, was Lurie's vocalizing.
Her intimate tonal blending with Orfield's saxophone on "J'ai
Faim,"--sometimes in unison, sometimes via closely linked
harmonies--was a strikingly new-sounding jazz timbre, worthy of more
extensive presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Even more intriguing, the group rendering of Alison Krauss'
"Didn't Leave Nothin' but the Baby" (from the Coen brothers film "Oh
Brother, Where Art Thou") was a convincing combination of lyrical
song and atmospheric accompaniment.</TE>

<HD>Are Bureaucrats TV's New Heroes?</HD>
<DH>Trends* The new interest in the role of government, and
those who make it work, is reflected in recent programs that focus on
Washington, D.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP KENNICOTT</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On "This Week With Sam Donaldson &amp; Cokie Roberts," the latter has an
idea, Sam is clucking approval, and even the saturnine face of George
Will is registering a slight smile. The idea: The '60s are finally
over. The proof: Polls show that Americans trust the government again
(though it's not clear from the polls whether that trust extends
beyond the prosecution of the war on terrorism).</LD>
<LD>   They certainly seem infatuated with government out in the Great
Wasteland. Following the multiple-Emmy success of "The West Wing,"
there are now two TV entertainment series devoted to the inner
workings of the Supreme Court ("First Monday" and "The Court"), and
one to the CIA ("The Agency"). An attempt to apply the same formula
to the diplomatic corps ("The American Embassy") came and went, but
"JAG," a look at the judge adjutant general, has proved popular.
Network television never loved bureaucrats as much as it does now.</LD>
<LD>   By and large, these shows seem aimed at a relatively literate
audience and steer clear of the twin demons of television violence
and prurience. Despite their grandiose settings, they mostly revolve
around the petty dramas of everyday people just doing their best to
get on getting on.</LD>
<TE>   On balance, it seems a positive trend. Several of the programs
place a premium on intelligence and dedication. A current leitmotif
of "The West Wing" is the problem of the president's brainpower:
Should he hide it from an electorate suspicious of intellectuals or
celebrate it as a strength? Plot twists revolve around clever,
well-studied underlings who think their way out of jams. And far from
the faceless bureaucrats villainized by the budget-cutting,
outside-the-Beltway crowd, today's television bureaucrats are hip
young urbanites, devoted to public service and solving the nation's
problems. They all put in very long hours.</TE>
<TE>   These are the perfect shows for what historians would call
"post-industrial" America. We've come a long way from the agrarian
society of 1970s television, the little houses on prairies, the
fur-wearing, muskrat-trapping Grizzly Adams and his hunter-gatherer
ilk. Today's TV workers don't actually grow or make anything; they
provide administrative services, interact with each other, talk and
write and push papers around offices with no natural light.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics might note that these are basically the same dramas that
used to happen in hospitals, or law firms, simply transferred to
government settings. Throw up some columns, roll out some marble,
drape a few flags, and "The West Wing" is basically "L.A. Law" in
D.C. But that underestimates the power of setting. The government is
not incidental to these programs, it is essential.</TE>
<TE>   The fascination with government as TV subject has so far been
limited to areas of the bureaucracy that have a cult of secrecy: the
imperial remove of the executive mansion, the cloak-and-dagger hush
of the CIA, the arcane hidden traditions of the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most secretive new addition to the roster of
government powers, the military tribunals proposed for trying
terrorism suspects, is the subject of an upcoming episode of "JAG,"
written with some input from the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Is it merely a coincidence that television is obsessed with
showing the inner workings of government at a time when the inner
workings of government are becoming more and more opaque? Energy
policy is decided behind closed doors with oil executives--a fact
that comes out only after the government grudgingly releases records
riddled with deletions and excisions. Terrorist suspects are rounded
up and held for questioning, and the government doesn't even release
their names. And the Bush administration invokes executive privilege
and refuses to allow top-level lieutenants in the war on terrorism,
such as Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, to testify before
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Less than half a year after the election was decided, by the
Supreme Court, the camera takes us there in camera . And as the
government orders all of its agencies to review and expunge from the
Internet any weapons information that may be of use to potential
terrorists, "The Agency" appears as a behind-the-scenes fantasy of
the spook technology that we so desperately hope is being used to
protect us.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether all of this is driven by a newfound love of
the government, or simply wish fulfillment--please let our government
be as benign as it seems to be on television. One can't, for
instance, explain the public's love of medical dramas through any
particular love of spending time in a hospital, or lawyer dramas
through any profound affection for the legal profession. Television
may play on our fears, but it also soothes them by making our
dependence--on doctors, lawyers or bureaucrats--feel more human.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the things that are most troubling about
television--violence and exploitative sex--we mostly fall back on two
very old theories: Either it is setting us a bad example and leading
us to ruin, or it is a catharsis, a pressure valve, that dissipates
toxic impulses in a fantasy world before they mess up the real one.</TE>
<TE>   Let's apply the same theories to the seemingly positive things
about the new crop of government dramas--the positive vision of
hard-working, dedicated, intelligent civil servants. Is this setting
us a good example, leading young people, perhaps, to contemplate
careers as policy wonks? Or does fantasy government become a kind of
substitute, a reassuring bromide, that deflects attention and energy
away from thinking too much about the problems of the real one?</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody transforms arrogance into pop fun quite like Kid Rock. At his
circus-like show on Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre, the
Detroit rap-rocker tackled the riffs and melodies of everyone from
Led Zeppelin to the Supremes to Eminem and took it upon himself to
play solos on each of his band member's instruments. Of course, that
was when he wasn't screaming out his name or bragging to the beats.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how self-indulgent or over the top things get, however,
Kid Rock (a.k.a. Bob Ritchie) maintains an everyman charm that keeps
crowds right there with him.</LD>
<LD>   With a trailer park stage motif, buxom go-go dancers and plenty of
fireworks, Saturday's flashy presentation was pure keg-party
hedonism--a perfect setting for his many Southern rock-flavored hits.</LD>
<TE>   As his versatile band, Twisted Brown Trucker, rolled along with
him, the wiry rapper-singer-musician meandered through classic licks
(the intro to Aerosmith's "Walk This Way"), flag-waving anthems (a
heartfelt rendition of "America the Beautiful"), a little tribute to
his dearly departed co-MC Joe C. and a sprinkling of metallic
head-bangers and twangy new country crooners.</TE>
<TE>   His rhymes are audacious and often downright silly, but Rock
rarely goes the ironic route. He may have a shameless manner and
cartoony image, but his reverence for (and reference to) the musical
influences who came before him is undeniably earnest, as is his
patriotic fervor, something he had long before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Though he helped spearhead the rap-rock craze, Kid Rock has more
in common with Lynyrd Skynyrd than Limp Bizkit. Sure, the concert had
its share of punk-like rants and raucous rhythms, but there were just
as many low-key Willie Nelson-style moments.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Classical Spanish dance conveys an image of supremely vibrant,
refined energy--the body restlessly reflecting the shifting moods in
the music, yet always majestic in placement, silken in technique.
This image dominates Mayte Bajo's solo "De Azabache y Playa," new to
the repertory of the National Ballet of Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday afternoon at the Wilshire Theatre, Bajo danced this
technically demanding showpiece with assurance, looking willowy in a
glittering black gown but making every turn, jump, high kick and
castanet flourish convey the gathering speed and force of taped music
by Javier Coble.</LD>
<LD>   No less a test of dancer prowess, the flamenco solo "Entreverao
(Farruca)" found Oscar Jimenez diligently working through the
choreography two days after its premiere with another dancer.</LD>
<TE>   Jimenez can make an audience hold its breath simply by adjusting
his vest or suddenly pausing in the midst of high-speed dancing with
one leg floating in the air behind him.</TE>
<TE>   But as yet, the different tasks and moods created by Manuel
Santiago Maya in "Manolete" look assigned rather than driven by some
inner imperative.</TE>
<TE>   Now led by Primitivo Daza and Alberto Ferrero, the men's
"Estampio" showcase had tightened impressively since its Thursday
premiere, with the sustained unison flamenco footwork more than ever
an index of this company's impressive training and coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing with spirit and charm, Cristina Gomez replaced Kira Gimeno
as a soloist in the opening section of the previously reviewed
"Concierto de Aranjuez." "Mujeres" and "Grito" again completed the
program.</TE>

<HD>Dayton Infuses McKayle Salute With Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adrenaline kicked into overdrive when the Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company shredded the stage of the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Friday
with brute power, dizzying energy and unlimited stamina in a program
dedicated to Southern California's preeminent choreographer, Donald
McKayle. The four works included a world premiere tribute to McKayle,
"Mighty Fortress," set to Bach's Cantata No. 80 by company artistic
director Kevin Ward.</LD>
<LD>   With such potent music--and tackling no less a subject than
talking to God--this 25-minute, eight-part suite could have used a
shot of divine intervention: The choreography proved scattershot,
with little cohesion, save for the dancers continually gazing
heavenward. Dressed in Ward's white costumes, the dozen performers
were certainly kept busy enough--leaping, skipping, falling
backward--but fluidity and sense of purpose were lacking.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the perpetual motion, however, there were moments of beauty:
A male trio--Ricardo J. Garcia Cruz, Daniel Marshall and Alvin J.
Rangel--offered nifty handstands; a deftly executed pas de deux by
DeShona Pepper and G.D. Harris featured a brazen one-arm lift; and
Monnette Bariel's vigorous solo saw her hoisted overhead as if in a
sacrificial rite. Another highlight was the phenomenal Sheri
"Sparkle" Williams, a 28-year company veteran whose exuberance and
technique awed in her pristine solo.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Williams opened the program as the sole woman in McKayle's
seminal 1959 work, "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder," a chain-gang opus
that addresses oppression. Performed by companies around the world,
Dayton premiered it in 1987. It is testament to McKayle's genius that
his taut choreography, cutting an emotional swath, remains vital
today.</TE>
<TE>   Emotions also soared in "Children of the Passage," made for the
company by McKayle and Ronald K. Brown in 1999. Previously reviewed,
the dancers joyously let loose to the live, raucous sounds of the
Dirty Dozen Brass Band.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the program: Bebe Miller's West Coast premiere,
"Aerodigm" (2002), an abstract exploration of flight that failed to
take off,with arbitrary prancing aggravated by a nonsensical
voice-over and unflattering costumes.</TE>

<HD>Leno's Late-Night Streak Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Letterman and "Nightline" commanded the lion's share of
headlines during March, but the first three months of 2002 again
belonged to "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno": NBC's late-night host
dominated the ratings in finishing first for the 26th consecutive
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Leno's show, which will mark its 10th anniversary with a
prime-time special April 30, averaged 6 million viewers per average
minute, mirroring its performance versus the same three-month period
last year.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' "Late Show With David Letterman," meanwhile, was up slightly
compared with first-quarter 2002, averaging 4.2 million viewers.
"Nightline" fell 7%, to 4.2 million viewers, while the ABC show that
rounds out the hour, "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher," slipped
11%, to 2.5 million viewers.</LD>
<TE>   "Politically Incorrect" has lost some affiliate coverage since
comments by Maher generated controversy during the fall. Moreover,
ABC's ratings in prime time are down by more than 20%, which hasn't
helped other parts of the network's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Leno also maintains a solid advantage among adults ages 18 to 49,
the most important demographic to advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   These latest ratings underscoring "The Tonight Show's" unwavering
leadership coincide with Leno's first detailed remarks addressing the
recent tumult surrounding late night, including reports that
Letterman's flirtation with jumping to ABC was driven by his fervent
desire to narrow the gap with Leno.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources say the fact that Letterman trails Leno gnaws at
the host, whose new CBS contract stipulates that he will receive more
promotion from the network's parent company, Viacom, in an effort to
make his show more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think after all this time it would be, 'Oh, well, he's
successful, I'm successful, everybody is rich beyond their wildest
dreams.' I don't know why there has to be such animosity. It just
seems odd to me," Leno told TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the press has generally favored Letterman,
critically anointing him as the heir to Johnny Carson. Leno,
meanwhile, has taken a more populist approach, telling TV Guide that
he takes "a certain perverse pleasure" in knowing he works more weeks
a year than Letterman, makes less money and turns out a more
profitable show. "I'll take ambition over genius any day of the
week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Leno, NBC's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" averaged 2.5
million viewers during the first quarter this year, a 4% gain from
2001 and 900,000 more than CBS' competing "Late Late Show With Craig
Kilborn," which experienced a 5% decline. The new half-hour NBC show
that follows O'Brien, "Last Call With Carson Daly," averaged 1.7
million viewers.</TE>

<HD>Brendel Spreads Pianistic Calm</HD>
<DH>The beloved performer offers musical comfort in his program
of Viennese classics at the Chandler.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alfred Brendel looks a part when he walks onstage. His hair divides
into tousled patches of gray. His manner appears purposeful yet
slightly distracted. He could be a wise scholar, a trusted family
physician, a poet.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the beloved pianist is something of each. He is a much
published writer on music and other subjects. He is, as musician, a
comfort giver--a pianist who these days concentrates on the familiar
Viennese masters of the Classical and Romantic era and plays them
with irresistible affection.</LD>
<LD>   And for the last several years he has been an actual poet.
Sandwiched between piano recitals at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
Friday and the Irvine Barclay Theatre Sunday, he read his whimsical
poetry Saturday night at the Jack Rutberg Fine Arts Gallery.</LD>
<TE>   For Friday's recital at the Chandler, Brendel was in the business
exclusively of providing musical assurance. His program was devoted
to the big three Viennese classicists--Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.
From his writings and interviews, it is clear that Brendel thinks
about, and involves himself in, the world at large, in politics and
culture. But here he seemed to need nothing more than to warmly
embrace every lovable phrase in these three composers, and maybe an
ever so slight bemusement.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Brendel's many fans--and they filled the
Chandler--is that, at 71, the pianist seems in perfectly good shape
technically. He has never been one of the big keyboard barnstormers,
but he has enough technique to decorate a Haydn sonata with
gracefully uplifting decorations, which he did with the one in G
minor that opened the program. In Mozart's weighty D-minor Fantasy,
he plumbed depths with a rich and concentrated tone, and he played
Mozart's A-minor Sonata with constrained passion, its middle movement
sumptuously smooth. Every so often Brendel seemed on the verge of
lingering, too entranced by a cadence or turn of phrase to let it go
but he always managed to stop just short of mannerism.</TE>
<TE>   These are pieces meant for an intimate space, and that is how
Brendel played them, which also meant a certain straining for an
audience in a large hall without a strong acoustical presence. Even
in Beethoven's "Diabelli" Variations, Brendel seemed more inclined to
find delicate wonder in the composer's invention than to exult in the
variations' extravagant range of character.</TE>
<TE>   Each one of these 33 variations is a marvel of wit and wonder,
and, in two new recordings, the extraordinary young pianists Olli
Mustonen and Piotr Anderszewski play them as if they are pulling us
out of chairs and taking us on great escapades. Another recent
recording of the variations, by Maurizio Pollini, is a great
intellectual venture. Brendel, on the other hand, is the avuncular
Beethovenian, as if reading to us about these pianistic exploits from
his easy chair.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say his performance lacked immediacy or power. He
could be surprisingly forceful, and there were touches of wry humor.
He has thought about this great work deeply, and though other
pianists can be more interesting here and there, he finds something
satisfying in its every instance. I particularly enjoyed the
roundness he brought to the contrapuntal lines in the 32nd variation
and the delicate way he seemed to drift off into outer space with the

<HD>Quirky Violette Pairs Eclectic With Eccentric</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Asian American pop band Visiting Violette sure picked a topical title
for its debut album, "A Hero's Day." But the decade-old L.A.-based
group focused on personal heroes, not those who do brave things for a
living, during a Saturday celebration at the Japan America Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The septet's polished music fused R&amp;B and funk, folky pop and
mellow rock, variously recalling 10,000 Maniacs, Sheryl Crow and the
Motels. The songs were put together well, but often so stylistically
eccentric it was as if the band found all ideas equally compelling
and couldn't leave anything out. Indeed, that was reflected in the
75-minute program, which also featured spoken word, a taiko drummer
and dancers, as well as a stripped-down "acoustic" segment complete
with guest rapper, and even a short, hero-themed video.</LD>
<LD>   Crooning quirky tunes about heartbreak, life on Mars and
overcoming hardship in a girlish yet substantial voice, singer Lee
Takasugi was a dynamic frontwoman, although her performing style was
an overly theatrical blend of Natalie Merchant twirling, Gwen Stefani
energy and theme-park-show exaggerated emotion.</LD>
<TE>   Some lyrics had threads of social and cultural conscience,
commenting on such things as traditional submissive Japanese female
roles, as did stories Takasugi told.</TE>
<TE>   In one, she explained that the piano she played had been her
mother's, kept during World War II by sympathetic white neighbors
while the family was interred. It was poignant to realize how
something often taken for granted--family heirlooms--could be so
rare. And that, in this context, an act of decency became a heroic
deed.</TE>

<HD>Competition of Pianists Ends on a Controversial Note</HD>
<DH>Judges disqualify an audience favorite, saying he played
too poorly, and decline to name a third-place winner.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials at the first Rachmaninoff International Competition and
Festival wanted to avoid controversy. But one landed in their laps
anyway when, in announcing top honors Friday at Pasadena Civic
Auditorium, the judges disqualified Alessio Cioni, 23, of Italy from
the final round.</LD>
<LD>   "With regret," they declared in a statement, "it is the unanimous
decision of the jury that Mr. Cioni's lack of preparation in his
performances in the final round was such that is it not warranted
that he be considered a laureate finalist of this competition. He
will remain, however, designated a formal semifinalist."</LD>
<LD>   There was more than a title involved. Each of the three
non-medalist finalists received $10,000 (semifinalists, $2,000).
First-place winner Evgeni Mikhailov, 29, of Russia, got $30,000, a
Kawai concert grand piano and a concert date with the Mexico City
Philharmonic Orchestra. Second-place winner Mizuka Kano, 23, of
Japan, received $20,000. Both also will have a CD released by
L.A.-based Pipeline Music, one of the sponsors. No third-place winner
was awarded. (Finalist Ning An, 25, of the United States, won the
$3,000 Audience Prize, announced at the awards ceremony and concert
on Saturday.)</LD>
<TE>   But the disqualification of Cioni, named an audience favorite in
informal polls earlier in the two-week, 30-pianist contest, made
rumors fly, tempers flare and conspiracy theories sprout.</TE>
<TE>   Some saw an ominous preponderance of judges from Russia and former
Eastern bloc countries. Some asked if Kawai's sponsorship guaranteed
a Japanese winner.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the most stalwart fans of Cioni could claim that his
playing in the final concerto round--especially Rachmaninoff's
Third--remotely approached the level he had reached earlier. Still
many wondered why he had been so publicly rebuked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cruel and unnecessary, like punishing a child in public,"
said a major pianist.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight I am an embarrassed citizen of this community," one
faithful attendee wrote in a widely circulated e-mail message.</TE>
<TE>   "We can forgive lots of things on stage," said jury co-chair,
Nikolai Petrov, of Russia, Saturday. "An interpreter can be sick. He
can be afraid of the public. He can forget. He can stop on stage.
This time, [Cioni] was not prepared. He didn't learn the concerto."</TE>
<TE>   Said Russian-born pianist and judge Vladimir Ashkenazy: "This
decision was made based on a lot of information, not just because he
played Rachmaninoff the way he played. The jury reminisced on the
first two rounds. The decision was made with maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing else we could do," he continued. "It would be
really unfair if he got so much money just because he got to the
finals."</TE>
<TE>   Cioni acknowledged he was ill-prepared for the final round. "I
studied the [Rachmaninoff] concerto in a short time and never played
it with an orchestra," he said after the closing concert Saturday. "I
don't feel cheated. The decision of the jury is fantastic. Mikhailov
is a wonderful pianist. I'm very happy. The level of the competition
was very high. It was a good experience."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel very, very bad for this nice guy and someone with a great
potential," Mikhailov said through an interpreter. "But he was
completely unprepared for the third round. Probably he didn't expect
to be there. It would have been much better if he said he were ill
and didn't participate in the round. It was the right decision of the
jury, and a courageous decision."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the missing third prize, U.S. juror Lucy Ishkanian said:
"Most of us felt that the gap, the distance in the quality of playing
between the second-prize winner was just too great to award a third
prize. We wanted to keep the level of the competition rather high."</TE>
<TE>   Petrov said the matter was simpler: "We needed to get a two-thirds
majority [of the 12-member jury]. We didn't. We had four or five for
one finalist, three for another. The question was over."</TE>
<TE>   The jury rules printed in the program stated that all marks given
by the jury would be public. That will not happen, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided there was really no reason to make them public," said
American co-chair Byron Janis. "Most competitions don't."</TE>
<TE>   Cioni did have fans on the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first round, he played the Chopin Etude in A minor. It was
stunning," said U.S. juror Earl Wild. "It was so good, in my life I
hadn't heard it played so well. But playing concertos is another
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very talented boy," Wild continued. "This should be a
wonderful lesson for him. If you're in music, you have to become used
to being criticized. He was up against people who knew the music
perfectly. He didn't. It's unfortunate. All of us in the world have
been criticized, sometimes very unfairly. If you have anything inside
you that's real, it should not even bother you."</TE>

<LD>A spate of convicts has earned freedom following "Frontline" films by
Ofra Bikel that raised public awareness about their plights.</LD>
<LD>   "When injustices in the system receive this kind of attention, the
public will respond," attorney Mark Montgomery said in February, when
his client, 21-year-old Terence Garner, was released from a North
Carolina prison and granted a new trial less than a month after
Bikel's "An Ordinary Crime" offered strong evidence of his innocence
in an armed robbery that resulted in a death.</LD>
<LD>   This time she's too late.</LD>
<TE>   The subject of her newest PBS documentary, Thursday's "Requiem for
Frank Lee Smith," had spent 14 years on Florida's death row when he
died of painful cancer 10 months before DNA testing would exonerate
him of raping and murdering 8-year-old Shandra Whitehead.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was no angel.</TE>
<TE>   At age 13 he was convicted of manslaughter. At 18 he was convicted
of murder. He had already spent 15 years behind bars and was on
parole when he was picked up by police in Fort Lauderdale and charged
with Shandra's murder.</TE>
<TE>   The murder that would attract Bikel to his case. The murder for
which a jury found him guilty. The murder that brought him a cell a
few steps from the Florida electric chair nicknamed "Old Sparky."</TE>
<TE>   The murder he didn't commit.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's vicious past makes this film--which methodically traces
his abuse by the legal system--no less important or fascinating. Or
his case any less sympathetic to Bikel, one of television's premier
documentary filmmakers since the 1970s, including 15 productions for
"Frontline." Although her films aren't magic wands that right wrongs,
her camera wields the power to mobilize public opinion through
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Miscarriages of justice fire her passion.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about crime that blows my mind is that people have no
idea," she said by phone from New York City. "They don't realize that
once you're sentenced, being innocent makes no difference. They could
execute you knowing you're innocent. People know nothing about it."</TE>
<TE>   And she does know? This petite, blond-frosted, elegant,
expensively turned-out woman (we'll call her "mature") who wears big,
tinted glasses and seals herself from street crime in her apartment
above Central Park? Some impassioned crusader, some scruffy
revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you kidding? I'm no revolutionary," protested Bikel in the
soft hybrid voice (she's from Israel and attended college in Paris)
heard in her films. "I'm a middle-class person. I love pretty
furniture. I love jewelry. What I'm drawn to is the difference
between perception and reality. If you like the system, be my guest.
But at least know what it is. It's not a trial system, it's a
plea-bargain system. It really gripes me when people say this is not
a perfect system but it's the best in the world."</TE>
<TE>   It griped her when she was making her 1990s "Innocence Lost"
trilogy in tiny Edenton, N.C., where she initially resisted going
because "I was told it was a little town that doesn't have a big
hotel and doesn't take American Express." The yield was remarkable,
though, an award-laden work documenting an odyssey of anguish endured
by jailed defendants in a sexual abuse case at a day-care center
called Little Rascals, shades of the McMartin preschool case. The two
convictions, both leading to life sentences, were overturned as
Bikel's third film in the series was about to air.</TE>
<TE>   It griped her too when making "The Case for Innocence," whose
three profiled "lifers" were set free in 2000, months after the film
reported on DNA testing that appeared to confirm their claims of
innocence regarding rape and murder.</TE>
<TE>   It griped her when making "An Ordinary Crime," the documentary
that whipped up public opinion that ultimately threw open Garner's
cell. "All I wanted to do was get this boy out," she said. "It was
such a setup. He obviously didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   It griped her, finally, when she was planning her latest film.
"There was one more case, which we began to investigate and didn't
have time to finish," says narrator Will Lyman to start the
documentary. "And it haunted us, so we decided to go back to it two
years later. It was the story of Frank Lee Smith."</TE>
<TE>   It was a story that Bikel had wanted to include in "The Case for
Innocence," but she ran out of air time. A story turning on a
disputed confession and mistaken identity from a police sketch by a
woman named Chiquita Lowe, who later recanted and identified someone
else after Smith was already on death row .</TE>
<TE>   Where he stayed ... and stayed ... and stayed, his life "passing
in aging mug shots," says Lyman as prison photographs of Smith's
gradual atrophy through the years appear on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Just as several jurors in the Little Rascals case confided to
Bikel they bowed to the majority's will and voted "guilty" despite
having strong doubts, Lowe says she had her own reservations when
naming Smith at his trial. But she caved in to pressure from family,
friends and police, she says, before later identifying another
African American, Eddie Lee Mosley, as the killer.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't persuade authorities, though, and it was only much
later, after he had died at age 52, that DNA tests cleared Smith and
appeared to confirm Mosley, who is now in a mental institution, as
Shandra's rapist-slayer.</TE>
<TE>   The film's most persuasive indictment, though, targets police and
prosecutors, and its only serious flaw is in finding no motive,
beyond stubbornness, for their inexplicable refusal to bend on
Smith's guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Why Smith? "It was easy," Bikel said on the phone. "He had a
record. He was a nobody. He didn't have a family. Why not Frank
Smith? This is the justice of the black poor." Of course, Mosley also
is black and poor.</TE>
<TE>   What surfaces here beyond legal injustice are implicit arguments
for DNA testing and against capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   In Smith's case, the wrong man was headed for execution, just as
those featured in other Bikel films appear to have been unjustly
convicted and locked away.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the woman whose original accusation sent Smith to
prison is shown visiting his unmarked grave. Chiquita Lowe says she
is saving money to buy him a headstone.</TE>

<TE>   "Requiem for Frank Lee Smith" will be shown Thursday night at 9 on
KCET.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three choreographers obsessed with outsiders made a challenging
program by the Jose Limon Dance Company surprisingly unified on
Friday in the Luckman Theatre at Cal State L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Donald McKayle's 2001 "Cross Roads" depicted a divided society
defined by costume colors. You could think of his opposing cadres in
brown or red as symbolizing racial differences, gang colors or social
classes, but when Kimiye Corwin and Dante Puleio left their in-group
partners for a relationship a la "Romeo and Juliet," they became
outcasts.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Regala played a different kind of outsider: a rootless
drifter with no allegiances or sympathies. His eccentric movement
provided a new force field in contrast to the lovers' increasingly
defensive actions and the Browns' and Reds' oppressive group
statements.</LD>
<TE>   Besides these artful movement contrasts, "Cross Roads" proved
compelling for its use of a James Newton jazz score, played live by
Newton's accomplished seven-member band. Often deceptively jaunty,
the music also had edges and undercurrents, outbursts of drum thunder
and sudden silences that signaled danger for those defying the power
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Taped jazz brought bounce and drive to Billy Siegenfeld's
postmodern 2001 suite, "If Winter," which began with simple walking
steps by dancers in street clothes, expanded to running steps and
gestural motifs and culminated in full-fledged, loose-limbed dancing
much later than you might expect.</TE>
<TE>   Initially glimpsed in brief tableaux, Mary Ford represented rugged
individualism in Siegenfeld's universe--or perhaps symbolized the
birth of spring. While everyone else huddled together in thick coats,
she sensually stretched on the floor in body-hugging dance-wear.
Eventually the group followed her example and liked it well enough to
raise her on high in the happy, engulfing dances that closed the
piece.</TE>
<TE>   If McKayle's and Siegenfeld's outsiders embodied alternatives to a
rigid, useless status quo, the loner in Limon's own 1967 "Psalm" was
carefully protected by the group as an acknowledged savior: one of
the "36 just men" in Jewish tradition, or anyone as indispensable as
Limon himself.</TE>
<TE>   As always with Limon's group pieces, the use of stage space and
blocks of dancers--indeed, the whole sense of dance architecture--was
a stunning achievement. In "Psalm," his mastery transformed actions
as simple as the unfolding of arms and as sophisticated as the waves
of dancers that framed Regala's outbursts.</TE>
<TE>   However, the pain in the role, and Limon's program note about "the
heroic power of the human spirit, triumphant over death itself," also
expressed overwhelming personal issues. He was diagnosed with cancer
in 1967 and soon stopped performing. In "Psalm," he portrayed the
central figure as violently troubled and left unanswered questions
about the agony of exceptional outsiders in our midst--why their
suffering seems to be in proportion to their gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Artistic director Carla Maxwell recently restaged the work,
replacing music by Eugene Lester with a new score by Jon Magnussen--a
score arguably too conventionally religious for Limon's unresolved
statement of embattled faith. No church choir hallelujahs can relieve
the darkness of his vision; we can only accept it as the
unforgettably bleak expression of a great artist who died only five
years later.</TE>

<LD>Horton Foote, 86, knows a thing or two about old age. But he also
understands the frustrations of younger adults whose lives are
dominated by their parents.</LD>
<LD>   Foote--the bard of small-town Texas--takes a clear-eyed look at
this fault line between generations in his funny and finally poignant
"Getting Frankie Married--and Afterwards," in a sterling premiere at
South Coast Repertory.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently the play's theme has been on Foote's mind for a long
time, judging from his last play to receive its professional premiere
in the Southland, "The Day Emily Married," seen in a Lost World
production at Whittier College in 2000. Foote wrote "Emily" four
decades ago, but it also depicted a tug of war between a young adult
and her domineering parents, with her marriage as the focal point.
The characters in "Emily," however, were considerably younger than
the ones in "Frankie."</LD>
<TE>   Frankie is 39, and Fred, her beau since high school, is 43. They
have never married. Frankie's friends profess not to know why. But we
see fairly soon that Fred is in psychological thrall to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Willis, 85, and her only child are virtually inseparable.
When Fred was 7, his father died, and mother and son have depended on
each other since.</TE>
<TE>   As the play opens, Mrs. Willis looks as if she's at death's door.
But she survives to wreak still more havoc on the relationship
between Fred and Frankie. It's not that she opposes their match. She
seems to be happy about it. But she doesn't let it deter her from
continuing to summon Fred to her side at every opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In Martin Benson's staging, Nan Martin's Mrs. Willis is a
galvanizing presence just about every second she's onstage--and often
when she's offstage, calling for her son. Although her body looks as
if it may collapse at any moment, she commands the play almost as
much as she commands her household.</TE>
<TE>   Foote and Martin show us Mrs. Willis at her most tyrannical, but
they also create a character with such a vigorous spirit that it's
easy to see why it would be hard for her son to separate from her.
Even though she tends to repeat herself or to forget key facts--like
her husband's name--the way she handles these gaffes illustrates the
remnants of Southern charm that linger within her.</TE>
<TE>   For Fred, Southern gentility has reinforced the repression of his
own personality. Joel Anderson's performance as the son is extremely,
intentionally uninflected. This man can function in a social setting,
but his emotions are buried so deep that he can't find them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, something is stirring. On a subterranean level, he's
flailing around in an attempt to salvage his adulthood. This leads
not only to a sudden decision to propose to Frankie, but also to
doubts about whether Frankie is the woman he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Frankie is so accustomed to the uneasy fit of being Fred's
common-law wife that she, too, has lost sight of what she wants.
Juliana Donald's Frankie looks so attractive on her wedding day that
it's hard to believe she has stuck with stolid Fred for so many
years. But Frankie's own parents are dead, and she probably sees
stability in Fred's link to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Foote's style is deceptively simple. The characters are
plain-spoken, but a lot goes unsaid. Anderson's Fred, in particular,
is so subdued that when he finally discloses his inner feelings, an
audible gasp can be heard from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Frankie" is shorter than "Emily," a few passages could
be trimmed, especially when Frankie's friends are chattering in the
second act and Mrs. Willis is uncharacteristically silent.</TE>
<TE>   The storytelling gears are occasionally too evident. But the
friends who enter the house are vital in establishing the small-town
culture that eventually brings everyone's affairs into the open.</TE>
<TE>   The use of friends as a Greek chorus also creates two hilarious
performances: Linda Gehringer as a flashy social butterfly and Hal
Landon Jr. as her frail 74-year-old husband, constantly fretting
about his health.</TE>
<TE>   Another important onlooker is Barbara Roberts as Mrs. Willis'
nurse, a religious woman who nevertheless utters a choice morsel of
dry sarcasm.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Devine's living room set, lighted to rosy perfection by
Tom Ruzika, has the conventional look that might reinforce a stifled
feeling among its inhabitants. Ultimately they are indeed stifled,
but it's hard to stop thinking about them, all the way home from the
theater.</TE>

<HD>Gurney's 'Far East' Keeps Its Distance</HD>
<DH>Staged in Laguna, the 1998 work is intellectually
satisfying but suffers from emotional remoteness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD STAYTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In search of adventure after graduating from college in the early
1950s, A.R. Gurney went as far as he could by enlisting in the Navy.
While the young writer was stationed in Japan, his encounters must
have seemed exotic and dramatic.</LD>
<LD>   But by the early 21st century, those experiences don't go far
enough to ignite Gurney's semiautobiographical play "Far East," now
at the Laguna Playhouse. Today the torment of a corporate heir over
an affair with a Japanese waitress feels quaint, like the Hollywood
epics set in Asia during that era--"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,"
"The Bridges at Toko-Ri" and "Sayonara"--some of which are referred
to in Gurney's play.</LD>
<LD>   But if "Far East" doesn't become riveting drama, the production
under Jules Aaron's efficient direction does offer an intelligent
refresher course about Cold War history. Intellectually, if not
emotionally, Gurney's life lessons reward our attention. The prolific
playwright, a master of WASP culture's reticent dialogue, has made
reference to his postwar Japanese experiences in previous works, such
as "The Middle Ages" and even the phenomenally successful "Love
Letters." But not until this 1998 play (receiving its Southern
California stage premiere in Laguna) had Gurney overtly staged the
story.</LD>
<TE>   He was finally at liberty to write "Far East," he has said,
because "after almost 50 years, I managed to work out a
quasi-Japanese way of telling the story." He added Kabuki and bunraku
stagecraft to his signature modern realism. Don Gruber's minimalist
set evokes a Japanese teahouse (beautifully lighted by Paulie
Jenkins).</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the role of a Kabuki narrator, a so-called Reader (Carie
Yonekawa) sits at the edge of the stage, giving voice to a variety of
characters and signaling scene changes by clacking wooden blocks, as
would happen in classic Kabuki. On the other side of the stage, a
percussionist underscores the story by pounding on a taiko drum, as
in bunraku theater. Two occasionally veiled "stagehands" carry props
and serve as minor characters, again as in classic Japanese theater.
Blended with the narrative's realism, these Asian theatrical devices
lend a cinematic, almost seamless style to the production. The story
moves quickly with a minimum of wasted motion. Yet why does it still
feel so slow?</TE>
<TE>   Primarily because Gurney chooses to tell rather than show. "I come
from a pretty sheltered background," confides the playwright's
alter-ego, Lt. Wallace "Sparky" Watts (a by-the-numbers Darren
Bridgett) to Capt. James Anderson (a serviceable Frank Ashmore). "I
feel I could benefit from some significant life experiences in the
world at large."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but "junior officers stationed in the Orient can become
disoriented," or at least such is the belief of Mrs. Julia Anderson
(an inspired Laura Wernette), the captain's frustrated wife, who
provides questionable maternal guidance to fresh recruits. Yet when
rich, spoiled playboy Sparky arrogantly announces that his pursuit of
"experience" means Asian women, she welcomes the challenge of
maintaining Sparky's American purity. After all, Julia knows members
of his family.</TE>
<TE>   For reasons inexplicable in this production, everyone reaches out
to Sparky, whose magnetism as expressed by Bridgett is invisible,
although not so much as Sparky's love affair with a local Japanese
girl, which is only described. (Imagine Romeo without Juliet. He
talks a good game, and yet....) The more Mrs. Anderson interferes
with the graduate, the more he declares his undying love for the
girl. When marriage looms, Mrs. Anderson decides it's her duty to
alert the young man's conservative Midwestern parents.</TE>
<TE>   A well-meaning but distracting subplot concerns a repressed
homosexual ensign (Michael Edwards) who becomes the victim of
blackmailing espionage agents. The sole purpose of this second story
line appears to be the playwright's desire to expose the '50s roots
of the '60s Vietnam debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Arias from "Madame Butterfly" would be expected if this wasn't
Gurney, who dreads melodrama and fears naked emotion and what he has
termed "the sentimental and the personal." This aristocratic reserve
usually serves Gurney admirably, but here the reluctance frustrates
the rich potential of the Kabuki and No rituals. When offered the
opportunity, director Aaron often employs highly theatrical stage
effects, as he did a few years ago in an extraordinary "Equus" in
Hollywood. Despite these No, Kabuki and bunraku elements, the
playwright's emotional detachment undermines the conventions. In last
year's PBS version of "Far East," Gurney successfully adapted his
play for TV and fleshed out the love interest, showing audiences the
actual affair.</TE>
<TE>   But one emotionally confrontational scene demonstrates what might
have been. A drunken Mrs. Anderson enters Sparky's room and seeks
some resolution to the unresolved passion. Wernette prowls like
Tennessee Williams' torrid Maggie the Cat, encircling the lieutenant
in an acting tour de force. Will she go too far? This being Gurney
country, not "Sayonara," no one travels out of mind.</TE>

<HD>Competition of Pianists Ends on a Controversial Note</HD>
<DH>The contest's structure and emphasis on music of
Rachmaninoff ensure an undistinguished outcome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evgeni Mikhailov has a shiny new piano and $30,000 he didn't have
last week. Twenty-nine other pianists who traveled from far and wide
to Pasadena to trudge through some of Rachmaninoff's most popular
music must return home disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   At the Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Saturday night, a couple
thousand people paid as much as $120 a seat to hear a short concert
and sit through a long awards ceremony, dominated by commercial
sponsors and self-congratulating organizers. A star was not born.</LD>
<LD>   I did not attend the proceedings of the Rachmaninoff International
Piano Competition, so I cannot speak about the caliber of all the
pianists who entered. I am also willing to accept the sponsors'
claims that the jurors for this new competition voted their sincere
enthusiasms, however predictable the prizes they ultimately awarded.</LD>
<TE>   This competition is a Russian enterprise, and a Russian, who
tastelessly banged his way through Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a
Theme by Paganini" Saturday, took the top honors. The competition
also had backing from Kawai, the Japanese piano manufacturer; the
Japanese pianist, Mizuka Kano, who won second prize, was bland, if
technically secure, in the two short solo Rachmaninoff pieces she
played. There was no one deemed worthy of third place.</TE>
<TE>   That these results don't appear coincidental need not imply funny
business from the judges. The funny business began long before the
international jury set foot in Pasadena. In fact, the flawed
competition was set up in such a way that such results would almost
be inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   First, the repertory all but precluded an interesting outcome. The
emphasis was on Rachmaninoff's warhorses, not enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the sheer dulling process of hearing, say, 10
sequential performances of Rachmaninoff's massive second piano sonata
(as happened in the second round), which does not make for
bright-eyed judging.</TE>
<TE>   Third, Kawai's pianos may have thrown the competition another
curve. This is not a piano commonly selected by recitalists, and the
bright, metallic-sounding instrument on the stage Saturday would not
likely suit a lyrical player or a colorist. The two prizewinners
were, indeed, most notably deficient in buttery lyricism and subtlety
of touch.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, Mikhailov, who is 29 and has appeared often in Moscow, had
the benefit of familiarity to at least some of the jurors, many of
whom were Russians, and he had previously performed with the
celebrated conductor, pianist and juror Vladimir Ashkenazy in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Muscovite Mikhailov also had the advantage of his
familiarity, and compatibility, with the Moscow Radio Tchaikovsky
Symphony Orchestra, which accompanied him in the Rhapsody on Saturday
(and all the finalists in their Rachmaninoff concertos during the
competition). Under the guest conductor, Nikolai Alexeev, it proved a
curiously feral ensemble, full of individually expressive players who
seemed to like nothing better than to pounce on each phrase and snag
it. There was certainly something enjoyable about hearing these blunt
musicians in love with vibrato (and not particularly attached to
intonation) in Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, which opened the
concert portion of the program. With encouragement from Alexeev, some
really odd, and sometimes gripping, sounds poured forth.</TE>
<TE>   This proved an advantage for Mikhailov. In the Rhapsody, the
pianist rarely looked up from the keyboard that he was busily
smashing; the conductor seldom lifted his head from the score. Yet
they hardly needed eye contact, locked in, as they were, to the same
unspontaneous wavelength.</TE>
<TE>   What made me most uneasy Saturday, however, was not a vulgar
pianist collaborating with a crude orchestra to produce studied
excitement. After all, the Rachmaninoff prize is not likely to mean
much, one way or another. (It assures no gigs other than a single
appearance in Mexico City, and a recording on Pipeline Music, a
sponsor of the competition that distributes its CDs by mail order.)
Rather it was hard to respect any public presentation that
demonstrated such disregard for the audience and performers alike.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to capture every aspect of this occasion for posterity,
Pipeline allowed a callous film crew to shine intense, bright light
directly into the audience's eyes whenever there was occasion for
applause. By the time that the awards were presented and the
performances given, our Pavlovian responses were well trained. There
could be no question of sustained clapping for the winner, merely an
anticlimactic quick getaway for most of the crowd and a general sense
of irritability. There were no encores.</TE>
<TE>   It is also necessary to mention that the city of Pasadena and the
state of California were partners in this misguided exercise in
Russian chauvinism. California's first lady, Sharon Davis, spoke
during the ceremony, reminding us that music is a universal language.
She did not, though, credit Californians--from Henry Cowell to the
Kronos Quartet--with their leading role in making that so. Too
readily we cede our place to Rachmaninoff, who hardly needs the help.</TE>
<TE>   For all its pomp, the Rachmaninoff International Piano Competition
was a hunt for the kind of pianists who are a dime a dozen. And
drawing a blank for third place, it didn't even do a good job at
that.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tonight at 8, from the fabulous Stardust Lanes in Minneapolis, Comedy
Central rolls out the second season of its wackily tacky game show,
"Let's Bowl."</LD>
<LD>   You don't have to be a fan of the sport to enjoy the goings-on,
and in fact, it's probably best if you're not. The bowling culture,
as well as life in American's Polka Belt, is given a frequently bawdy
bashing by series creator and writer Tim Scott and his partner Mike
Nelson. The result is a series that's more satirical sendup than game
show, and the formula works more often than not.</LD>
<LD>   The format is simple: Two bowlers go head-to-head to decide a
personal issue. In tonight's show, a husband and wife are at odds
over a vasectomy. If she wins the match, she takes him to the doctor.
If not, he emerges unscathed. With co-hosts Wally Hotvedt (creative
consultant Rich Kronfeld) and Steve "Chopper" Sedahl (Steve Sedahl)
presiding over the action, you could cut the tension with a knife.</LD>
<TE>   "I usually try to stay impartial, but I'm rooting for you,
brother," Hotvedt tells the husband. "Every normal man is." Bonus
prizes include an ice-fishing package, a snow blower and membership
to a herring-of-the-month club.</TE>
<TE>   The bowling coverage comes complete with slo-mo replays and
cutaways to the scorecard. There are some special rules to keep in
mind, however. Tonight, the person with the poorer vision gets to go
first. Next week, it's the individual who has caused more car
accidents. And, once each game, a contestant can crash cymbals behind
an opponent's head as the ball is released.</TE>
<TE>   Amusing interviews, musical numbers and wicked "Inside Bowling"
segments round out the package. And although "Let's Bowl" doesn't
always roll a strike, it's got attitude to spare.</TE>

<LD>Tap dance--like mom, apple pie and baseball--is strictly a home-grown
American tradition. It made perfect sense, then, to kick off Dance
2K2, a celebration of National Dance Month, with this decidedly
Yankee art form at the Los Angeles Theatre Center on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The first in a series of eclectic dance performances, tap proved
to be very much alive and well as a number of artists vamped, jumped
and jived.</LD>
<LD>   Delivering the goods with its usual panache, Jazz Tap Ensemble
presented the Caravan Project, a group of hoofers, ages 12 to 19.
Founded by Jazz Tap Ensemble artistic director Lynn Dally in 1991,
and now under the ace leadership of Becky Twitchell, these dozen
dancers represent the future of tap.</LD>
<TE>   Notable for their virtuosity at the young ages of 14 and 15 were
Melinda Sullivan and Joseph Wiggan, respectively. In "Twitchell
Tacit," choreographed by the group's leader, the duo shuffled, beamed
and let rip a tidal wave of riveting steps a cappella, while their
improvised solos offered a glimpse of solid, polyrhythmic stepping.</TE>
<TE>   The affable Channing Cook Holmes, a Jazz Tap Ensemble member known
for quicksilver footwork, brought his group, Tappin' (featuring
fellow ensemble member John Kloss, Jason Rodgers, Jason Samuels and
Chance Taylor).</TE>
<TE>   They roared through 10 numbers like bulls on the streets of
Pamplona. Particularly mind-blowing: improvised solos by Rodgers and
Samuels, whose feet seemed atomic, executing percussive blows that
resonated with jackhammer force. Taylor, too, dove in with such
abandon, his glasses flew off his head in "Twice the Tap," a number
he choreographed and danced with Rodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of tap were on fine display as suit-clad veterans
Chester Whitmore and Skip Cunningham moved with ease and grace.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham dispensed a bit of the old body-slapping hambone;
Whitmore got down with bare feet and bottle caps, tapping up an
old-fashioned storm before shuffling over freshly poured grains of
sand.</TE>
<TE>   Dance 2K2 continues with various performers Saturday and April 19
and 20 at 8 p.m.; April 21 at 3 p.m. at Los Angeles Theatre Center,
514 S. Spring St., L.A., (213) 485-1681. $10.</TE>

<HD>Babbitt Played With Cohesive Charm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton Babbitt is one of those perennially misunderstood artistic
figures, often deemed synonymous with all that is cerebral and
unforgiving in 20th century concert music.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, his music can be at once serious, colorful and engaging,
like an intellectual argument that keeps weaving in and out of a
casual conversation.</LD>
<LD>   That was the impression, anyway, when Southwest Chamber Music
conscientiously--and movingly--performed his 1986 work, "Groupwise
for Solo Flute, Violin, Viola, Cello and Piano," at the Norton Simon
Museum Theater on Saturday. The performance honored Babbitt's 85th
birthday.</LD>
<TE>   "Groupwise" is no picnic, for either players or listeners, given
its determinedly atonal and arrhythmic designs. Still, once attuned
to Babbitt's language, cool charms emerge.</TE>
<TE>   As the title implies, group think is a central idea, with small,
intense pieces assembled into a musical mosaic in which the parts
rule. Here, flutist Dorothy Stone and violinist Mark Menzies would
gleam fleetingly, but no heroic soloist, or discernible theme, wins
out in the hypnotic, objective note flow.</TE>
<TE>   Few composers have quite managed Babbitt's balancing act, creating
music both ascetic and vibrant. And in this case it made musical
allies with the opener, Mozart's wondrous arrangement of Bach's
music, the Preludes and Fugues for String Trio, K. 404a.</TE>
<TE>   These transcriptions, mostly from "Well-Tempered Clavier" and "The
Art of the Fugue," logically expand the music for violin, viola, and
cello, accentuating the original music's beautiful math and
contrapuntal energy.</TE>
<TE>   There was less apparent simpatico between Babbitt's lucid chill
and the Romantic contours of Brahms' Trio in B for Violin, Cello and
Piano, Opus 8. Though played well enough by Menzies, pianist Gayle
Blankenburg and cellist Paula Fehrenbach, it sounded overheated and
irrelevant in the context of the program.</TE>

<HD>Bond Funds Face Challenges, but May Still Eke Out a
Positive Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two strong years, bond mutual funds lost some of their luster
in the first quarter as market interest rates rose in anticipation of
an economic rebound and the Federal Reserve moved one step closer to
reversing its easy-credit policies.</LD>
<LD>   Investors in funds that own longer-term Treasury securities mostly
saw their funds lose value in the quarter, though the losses were
small.</LD>
<LD>   Funds that own corporate bonds generally fared better, and that
could be the story all year: Many experts believe 2002 could prove
profitable for holders of corporate debt, including high-yield junk
bonds, which are those considered less than investment grade.</LD>
<TE>   And even if interest rates continue to rise, depressing older
bonds' values, Treasury and tax-free municipal issues should remain a
portfolio cornerstone for many conservative investors, financial
advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that the recession is over, bond proponents
argue that the economic recovery is likely to be muted, with
businesses growing slowly as they focus on repaying debt and cutting
costs. That could mean that interest rates would rise slowly and that
many companies' finances would improve, decreasing default rates on
corporate bonds and boosting the appeal of those issues.</TE>
<TE>   If that scenario plays out, "I actually think this could be the
third consecutive year where bonds outperform stocks," said Mark
Kiesel, senior investment strategist at Newport Beach-based bond fund
manager Pimco.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, though, many bond funds are struggling. After 11
Fed cuts in short-term interest rates in 2001, longer-term rates
began rising late last year and continued rising during the first
quarter as evidence of an economic rebound began to pile up.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for example,
rose from 5.05% on Dec. 31 to 5.39% by the end of March. The yield
has since slipped back to 5.21% as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   When market rates rise, the value of older, lower-yielding bonds
drops. In the first quarter, the declines in bond mutual fund share
prices almost exactly offset interest earnings in the period on the
typical government and corporate fund, according to fund tracker
Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Some cheering was heard from investors bold enough to own funds
that invest in emerging-markets debt. Those funds scored an average
return of 6.7% in the quarter, as emerging-market stocks, such as in
Mexico, also rallied.</TE>
<TE>   But the average corporate bond fund posted a total
return--interest earnings plus or minus any change in principal
value--of just 0.2% in the quarter, Morningstar said. The average
government bond fund finished with a zero return.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, as interest rates fell in 2000 and 2001, investors in
government bond funds enjoyed average total returns of 10.4% and
6.7%, respectively, as declining rates boosted the value of older
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' strong performance prompted heavy flows of cash into bond
mutual funds last year. The inflows continued early this year, with
nearly $30 billion in net new cash flowing into bond funds in January
and February, according to the Investment Company Institute, the
funds' main trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Even as bond fund returns sputter this year, some experts said
there's no reason for investors to flee bonds if their goals are the
classic ones of gaining a reliable stream of income or diversifying a
stock portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as interest rates rise, buying new bonds can become more
appealing: The 10-year Treasury note's yield now is about 4
percentage points above the current inflation rate. If inflation
stays tame, the Treasury note's yield is providing a historically
high "real" (after inflation) return.</TE>
<TE>   Using bonds to help anchor volatile stock portfolios remains a
nearly universal practice among financial planners, even among those
like Laura Tarbox of Newport Beach, who believes now "is probably the
worst time to invest in bonds in our lifetimes" because higher
interest rates are so likely.</TE>
<TE>   "However, one never knows for sure, and we believe in
diversification," she said. Tarbox keeps portfolios of even
growth-oriented clients at least 16% in cash and fixed-income
securities. For Tarbox these days, that means mostly mortgage-backed
securities and corporate bonds with shorter maturities because they
lose less value than longer-term bonds when interest rates rise.</TE>
<TE>   Even in bad years for bonds, as when the Fed doubled short-term
interest rates in 1994, the damage to bond funds is generally modest
compared with what can happen to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The average share-price decline of long-term government bond funds
was 10.4% in 1994. But that was partly offset by interest earnings
that year, so the total return on the funds was a negative 4.6%,
according to Lipper Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In the stock market, a bad year can mean losses of 20% or more.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've lived through the stock market the last couple of
years, you'll never have any damage like that" in bonds, said Ross
Gerber, chief operating officer of Independent Capital Management in
Woodland Hills. "With bonds, it's a much safer place to play."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at last quarter's performance of key bond market
sectors and the current outlook.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Treasuries</TE>
<TE>   When the yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note jumped from 4.8% to
5.4% in just two weeks last month, it was a harsh reminder of how
fast the outlook can change for bondholders in a rebounding economy.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in market yields left the average long-term government
bond fund with a negative total return of 0.6% for the quarter,
according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Intermediate-term government bond funds, less sensitive to rising
interest rates, eked out a 0.1% positive return in the quarter, while
short-term government funds returned 0.2% on average.</TE>
<TE>   Should a strong economic recovery continue, and if inflationary
trends such as the recent spike in oil prices persist, yields on new
Treasuries could rise still higher, devaluing older bonds and sending
bond fund share prices tumbling again, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Government bond funds were the best place to be last year, but I
think you can potentially lose a lot of money on them this year"
relative to other types of bonds, said Gerber. He has been advising
clients to jump from Treasuries to corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But believers in a slow economic recovery say that, for guaranteed
income that outpaces inflation, Treasuries remain a good choice.</TE>
<TE>   At Western Asset Management in Pasadena, chief economist Scott
Grannis said the markets already are assuming that the Fed "is going
on the warpath" and will push its key short-term rate from 1.75% now
to 3.5% by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an awful lot of tightening in a zero-inflation world,"
said Grannis, who thinks a year-end Fed rate of 2.5% is more
realistic. If he's right, longer-term yields may not rise
significantly this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corporate Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Total returns on investment-grade corporate bond funds were
uninspiring in the first quarter--intermediate-term funds were down
0.3% and long-term funds lost 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Junk-bond funds, after posting an average total return of 5.5% in
the fourth quarter, were up 0.9% in the first quarter, which means
their high interest earnings were mostly offset by declining
principal values.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate bond investors have had plenty of worries: the
recession, terrorist attacks, record public-company bankruptcies and
fears of Enron Corp.-style hidden debts. But considering the
improving economy, aggressive corporate cost-cutting and their
current yields, corporate bonds are a great choice, said portfolio
manager Stephen Kane of Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The average 12-month yield on intermediate-term investment-grade
bond funds is about 5.4%, compared with about 4.9% on
intermediate-term government bond funds, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is pricing in an excessively pessimistic outlook for
corporate profitability and insolvency," Kane said. "We think within
a year's time, some of these fears will have abated due to the
stronger economy and better balance sheets." He recommends focusing
on intermediate-term or shorter-term corporate bonds, however, to
help limit losses if interest rates accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that junk bonds could be poised for a great
year. That was the case in 1991, when the economy was recovering from
the 1990 recession. The average junk bond fund posted a total return
of 37.1% in 1991 as market rates fell and waning worries about
defaults pushed junk bond values sharply higher.</TE>
<TE>   But the risks of owning junk bonds remain high. If the economic
recovery slows, corporate bankruptcies and junk bond defaults could
rise again.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some analysts, Pimco's Kiesel is staying away from junk
bonds. He prefers BBB-rated corporate bonds--the lowest level of
investment grade--arguing that the sector has been overlooked by
cautious investors and speculators who've been focusing on junk.</TE>
<TE>   Another alternative for investors looking for higher yields, he
said, is mortgage-backed bonds, which will run much less danger of
early repayment as modestly rising interest rates rein in last year's
refinancing spree.</TE>
<TE>   Many major mutual fund companies offer funds that invest in
Government National Mortgage Assn. (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) bonds.
Morningstar's top-rated GNMA funds are listed in government-bond
categories on page U10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Municipal Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who can afford California's high housing costs, contribute
to tax-sheltered retirement plans and still have money to invest
probably is in a high enough tax bracket to consider tax-exempt bonds
issued by state and local governments and agencies. And so-called
munis are always a favorite of retirees and others looking for safe
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with other bond categories, municipal bond funds held up
relatively well in the first quarter, according to Morningstar. Funds
that invest in long-term California municipal bonds broke even, on
average, but returns on other municipal fund categories ranged from
0.3% to 0.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, investors were complaining of a shortage of muni
bonds, but there's an abundance these days.</TE>
<TE>   "California is on the verge of a bond explosion unlike any we can
remember," wrote Zane B. Mann in his latest California Municipal Bond
Advisor newsletter, which is published in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing is accelerating for public-works projects, for example.
California also is planning a mammoth bond offering to cover the
costs of last year's electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Greater issuance of bonds will give investors more choices. Many
municipal bond investors prefer to own individual securities rather
than funds, because individual bonds guarantee a set interest rate
and full return of principal at maturity.</TE>
<TE>   But Gerber contends that individual investors don't have access to
the best municipal bonds, so he still recommends buying funds. What's
more, investors have to be careful when buying bonds of smaller
municipalities. Though municipal bond defaults are rare, when they do
happen it usually involves small issues.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, bonds issued directly by California (so-called
general obligation bonds) have paid a quarter-point or so less in
interest than those of other states because of strong demand for
California issues. But stresses from last year's power crisis and
economic slowdown, along with an increasing debt load, have lifted
California municipal yields more in line with other states'.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, California still is in good position to support its debt
load, Mann said, based on the criteria used by bond-rating firms,
such as debt load per capita. And at current yields, nvestors in
higher tax brackets can earn attractive returns on municipal issues
relative to U.S. government bonds or corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a recently issued California bond maturing in nine
years was priced to yield 4.52% a year, Mann said. That yield, exempt
from both federal and California income tax, is the equivalent of an
8.21% taxable bond yield for someone with a combined federal and
state tax rate of 45%.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit to Target the Banks, Law Firms of Enron</HD>
<DH>Courts: Filing expected today will allege Wall Street
companies designed sham transactions that let the energy trader mask
worsening finances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment banks and law firms that helped Enron Corp. create the
off-the-books partnerships that lie at the heart of the company's
collapse will be targeted in a sweeping new legal action to be filed
today by aggrieved Enron shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The court papers--which will name nine investment banks, two law
firms and several individuals--portray the Wall Street firms as
deeply involved in an effort to disguise the company's deteriorating
financial condition from shareholders, rating agencies and other
outsiders.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations will come in the form of a consolidated complaint
scheduled to be filed in federal court in Houston by the University
of California Board of Regents, the lead plaintiff in the previously
filed class-action case that had named only Enron executives and
accounting firm Andersen. The plaintiffs claim to have lost more than
$25 billion when Enron's stock price shriveled from its August 2000
peak of almost $91 to its current 33 cents.</LD>
<TE>   The shareholders claim the Wall Street firms intentionally
designed a series of sham transactions that let Enron mask its
worsening finances by moving millions of dollars of debt off its
balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The dealings made the company seem to be profitable and hid the
severe financial risks it was taking. The lawsuit also alleges that
top Wall Street executives profited personally from some of the
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are certain to open a new chapter in the Enron saga.
Wall Street's potential involvement in Enron's downfall has been the
subject of intensive study by congressional regulators, Enron
creditors and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street firms have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Several investment banks have said they were victims of Enron, and
they are among the largest creditors to have sued Enron in federal
Bankruptcy Court, claiming they are owed billions of dollars in
unpaid loans.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Andersen has received the most criticism for its role
in auditing Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   But with Andersen's own financial troubles--and its shrinking
ability to pay reparations to victims--becoming increasingly
apparent, shareholders and others are now homing in on investment
banks and other deep-pocketed targets, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   William Lerach, the lead attorney representing the University of
California, said the banks committed egregious wrongdoing and should
be held responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "If the banks happen to have a lot of money, well so be it,"
Lerach said in an interview on Sunday. "The banks made a lot money in
their dealings with Enron. And if they went over the line under our
legal system they're responsible and they should pay to the investors
who were hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the allegations in the new complaint have been made public
previously, such as in an internal Enron report released in February
or in other lawsuits filed against the investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   But the suit also appears to disclose new details about Wall
Street's role in the partnerships. For example, the amended complaint
alleges a total of $1.2 billion in insider trading by 28 Enron
directors and officers, about $171million more than previously made
public.</TE>
<TE>   The document also appears to have new details about some of the
most controversial off-the-books partnerships, known as LJM-2 and
Mahonia.</TE>
<TE>   According to a media release issued Sunday by the UC, the
investment banks "helped to set up clandestinely controlled Enron
partnerships, used offshore companies to disguise loans and
facilitated the phony sale of overvalued Enron assets."</TE>
<TE>   Even as the Wall Street firms were helping to shield Enron's
worsening financial condition, stock analysts at the firms were
publicly extolling Enron's prospects to investors, the complaint will
allege.</TE>
<TE>   The law firms "issued false legal opinions, helped structure
non-arm's-length transactions and helped prepare false submissions"
to federal securities regulators.</TE>
<TE>   However, it could be difficult for investors to prove that Wall
Street firms engaged in wrongdoing, legal observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court decision, plaintiffs must prove
that investment banks either "recklessly" or "intentionally" misled
investors, said David Skeel, a corporate law professor at the
University of Pennsylvania. Before 1994, plaintiffs only had to
satisfy a lower legal standard that the banks had aided and abetted a
client's wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody looks bad here, so there's probably some settlement
value to naming the banks," Skeel said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if it went to court, of the professionals, the banks are the
least likely to be found liable, unless there's some smoking gun"
that has yet to be discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Other legal experts agreed.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one could argue that the law firms that set up the
Enron partnerships that hid losses, and the firms that conducted
internal reviews for Enron's board of directors but failed to
highlight problems at the company, are culpable in the meltdown of
the energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Houston securities litigator Thomas Ajamie, that
is a difficult claim for shareholders to enforce. That's because law
firms had contracts with Enron, not its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "The law doesn't look as favorably on parties that are once
removed from the contract," Ajamie explained.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the financial institutions and the investment banks
that Lerach's firm is naming in the consolidated lawsuit, it will be
difficult to proved that they "aided and abetted" fraud at Enron,
Ajamie said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the charges are serious and "I know that this is
something the banks are very concerned about," Ajamie said. "They
know that this is more than a fishing expedition for whoever has deep
pockets."</TE>
<TE>   The case may turn on how much inside information the banks and
investment bankers had and whether that could be used to prove that
they should have known that they were involved in "sham
transactions," Ajamie said.</TE>
<TE>   The banks listed in the 485-page complaint are J.P. Morgan Chase,
Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Deutsche
Bank and Lehman Bros. The law firms are Vinson &amp; Elkins and Kirkland
&amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. and Salomon Smith Barney, which is owned by
Citigroup, declined comment on Sunday. J.P. Morgan Chase spokesman
Kristin Lemkau said only that "the Mahonia transaction was on our
balance sheet and was intended to be on Enron's balance sheet." She
declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, CIBC, Merrill Lynch,
Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins and
Kirland &amp; Ellis could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston named the University
of California system the lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit
against Enron's senior management and the Andersen accounting firm in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's stock collapse cost the university system $145 million in
pension and endowment funds it had invested in the company.</TE>
<TE>   The university joined the lawsuit in December, claiming that it
was duped by a "massive insider trading" scheme in which the company
and Andersen issued false financial statements and made "false and
misleading statements about the company's purportedly record results
and strong operating performance."</TE>
<TE>   The university at one point owned 2.2 million Enron shares.
CalPERS, the state's public employees' retirement system pension
fund, said it has lost $45 million in Enron shares. The California
State Teachers Retirement System lost about $40 million.</TE>

<HD>Agent Group Plans to Promote Travel to Cuba</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Members will be trained to sell the island as a
vacation destination despite a U.S. ban on tourism there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>The biggest travel agents' organization in the United States said
Saturday that it would train members to promote Cuba as a vacation
destination, despite Washington's ban on tourism to the Caribbean
island.</LD>
<LD>   "We are developing a destination specialist course to train and
educate U.S. travel agents to sell Cuba," Richard Copland, president
of the American Society of Travel Agents, said at a Havana news
conference.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe it is a constitutional right of Americans to have
freedom to travel anywhere in the world.... Travel promotes peace and
understanding among peoples," Copland said.</LD>
<TE>   The association has 26,000 members, 18,000 based in the United
States. Copland and four other association executives who arrived
last week toured resorts, including Varadero and virgin keys now
being developed, and met with Cuban President Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Copland said his organization was part of the growing U.S.
business lobby supporting efforts in Congress to end the
four-decade-old trade embargo against the island's communist
government, including travel restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba built up its tourism industry after the collapse of its
former benefactor the Soviet Union a decade ago. The Tourism Ministry
reported 1.8 million visitors in 2001, most from Europe and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are increasingly ignoring the travel ban, under which
they can be fined and imprisoned for spending money in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Treasury Department reported more than 150,000 U.S.
citizens visited Cuba last year, of which only two-thirds were
approved by Washington under provisions for athletic, academic and
cultural exchanges, as well as limited commercial activities and some
other categories.</TE>

<HD>Giving Disabled a Voice</HD>
<DH>Small firms make most of the devices that enable people to
speak and use a computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Physicist Stephen Hawking owes his voice to Words-Plus, a Lancaster
company that makes communication devices for the disabled. Lou
Gehrig's disease long ago robbed him of speech, but the use of a
highly sensitive pressure switch hooked into a specially designed
word processor has allowed Hawking not only to write his best-selling
"A Brief History of Time" but also to send e-mail, lecture and hold
conversations often spiced with his sarcastic humor.</LD>
<LD>   Words-Plus devices have had a similarly liberating effect for
thousands of people worldwide, making the company one of the big-time
players in the field of technology for the disabled.</LD>
<LD>   But Words-Plus has fewer than 30 employees and last year had
annual revenue of just $2.9 million--or about 4% of Microsoft Corp.'s
average daily revenue in its 2000-2001 fiscal year.</LD>
<TE>   Although the 33 million severely disabled people in the United
States make up more than 12% of the population, the firms that enable
the blind to surf the Web and quadriplegics to use a computer mouse
are primarily small operations with few employees.</TE>
<TE>   Words-Plus is among the few publicly traded companies, part of
Simulations Plus Inc., which also produces pharmaceutical software.</TE>
<TE>   "To put it frankly, there are not enough disabled people to make
it worthwhile for the big companies to get involved," said Larry
Israel, executive director of the Assistive Technology Industry Assn.
"It's just not a big enough market."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent trade show of high-tech companies serving the
disabled, there were so many exhibitors that the ballrooms of two
hotels had to be used, with a shuttle bus running between them. But
with rare exception they were small, even mom-and-pop companies. Some
of the big names in electronics donated funds and equipment to the
show, organized by Cal State Northridge's Center on Disabilities, but
few had products on display.</TE>
<TE>   The severely disabled are a highly segmented group, making them a
difficult target for a firm interested in mass markets. A company
that makes products for the partially blind is not likely to also
manufacture devices for the deaf or those in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The total industry just in augmentative communications, which is
what we do, is only on the order of $50 million a year," said
Words-Plus founder and Chief Executive Walter Woltosz. "If it was one
company doing $50million, that would still be a tiny industry in the
eyes of Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   And the industry is service intensive. "Almost nothing except for
a little part is sold over the phone or through mail order," said Ron
Creeley, marketing vice president at Words-Plus.</TE>
<TE>   The company and its competitors sell units that are highly
customized through meetings with clients and speech pathologists.</TE>
<TE>   A Words-Plus setup, including a rugged laptop computer, can cost
as much as $11,000. The relationship with the client does not end
there.</TE>
<TE>   "The support requirements are tremendous," Woltosz said. "If
someone has a problem, it will probably be the caregiver who calls,
and that person might not be all that familiar with computers. A call
can take a long, long time.</TE>
<TE>   "There are customers we have lost money on because of all the
support time. It's another reason the big companies don't want to
deal with this. They leave it to the boutique companies."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the products most prized by the disabled were not even
made with them in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Dragon NaturallySpeaking is a voice-recognition program that works
with impressive accuracy. "People who are not able to type love this
program," said Jorge Sanchez, who does training at the
Westchester-based nonprofit Computer Access Center, which matches
disabled people with appropriate technology.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was meant for doctors and lawyers who wanted to dictate
without a secretary."</TE>
<TE>   ScanSoft Inc., which makes the program, doesn't mention uses by
the disabled on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms that make products expressly for the disabled got into
the field by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Origin Instruments Co. was founded in the late 1980s in a Houston
suburb by two former aerospace engineers--Melvin Dashner and Steve
Bain--who wanted to market an infrared tracking device.</TE>
<TE>   "My partner was fooling around with the device to try and figure
out how to show its abilities," Dashner said, "and he made a computer
mouse that could be controlled with his head."</TE>
<TE>   It consisted of an infrared unit, atop a computer monitor, that
bounced an invisible beam off a reflective strip Bain stuck to his
forehead.</TE>
<TE>   This "head mouse" was a novelty until Dashner heard a local radio
program about a group that provides computers for the disabled. He
showed them the mouse and an industry was born. Dashner would not
disclose the income of the private company, but he said the head
mouse accounts for about half of it.</TE>
<TE>   John Duganne III, who has cerebral palsy, uses the device daily.
With a reflective dot affixed to the end of his nose, Duganne can
pick out letters from an on-screen keyboard and draw graphics.</TE>
<TE>   Duganne, 31, has a degree in animation from CalArts. The tracking
device "got me through school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it did not get him a job--Duganne has not been able to find
work in his field. It's a situation that is not unusual, said Woltosz
of Words-Plus. Even the Americans With Disabilities Act--ratified in
1990 to make workplaces and public areas accessible to the
disabled--was not a help to many of the severely disabled looking for
employment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good for people with acquired disabilities," said Woltosz,
referring to those who already had jobs when they became disabled.</TE>
<TE>   He said his company has outfitted devices for people in that
situation at several companies and institutions--including Intel,
Shell and NASA--to help them get back to work.</TE>
<TE>   But it will take much more than technology to get those disabled
at birth or a young age into appropriate jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have all the devices, but if someone who is severely
disabled goes into a job interview with a resume on the back of a
wheelchair," said Woltosz, "it's very tough."</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Continue to Rise Amid Oil Worries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices, which have risen steadily since February, jumped
more than 8 cents per gallon in the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's weighted price per gallon for all grades and taxes was
$1.46, up 8.44 cents from March 22, according to the Lundberg survey
of 8,000 gas stations nationwide. Since Feb. 8, prices at the pump
have risen 32 cents.</LD>
<LD>   "Continued crude oil price strength accounts for more than half of
that price increase," analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Nervousness among oil traders about the worsening crisis in the
Middle East also could play a role in the higher prices, she said.
Other factors pushing prices up include a seasonal increase in demand
and an improving economy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite two months of increases, gasoline prices are lower than
they were at the same time last year, when gas cost $1.54 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's average price was 10cents lower than pump prices on Sept.
7, just before the terrorist attacks Sept. 11. Prices dropped to a
low of about $1.12 in December.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.43 per gallon for regular,
$1.53 for mid-grade and $1.62 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Hotels Unite in Battle for Online Reservations</HD>
<DH>Lodging: Effort to keep brand recognition and boost sales
leads five major chains to team up to compete against Hotel
Reservations Network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD FOSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Ever since she coordinated her Italian honeymoon using a computer and
a credit card, Karen McDermott has been hooked on planning trips over
the Internet. She's hardly alone, since millions of Americans
regularly buy plane tickets online.</LD>
<LD>   What puts the 35-year-old New Yorker on the cutting edge is that
she regularly books hotel rooms online, where only 4% of reservations
are made.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking for a good deal and the convenience," said McDermott,
a research librarian who has used Travelocity.com to reserve rooms in
San Francisco, Cincinnati and Washington in the last year.</LD>
<TE>   Though online spending for hotels remains small compared with
purchases of airline tickets, the marketplace is growing fast, with
annual sales expected to reach $7.7billion by 2006, or double the
forecast for 2002. Yet many of the nation's leading hotel chains have
little to celebrate, because consolidators and Internet travel
companies control as much as 95% of these sales.</TE>
<TE>   The largest consolidator, Hotel Reservations Network Inc., buys
rooms in bulk from hotel franchisees at extremely low prices and
resells them through thousands of affiliated Web sites and on its own
retail site, at www.hotels.com. It's a great deal for bargain-hunting
travelers as well as for Dallas-based HRN, which is able to mark up
nightly rates by 28% on average, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   HRN's stock price has more than tripled since its first day of
trading in February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After HRN, which had $536 million in revenue and a net profit of
$13 million last year, the next-biggest discount seller of hotel
rooms is Expedia Inc. of Bellevue, Wash. Both companies are
majority-owned by USA Networks Inc. of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that hotel firms are losing on several fronts: Their
ability to set prices is weakening, franchisees' profit margins are
under pressure and well-known brands could become watered down.</TE>
<TE>   "You want consumers to view Marriott differently than, say,
Hyatt," said Jake Fuller, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in New
York. "These companies have spent billions to build their brands."</TE>
<TE>   Ready to defend themselves and to try to recapture lost revenues,
five major hotel companies will begin a joint online-distribution
venture in late spring or early summer called Hotel Distribution
Network. Based in Dallas, its main goal is to undo the primacy of
rival HRN, which is responsible for about nine out of 10 hotel rooms
sold over the Internet, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The distribution network's founders are Hilton Hotels Corp., Hyatt
Corp., Marriott International Inc., Six Continents Hotels Inc.,
Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. and Pegasus Solutions Inc.,
an electronic reservation company.</TE>
<TE>   The network's interim chief executive, Joe Humphry, said the
company will offer a "better value proposition" to its owners'
franchisees and other individual hotel owners that currently sell
excess inventory cheaply to consolidators and travel Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become a very profitable business," said Humphry, whose
company has spent two years planning a strategy while consolidators
and Internet travel sites reaped profits from this sector.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the owners of the hotels feel it has been at their
expense. In the future, they need to sell at rates that are more
economical for them," Humphry said.</TE>
<TE>   Practically speaking, that means the distribution network will try
to woo franchisees away from consolidators by offering them a better
price per room and promising to reduce the time and expense it takes
to process online reservations.</TE>
<TE>   The venture might sound like the hotel industry's version of
Orbitz, the online distributor started last year by five major
airlines, but it is fundamentally different, said Henry Harteveldt,
Forrester Research's Internet travel analyst.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the distribution network was not established as an
alternative to the computerized booking systems used by travel agents
and their online counterparts. By using Pegasus' technology, the
network ensures that its rates are available through every
distribution channel. And the network will be solely for hotel rooms,
whereas Orbitz offers much more than airline tickets; in fact, Orbitz
will be the first major retailer to sell the network's inventory.</TE>
<TE>   By next year, the distribution network will sell directly to
consumers over its own Internet site, at www.travelweb.com.</TE>
<TE>   "It will challenge dominant online hotel sellers and can carve out
a meaty role for itself in the long run," Harteveldt said, "but it
won't win the top prize because the industry is too fragmented."</TE>
<TE>   HRN President Bob Diener agreed there's plenty of business to go
around. So though the firm he co-founded is under attack, Diener said
he does not feel threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see any impact on our growth potential," Diener said.</TE>
<TE>   But Diener obviously is looking over his shoulder. One month after
Hotel Distribution Network said it would not charge cancellation fees
to consumers, HRN said its fee would drop to $10 from $50.</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly the kind of effect hotel executives hoped the new
joint venture would have.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there's room for new competition in this area," said
Bruce Wolff, Marriott's senior vice president of distribution and
sales and a member of the distribution network's board.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott is ahead of the rest of the industry in that 6% of its
sales occur online and three-quarters of those transactions take
place on its Web site. But even as the world's biggest lodging
company embraces this low-cost distribution channel, Marriott and its
competitors are locking arms for another reason--Hotel Distribution
Network will boost its participants' revenues by marketing their full
range of nightly rates--not just the lowest-priced inventory, as HRN
does.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with HRN's model, Wolff said, is that it sends the
message that the best hotel deals are available only online--a boon
to Web surfers, perhaps, but a potential sore spot with the 95% of
consumers who still reserve hotel rooms in more traditional ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who don't buy online really aren't that happy," he said.</TE>

<HD>Judge in HP Merger Seen as Evenhanded</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: William Chandler III of Delaware Chancery Court
has ruled in cases involving WorldCom and Hyatt Hotels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL MILFORD</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>The fate of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s $19-billion buyout of rival Compaq
Computer Corp. lies in the hands of a judge who's known for his
evenhanded approach to disputes between shareholders and corporate
officers.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor William B. Chandler III is the senior judge on the
Delaware Chancery Court, which decides lawsuits involving thousands
of Delaware-incorporated companies, including half of the Fortune
500. On Sunday in Wilmington, he heard Hewlett-Packard's request to
dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Compaq acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   "He's highly respected. I think he strikes a very good balance
between management prerogative and shareholder prerogative," said
Charles Elson, a law professor at Stetson College in St. Petersburg,
Fla., and director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware.</LD>
<TE>   Chandler has experience with high-profile disputes over corporate
transactions, having decided cases involving WorldCom Inc. and Hilton
Hotels Corp. A major focus of his 210-year-old court, which traces
its history to England's High Court of Chancery, is deciding the
fairness of acquisitions in which stockholders seek more money for
their shares.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best and most respected business court in the country,"
Elson said.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler and the court's four vice chancellors also rule on
derivative complaints, in which shareholders sue directors on behalf
of the company, alleging mismanagement. There also are more routine
cases such as trusts and property line disputes.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent highly publicized case, a chancery judge decided
last year that Tyson Foods Inc. must complete a $4.7-billion buyout
of beef processor IBP Inc. after Tyson backed out of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Elson described Chandler as "thoughtful, polite and intelligent"
and said, "I believe he'll do a very fair job."</TE>
<TE>   "He's an excellent judge, very hard-working," said corporate
lawyer Stephen Radin of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he strikes an appropriate balance" between the interests
of management and shareholders, said Radin, who appears often in
Chancery Court.</TE>
<TE>   Rural Roots and Ivy League Background</TE>
<TE>   Chandler, a husband and father of two who turns 51 this year, has
tried to stay close to his roots in rural Sussex County, where
chickens outnumber people by a wide margin. In 1997, he told an
interviewer that he declined a federal judgeship because he didn't
want to move his family to Wilmington, the state's largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler still lives in Dagsboro, Del., the tiny town where he
grew up.</TE>
<TE>   He hears many of his cases in the Sussex County Courthouse, often
using a videophone to communicate with out-of-town litigants
appearing in a Wilmington courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler, a Republican, earned a bachelor's degree from the
University of Delaware as a philosophy and political science major
and holds law degrees from the University of South Carolina and Yale
University.</TE>
<TE>   Admitted to the bar in 1976, he served as a law clerk for a
federal judge in Wilmington and worked as a law professor at the
University of Alabama from 1979 to 1981 teaching about the
legislative process, commercial law and legal remedies. He then
returned to Delaware to become legal counsel for then-Gov. Pierre S.
DuPont IV.</TE>
<TE>   A History of Issuing Two-Pronged Rulings</TE>
<TE>   Chandler worked for the law firm of Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp;
Tunnell in Georgetown, Del., from 1983 to 1985. He was appointed
associate judge of the Superior Court for Sussex County, became a
vice chancellor of Chancery Court in 1989 and took the post of
chancellor for a 12-year-term in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In other contested corporate cases, Chandler has been known to
issue two-pronged decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion in late 2000, Chandler refused to block a $4-billion
buyout of Intermedia Communications Inc. by phone-service provider
WorldCom--yet warned that the combined companies could face more than
$2 billion in shareholder claims.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom bought Intermedia last July and settled the shareholder
cases for more than $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, Chandler ruled that Hilton Hotels' "poison pill"
anti-takeover defense was valid and threw out a shareholder's
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Although an official tally in the Hewlett-Packard proxy contest is
expected in the next few weeks, the legal fight over the Compaq
purchase may take months to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the parties are lucky to have someone of his caliber
reviewing the case," Elson said.</TE>

<HD>Still Waiting as Shift to Digital TV Struggles</HD>
<DH>Television: Despite some advances and pressure from
regulators, broadcasters find themselves in a bind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Make no mistake, Matt Stevens loves his new digital television. "It's
the best thing I've ever bought," the independent filmmaker from New
Haven, Conn., said.</LD>
<LD>   His $2,000, 47-inch wide-screen Panasonic was one of the least
costly high-definition sets on the market, yet it delivered a
super-sharp picture and cinema-quality sound--as long as Stevens was
watching DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   To watch high-definition broadcasts from his local TV stations, he
had to spend an additional $750 on a digital receiver. He covered the
cost by selling some of his vintage comic books.</LD>
<TE>   But he soon discovered that CBS' local digital station, which
offers the most prime-time programs and sports in HDTV, was too weak
to tune in to over the air, and it wasn't carried on cable or
satellite. The local NBC and Fox stations in Connecticut, meanwhile,
hadn't even begun broadcasting in digital.</TE>
<TE>   All this was bad news but not a deal-killer for Stevens, who had
no trouble tuning in to the local ABC station's digital channel.
After all, the main reason he'd bought the receiver was to watch the
series of 13 James Bond movies ABC was running in HDTV, the
highest-quality form of digital broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, just as I got [the receiver], they canceled the
movies," Stevens said ruefully.</TE>
<TE>   The reason? Lousy ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens' plight illustrates why so few consumers are tuning in to
their local stations' digital channels, and why the broadcasters'
federally mandated shift from analog to digital is still sputtering
after five years and hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Digital TV has made so little headway with the masses that a top
federal regulator tried to light a fire under the industry last week
by proposing a new set of "voluntary" deadlines. Meanwhile, more than
80% of the commercial TV stations are about to miss a real federal
deadline for launching their digital channels.</TE>
<TE>   The expensive sets and the shortage of HDTV programming,
particularly on cable and satellite, have left the digital stations
with only a cadre of determined viewers such as Stevens. There are
about 2.7 million digital sets in the U.S., and only 10% of them can
tune in to digital broadcasts. That compares with more than 250
million traditional analog sets nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny audience for digital puts broadcasters, whose annual
convention begins today in Las Vegas, in a bind. The federal
government has ordered them to start making the shift away from
analog broadcasting, but they can't build new digital businesses
without viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are replacing every consumer set in America, and that is a
long-term process no matter how you slice it, how you promote it,"
said Edward O. Fritts, the National Assn. of Broadcasters' chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The government-mandated transformation of television began in
1987, when Japanese advancements in broadcasting led policymakers to
call for a U.S. response. With the broadcasters' and set
manufacturers' support, the Federal Communications Commission
eventually adopted a digital alternative that stations could use for
a range of services, including HDTV, multiple simultaneous channels,
high-speed data transmissions and interactive programming.</TE>
<TE>   Digital technology was supposed to change the way people watch TV.
In addition to sharper pictures, broadcasters would be able to offer
extras with every program: alternate camera angles during a game, for
example, or downloadable soundtracks to movies.</TE>
<TE>   Digital broadcasters don't use the same technology that the cable
and satellite companies do in their digital offerings. The cable and
satellite operators use digital to change the way pictures and sound
are sent to conventional TV sets, while the local stations use
digital to change the nature of the picture itself. That's why
consumers need a digital TV to watch the new local channels in their
full quality.</TE>
<TE>   It's also why the FCC loaned each local broadcast station a second
channel in April 1997 so it could gradually shift its programs from
analog to digital. All 1,300 commercial broadcasters had to put their
digital stations on the air by May 1, 2002, and all analog channels
had to be shut down by the end of 2006.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 273 commercial and public broadcasting stations have
launched their digital channels. But more than 800 commercial
stations have sought extensions to the May 1 deadline, and about 100
more don't even have construction permits yet.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the transition picks up speed in a hurry, the federal
government will have to wait to reclaim and auction the airwaves now
being used for analog channels. Critics such as former FCC Chairman
Reed Hundt predict it will take 20 years or more to clear those
channels.</TE>
<TE>   The cost: upward of $70 billion in revenue lost because the
publicly owned spectrum could not be auctioned off for other uses,
such as high-capacity wireless networks.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents note that the digital rollout has been strong in large
cities, with more than 80% of the population being reached by at
least one digital channel. In Los Angeles, 10 digital channels are on
the air, including all the major network affiliates and two public
broadcasting stations. Fritts also says that "the large majority" of
the stations seeking extensions will have their digital channels
running by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   On the manufacturing side, more than 400 types of digital TVs have
been developed, and about 2.7 million sets have been purchased. The
average price of those sets has fallen more than 40% in three years,
and it's expected to drop further as sales increase. Much to the
broadcasters' chagrin, though, only 10% of the homes with digital
sets also have a digital receiver.</TE>
<TE>   To address that issue, several stations plan to test a low-cost
digital converter from Wow Digital TV of Salt Lake City. The
converter, expected to sell for less than $200, enables consumers to
watch the broadcasters' digital channels on conventional TVs in DVD
quality. It also will be able to deliver interactive services, such
as traffic cameras, local weather updates and sports highlights on
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Brown, vice president and general manager of KGTV in San
Diego, said his company has spent $3.5 million putting a digital
channel on the air with no new revenue to show for it. "The Wow
Digital system," he said, "seems to have the most realistic chance of
creating any kind of revenue stream."</TE>
<TE>   Other recent developments suggest that the digital transition is
picking up steam.</TE>
<TE>   Several top cable operators disclosed plans to carry digital
stations in a dozen cities, doubling the current number of
communities served. Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America announced
Saturday that it has stopped making analog TVs, committing itself
totally to digital sets. And the amount of digital programming
continues to increase, with DirecTV planning to carry an additional
entertainment channel in HDTV this quarter and NBC officials saying
they'll broadcast all their new prime-time shows this fall in HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to accelerate the pace of change, FCC Chairman Michael
Powell on Thursday called for more HDTV and other enhanced digital
programming from the top networks this fall. He also urged cable and
satellite services to bring these digital services to 75% or more of
the country by January, and set manufacturers to start putting
digital TV tuners in at least half their big-screen sets by the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   If the voluntary deadlines aren't met, the FCC may adopt new
mandates to boost the transition, the chief of the FCC's media bureau
said last week. Powell's deadlines don't address one other, critical
stumbling block for the digital transition. Set makers, cable and
satellite companies and Hollywood studios are still struggling over
how to connect the new TVs digitally to cable or satellite services
without risking incompatibility, promoting piracy or restricting
consumers' rights to copy programs for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of today's digital sets don't even have digital
connectors, making some owners such as Stevens worry that they'll
lose access to premium HDTV shows. One consequence of the wrangling
is that most digital sets offer no way to record HDTV programs,
making them less appealing to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the equipment woes, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who made
billions on Internet broadcasting, believes the appeal of HDTV will
help TV stations win larger audiences eventually and recover their
investment. One of Cuban's current ventures is HDNet, a satellite TV
channel offering sports and other programming in high definition.</TE>
<TE>   "People with HD [sets] want to watch HD and they do," Cuban said
in a recent e-mail to The Times. "This translates into programming in
HD on HD broadcasting stations getting better ratings and the
financial rewards that come with better ratings, simply because they
are in HD."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Franks, an executive vice president of CBS and a strong
HDTV advocate, agreed. "Digital," he said, "gives us a chance to
differentiate our programming from the fourth food network. The
ability to offer it in wide screen and high definition helps to make
broadcast programming special again."</TE>

<HD>Kmart Wins Ruling on Penske</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bankrupt retailer Kmart Corp. won a temporary restraining order
preventing Penske Auto Centers from shuttering its 563 service
centers over the weekend. The two companies are to return to court
today to determine whether the order will be made permanent.</LD>
<LD>   Penske Auto Centers, which is partly owned by Kmart, had informed
the Troy, Mich.-based retailer on Friday that it would shut down all
of its centers beginning Saturday. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Susan
Pierson Sonderby in Chicago issued a last-minute stay on Saturday
preventing Penske from taking any action until a hearing today.</LD>
<LD>   Although the auto centers were not among the retailer's primary
draws, analysts say the closures would almost certainly inflict
further damage on Kmart and its reputation at a time when it is
struggling to survive alongside fellow discounters Target and
Wal-Mart.</LD>
<TE>   "When you look at a Kmart, the last thing you want to do is see
parts of the store shut down," said Richard Giss, a partner at
Deloitte &amp; Touche Retail Service Group. That sends the signal "that
the whole place is getting ready to shut down."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court protection in January,
the largest filing for a national retailer. Its reorganization has
taken a toll on Penske, as it has on other suppliers. Penske said
Kmart last month defaulted on a $5-million payment owed to Penske
when Penske was forced to shutter 63 auto center locations when Kmart
announced a round of store closings. The centers do everything from
change oil to sell batteries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Penske Chief Executive Jim Wheat said the auto centers
still open were "strong and performing well."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said Saturday in a statement that it is "in discussions with
Penske regarding a mutually acceptable plan for the future of the
auto centers that would protect the interests of the centers'
customers."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Penske officials, contacted late Saturday, called Kmart's
statement misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Penske Chairman Richard Peters said that during a March 27
meeting, Kmart Chief Operating Officer Julian Day "informed us that
Kmart had determined through their research that the auto centers
provided no value to its core business."</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart was therefore unwilling to provide any support to PAC and
agreed that the best course of action was to close PAC," Peters said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart officials were not available for comment. Kmart owns 36% of
Penske Auto Centers; the rest is controlled by a unit of Troy,
Mich.-based Penske Corp., which purchased the auto-service business
from Kmart in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said Penske is just one of a number of companies hurt by
Kmart's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Dorel Industries, a maker of children's car seats, took a one-time
charge of 5 cents per share in its last quarter from its Kmart
losses, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. has reduced its
profit projections for 2002 because of Kmart's store closures.</TE>
<TE>   But Kmart won Bankruptcy Court approval to pay certain suppliers,
including Martha Stewart, to continue shipments of merchandise the
retailer deemed essential.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's stock closed at $1.28, down 9 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Deeper Issues May Be Stalling Stock Transfer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I've worked in our family business for 15 years, the
last five as chief executive. During that time I have done a good job
of increasing sales and profit. My parents, who own all ofthe stock,
are easing out of the business. For several years, I've been asking
them about transferring ownership to me, but they keep putting me
off. I feel like I've paid my dues and deserve to be an owner. I'm 47
years old and not getting any younger. Should I keep pushing or back
off until my parents are ready to hand over the stock?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: There seem to be two basic issues here--your personal
feelings regarding ownership of the company and whether or not your
parents have begun the complex process of succession and estate
planning. It's one thing for them to refuse to surrender any stock at
this point--that's between you and your parents. It's another thing
if they haven't put a process in place that ensures an orderly
transition during their eventual exit from the business. Failure to
do so could endanger the business.</TE>
<TE>   To address the first issue, start by examining your own feelings
and motives. Why is it important to you to own the stock now? Is it a
compensation issue? An ego thing? Does the lack of ownership inhibit
your ability to run the business? Are there unspoken conflicts
between you and your parents? Do they have confidence in your ability
to run the company after they are gone?</TE>
<TE>   Next, suggests Suzanne Frindt, a principal in consulting firm 2130
Partners in Villa Park, consider the situation from your parents'
perspective. What are their long-term financial goals and objectives?
What are their retirement plans and how does the business fit in?
Might they consider a buyout, in which you pay to get ownership, or
do they expect to keep the stock until they die? Until you know more
about their situation and long-term objectives, you can't make any
accurate assessments of their decisions regarding the stock.</TE>
<TE>   From a succession standpoint, have your parents met with an
experienced estate planner to examine the issues involved? Do they
understand all the tax and financial ramifications of transferring
ownership to another generation? In particular, do they understand
what can happen if they suddenly die or the business has to be
transferred with no funds to pay the taxes? These questions need to
be answered for the sake of your relationship with your parents as
well as the survival of the business.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Muse, CEO of Muse Presentation Technologies in Santa Ana,
recommends having a heart-to-heart talk with your parents, but only
after educating yourself on all the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Start by meeting solo with an estate planner so you fully
understand all the ramifications of what happens if your parents do
nothing and get hit by a truck tomorrow," he said. "That should
empower you to at least get the conversation started.</TE>
<TE>   "Next, get clarity on your options," Muse said. "If your parents
say 'no' or 'not now' to your request for ownership, what are you
willing to do? Could you leave and start your own company? Go to work
for a competitor? Have you considered taking a sabbatical and letting
your parents have the fun of running the business full time again?
That might encourage them to open up the discussions and give you
some needed leverage at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you decide, you need to get comfortable with the
situation," Muse said. "You can't run a business effectively if
you're continually agonizing over the lack of ownership and creating
friction between you and your parents."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Van Ness, CEO of Sperry Van Ness in Irvine, echoes the need
to jump-start talks about succession planning. He also suggests
bringing in a third party to help facilitate the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you or your parents know anyone who has successfully
transferred a business to their children?" Van Ness asked. "If so,
your parents might be more open to hearing a fellow business owner
talk about what they went through. I personally know a few people
who, through lack of planning, had a terrible time with the
transition. One fellow and his sister ended up suing their father,
and they have since become estranged for life. A few stories like
that might break down some of the barriers your parents may have
toward the succession-planning process.</TE>
<TE>   "If your parents have doubts about your ability to run the
company, you might want to explore setting up a board of advisors or
directors to provide some structure and oversight. Ultimately,
however, you have to figure out where you want to go with your career
and whether owning the company will enable you to meet your goals. As
much as possible, try to get your emotions out of the way. The more
you can treat it like an employment decision rather than a family
decision, the better your chances of realizing the best outcome."</TE>

<HD>Morpheus' Redirecting Software to Be Optional</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of a controversial online file-sharing network said last
week that the company's use of a technology that redirects Web users
to preferred sites was an experiment that would become an optional
feature in the future.</LD>
<LD>   StreamCast Networks, whose Morpheus network allows tens of
millions of Internet users to download music, movies and other files,
plans to roll out a shopping network that will reward users with cash
back and other incentives, Chief Executive Steve Griffin said.</LD>
<LD>   The company came under fire last month when users discovered it
secretly had included a software device that redirected Web surfers
from popular shopping sites such as Amazon.com to sites run by
business affiliates of StreamCast.</LD>
<TE>   The new Morpheus service comes as rival network KaZaA faces
criticism for secretly including a technology that could seize a
user's extra bandwidth and processing power to perform other tasks.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s bid to unseat Sony Corp. as Japan's No. 1
video-game console maker is a flop.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Xbox's release Feb. 22, Microsoft has sold about 165,000
units, falling one-third short of its goal to sell out of its 250,000
initial shipment by now, a Japanese research company said. The sales
figures are based on a nationwide survey of retailers and rental
stores.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft's attempt to topple Sony in Japan was hampered after the
company was forced to repair or replace defective versions of the
Xbox when customers complained the machine damaged some game discs.</LD>

<HD>Today's Printers Truly Are State of the Art</HD>
<DH>Computers: Advances enable home users to output
high-resolution photos and companies to download artwork and make
reproductions on demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most of the high-tech world perpetually focuses on the next new
thing, a familiar device quietly has gotten so good as to be almost
stunning: the printer.</LD>
<LD>   Galleries and frame stores can download artwork from the Internet
and make richly colored prints directly on fine paper or canvas
within minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Big laser printers and digital presses enable corporations to make
customized glossy publications in-house and in short runs, without
the expense of shipping them to specialty printing houses.</LD>
<TE>   Inexpensive photo printers let consumers instantly develop
sharp-looking shots from digital cameras, skipping not only the
traditional trip to a photofinishing store but also a time-consuming
upload onto a personal computer.</TE>
<TE>   "These things keep improving in quality while coming down in
price," said Keith Kratzberg, director of photo imaging for Epson
America Inc. "We have totally refined the way these things are
designed and manufactured."</TE>
<TE>   New inks fuse to paper much more easily and in smaller particles,
permitting greater resolution and sharper images with more subtle
hues.</TE>
<TE>   Other refinements make printing faster.</TE>
<TE>   The iGen3 digital press, expected soon from Xerox Corp., should
help graphic arts companies and corporations do their own publishing.</TE>
<TE>   Forty feet long and costing about $500,000, the press can crank
out 100 pages a minute.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, even a 17-page-per-minute desktop printer can
be had for about $150.</TE>
<TE>   One company built almost entirely on the recent advances in
printing is Brightcube Inc. Its technology enables art galleries and
frame stores with high-end inkjet printers to make posters and
high-quality prints on demand, reducing the need to keep costly
inventory around.</TE>
<TE>   One painting of a Mediterranean-style cottage and a garden,
downloaded from Brightcube, emerged on a large canvas with sharp reds
and yellows. The brush strokes of the original also stood out on the
digitally made copy.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, customers want to come in and order a specific piece,
and rather than order it, we'll just print it," said Scott Gilsinger,
owner of the Framing Loft in Sun City, Ariz., who uses Brightcube's
service to make 20 to 30 prints a month. "It's excellent quality."</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Brightcube has 40 employees, about 100 customers
and a somewhat limited selection of art and photography available to
download.</TE>
<TE>   But its potential is intriguing. Brightcube's technology keeps
track of which works are downloaded and printed so artists can
collect royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond artwork, Brightcube hopes retailers will want to download
official logos and designs from their parent companies' headquarters
and customize advertisements for individual stores.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the Internet with new high-end printing technology also
is a goal at Hewlett-Packard Co., which recently closed a deal worth
as much as $800 million to acquire Indigo, a Dutch company that makes
digital presses.</TE>
<TE>   Digital presses let companies, such as advertising agencies and
printing houses, create fancy color newsletters, brochures and ads
quickly, in relatively small batches--and with customized content.</TE>
<TE>   For example, HP and a European airline are exploring ways to use a
digital press and Web-based customer-service platform to make
personalized in-flight magazines for first- and business-class
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd find seat 12K, and with the magazines sitting there, on the
top is one geared to you and your flight, welcoming you on board,
giving you a summary of your frequent-flier miles, saying, 'Here's
your menu, here's your videos you asked for and here's the articles
you might like to read,'" said Bill McGlynn, an HP vice president of
digital publishing.</TE>
<TE>   Eyeing similar opportunities, Xerox expects its iGen3 digital
press to bring in $15 billion in revenue in the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   But despite their flexibility, digital presses probably will
supplement the equipment that large printing companies already have,
rather than steal their business altogether, said Mike Croke, who
consults with companies on big printing tasks and farms out the work
to specialty houses.</TE>
<TE>   "It will start to take a toll on some of the mom-and-pop shops,
some of the medium-size shops. But it's not going to knock the large
printers down," Croke said. "I don't see a large insurance company
going back into the printing business."</TE>

<HD>Testing the Sound Barriers Aboard a Loud Jet</HD>
<DH>Special headphones are designed to cancel in-flight roar.
In one comparison, one brand is clearly best.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you flown on any long flights lately? I said, have you flown on
any long flights lately? It's loud inside a jetliner: 80 to 95
decibels, depending on the plane and on where you sit. That's as loud
as a power mower--and it doesn't even include the crying kids.</LD>
<LD>   After a few hours in the noisy skies, it's hard to hear yourself
think--unless you've brought a pair of noise-canceling headphones
along for the ride. I tested some noise-canceling headphones on a
recent trip, and I'll never travel without them again. Not only do
the best noise-canceling headphones greatly diminish the in-flight
roar, but they also sound far superior to the cheesy headphones that
accompany most portable music players.</LD>
<LD>   All noise-canceling headphones operate similarly. Inside each ear
cup, a microphone listens for continuous low-frequency noise--exactly
the kind of racket that a metal tube makes as it hurtles through the
air at 600 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The signal from these microphones is fed into circuitry that
generates an equal but opposite sound, thus eliminating much of the
noise before it reaches your eardrums. The process is roughly akin to
putting a negative image on top of its positive counterpart: The two
cancel out each other.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to guarantee that you'll be searched by airport
security, stash three sets of headphones in your carry-on bag. That's
what I did in the course of testing Panasonic's $49 RP-HC70, Sony
Corp.'s $199 NDR-NC20, and Bose Corp.'s $299 QuietComfort.</TE>
<TE>   When I told a Bose public relations person that I was planning to
compare noise-canceling headphones, she declined to send a loaner
unit, citing a company policy against participating in comparison
reviews. So I bought a set of QuietComfort headphones from the Bose
Web site, figuring I might take advantage of the company's 30-day,
money-back guarantee and return the headphones.</TE>
<TE>   They're not going back. The QuietComfort headphones aren't cheap,
but they out-quiet the competition by a wide margin. Snug their
supple ear cups into place and flick a switch, and the in-flight roar
subsides to a subtle hiss.</TE>
<TE>   You can still hear the crying kids, but the din recedes to well
below headache levels.</TE>
<TE>   And you do get a lot for the money. The headphones sound fabulous
and are far more comfortable than the Sony and Panasonic headsets.
And they include a padded carrying case that has room for a portable
music player and even a few compact discs. Also included are adapters
for connecting to stereos, TVs and airliner armrest jacks.</TE>
<TE>   And the Sony and Panasonic headphones? Both reduced the roar only
marginally, and Sony's did a better job than Panasonic's. Part of
that may be due to superior electronics, but another factor is that
Sony's headphones, like Bose's, use a closed design: They surround
your ears with a padded ear cup that helps isolate outside sound.</TE>
<TE>   At home, I tested the headsets while using a treadmill and while
standing in front of a kitchen vent fan that does an uncanny
imitation of a DC-9. Again, neither Panasonic nor Sony could match
Bose's noise-canceling talents, fidelity and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Because noise-canceling headphones contain electronics of their
own, they require batteries. The Panasonic and Sony headphones each
use one AAA battery, and the Bose QuietComfort requires two. And it's
worth noting that the Bose headset operates only when its batteries
have juice. By comparison, the Sony and Panasonic units can operate
as passive headphones: Switch them off or drain the batteries, and
they still work, albeit with no noise reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's and Panasonic's headphones also are more compact than the
QuietComfort headset; both have a fold-up design that takes up less
space in your luggage. But if you have room in your carry-on bag--and
in your budget--buy the Bose.</TE>

<HD>Tuned to Digital TV</HD>
<DH>Richard Wiley, who headed U.S. conversion efforts, says
hurdles still exist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1987, officials from the Japanese national television network,
NHK, demonstrated a new, advanced version of television to stunned
policymakers in Washington. The Federal Communications Commission
quickly assembled an Advanced Television Advisory Committee to come
up with a U.S. response, tapping former FCC Chairman Richard E. Wiley
to lead it.</LD>
<LD>   NHK, like many companies in the TV industry, focused on improving
analog television, using existing technology as a foundation. But
Wiley threw his support behind a completely new approach, using
digital cameras and transmission equipment to make a leap in picture
quality.</LD>
<LD>   Prodded by Wiley, leading manufacturers joined forces in 1993 to
develop a digital TV standard, which the FCC adopted in 1996.
Regulators around the world soon followed suit, abandoning advanced
analog systems for digital ones.</LD>
<TE>   This work led many observers to label Wiley a key force behind
digital TV, particularly the richly detailed version called
high-definition television. A lobbyist in Washington and a
communications lawyer for Wiley Rein &amp; Fielding, he has remained an
active and influential advocate for the technology. This morning, the
National Assn. of Broadcasters is scheduled to give Wiley its
Distinguished Service Award at its annual convention in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Question: More than three-quarters of the commercial stations in
the U.S. are likely to miss the May 1 deadline for launching their
digital channels.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yeah, but let's keep in mind, the big affiliates in the
big markets are already on the air with digital signals, over 270
stations reaching over 80% of the American population. So we're down
the road there.</TE>
<TE>   [The others] are going to miss it for a variety of reasons. Some
of it zoning, some of it availability of the equipment, probably some
of it financial. But if you don't go digital, where are you going to
be? Because there's not going to be an analog broadcasting system
someday. The world is going digital. Radio is going digital, cable is
going digital, the satellite industry is already digital. Digital is
a better transmission technology, and that's the way the world's
going. There really isn't any turning back.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If there were a clear business model here, some clear return
for going digital, wouldn't every station be doing it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, there's a number of transmission problems, a number of
transition problems that have occurred, which have slowed this down
without a question. First of all, let's keep in mind that this is a
highly complex transition we're going through. Color television
didn't happen overnight.</TE>
<TE>   I think 2010 is a much more realistic date for a phase-out of
analog television and switch-over to digital. The most important
problem of all is to have compelling programming that would really
motivate consumers to spend the money for an expensive television
set, the digital television set. The equipment is much better, highly
improved over the first generation, and the price is falling. What we
do now is to solve the other part of it, which is the programming.
The chicken and egg being you don't buy the sets unless there's
programming. You don't produce the programming unless there's sets.
Well, the sets are at least available in the marketplace. What would
drive their sales, I think, would be to have the programming.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what's holding that up? There are two things. One is copy
protection, particularly for motion pictures. In digital, you have
the capability of making multiple perfect copies and releasing it on
the Internet and all the rest of it. And Hollywood understandably is
concerned about that, and the set manufacturers understandably are
concerned about having restrictions that would prevent home recording
for people.</TE>
<TE>   The other issue is cable compatibility. I had to put up an antenna
to get high-definition television because my cable system doesn't
offer it. I think it's incumbent upon the cable industry to pass
through broadcast and cable high-definition television signals, which
they are starting to do, and to create specifications for a
plug-and-play receiver. You want to be able to go out and buy
equipment and take it home and plug it in as we do now.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is that why only about 10% of the people who have
high-definition monitors also have digital receivers?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yeah, they're buying monitors primarily to use it for DVD
players, which is well and good. Nothing wrong with DVDs. But they're
not buying integrated sets or the set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think a consumer should buy a digital TV today?</TE>
<TE>   A: It depends how much money they have to spend on it and how
interested they are in it. But I would say this: The equipment is
very good today. What would drive me to the marketplace would be the
fact that there's something out there to watch, and we're not seeing
that too much.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Programmers today aren't doing things on the digital channels
that just aren't possible with analog. They're providing the same
programs with much better picture and better sound.</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think that they've yet gotten to that point because
that's a complex business equation as well, and you certainly, before
you go down that road, want to make sure there's enough sets out
there. So it's a long, slow enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Digital is the language of computers, and this is the computer
age. When you can be able to marry these technologies and the power
of the computer with the power of displays--great, really attractive
displays--I think there's a lot of great services. I'm a big fan of
high-definition television, with five times the picture quality, five
times the content, but I'm the first one to say that I think it's
more than just better picture and sound.</TE>
<TE>   The government decided to commit the United States to this
technology. Other governments have decided to do the same thing. The
[U.S.] government, I think, was a little slow at the switch during
the late '90s, and that's not a political statement. It's just a
reality. What I've been arguing for is, it's incumbent upon them,
having made this decision [to shift to digital] to try to make it
work. That doesn't mean necessarily regulating, but it does mean
trying to use the bully pulpit, trying to bring the industries
together and talk over these problems, trying to understand the
problems, trying to urge resolution. And that's what's happening.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The FCC members who adopted the initial digital TV regulations
weren't fans of HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   A: That is true. I think they were jumping the gun to say, 'Let's
make it [the broadcasters' new digital services] all computer, all
data.' The data services have to develop in the marketplace. The
transmission systems have to find business models that will make it
work. And they will, but it's just going to take a little time. Right
now, I think the thing that's right, and available in the
marketplace, is HDTV, if people would only put on the programming.</TE>
<TE>   I think what's going to drive it all is competition. I think the
broadcasters want to be competitive. The cable industry sees
satellite coming along. Everybody's got a competitor, and that's
good.</TE>

<HD>Few Weak Points Seen in Strength of Smaller, 'Value' Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Funds combining the shares rose an average of
8.7% in the first quarter. Factors may keep them in favor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smaller stocks and "value"-oriented shares have been Wall Street's
leaders this year, building on what is now a 2-year-old trend.</LD>
<LD>   But the continuing gains in those market sectors also pose key
questions for investors: Is there still value in value, and can
smaller stocks keep generating bigger returns than blue chips?</LD>
<LD>   Many mutual fund managers who have benefited from what has been
dubbed a stealth bull market in smaller shares and value issues said
that despite the strength in those sectors, they aren't having
trouble finding good ideas.</LD>
<TE>   That may sound similar to what technology-stock fund managers said
at the tech sector's peak in March 2000, but small-stock fund
managers and value-fund managers said there's no comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is we're early in a cycle. We could be in the second
year of a five-year cycle for the market," said Buzz Zaino, manager
of Royce Opportunity, a small-stock value fund that climbed 10.1% in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks and value-oriented issues took a back seat to
big-company stocks and "growth"-company shares, especially technology
issues, in the late 1990s. But since the broad market peaked in
spring 2000, smaller stocks and value issues have ruled Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Small-stock value funds have risen an average of 20.2% a year over
the last three years, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. The
sector leads all others tracked by Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the large-cap growth stock funds that still have a far
bigger chunk of investor assets have lost an average of 5.8% a year
over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Optimism about an economic recovery lifted growth stocks in the
fourth quarter. But value stocks took back the lead in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Small-cap value funds gained an average of 8.7% in the first
quarter, while large-cap growth funds lost 2.7% on average, according
to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Don Cassidy, senior research analyst at fund-tracker Lipper Inc.
in Denver, called the rally from the stock market's Sept. 21
low--which saw the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index surge 45% in
3 1/2 months--"more of a snap-back reaction than a meaningful trend."</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy said the renewed slide in tech stocks in the first quarter
showed that many investors remain nervous about still-high
price-to-earnings valuations on classic growth shares.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment could continue to work in favor of value stocks,
which typically sell for relatively low valuations relative to
earnings, assets and other measures. Value issues also often sport
high dividend yields--a cushion in times of market trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of rising interest rates this year, as the economy
recovers, also may be turning more investors toward small-company
stocks, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Zaino said he is reminded of the period from the mid-1970s through
the early 1980s, when small stocks consistently outperformed blue
chips as interest rates rose.</TE>
<TE>   Higher interest rates typically put more pressure on larger
stocks, Zaino said, because they trade in "a more efficient market"
in which their price-to-earnings ratios often contract in response to
rising rates, whereas smaller companies "just trade on their
earnings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, investors worried about getting stuck with another Enron
Corp. are shying away from conglomerates and companies whose business
plans and financial statements are confusing, some said.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller is simpler is better," said Tom Perkins, manager of the
Berger Mid-Cap Value fund, which gained 5.5% in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Small- and mid-cap value fund managers said they still are finding
plenty of undervalued stocks to buy, although they are looking in
unusual places--including in the tech and telecom sectors, once the
domain of growth managers.</TE>
<TE>   David Wallack, whose T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value fund rose 10.1%
in the first quarter, said he is finding "good risk/reward
characteristics" in tech and telecom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an explicit bet that the sector is going to be in great
shape in the next three, six, 12 months, but looking out two years I
see better times for some of these companies that have good balance
sheets," Wallack said.</TE>
<TE>   Two stocks he bought in the first quarter are ADC
Telecommunications Inc. (ticker symbol: ADCT), which sells equipment
to established phone carriers, and Molex Inc. (MOLX), which sells
switches and other electronics gear. Both firms have experienced
managers who have been through economic cycles before, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither of these companies worries too much about quarterly
earnings. They focus on the long term and don't gut the business to
make Wall Street happy."</TE>
<TE>   Zaino said he is finding tech companies "where, if you rip the
company name off the quarterly financial report, you could make a
Graham-and-Dodd guy salivate," referring to two value investing
legends.</TE>
<TE>   He said examples include Asian electronics manufacturers Deswell
Industries Inc. (DSWL) and Nam Tai Electronics Inc. (NTAI), which
trade for P/E ratios of only about 10 based on Zaino's estimates of
this year's earnings. The S&amp;P 500, by contrast, has a projected P/E
of about 23.</TE>
<TE>   Growing trade with China could help fuel solid earnings gains in
coming years for manufacturers like these, Zaino said, noting that
both stocks also pay a dividend.</TE>
<TE>   He also likes EPresence Inc. (EPRE), which helps companies build
Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Though the company will probably post a modest loss this year, it
does not carry any long-term debt and has plenty of cash on hand,
Zaino said.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins said he is taking small positions in tech stocks that
"look pretty well washed out," adding that he generally limits the
volatile sector to about 20% of his portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks he has bought recently include enterprise software maker
Micromuse Inc. (MUSE), which has tumbled 74% in the last 12 months,
and voice-messaging systems maker Comverse Technology Inc. (CMVT),
down 77% in the last year. Though the economic slump has crimped
revenue at both firms, Perkins said they have clean balance sheets
and good long-term prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the tech sector, Wallack has bought shares of Diamond
Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO), whose earnings could rebound sharply in
the next few years if the oil and gas drilling business recovers, he
said. The firm has been solidifying its competitive position by
buying rigs at low prices, Wallack said.</TE>
<TE>   Though shares of health insurer Aetna Inc. (AET) have bounced back
with a 21% gain year-to-date, Wallack believes the stock may have
more of an upside.</TE>
<TE>   The company made numerous blunders in the late 1990s, Wallack
said, including overpaying for acquisitions, but it still has large
market share and a valuable brand. With a new chief operating officer
on board, the company should be able to raise premiums and manage
costs better, Wallack said.</TE>
<TE>   With the arrival of spring, Zaino's thoughts have turned to
garden-supply companies: Lesco Inc. (LSCO), which supplies fertilizer
and other lawn equipment to commercial golf courses, and Central
Garden &amp; Pet Co. (CENT), which makes various brand-name consumer
products.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies should benefit from seasonal spending in the short
run and an improving economy in the longer run, he said.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelan Oil Monopoly Fires 7 Execs</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Country's president says any others who
protest company leadership also will go.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez said seven executives who led monthlong strikes
and protests against government-appointed leadership at the
state-owned oil monopoly were fired by the company's board of
directors over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve other Petroleos de Venezuela executives have been sent into
early retirement, he said Sunday, adding that any other employees who
continue leading protests will be fired.</LD>
<LD>   The decision is likely to exacerbate a conflict that has affected
production at South America's largest state-owned oil company. The
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, the country's biggest labor
union, said the government had "committed suicide" by announcing the
dismissals.</LD>
<TE>   A five-week-long labor slowdown has forced operators to scale back
production at the 950,000-barrels-a-day Paraguana refinery complex in
western Venezuela, company sources said Sunday. The sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said they couldn't say by how much
production had been trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   The Paraguana complex produces 70% of Venezuela's refined
products. The production slowdown was part of a plan to prevent
accidents because of the reduction in the flow of gas and oil.</TE>
<TE>   Confederation President Carlos Ortega said the union may extend a
one-day nationwide general strike called for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Fedecamaras, the country's largest business association, announced
Sunday that its members would join the general strike Tuesday. It
will be the second time in Chavez's 3-year-old presidency that
unionized workers and business leaders will have joined forces to
paralyze the country.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred by the firings, company employees staged a noisy
protest outside the Caracas headquarters, chanting "Not one step
back" and banging pots and pans.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared to respond to these decisions. We will take the
necessary measures," said Petroleos de Venezuela's director of
finance, Juan Fernandez, one of the executives who was fired. Also
fired were Horacio Medina, Eddy Ramirez, Gonzalo Feijoo, Alfredo
Gomez, Carmen Elisa Hernandez and Edgar Quijano.</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly radio broadcast Sunday, Chavez said the government
had been more than patient. Chavez accused the protesters of trying
to "sabotage" Venezuela's oil industry and vowed that his efforts to
reform the company would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Two of five main export terminals for crude oil and refined
products--El Palito in central Venezuela and Puerto La Cruz in the
east--shut down because of labor unrest. At least a dozen vessels
were waiting at the ports for operations to resume.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also announced a 20% increase in the public sector minimum
wage, to take effect in May. About 40% of Venezuelan workers earn the
current minimum wage of $180 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Petroleos de Venezuela, also known as PDVSA, oversees the
country's greatest resource--crude oil reserves that are the largest
outside the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Oil provides a third of the nation's $110-billion gross domestic
product, 80% of its export earnings and half of government income.</TE>

<HD>Firms Cautious on 401(k) Changes</HD>
<DH>With Congress unable to agree on how far to go with reform
legislation, some employers are holding off on revising their
retirement plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The security of many investors' biggest financial asset--their 401(k)
retirement plan--has become a major issue in the aftermath of the
bankruptcies of Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and other once
high-flying giants.</LD>
<LD>   But hopes earlier this year for rapid reform of 401(k) plan rules
that have long vexed many workers have been frustrated.</LD>
<LD>   Congress appears deadlocked on what change to mandate through
legislation, even though calls for reform were heard from both sides
of the aisle and from the White House after the Enron and Global
Crossing failures obliterated millions of dollars in employee
retirement savings.</LD>
<TE>   Some companies already have acted on their own, hoping to preempt
reforms by changing some aspects of their plans. Gannett Co. and
International Paper Co. said they removed restrictions that barred
employees from selling company stock held in their 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   Such restrictions are fairly common among the roughly 2,000
companies that use their own stock to match workers' 401(k) plan
contributions. They typically forbid employees from selling company
stock received as matching contributions until the workers reach age
50 or 55. Gannett and International Paper said employees can now sell
matching-contribution stock as soon as they get it.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco Corp. announced it would make similar changes to its
401(k) rules. Packaging firm Ball Corp. eliminated stock-sale
restrictions when it restructured its 401(k) plan in December.</TE>
<TE>   But as hopes fade for a comprehensive 401(k) reform bill from
Congress this year, companies have become increasingly reluctant to
make major changes for fear that whatever they do may need to be
undone or modified later.</TE>
<TE>   Modest changes--the addition of investment options, for
example--continue, experts note. But the big issue of plan design is
being put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "What the legislative debate has ended up doing is freezing the
world," said Dallas Salisbury, chief executive of the Employee
Benefit Research Institute in Washington. "In the present situation,
people are thinking that there is no way to know what is going to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to do anything until there is a clearer
direction."</TE>
<TE>   The source of the confusion isn't hard to find: Lawmakers are
weighing several bills that would change how companies set up their
401(k) plans, and it's anybody's guess what provisions will make it
into law.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), would
bar companies from providing employer stock as a 401(k) investment
option while also making matching plan contributions in company
stock. Companies would have to choose one or the other. The only
exception would be for companies that also offered a traditional
pension--the type that pays workers monthly benefits for life--in
addition to a 401(k).</TE>
<TE>   Other legislative proposals would require firms to lift all
restrictions on workers' sale of company stock within 401(k) plans,
giving employees the right to diversify their investments more
quickly than some plans now allow.</TE>
<TE>   But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Kennedy's proposal also
would create "joint trusteeship" of 401(k) programs, giving
rank-and-file workers considerably more say in how the plans are
designed. Republicans--and many employers--think this goes too far
and are fighting to keep it out of the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals dealing with how much investment education employees
should be offered in conjunction with their 401(k) plan, and how that
education should be provided, also are being debated in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, some proposals would change company rules that govern
so-called blackout periods, which occur when employers switch 401(k)
plan administrators and workers are banned from trading within their
401(k) accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Political observers said congressional leaders are becoming less
willing to compromise on these issues as the debate wears on. And
many are saying that a 401(k) reform bill probably won't be passed
until next year.</TE>
<TE>   For companies considering changes, that creates a difficult
situation, said Libby Sartain, senior vice president of human
relations at Internet firm Yahoo Inc. and former head of the Society
of Human Resource Management in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   It can take years of study and cost millions of dollars for large
employers to make changes to their 401(k) plans, Sartain said. That's
partly because the plans already are governed by complicated laws and
regulations that must be carefully examined before design changes are
made to ensure that no rules are violated.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, larger firms can spend a small fortune rewriting plan
documents, creating brochures and holding seminars to communicate the
news to workers once a change has been made.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be some companies that are going to wait and
see what comes down before they make any changes," Sartain said.
"There are so many different proposals coming down ... and you don't
want to change something and realize that you're going to have to
spend all the time and all the money to do it all over again."</TE>
<TE>   The failures of Enron, Global Crossing and other firms have
brought home for many workers--and companies--the risks entailed when
employees are too heavily invested in the stock of their firm,
benefits experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "Everybody is kind of gun-shy to even deal with the
issue of [company stock]," said Alex Brucker, a pension lawyer with
Brucker, Morra &amp; Hiltunen in Los Angeles. "They don't want to take
any action because any alteration they make could end up
[violating]some new rule."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, though companies continue to be willing, able and eager
to improve their employee education efforts, structural changes
similar to those affecting employer stock are getting tabled, said
Paul Heller, head of the full-service defined contribution business
at Vanguard Investments.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a large camp that's in wait-and-see mode," Heller said.
"There is a lot of discussion ... and many companies are willing to
do things that fall short of plan design changes, but not that many
are making structural changes right now."</TE>

<HD>How to Put In Your 2 Cents on 401(k)</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't like the investment options or the rules governing your 401(k)
plan? It may not take government action to improve your plan.</LD>
<LD>   Although workers generally don't have a specific legal right to
demand changes in their company's 401(k), they often can influence
change by approaching the right people.</LD>
<LD>   "It happens here all the time," said Bob Wynkoop, senior director
of compensation and benefits at packaging company Ball Corp. in
suburban Denver. "We have had a history of people writing in [with
suggestions about the 401(k) plan]. We have made some changes because
of the things they wanted."</LD>
<TE>   At most companies, employee input on 401(k) plans usually focuses
on two areas: the number and variety of investment choices in a plan;
and the rules that govern plan participants, such as who can join and
when, the size of the company's matching contributions and how issues
such as loans, blackout periods and sales of company stock within the
plan are handled.</TE>
<TE>   Generally speaking, it's easier to change the investment options
than it is to change a plan's rules. The reason: cost. It can cost
millions of dollars for companies to alter the structure of a 401(k)
plan because the process requires legal review and lots of
communication with employees.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, adding or deleting investment options usually is
simple and inexpensive.</TE>
<TE>   The first step in pressing for change is to determine who's in
charge and how they operate.</TE>
<TE>   "You are much more likely to succeed if you work within the system
and understand how it works," said Judith Mazo, senior vice president
and director of research at Segal Co., a benefit-consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   At small companies, plan investment options often are chosen by
top executives, such as the president, chief executive, treasurer or
controller. If these executives are relatively accessible--as they
often are in smaller firms--lobbying for change can be as easy as
sitting down with the appropriate executive over lunch or at the
company picnic.</TE>
<TE>   At large companies, the process generally is more formal. An
employee-benefits representative is likely to be responsible for
communicating with workers and determining what to recommend to a
plan's trustees, who are responsible for the program's design and
investment choices. Some companies also have written guidelines that
spell out the formal process by which plan investment options are
selected.</TE>
<TE>   To get the process started, it's wise to contact whoever is in
charge of benefits or human resources. If there is a formal committee
that deals with the 401(k) plan, the benefit representatives should
know who they are, how to contact them and whether they operate under
a formal set of rules.</TE>
<TE>   Doing some research on the criteria the 401(k) trustees use to
choose investment options may help employees in building their case
for new options. But realize that even if making a change would seem
to be free and simple, the answer may not always be yes.</TE>
<TE>   At Ball, for instance, the company changed its international
mutual fund selections at the urging of an employee. But the company
refused to add a technology stock fund two years ago because the
firm's financial advisors were convinced that employees were simply
eager to chase the latest "hot" investment sector.</TE>
<TE>   These advisors told Wynkoop, the compensation director, that
adding such a fund could put workers' savings at risk because what is
hot one year often turns cold the next. Though some workers didn't
like the denial at the time, they stopped complaining six months
later when tech stocks hit the skids, Wynkoop said.</TE>
<TE>   Mazo, who serves as a trustee on Segal's 401(k) board, said the
board turned down a recent request to allow plan participants to
trade individual stocks within the plan because the option would have
cost every participant $5 per quarter in additional administration
fees. That may not seem like much, but it's like cable-TV fees, she
said: There are lots of little charges that can add up to substantial
amounts if you aren't careful.</TE>
<TE>   "Since only a few people were likely to use this, we didn't think
it was appropriate to make everyone pay," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Employees who are convinced that a reasonable request is being
ignored don't have recourse under federal law--unless they can prove
that the plan's structure or investment options are so bad that they
violate the sponsor's fiduciary responsibility to workers.</TE>
<TE>   If a request is turned down, try again, some experts advise.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that the request was rejected because plan trustees
thought it had little support or wasn't well-considered. The employee
may simply need to do more research or gather support among
co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   Also realize that although companies may move slowly, most are
anxious to make their plans as attractive as possible to workers,
said Libby Sartain, senior vice president of human resources at
Internet firm Yahoo Inc. That's because offering a good plan is in
the firm's best interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Most good companies have wonderful 401(k) plans with wonderful
investment options," she said. "The reason we do is because we are
all competing for a scarce commodity--talent."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if too few rank-and-file workers participate in a plan,
tax rules restrict the ability of top managers to participate as
well. That gives everybody from the CEO on down a vested interest in
making a 401(k) plan as attractive as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Employees have always asked their employers for different things
in these plans, and largely because of that, 401(k)s are vastly
better than they used to be," Sartain said.</TE>

<LD>The fact that government-mandated 401(k) plan reform appears to be
stalled shouldn't discourage workers from contributing to these
plans--and contributing as much as possible, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Though the system may not be perfect, financial advisors maintain
that 401(k) plans remain one of the best options workers have when it
comes to saving for retirement. And this year, new rules allow
employees to contribute even more to these programs.</LD>
<LD>   In 2002, workers can contribute up to $11,000 to a 401(k). Those
ages 50 or older can contribute an extra $1,000 in so-called catch-up
contributions.</LD>
<TE>   Plan contributions are taken out of paychecks before federal
income taxes are computed. That reduces the amount of a worker's
income that is subject to federal tax each year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many individuals who contribute to 401(k)s can take
advantage of income-contingent tax breaks that they otherwise might
have lost because they earned too much.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there's a special tax credit for paying education
expenses for a college freshman or sophomore. But the break begins to
phase out once a taxpayer's income exceeds $41,000 for a single
person or $82,000 for a married couple filing jointly.</TE>
<TE>   If a couple earning $92,000 were paying these college expenses,
contributing $10,000 to a 401(k) plan would not only save them $3,000
in income tax, it would reduce their taxable income enough to qualify
them for the full $1,500 Hope Tax Credit--half of which they
otherwise would have lost because their income exceeded the
thresholds. The net tax benefit to contributing to the 401(k) would
be $3,750.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies also match employee savings up to set amounts. For
example, a firm might match 50% of the first 6% of pay contributed by
a worker.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, experts say, workers should contribute enough to a
401(k) account to qualify them for the full employer match, while
also making sure that they are keeping their plan assets
well-diversified.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the biggest benefit of 401(k) plans is that they are
automatic: Contributions come out of earnings just like payroll
taxes, reducing the temptation to spend rather than save.</TE>

<HD>International Funds Off to Strong Start</HD>
<DH>Many of the best performers in the first quarter were funds
that invest overseas. But analysts remain cautious about emerging
markets.</DH>

<LD>Mutual funds that invest in foreign stocks have been disappointing
U.S. investors for years. Will 2002 be any different?</LD>
<LD>   Many international-investing pros think this may be foreign
markets' year. And foreign stocks overall are off to a strong start.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the five best-performing stock fund categories in the
first quarter were funds that invest overseas: Latin American funds;
funds that own Asian stocks other than Japanese issues; and
diversified emerging-markets funds, which can own Latin American and
Asian stocks as well as those in Eastern Europe and Africa.</LD>
<TE>   The emerging-markets category was up 11.9% for the first quarter,
Asian funds rose 9.7% and Latin American funds gained 8.7%, on
average, according to Morningstar Inc. Those categories also were
among the best performers in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Both emerging-markets and Latin American funds got a boost from
Mexico, where the stock market rose 17% in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the average international stock fund gained 3.9% in the
quarter. In contrast, the average U.S. stock fund was up 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Some financial planners are cheering the divergence in performance
between U.S. and foreign funds as evidence of what they've long
contended: Investments in foreign stocks can help diversify a
portfolio and lower risk for investors by boosting returns when
domestic markets lag.</TE>
<TE>   But even some big fans of foreign stock investing caution against
overdosing on international funds. The United States, despite
accounting scandals and lackluster returns so far this year, probably
won't lose its status as the world's premier market any time soon,
especially if the economy continues to rebound.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the strong dollar--a major drag on foreign returns
for U.S. investors since the early 1990s--could continue to mute any
gains foreign markets produce.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is some value to be had by looking overseas," said
David Bowers, chief global strategist at brokerage Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. "But I don't think we have the 'full Monty' of factors [to
support a major overseas rally]."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign stock fund returns have trailed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index for 10 of the last 12 years, typically by double digits. Last
year, for example, foreign stock funds on average lost 22%, compared
with a 12% loss in the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Even in good years, foreign stock funds often have been eclipsed
by the U.S. market. Case in point: Foreign funds' 13.5% average gain
in 1998 was overshadowed by the S&amp;P 500's 28.6% rise.</TE>
<TE>   The strong dollar has been a perpetual problem, reflecting global
investors' hunger for U.S. assets. Just as a foreign currency buys
fewer greenbacks when the dollar is strong, foreign stock returns are
reduced proportionately when the dollar rises in value.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Italian stock market's 3.1% rise in the first
quarter was reduced to 2.1% for U.S. investors, after accounting for
the dollar's rise against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly disturbing to some analysts is that foreign markets
in recent years have moved in tandem with the U.S. market--blunting
the argument that foreign stocks could reduce a portfolio's
volatility.</TE>
<TE>   "They've under-performed, relative to the U.S., and they haven't
given you the diversification you thought you were going to get,"
Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some experts maintain that foreign stock funds can
build on their first-quarter gains and have more room to climb than
U.S. stock funds.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has lost some of its cachet as the most-trusted financial
market, in the wake of the Enron Corp. collapse and other accounting
scandals, said Jay Pelosky, global strategist for brokerage Morgan
Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   That could make investments in foreign companies--traditionally
considered less transparent in their accounting methods--seem less
risky, Pelosky said.</TE>
<TE>   Still-low interest rates and a global economic recovery also may
help many countries more than the United States, strategists said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. consumers and companies have big debt loads, which could slow
the pace of the domestic economy's recovery, said Charles de Vaulx,
co-manager of First Eagle SoGen international funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamentals in Europe are better than in the U.S.," De Vaulx
said. "U.S. consumers are overextended ... and corporations in Europe
have better balance sheets than their U.S. counterparts."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, U.S. stocks are still pricey by classic market
measures, many experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is relatively the most expensive market in the world,"
Bowers said. Even after its big drop over the last two years, "the
Nasdaq composite index is trading at 90 [times projected earnings per
share], while emerging markets are trading at 11 to 12 times." The
S&amp;P 500 is priced at about 23 times estimated 2002 earnings.</TE>
<TE>   What about the strong dollar? Pelosky is among many pros who
expect the buck to weaken over the next two to three years if the
global economy revives and more investors become interested in
foreign assets over U.S. assets.</TE>
<TE>   A weaker dollar automatically would make foreign stock portfolios
appreciate in dollar terms, all other things being equal. In fact,
the dollar did weaken in the first quarter against some Asian and
Latin American currencies.</TE>
<TE>   Several brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley, recently trimmed their recommended allocation of U.S.
stocks, reflecting the view that foreign stocks could do better than
domestic shares in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most strategists don't see the catalyst that could send
investors stampeding from the U.S. to the markets of either of the
two other leading economies: Japan and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, the average European stock fund was up 1.1%.
The average Japanese fund gained 2.8%. Those gains beat the average
U.S. fund, but last year the average European fund plunged 21% and
the average Japanese fund slumped 30.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Even this year's rally in emerging markets probably will fizzle at
some point, because the risks involved will keep professionals from
committing more than a small portion of their portfolios to
emerging-market stocks, Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   "'Sell U.S. and buy Russia' doesn't quite work," Bowers said.
"You've got to have a pretty powerful story to move capital away from
the U.S. markets, and that's still missing."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, emerging-markets funds should be approached with
caution, analysts say. The funds are highly volatile--four times more
likely to incur losses of more than 10% in a quarter than the typical
foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Most investors are better off using larger, more diversified
international or global funds, such as American Funds EuroPacific
Growth, Artisan International, Harbor International, Liberty Acorn
International or Tweedy Browne Global Value, said Morningstar analyst
Gregg Wolper. (Funds classified as foreign invest almost all their
money abroad. So-called global or world funds may invest some money
in U.S. markets.)</TE>
<TE>   Investors who want to take a bit of a gamble on emerging markets,
without risking losing their shirts, can consider diversified foreign
funds that have significant stakes in developing countries, experts
say. American Funds EuroPacific Growth, for example, recently had
19.5% of its assets in emerging markets. Another top performer, First
Eagle SoGen Overseas, had 17.2% in developing markets.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy has paid off for financial planner Ross Levin of
Minneapolis, who kept his clients partly invested in foreign stock
mutual funds throughout the 1990s, even as returns on foreign shares
mostly lagged.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said he minimized his clients' ire by investing in some of
the best-performing international funds, such as First Eagle SoGen
funds and Artisan International, which often produced gains when
their peers were losing money.</TE>
<TE>   He believes foreign stocks will start outperforming U.S. stocks,
just as U.S. stocks beat out foreign shares for most of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The worse foreign stocks did, the more I liked them," Levin said.
"I'm a big believer in reversion to the mean."</TE>

<HD>Use the Four Rs to Pick, Track Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our tables on these pages are designed to help you pick new mutual
funds and assess the performance of funds you already own.</LD>
<LD>   As with selecting a good diamond, there's a system you can use to
find good funds.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the four Cs--cut, carat, color and clarity--fund
investors must consider the four Rs: returns, ratings, risk and ratio
of expenses to assets.</LD>
<TE>   Our lists of funds on these pages are fund tracker Morningstar
Inc.'s top-rated funds, according to its proprietary rating system.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an explanation of the four Rs and how these funds come to
be ranked highest by Morningstar:</TE>
<TE>   * Returns. Obviously, before selecting a mutual fund you'll want
to look at its record. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future
returns, but it can be an indication of competence and consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Performance return figures are simple to look up in our charts.
Under the header "Total % Return" you'll see three figures.</TE>
<TE>   The first shows the fund's return in the first quarter (the three
months ended March 31, or technically March 28). The second shows the
return in the 12 months through March.</TE>
<TE>   The third shows the fund's annualized return over the three years
ended March 31. In other words, it takes the fund's total three-year
net return and calculates what that worked out to on a yearly basis.</TE>
<TE>   All returns figures are "total returns"--meaning they measure net
price change plus any dividend or interest income.</TE>
<TE>   By comparing each fund's return with its category average for any
given period, you can see whether the fund did better or worse than
the average fund.</TE>
<TE>   There's another way to measure longer-term performance. Look at
the second column in each table--the "3-yr Rnk" column.</TE>
<TE>   This shows how a fund ranks by returns over the last three years,
expressed by the percentile in which its performance ranks within its
category. A "1" rank means a fund ranked in the first percentile in
its category; a "99" means the fund ranked at the bottom in its
category.</TE>
<TE>   * Ratings and Risk. These two Rs are intertwined, based on the
different rating systems Morningstar uses to judge funds against
their peers.</TE>
<TE>   "Category ratings," which you'll see as the first column of each
table ("Cat Rtg"), assess a fund's "risk-adjusted" performance over
the last three years relative to other funds in its specific
category.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings are 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.</TE>
<TE>   What does risk-adjusted mean? Morningstar judges each fund's
overall performance against its downside volatility. The idea is that
you don't necessarily want to earn the highest returns if a fund also
is extremely volatile, swinging wildly in terms of returns.</TE>
<TE>   High volatility increases the chance of loss if you need to sell
at a bad time, a lesson many fund shareholders learned in the harsh
bear market of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   So Morningstar believes consistency of performance, as well as
above-average performance, is important in judging returns--and
whether a fund is a good choice for the typical investor.</TE>
<TE>   You're probably more familiar with the rating system shown in the
third column of our tables--Morningstar's famous three-year "star"
rating ("3-yr Star" in the header), which also has a 1-to-5 scale,
with 5 being the best.</TE>
<TE>   As with the category ratings, the star ratings are handed out on a
bell curve: The highest-rated 10% of funds get a 5, the next 22.5%
get a 4, the next 35% get a 3, the next 22.5% get a 4 and the lowest
10% get a 1.</TE>
<TE>   What's the real difference between the category rating and the
star rating? In awarding stars, Morningstar compares a fund not with
others in its specific category but with others in one of just four
much broader fund groupings: domestic stock funds, international
stock funds, taxable bond funds or tax-free bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   What this means, in effect, is that specific categories of funds
that are out of favor in a given period, relative to the broad
market, will tend to have more funds with lower star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, funds in categories that investors have favored
lately, relative to the broad market, will tend to have more funds
with higher star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   For example, many health-care stock funds still get five stars,
despite losses in 2001 and the first quarter of this year, because
the funds' three-year returns in many cases remain stellar.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious problem with star ratings: They are backward-looking;
they don't necessarily tell you which fund categories may be starting
to shine just recently.</TE>
<TE>   If you're hunting among fund categories that have just begun to
improve recently--such as precious metals funds--the category rating
in our tables might be more valuable than the star rating because the
former tells you which funds have performed best in their specific
category, rather than relative to the broad market.</TE>
<TE>   * Ratio of expenses. Our tables show each fund's management fees
in the column labeled "Exp Ratio." That measures annual fund expenses
as a percentage of assets.</TE>
<TE>   The average for each category is shown at the bottom of each
table.</TE>
<TE>   If a fund charges more than the average, it should be producing
above-average returns for shareholders as well. If not, you should
wonder what you're paying for.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that some types of funds are more costly to manage
than others. For instance, the staffing needed to properly research
obscure emerging-markets stocks is likely to be greater than that
required for a fund investing in well-known companies here at home.
So judge a fund's expense ratio relative to that of its peers.</TE>
<TE>   Funds with sales charges, or "loads," are usually sold by brokers
or other financial advisors and are often a way to pay for advice.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term effect of sales charges is an ongoing controversy,
but it is important to note that return figures and Morningstar
ratings do not take these sales charges into account.</TE>

<HD>Morningstar's Top-Rated Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 10,000 mutual funds to choose from, many investors
cringe at the task of making selections.</LD>
<LD>   With today's special quarterly fund report, The Times and
independent research firm Morningstar Inc. provide several ways to
evaluate funds--including measurements designed to help investors
determine a particular fund's performance not only overall, but also
relative to its peers.</LD>
<LD>   The tables on the next three pages list the best-performing funds
in each of Morningstar's major fund categories over the last three
years (ended March 28), as determined by the firm's proprietary
rating system. That three-year period includes the bull market surge
of 1999 as well as the bear market that began in March2000.</LD>
<TE>   Only funds with three years of history are included.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the funds were ranked:</TE>
<TE>   * First, each fund has a "category rating" (Cat Rtg), a number
from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. This rating represents
Morningstar's assessment of how well the fund achieved its three-year
returns relative to the amount of risk it took, compared with its
category peers.</TE>
<TE>   * Second, within each category rating score (i.e., first the 5s,
then the 4s, etc.) funds are ranked by actual three-year performance
within the category as a whole, expressed as a percentile figure (1
to 100, with 1 being best). That is the "three-year rank" column.</TE>
<TE>   For funds with multiple classes (i.e., A and B shares, etc.) only
the best-performing class is included.</TE>
<TE>   To determine order, ties in the first two columns were broken by
manager tenure.</TE>
<TE>   * The more familiar Morningstar three-year "star" rating appears
in the third column.</TE>
<TE>   The number of stars (again, on a scale of 1 through 5, with 5
being the best) is an assessment of performance and level of risk for
that fund compared against its broader group: domestic stock funds,
international stock funds, taxable bond funds or tax-free (muni) bond
funds. See more detailed information below.</TE>
<TE>   A word about categories:</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar does not categorize funds based solely on a fund's
self-description. Rather, it also looks at each fund's actual
holdings to determine category.</TE>
<TE>   The largest groups of funds are domestic equity funds, which
Morningstar organizes by the average size (market capitalization) of
stocks owned and by a fund's general investment philosophy. These
appear on the next page.</TE>
<TE>   Want to see how other funds shape up? Appearing after these four
pages are listings of the 4,500 largest mutual funds, listed by
family name from A to Z, with category type, rankings and performance
data for each.</TE>
<TE>   Also listed are funds' telephone numbers--most are toll-free.
(Some top-rated funds here are not among the 4,500 largest on pages
U12--14. A small number of late-reporting funds are not ranked.)</TE>

<HD>Riding the Recovery</HD>
<DH>Stocks struggle to keep momentum despite optimism about
economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recession of 2001 has given way to the recovery of 2002. And a
recovering economy almost always has meant that stocks are the place
to be.</LD>
<LD>   After the devastating market decline of 2000 and 2001, that's a
welcome thought for many investors, of course.</LD>
<LD>   But in the first quarter, Wall Street didn't quite play along with
the historical script. Stocks struggled to a mixed finish, unable to
extend the powerful rally of the fourth quarter that followed the
post-Sept. 11 dive in prices.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index closed virtually
unchanged for the quarter ended March 28, though counting dividend
income, the index's "total return" was a positive 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The average domestic stock mutual fund likewise posted a minuscule
positive return of 0.4%, according to fund-tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of bright spots in the market in the quarter,
including "value"-oriented shares, natural resources stocks and many
foreign issues.</TE>
<TE>   But the first week of the second quarter brought a fresh sell-off
market-wide, raising new concerns that the next major turn on Wall
Street's roller coaster won't be to the upside.</TE>
<TE>   "On 'the Street' there's a pretty good battle going on between the
optimists and the pessimists," said Ed Keon, investment strategist at
Prudential Securities in New York. "We fall on the optimists' side,
but the pessimists have a good story as well: Their point is that the
economic downturn was not that strong, so this recovery may not be
much either."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. strategist Jeffrey Applegate also is an optimist,
relatively speaking: He expects the rebounding economy to lift
corporate profits this year, and believes share prices will advance
as well. His year-end price target of 1,350 for the S&amp;P 500 would
mean a 20% gain from the index's Friday close.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point in the economic cycle, stocks should outperform
bonds," he said. But the market's fourth-quarter rally priced in a
healthy portion of this year's corporate profit recovery, he said. So
stocks may not see the kind of gains this year that were typical
after other recessions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the market's advance from its recession lows reached
Sept. 21 has been modest, compared with the rallies following
previous recession lows.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 is up 16.2% since Sept. 21, and the Nasdaq composite
index is up 24.4%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, approximately 28 weeks after the market's recession
lows of 1990, the S&amp;P was up 28.4% and the Nasdaq index was up 48.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say investors have some good reasons for being cautious
about pushing share prices higher, despite the economy's apparent
emergence from recession.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for Rebound in Corporate Profits</TE>
<TE>   One key question is whether corporate earnings--the fundamental
underpinning for stock prices--will rebound strongly in the second
half of the year. Brokerage analysts are setting the target high for
the third and fourth quarters, predicting a 38% year-over-year climb
in earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies in the period, said Robert
Doll, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch's asset management
division in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Doll and others note that advance corporate warnings about
first-quarter results have been lighter than usual, which suggests
that the reports will be on target or better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   But a wave of warnings last week from the software industry didn't
help investors' confidence, and contributed to the week's 4.1% drop
in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index. Year-to-date the index is
down 9.3%, after surging 30% in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   If investors begin to question whether robust revenue and profit
growth is possible later in the year, the market could struggle from
here, with the major indexes notching gains in the high single
digits--at best--for the year, Doll said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for caution is that consumer spending never withered in
the 2001 recession, making it unlikely that a dramatic surge in
spending will supercharge the economy, he said. What's more, many
analysts don't believe that corporate capital spending will turn up
significantly this year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the possibility of a choppy or muted earnings recovery,
steep stock valuations are a key concern on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "By historical standards stocks are still fairly expensive," Keon
said, noting that the S&amp;P 500 trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of
about 23 based on this year's profit estimates, compared with its
historical average P/E of about 15.</TE>
<TE>   Valuations may limit the market's upside, Keon said, because there
is arguably little room for P/E ratios to expand.</TE>
<TE>   In past economic recoveries, the market got a lift not only from
rising corporate earnings but also because investors were willing to
pay higher prices relative to earnings. Because the average P/E
already is high, that P/E expansion may not happen this time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some market strategists say today's equity valuations are
reasonable in the context of benign inflation, relatively low
long-term interest rates and federal income tax rates that are slated
to continue to fall in 2003--all factors that tend to make stocks
more attractive to investors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fed May Go Slow in Raising Rates</TE>
<TE>   One potential market obstacle that isn't troubling most
professionals is the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will begin
raising its key short-term interest rate this year from the current
40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of stronger-than-expected economic data in the first
quarter, the Fed in March signaled that it may begin tightening
credit later this year. But analysts note that the stock market
usually has rallied in periods of economic recovery even after the
Fed has begun raising rates from recession lows.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many economists believe the Fed will be cautious in
tightening credit this time because of concern that the recovery is
tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   One threat to the recovery is the surge in energy prices this
year. Crude oil has shot up from $19.84 a barrel at year's end to
$26.21 a barrel as of Friday, driven in part by worries that the
worsening situation in the Middle East could lead to an interruption
in energy supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset
Management in New York, believes the biggest risks to the stock
market are "exogenous, tied to the Middle East one way or another.
The Israeli-Palestinian situation is a powder keg. And then there's
Iraq and Saddam Hussein," he said, referring to the possibility of a
U.S. invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Orlando says investors shouldn't underestimate the
market's potential this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Earnings will really explode starting in the third quarter," he
said. There is typically an 18-month lag before the full effect of
Fed interest rate changes is felt in the economy, he noted, and the
Fed began its rate-cutting campaign in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential's Keon likewise thinks the bulls will regain control of
Wall Street this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not heading back to 1995--the boom years of 20% and 30%
gains--but I wouldn't be surprised to see something in the market's
historical range of 10% [for 2002]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first quarter demonstrated that even in a struggling market,
as measured by broad indexes, there can be plenty of stocks that do
well. That puts the onus on mutual fund managers to earn their fees
by picking well, as opposed to buying just about anything and hoping
that a rising tide will lift all boats.</TE>
<TE>   The funds shown in the charts on this page were the biggest
gainers in their categories in the first quarter, which suggests that
they had what Wall Street wanted in the quarter (though past
performance, of course, is no guarantee of future results).</TE>
<TE>   Many investment strategists say consumer-related stocks are likely
to continue to fare well, which is typical in times of economic
recovery. Investors can draw a parallel with 1981-82, a recession in
which consumer spending also hung tough, Keon said. Despite the lack
of a breather, spending accelerated coming out of that downturn, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wealth transfer through inheritances, a dynamic fueled by the
1990s stock market boom, continues to boost consumer spending, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Keon suggests investors own a broad spectrum of stocks that can
benefit from a recovery. Examples from his firm's recommended list
include such names as medical-products giant Johnson &amp; Johnson
(ticker symbol: JNJ), retailer Target Corp. (TGT) and technology
names such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC).</TE>
<TE>   Orlando said home builders and companies tied to the housing
sector are well-positioned for 2002, despite their heady advance
since September. The housing sector shows few signs of weakening,
reflecting many Americans' belief that homes still are among the best
investments today.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, home builders' shares sell for about eight times
analysts' earnings-per-share estimates for 2003, Orlando said.
Historically the sector reaches its peak valuation at a P/E that is
about half the broad market's P/E. If that holds true this time, the
builders' stocks could rise to a P/E of about 11 based on 2003
earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Builders Lennar Corp. (LEN), Centex Corp. (CTX), KB Home (KBH) and
Pulte Homes Inc. (PHM) are highly rated by Value Line for their
12-month appreciation potential, and Orlando said he also likes
housing-related companies such as carpet maker Mohawk Industries Inc.
(MHK), appliance maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) and retailers Lowe's
Cos. (LOW) and Home Depot Inc. (HD).</TE>
<TE>   Lehman's Applegate said investment managers such as State Street
Corp. (STT) and Citigroup Inc. (C) could benefit from an economic
pickup, along with consumer-related stocks such as auto parts maker
BorgWarner Inc. (BWA).</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks also may continue to outperform their bigger
brethren, as they have for the last two years, strategists say.
That's what happened after the 1974 recession, Keon noted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Analysts Favor Small- and Mid-Caps</TE>
<TE>   Current fundamentals also appear to favor small- and mid-cap
stocks over blue chips, Merrill's Doll said. On the whole, analysts
forecast more vibrant profit growth from smaller companies this year.
That makes sense, Doll said, because the fortunes of smaller
companies tend to be more closely linked to the economy's swings,
given that the firms often are "further along in the supply chain" or
make niche products whose sales benefit from economic strength.</TE>
<TE>   But in the battered technology sector, usually a beneficiary of an
economic turnaround, prospects are murky at best.</TE>
<TE>   Although consumer spending probably will hold up, Keon said, the
sharp slowdown in business spending may linger, taking a further toll
on tech and telecom companies. He expects business spending to start
recovering by the fourth quarter, however, with "a new wave of
capital spending" coming in 2003 as the recovery gains traction.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for caution on tech shares is that the stocks'
valuations quickly became expensive again with the fourth-quarter
rally, Applegate said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of computer networker Cisco Systems (CSCO), at $16.15 on
Friday, are priced at 35 times analysts' average earnings estimate of
47 cents a share for the fiscal year ending in July 2003, according
to earnings-tracker Thomson Financial/IBES.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco--which rallied from $12 in September to $21 in January, then
fell as low as $14.24 by late February--may be a good example of what
investors will face in 2002, some pros say: a market best suited for
traders, and likely to test the patience of long-term investors.</TE>
<TE>   Doll said 2002 could be "a year of incredibly frustrating
rotation" as investors search for market leadership. In a volatile
market, the "buy-low/sell-high approach" can produce bigger gains
than buy-and-hold, Doll said.</TE>
<TE>   Although playing the trading game always looks easier in
retrospect, more investors may have to be willing to part with shares
that have scored big gains in favor of issues that have potential but
haven't yet begun to move, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Doll said he has taken some profits in consumer-related stocks
such as Nike Inc. (NKE) and Whirlpool, for example, which both
climbed more than 50% in the last 12 months, and added to financial
and energy holdings on recent dips.</TE>

<LD>The bear market of the last two years slammed many stock portfolios,
and more than a few stock pickers' reputations.</LD>
<LD>   But the rough times on Wall Street also brought new stars to light
in the mutual fund business. Some conservative stock fund managers
who sweat the fundamentals have produced superior performance for
their shareholders since the market's bubble burst in spring 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Many of these managers still are little known, but they are
gaining attention--and cash from investors looking for funds that may
continue to lead in a market environment that is much different from
the wild times of the late-1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a look at five stock funds that either registered gains or
lost far less than their average peer during 2000, 2001 and again in
this year's first quarter, and whose longer-term records also are
strong:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hibler,  Robert Zagunis,  Jensen Fund  (Large-Cap Growth)</TE>
<TE>   Hibler has been aboard since the Portland, Ore.-based fund's 1992
inception; Zagunis joined in 1993. The fund--whose management team
also includes Val Jensen, David Davies and Robert Millen--gained 20%
in 2000 and was flat in 2001, whipping the average large-cap growth
fund both years. In the first quarter it rose 3.3% while its average
peer fell 2.7%, according to fund-tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts at Morningstar say the $285-million-asset fund offers a
"tamer take on growth investing."</TE>
<TE>   Zagunis explains the fund's mission as a search for "the best
businesses in the best sectors, regardless of their size--the
companies that have a sustained competitive advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The fund starts by screening for companies that have recorded
returns on equity of at least 15% in each of the last 10 years,
winnowing the universe of about 10,000 public companies to about 120.</TE>
<TE>   After assessing the quality of management and the business
prospects at each of those survivors, the firm trims its list to
about 50 companies, then buys only those that sell for 60% or less of
the team's estimate of fair value.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a concentrated fund with about 25 holdings, most of
them currently large companies. "With our style, we tend to end up
with companies that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their industry," Hibler
said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's approach keeps it away from newer companies and those
in heavily cyclical industries such as manufacturing, whose fortunes
sway with the economy.</TE>
<TE>   That approach also has kept the fund out of trouble, the managers
say. "A long record of solid return on equity usually means these
companies have a tradition of survival," Hibler said. "We don't pay
much attention to the economy. We stick to what we know."</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks such as Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. were
good to the fund in the late 1990s, but the Jensen team dumped both
stocks in 2000 when they no longer passed the initial
return-on-equity screen, and both have since plummeted as business in
the tech sector has waned.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, as new money came in from investors, the
Jensen Fund added to top holdings such as credit card issuer MBNA
Corp. (ticker symbol: KRB), financial firm State Street Corp. (STT),
transaction processor Equifax Inc. (EFX), clothing maker Jones
Apparel Group Inc. (JNY), and drug giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Kellner, FMI Common Stock (Mid-Cap Blend)</TE>
<TE>   Kellner has managed the fund (known until recently as FMI Capital
Growth) since 1981, working with co-manager Patrick English since
1997. The Milwaukee-based fund gained 19.1% in 2000 and 18.6% in
2001, trouncing the average mid-cap blend fund (blend meaning a mix
of "growth" and "value" shares) both years. In the first quarter it
rose 5.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, according to Kellner: "We try to buy good businesses
with strong management and fair, if not cheap, prices."</TE>
<TE>   Often that leads the $56-million fund to companies experiencing
temporary difficulties, an investing approach that requires patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to hold a stock for two to five years," Kellner
said. According to Morningstar, the fund's annual portfolio turnover
rate of 47% is less than half the fund industry's average.</TE>
<TE>   Kellner believes the small- and mid-cap stocks the fund tends to
favor are still the most attractive segment of the market, but less
dramatically so than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's portfolio trades for an average price-to-earnings ratio
of about 17 based on FMI's earnings estimates for 2002. Two years ago
the fund traded for about 13 times estimated earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, by comparison, the large-cap Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
trades for about 23 times this year's earnings estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Kellner and English, who focus on "depth and quality of
management" as well as valuations, try to meet with executives from
every company in the portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business 32 years, and you can kind of tell
who's giving you the straight stuff and who's giving you a song and
dance," Kellner said.</TE>
<TE>   The fund seeks to limit risk by focusing on companies with
recurring revenue streams and stable products--if not a lot of
sizzle.</TE>
<TE>   Along those lines, in the first quarter FMI Common Stock added to
top holdings such as waste hauler Republic Services Inc. (RSG);
insurance holding company Old Republic International Corp. (ORI); and
uniform rental firm G&amp;K Services Inc. (GKSRA).</TE>
<TE>   Republic Services exemplifies the steady revenue idea, Kellner
said. "They pick up your garbage every week. It's a razor-blade type
of business."</TE>
<TE>   The fund remains light on tech and telecom. "In the macro sense,
those industry sectors still have problems to work through and
they're still overvalued," Kellner said. But, "there are always
exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   One of those, he said, is Broadwing Inc. (BRW), which the fund
recently bought at about $6 a share, down from its 52-week high of
$27.40 as telecom stocks have slumped en masse. Kellner estimates
that the former Cincinnati Bell local phone business is worth about
$6 a share, so the fund "essentially got the wireless and broadband
businesses for free."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Knuth, Ed Nicklin, Westport Small Cap (Small-Cap Blend)</TE>
<TE>   Knuth and Nicklin have run the Westport, Conn.-based fund since
its December 1997 inception. It gained 13.6% in 2000, 8.2% in 2001
and 3% in the first quarter--relatively modest numbers compared with
the average small-cap blend fund. Still, Westport Small Cap, which
clobbered its category average in 1998 and 1999, gets five stars from
Morningstar for its longer-term record.</TE>
<TE>   Assets in the fund's retail-class shares total $272 million, but
with nearly $1 billion in total assets between its retail and
institutional shares, Westport Small Cap is likely to close to new
investors within the next month, the managers said.</TE>
<TE>   When prospecting for stocks, the fund managers consider
valuations, but, like the Jensen gang, the Westport duo avoids the
"deep cyclical" companies that often have the cheapest valuations.</TE>
<TE>   "With those companies, even if you're right and the earnings
improve, you don't get any benefit from 'multiple' expansion," Knuth
said, explaining that investors are reluctant to pay a high
"multiple," or P/E ratio, for earnings that clearly are at a cyclical
peak.</TE>
<TE>   Knuth and Nicklin, whose portfolio has a 15% annual turnover rate,
emphasize patience as well.</TE>
<TE>   "A turnaround doesn't happen overnight, although Wall Street often
wants that to happen," Knuth said. "We're willing to buy when there
is little downside because we have a long time frame. This way, much
of the risk has been taken out of the stocks."</TE>
<TE>   The fund managers don't bother with mathematical valuation
screens, Nicklin said, such as looking for stocks with low P/E
ratios.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody does that, so the results are marginal," he said.
"There is no edge."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he and Knuth peruse the newspaper lists of stocks hitting
new 52-week lows, and scour the financial pages looking for company
blowups that could be transitory.</TE>
<TE>   The managers try to be selective, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Most blowups are not good businesses--they were a figment of
somebody's imagination," Knuth said. "It's our job to ferret out the
real businesses."</TE>
<TE>   The managers also like to see a catalyst for improved earnings on
the horizon, Knuth said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, for instance, the fund added
to its holdings in insurance broker Hilb, Rogal &amp; Hamilton Co. (HRH)
as insurance premiums clearly were heading higher.</TE>
<TE>   The fund also bought Saks Inc. (SKS) stock when the shares were
being "thrown out" for about $5 in early October, Knuth said, because
of worries over the flagship store on New York's Fifth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think New York City and Saks were going out of
business," he said. The stock's price now: about $13.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the first quarter the fund added to some of its energy
holdings after natural gas prices dropped sharply, a situation the
fund managers correctly saw as temporary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Herro, Oakmark International (Foreign Stocks)</TE>
<TE>   Herro has managed the fund since 1992; co-manager Michael Welsh
came aboard in 1995. The Chicago-based fund gained 12.5% in 2000 and
lost 5.1% in 2001, comfortably beating the average foreign stock fund
both years. In the first quarter it jumped 11.5%.</TE>
<TE>   As Herro explained the $1-billion fund's approach: "We try to put
together a portfolio of the highest-quality value stocks in the
world. We don't worry too much about what region or industry they're
in, or their weighting in the global indexes."</TE>
<TE>   That company-by-company approach leads to a portfolio whose
performance doesn't necessarily correlate closely with the major
indexes of foreign stock markets' combined performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We view that as a positive, although some people might not,"
Herro said. "We're paid an active management fee. If you want a
global index fund you can get one at Vanguard for one-third the fee."</TE>
<TE>   Herro and Welsh seek companies selling at an estimated 30%
discount to their intrinsic value, and like the other managers
featured in this article, they consider cutting back on those
holdings as they reach fair value.</TE>
<TE>   That discipline generally has protected investors in down markets:
Oakmark International lost 7% in 1998 as its Pacific Rim and Latin
American investments got hammered. But patience paid off as those
holdings rebounded in 1999 and 2000. Even in 1999's tech-dominated
market, the value-oriented fund gained a respectable 39.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Herro said he and Welsh screen for stocks with low
price-to-cash-flow ratios, but also "rely on our intelligence
network" of company managers for ideas. Herro, Welsh and their four
analysts say they visit about 1,000 companies a year, picking the
brains of executives not only about their own business prospects, but
also about competitors or other companies on whose boards they may
sit.</TE>
<TE>   Herro said he also tries to be opportunistic, noting, for example,
that he bought stocks in markets such as Singapore, Australia and
Hong Kong in 1997 and '98 when a series of shocks to the Pacific Rim
sparked a widespread sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's first-quarter purchases included Henkel (U.S. ticker:
HENKY), the German maker of cleaning and cosmetic products; British
pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which Herro said has a
promising pipeline of new products and a strong distribution network;
Pernod-Ricard (PDRDY), the French liquor maker that has expanded its
product line; and Swedish wireless phone equipment maker Ericsson
(ERICY), which has taken steps toward a turnaround, Herro said,
including shedding its money-losing handset division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Plumb, Thompson Plumb Balanced (Stock-and-Bond Mix)</TE>
<TE>   Plumb has managed this Madison, Wis.-based fund since 1987; David
Duchow is the associate portfolio manager. Thompson Plumb Balanced
gained 10.2% in 2000 and 11.1% in 2001, easily beating its average
peer fund both years, and was up 3.7% in this year's first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Like a typical balanced fund, it owns a mix of stocks and bonds,
usually keeping about 65% of assets in stocks, although the
percentage can range from 55% to 70%. The bond side of the portfolio
is expected to reduce the fund's overall volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Plumb looks for stocks of any size that can benefit from a
"catalyst that will change [how investors perceive the company] and
eventually lift the share price." The objective isn't to find
dirt-cheap stocks, he said, but "stocks that will become expensive."</TE>
<TE>   He does that by looking for companies with problems he believes
will be short-lived, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we're successful is that we look ahead over
the next year or even the next three years, not just the next
quarter," Plumb said. "We're not always right, but we minimize risk
by waiting until the concerns are fully reflected in the stock's
price."</TE>
<TE>   As an example, the $107-million fund added significantly to its
stake in hospital operator HealthSouth Corp. (HRC) when the shares
slid from nearly $15 at the start of the year to about $12 recently
on concerns that new government reimbursement rates might crimp
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The fund also added to longtime holding Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) when
that stock dropped from as high as $93 in 2001 to about $58 recently
amid expectations of flat earnings over the next few quarters. Plumb
and Duchow expect the drug firm's profit to accelerate in 2003 as new
products come to market.</TE>
<TE>   Plumb called Merck a "tremendous value" at about 18 times this
year's estimated earnings. Investors have punished the stock because
of concerns about key patent expirations on the horizon, but Merck
"spends $2 billion a year on research and development and we're
confident that that money is not being burned up," Plumb said.</TE>

<HD>Diversifying Investors Turn to Gold Funds</HD>
<DH>Precious metals lead all stock fund categories in the first
quarter. Natural resources and real estate also are among the top
performers.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold-oriented mutual funds combined hold just $2.7 billion in
assets--less than one-tenth of 1% of the total in all stock funds,
according to Morningstar Inc.</LD>
<LD>   But there was nothing puny about the performance of
precious-metals stock mutual funds in the first quarter: They soared
35.6%, on average, leading all stock fund categories.</LD>
<LD>   The average domestic stock fund, by contrast, was essentially flat
in the period, up a minuscule 0.4% as the broad market struggled
after the fourth-quarter's surge.</LD>
<TE>   With precious metals, natural resources funds (up 12.2% on
average) and real estate funds (up 8.1%) among the top-performing
stock mutual fund categories in the quarter, it might seem that
investors are signaling that they fear the re-emergence of inflation.
All three of those sectors are viewed as classic inflation hedges.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and money managers say it may not be inflation fear
that's driving these fund sectors so much as a simple desire by some
investors to better diversify their holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "There is definitely an interest in physical assets in some way,
shape or form," said John Hathaway, manager of the Tocqueville Gold
fund, which rocketed 45.9% in the quarter. "Returns on stocks have
been lousy for a while, so investors are discouraged and looking for
insurance. People always come to gold in difficult markets--it's the
epitome of an alternative asset class."</TE>
<TE>   Gold funds, which have been in an uptrend for the last 12 months,
tend to lure the so-called hot money of active traders when returns
are strong. And because the sector is relatively tiny it doesn't take
much cash to provide a big boost, Hathaway said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also believes the gold sector now is gaining more attention
from serious long-term investors.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1970s everyone thought it was prudent to have 5% of one's
portfolio in gold, whereas now people think it's prudent to have
nothing in gold. But that seems to be changing," Hathaway said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gold Companies' Shares Outperform the Metal</TE>
<TE>   Although gold bullion itself posted only a single-digit rise in
price the first quarter--up 8.5%, to $302.60 an ounce as of March
29--shares of gold mining companies "act like options," tending to
far outperform the metal on the way up and underperform it on the way
down, Hathaway said.</TE>
<TE>   Precious metals funds typically own mining shares, but some also
can invest directly in gold, silver and platinum, or in metals
futures contracts. The funds also may use borrowed money to juice
their bets.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors also contributed to the best quarter for
gold-oriented funds since the fourth quarter of 1993, said Andrew
Clark, analyst at Denver-based fund tracker Lipper Inc. He said gold
investors profited from industry consolidation; Japanese investor
interest amid ongoing weakness in that nation's economy and concerns
over new limits on bank deposit insurance; Middle East tensions; and
the prospect of global economic recovery and its promise of increased
demand for industrial and jewelry use of the metal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite gold's run-up to two-year highs, Hathaway, perhaps not
surprisingly for a gold-fund manager, said he believes it could be in
just the early stages of a multiyear climb. Among his reasons:
"Stocks remain overpriced, and the U.S. dollar is overvalued."</TE>
<TE>   Gold funds are rebounding from a dismal period in the late-1990s.
The average annualized return on gold funds over the last five years
is a negative 4.7%, despite the gains of the last year, according to
Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   As for inflation, though there's little evidence that a general
surge in prices is brewing, could the market be foreshadowing its
return?</TE>
<TE>   It's possible, said Lipper analyst Don Cassidy. "You could make
the case that the market always sees ahead, and maybe it sees
something that nobody else does at the moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But natural resources and real estate funds may have attracted
investors for other fundamental reasons in the quarter, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Natural resources funds posted their first back-to-back
double-digit quarterly gains since 1980, profiting from a spike in
crude oil prices. The escalating Middle East conflict continues to
propel oil prices, Cassidy noted.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate funds, which own shares of real estate investment
trusts, remained strong as investors were attracted to the sector's
seemingly sound earnings prospects, reasonable valuations and high
dividend yields.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate shares also tend to have little performance
correlation with the stock market overall, so the sector has
benefited from increased attention to portfolio diversification by
investors who fear Wall Street's rebound since Sept.21 may not be
long-lasting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Highlights in Other Fund Sectors</TE>
<TE>   Among other fund-sector highlights in the first quarter:</TE>
<TE>   * The sizzling small-cap value fund category--up 8.7% in the
quarter and an annualized 20.2% in the last three years--benefited
from a relatively heavy weighting in consumer stocks, such as
homebuilders and restaurant chains, analysts said. Consumer-related
stocks have been among Wall Street's favorites this year as investors
bet that consumer spending will continue to power the economy's
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   A net cash inflow from investors of nearly $20 billion in the last
14 months also has helped boost the small-cap value category, Lipper
said. Value stocks--which typically sell for lower prices relative to
earnings, assets and other measures than the average stock--have led
the market for the last two years, as the crash in once-high-flying
growth shares has turned more investors cautious about stock
valuations.</TE>
<TE>   But the cash infusion into the small-cap value sector has led
several fund firms to close their small-cap value portfolios to new
investors to avoid becoming inundated with more cash than they can
put to good use.</TE>
<TE>   * Among foreign stock funds, optimism about such economies as
South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico in a global economic recovery fueled
gains of 9.7% for Pacific Rim /Asia (excluding Japan) funds and 8.7%
for Latin American funds.</TE>
<TE>   Diversified emerging markets funds surged 11.9%, powered by
bargain hunting as well as the strength of oil and gold stocks in
those countries, Lipper said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Japanese funds rose 2.8% in the quarter and European
funds added 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Overall the average stock fund that invests overseas gained 3.9%,
outperforming the average U.S. stock fund even though the strong
dollar hurt foreign returns for U.S. investors, particularly in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   * Technology funds slumped 7.5% as the sector, which got a hefty
bounce with the market rebounding from its Sept. 21 low through early
January, succumbed to profit-taking. With $55 billion in assets, tech
still is the largest sector fund category, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks' continuing troubles weighed on large-cap growth
funds: That sector's 2.7% loss in the quarter was the worst of any
diversified equity fund category. Tech bellwethers Cisco Systems Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., which have a combined weighting of nearly 6% in
the average large-cap growth fund, both lost ground during the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the quarter's worst-performing sector was
communications. Those funds slumped 16.9%, on average, as corporate
bankruptcies in the overbuilt telecom industry rose further.</TE>
<TE>   * Health-care funds sank 7.7% in the quarter, hurt by a plunge in
many biotech stocks. Investors have become more skeptical about
steeply valued biotech issues amid a stream of Food and Drug
Administration decisions rejecting new drug ideas, according to fund
analysts at New York-based Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>

<HD>Christian Bias Against Israel Has a Resurgence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the author of "At the Entrance
to the Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for God With Christians and
Muslims in the Holy Land" (Morrow, 2001).</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The outrageous invasion of the Church of the Nativity by several
hundred Palestinian gunmen and wanted terrorists is a desecration of
our collective sense of the sacred, similar to Taliban gunmen taking
up positions inside mosques. But with increasing frequency it is
Israel, rather than Yasser Arafat's regime, that Christians choose to
blame.</LD>
<LD>   Using one of the holiest Christian sites as a shield from Israeli
counter-terrorism--and holding priests hostage while shooting at
Israeli soldiers from within the church--is typical of Arafat's
tactics. For the last 18 months, his Tanzim militiamen have taken
over homes in the Christian village of Beit Jala near Bethlehem,
shooting into Israeli homes in the adjacent Jerusalem neighborhood of
Gilo and provoking Israeli retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   Cynically, rather than condemning the Palestinian Authority for
using Beit Jala as a cover from which to terrorize Israeli civilians,
mainline churches have blamed Israel for trying to defend its
citizens. In so doing, the churches only encourage the Tanzim:
Evoking Christian outrage against Israel is one reason why they chose
Beit Jala in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   The Christian-Jewish dialogue is one of the great movements of
reconciliation of our time, healing two millenniums of pathological
estrangement between two sister faiths. Jewish organizations have
often been grudging in their recognition of the remarkable
theological changes toward the Jewish people undertaken by Christian
denominations, especially the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, those of us within the Jewish community who have argued
for a more positive Jewish attitude to Christianity have begun to
sense a new receptivity toward dialogue. Yet that precious dialogue
is now being threatened by a one-sided Christian approach to the
Middle East conflict.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for mainline churches to reconsider their anti-Israel
bias, which undermines the credibility of Jewish proponents of
dialogue and jeopardizes our historic reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   On the face of it, an anti-Israel stance among liberal Christian
churches is understandable. The natural tendency of Jesus' followers,
after all, is to side with the underdog. And in this conflict, the
underdog seems to be the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   We Israelis, though, are convinced that we're the underdog. That's
because Israel doesn't only confront relatively powerless
Palestinians but 22 Arab dictatorships, some armed with
unconventional weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do most Israelis believe anymore that the Palestinians' goal
is limited to a state in the West Bank and Gaza--which was Arafat's
for the asking. Instead, we're convinced that this is a war against
the existence of a Jewish state in any borders.</TE>
<TE>   Yet mainline churches continue to ignore Israeli fears and offer
simplistic judgments. An example: There was a recent uproar when
Israeli soldiers fired upon Palestinian ambulances that refused to
stop at checkpoints, with tragic results. Some church leaders accused
the Jewish state of crimes against humanity, ignoring Israel's
insistence that Palestinian ambulances are sometimes used as a cover
for transporting terrorists and weapons. Then, on March 27, Israeli
soldiers stopped an ambulance on its way from Ramallah to Jerusalem
and found 10 kilos of explosives hidden under a child lying on a
stretcher. What did these Christian critics say then? Nothing; just
silence.</TE>
<TE>   Like any country, Israel shouldn't be immune from criticism. But
in their obsessive attacks on Israel, some churches are inadvertently
reawakening old anti-Semitic instincts that, since the Holocaust,
much of Christianity has tried to uproot.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an Episcopalian church in Scotland, seeking to
express solidarity with the Palestinians, has just unveiled a
painting showing a crucified Jesus flanked by Roman and Israeli
soldiers. Such an image deliberately plays to historical Christian
accusations against Jews, holding them responsible for the death of
Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   And where was the Christian outrage over the massacre of 26 Jews
at a Passover Seder? It was a Seder, after all, that was Jesus' last
supper.</TE>
<TE>   Christian sympathy for Arafat--who told Al Jazeera TV that he
hopes to die a martyr like the suicide bomber at the Passover
massacre--is not only morally perverse but self-defeating. Even as
Arafat presents himself as defender of the Holy Land's Christians, he
presides over the erosion of the Christian presence in the West Bank.
Palestinian police routinely ignore extremist Muslim attacks on
Christians. Meanwhile, police have jailed and tortured more than two
dozen Palestinian Pentecostals who distributed New Testaments in West
Bank villages. Scandalously, their fate has been ignored by church
leaders, who reserve their outrage for Israel alone.</TE>

<HD>In Our Schools, Cosmetology Is No Substitute for Calculus</HD>
<DH>All kids deserve college prep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENETHIA HUDLEY-HAYES</AU>
<BD>Genethia Hudley-Hayes is a member of the Los Angeles
Unified School District board.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a time when some students are prepared to become doctors,
lawyers and scientists and others are trained to cut their hair and
be their secretaries.</LD>
<LD>   This inequitable method of educating children happens today in
school districts across the country, including Los Angeles Unified.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of Los Angeles high school students are channeled into
vocational education classes such as cosmetology, office work, floor
covering, bank telling and auto shop because there is not enough room
in academic courses. In many cases, the students don't learn until it
is too late that the vocational classes can hurt their chances of
going to college.</LD>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with students developing employable skills,
nor is there anything wrong with being a mechanic or a secretary.
What is wrong, however, is when a school system decides any student's
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that there are six cosmetology classes and no advanced
mathematics classes at overcrowded Fremont High School in
South-Central Los Angeles doesn't necessarily mean that 150 juniors
and seniors want to work in beauty salons. It means that school
officials have decided that students from low-income neighborhoods
need more access to thermal hair-straightening techniques than to
calculus.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, inner-city schools have fewer fully credentialed
teachers than schools in more affluent parts of the district. They
offer fewer Advanced Placement and other college prep courses; they
are more run-down and overcrowded; and they are more likely to be on
a year-round schedule, which research has shown is detrimental to
learning. By expecting so little of our poor students--who largely
are African American or Latino--by denying them the course work and
resources they need to get into college and develop meaningful
careers, we are relegating them to permanent second-class status.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, according to the California Education Department, three
out of four African American students, nearly four out of five Latino
students and more than four out of five students from rural areas
will not be eligible for UC or Cal State schools because they didn't
take the necessary classes.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, help is on the way. California State Senate Bill
1731, introduced by Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), would require
high schools to enroll every student in the college preparatory
course work necessary for access to the UC and Cal State systems
unless after they are advised of all their choices they opt out with
the consent of the school and their parents.</TE>
<TE>   In the past three years, LAUSD has been a leader in the fight for
quality educational opportunities for all students. Three years ago,
we took a controversial stand by mandating that elementary schools
use Open Court or other phonics-based reading programs. Test scores
have since risen dramatically. A year ago, we began a new math
program that expects every student to be ready for algebra by eighth
grade.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we must take a stand again; we must support SB 1731. We who
set educational policy need to believe that each and every child is
capable of learning, and we must provide them all with real
educational opportunities.</TE>

<HD>Bush Points U.S. Aid in the Right Direction</HD>
<DH>Against the common wisdom of his party, he sets the U.S.
back on track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL GRAHAM and MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD> Carol Graham and Michael O'Hanlon, fellows at the
Brookings Institution, are co-authors of "A Half Penny on the Federal
Dollar: The Future of Development Aid" (Brookings, 1997).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as President Richard M. Nixon was able to use his conservative
credentials to fend off critics and go to China, President Bush has
just announced a policy change that Republicans have opposed for
years but that is long overdue.</LD>
<LD>   Starting next year, Bush intends to expand U.S. development aid
for poor countries, eventually reaching $15 billion annually, or
about a 50% increase from current levels. He would channel that
additional assistance to countries that have adopted sound economic
policies.</LD>
<LD>   For years, critics of aid have argued that most assistance to the
developing world is wasted. No one has quarreled with immunizing
children or helping refugees, but many have disputed the notion that
foreign aid can work more generally.</LD>
<TE>   The critics' case was supported by studies that found weak links
between aid flows and growth and by the fact that most of the African
nations and many other countries that have received aid remain mired
in poverty. As a consequence, U.S. foreign aid dropped to the lowest
level of any industrial country, measured as a percentage of gross
domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics have been distorting the record on aid.</TE>
<TE>   Accomplishments in the realm of immunizations and other basic
health and education efforts have been remarkable, as shown by
improved child survival statistics, life expectancy and literacy
rates worldwide, with the exception of a few extremely poor
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The same studies that find no general link between aid flows and
growth also find that aid fosters economic growth when given to
countries with prudent fiscal policy, open trade regimes, sound
institutions and relatively clean government.</TE>
<TE>   Aid is not a huge drain on the U.S. taxpayer. Half a penny of each
federal dollar is spent on foreign assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Sept. 11 illustrated that the fate of people in poor
countries does matter to U.S. citizens. Granted, neither the Sept. 11
hijackers nor the top leaders of Al Qaeda were poor. But many Al
Qaeda recruits are among the disenfranchised and unemployed of their
societies. And Al Qaeda has used the territories of failed states
such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Sierra Leone for its training bases,
weapons production facilities, safe havens and sources of illicit
income.</TE>
<TE>   Aid alone cannot turn these societies around overnight. It can,
however, help.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of aid counter that international capital markets, which
have greatly increased the resources available to developing
countries in recent years, now play the role that aid used to--making
official assistance unnecessary. That argument ignores the fact that
95% of all private capital going to the developing world flows to 20
countries. The other 150 or so, including most of the world's poorest
nations, share the remaining 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that high-profile aid programs to advance Mideast and
Balkan peace efforts, secure Russia's nuclear weapons or help
Colombia wage the drug war remain strong and that no additional
increases in aid are necessary. Yet these programs have taken the
lion's share of our assistance funds while most other programs have
been neglected.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the linkages between poverty and terrorism,
persistent poverty is usually accompanied by other worrisome trends,
such as unchecked population growth and worsening long-term
challenges to the world's environment and resources, as well as human
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing these concerns serves moral, economic and environmental
priorities as well as American security interests.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's work is far from done, he has made one of the most
important pronouncements on foreign aid by a U.S. president in more
than 20 years, pointing U.S. policy in exactly the right direction.</TE>

<LD>In Fidel Castro's Cuba, human rights violations are egregious. Since
taking power in 1959, the dictator has stifled freedom of expression,
association and assembly. The justice system is an appendix of the
so-called revolutionary regime. The island is devoid of democratic
institutions.</LD>
<LD>   For these reasons, the United Nations Human Rights Commission,
based in Geneva, has voted to condemn the Castro government in 12 of
the past 13 years. These resolutions have been sponsored by either
the United States or the Czech Republic with encouragement from
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Last year the U.S. was thrown out of the Human Rights Commission,
leaving open the question of who will sponsor the resolution when the
body votes this month. Representatives of Libya, Venezuela, China and
Saudi Arabia routinely try, usually without much success, to shield
the abuses of the Cuban leader by voting against the U.N. resolution.
Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica, Britain, Guatemala, Italy, Norway,
Spain and Uruguay are among the nations that have shown their
commitment to human rights and democracy and voted to condemn the
Castro regime. But none have had the nerve to sponsor the resolution.
Now's the perfect time for a Latin American country--or maybe
Canada--to break from the cowering pack and do it.</LD>
<TE>   This symbolic annual act has special significance in this
hemisphere. Following many setbacks and lots of caution, Latin
America's nations have embraced democratic values. They have opened
their economies and adopted the defense of human rights as a
cornerstone of their domestic and international policies.</TE>
<TE>   For two years the Castro regime has conducted a relentless
campaign to dissuade countries from pursuing the defense of human
rights for Cubans. In an attack against Mexico--historically Cuba's
most faithful ally--Castro's state-sponsored publication Granma
threatened to disclose embarrassing information about Mexico's
foreign minister if that nation pushed the rights issue.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to confront this buffoonish bullying by the region's
only remaining dictator is for someone in the hemisphere--Canadian,
Argentine, Costa Rican, Peruvian, Uruguayan or, most appropriately,
Mexican--to stand up and sponsor this year's resolution condemning
Cuba's human rights violations.</TE>

<LD>When Congress created the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains
National Monument in 2000, marble bathrooms and four-car garages
probably weren't part of the vision. Yet that's exactly what's being
built inside the desert wilderness near Palm Springs, on land that
federal park officials had hoped to acquire.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, our nation's special places are under siege. At Valley
Forge National Historic Park outside Philadelphia, where George
Washington spent a grueling winter with his troops, local residents
spent this past winter beating back plans to build 62 large houses.
Private landowners and corporations hold title to more than 4.3
million acres within the other national parks and monuments and
millions more just outside them. Most acquired their titles before
Congress declared the surrounding lands public and were content to
maintain them in a wilderness state. Now the lure of a million-dollar
view tempts many to plan luxury resorts, mini-mansion tracts or just
one-of-a-kind retirement hideaways. In many preserves and parks, the
bulldozers have already rumbled in to break ground.</LD>
<TE>   It's not enough for Congress to draw a green line on a map and
consider its park-creating job done. Parkland managers need more
tools to block future development and acquire all the land within
park boundaries. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund was set
up to do that. Created in 1964, the fund is the depository for
revenues from federal oil and gas leases. Congress originally
directed that these royalties go toward buying parkland, yet for many
years Congress has raided that fund for other purposes.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's budget starts to make amends. However, for
example, the $1.5 million he has requested for next year to buy the
so-called inholdings at the Mojave National Preserve is far short of
the need. We hope that Bush and Congress are much more forthcoming
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials have two other points of leverage. They can tempt
would-be developers to swap their parkland holdings for acreage
outside. And as a last resort to block earth movers and construction
crews, the National Park Service has the right--subject, with good
reason, to strict congressional limits--to take property under the
power of eminent domain. Neither the Bureau of Land Management nor
the National Forest Service has this power. But since far more of the
threatened parkland is managed by these agencies than by the National
Park Service, they should be granted such authority.</TE>
<TE>   Public money bought the nation's parks and wilderness areas to
preserve history or nature and offer refuge. It hardly seems fair
that private owners with plans for dream homes should get to trample
the heritage and spoil the serenity.</TE>

<LD>Although our hot-tub and carwash culture takes the stuff for granted,
water is a life-and-death matter in California. Yet lowly toilets
consume about 25% of all indoor water use in the state. Since 1992,
federal codes have required that all new toilets be the low-flow
variety, using 1.6 gallons per flush, compared with 3.5 gallons for
the old ones. Over the years, builders have installed the water
savers in new and remodeled homes. But millions of older homes
continue to waste tens of millions of gallons a day with high-flow
toilets.</LD>
<LD>   Back in 1991, the Legislature killed a prescient bill to require
that the old toilets be replaced with low-flow models when a house
changed ownership. Now, in times of much shorter water supplies, the
measure has resurfaced as AB 2734, by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura) and sponsored by the East Bay Municipal Utility District
and the Natural Resources Defense Council, with support from the San
Diego County Water Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Californians already must retrofit hot water heaters with
earthquake safety straps and smoke alarms at the time of sale. It
only makes sense to have a similar rule requiring low-flow toilets
because the change after 10 years would save an estimated 350,000
acre-feet annually: enough to fill more than 22 billion of those
five-gallon water cooler jugs, enough to meet the total household
needs of about 700,000 families, enough to take care of half the
total water use of Los Angeles.The measure would also provide (if a
future bond comes up with the money) a sales tax break to buyers of
water-conserving clothes washers, require use of water-stingy shower
heads and demand tougher local ordinances governing water use in
large landscaping projects, saving an additional 250,000 acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which faces its first committee hearing Tuesday, has
broad support but is running into a buzz saw of opposition from real
estate interests. They claim that the toilet measure would lock
moderate-income families out of the housing market. The new toilets
cost about $100 and a homeowner or handyman can easily install one. A
couple of new toilets in a $150,000-$200,000 house do not seem an
onerous burden. The city of Los Angeles has had the toilet retrofit
requirement since 1999 and housing sales here seem to be doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, lawmakers who ignore the real estate industry's false
alarms will be doing it a favor. The need for water is a human
absolute, a biological imperative. The state expects 15 million new
residents by 2020, and if there's not enough water to sustain them,
the housing market too will dry up. The Legislature should pass this
overdue bill, and Gov. Gray Davis should gladly sign it as an
insurance policy against future drought and shortages.</TE>

<LD>In "Safety Is Still On Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction"
(Commentary, April 4), Avigdor Haselkorn suggests that Saddam Hussein
might use Palestinian suicide bombers to deliver his weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq is surrounded by tremendous U.S. military power, and
Baghdad's use of weapons of mass destruction (if it has any) against
any other country would be suicide. That was not always the case. The
United States did little to deter Baghdad's use of weapons of mass
destruction against neighboring Iran and Iraqi Kurds in the 1980s.
And when Iraqi forces massed on Kuwait's border in preparation to
invade, the U.S. was ambivalent. On July 25, 1990, days before the
invasion, U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told Hussein, "We have no
opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with
Kuwait."</LD>
<LD>   Today the equation is far different. No one doubts that the U.S.
response to any Iraqi attack would be decisive and overwhelming.
Baghdad is in check. Thus, it is time to put Iraq into perspective.
Even Iraq's neighbors are unconvinced that Baghdad poses a threat.
With Iraq effectively deterred, the Bush administration should work
through the U.N. Security Council to verifiably disarm Iraq and lift
the economic sanctions.</LD>

<LD>Re "White Collars, Black Hats," Commentary, April 3: Bravo, John
Balzar! I too find the double standard that society applies to
punishing street crime versus suite crime infuriating. What is even
more maddening is the public's apathy. When will we wake up and do
something about the way white-collar criminals are running roughshod
over hard-working people's lives?</LD>
<LD>   We should be out in the streets protesting with the same patriotic
fervor we displayed after Sept. 11. America's success is due to the
"ordinary" people who have invested their hard work and effort, not
the fat cats who have simply invested their money in the stock
market! The lack of ethics and accountability among those who occupy
the upper echelons of big business is every bit as threatening to the
welfare of this society as any threat from abroad. We need to realize
this and punish corporate lawbreakers as the traitors they are.</LD>

<HD>Governor's Race: Young Voters Have Issues Too</HD>

<LD>Almost every day I read an article regarding the upcoming governor's
race. I am glad to see that Gov. Gray Davis and Bill Simon are out
talking about issues that Californians care about, but as a young
person in this state I feel a bit disenfranchised. I don't feel that
the candidates are addressing the concerns that are facing young
people (ages 18 to 24) today, which could be a huge indicator as to
why young people are not voting.</LD>
<LD>   I think it would be a great idea if, before the November election,
the two candidates squared off for a debate that was moderated by
young people, where young people ask the questions and young people
are able to feel that their concerns are being addressed by our
politicians. This could be a historic time for California and the
nation to really engage young people in voting and the political
process.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Keep Pakistan on Target," editorial, April 3: The question why it
took so long to apprehend Abu Zubeida betrays a lack of basic
understanding about the very nature of counter-terrorism operations.
They require the collection of extensive intelligence information,
meticulous planning and smooth execution--necessarily a
time-consuming exercise. That Osama bin Laden and the senior Al Qaeda
and Taliban leaders are still to be apprehended, despite the
deployment of all necessary military and intelligence resources by
the coalition, proves how difficult and time-consuming this
enterprise is.</LD>
<LD>   Those familiar with the porous nature of the Pakistan-Afghanistan
border recognize how difficult it is to completely seal it. Our armed
forces and police are making their best efforts to prevent any
cross-border movement, a fact underscored by the arrest of several Al
Qaeda and Taliban elements.</LD>
<LD>   The conclusion that the government may have released some of the
Islamist detainees to curry favor with religious parties is
ridiculous. These parties have no clout. They have never managed to
get more than 5% of the popular vote. Only those persons against whom
no criminal charges were proved have been released. Our campaign
against extremism must remain within the bounds of the rule of law
and due process.</LD>
<TE>   Your negative characterization of the Inter-Services Intelligence
agency also runs contrary to facts. This agency has played a pivotal
role in helping the U.S. achieve the successes that it has in the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, President Pervez Musharraf has taken all his strategic
decisions in keeping with Pakistan's supreme interests. No one needs
to remind us what our "best interests" are.</TE>

<LD>Re "Antidote to the Liberal Monotone: Blogging," Commentary, April 4:
Where did Norah Vincent get the idea that I think "blogging" is a bad
idea? I think Andrew Sullivan's blogging is a bad idea. I can't
imagine many people care about his bathroom troubles and his dinner
parties. But are exploding toilets and "stomach evacuations" really
what blogging is about? A worthwhile blog is one that sticks to
topics that are likely to be of interest to significant numbers of
people and treats them intelligently and (relatively) responsibly. I
hold no brief for the "credentialed" media. I just think it's a good
idea for everybody to keep their egos in check. Editors help most
writers do that, and they also help them find points they've missed.
If bloggers can do all that for themselves, I say, "Blog on."</LD>
<LD>   I.F. Stone might be considered the first blogger. He was wrong
about a lot of things, but I suggest his work to all as a model of
thoughtful, committed, independent reporting and commentary: a
blogger forefather, in other words.</LD>

<TE>   New York City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No doubt the rise of cable news and the Internet helps account for
the decline of the "respectable" mainstream media. But that decline
is also self-inflicted.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk of diversity, liberal orthodoxy overwhelmingly
prevails in newsroom culture. Maybe not to the point of being a
monotone--you did, after all, print Vincent's piece. Still, Mensa
membership is hardly required to accurately predict who will be
termed an "activist" and who will be labeled an "extremist."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Ahmanson Ranch Mired in Political Tug of War," April 4: The real
problem with the Ahmanson Ranch development is the added traffic to
the 101 Freeway. L.A. may have a housing shortage, but we have the
worst traffic congestion in the world! Do we have the worst housing
shortage in the world? Development after new housing development,
there are no freeway expansions or new mass transit systems. The
builders keep making record profits, the politicians keep getting new
property tax revenues (added property taxes), and the residents keep
getting the shaft--suffering through increasingly worse traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Who is responsible for maintaining a balance between traffic and
housing? Apparently no one in our government.</LD>

<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A recent article about the 101 Freeway indicated that the San
Fernando Valley population is going to grow by 35% in the next 20
years. That's about 550,000 people. In view of this growth, tell me
why the Ahmanson Ranch development is going to create a "traffic
nightmare"?</TE>
<TE>   I have done development. I have two engineering degrees and am a
registered professional engineer in California.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Reiner and Martin Sheen are absolutely wonderful actors.
However, they are not knowledgeable on real estate development and
have no place in the debate.</TE>

<TE>   Are the neighbors of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch project truly
committed to the environment? This is difficult to believe when
observing the carpools at schools in the West Valley--each jammed
with hundreds of "must have" SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   When a 5,000-pound, 13-mile-per-gallon behemoth is used to
transport 120 pounds worth of children and backpacks, one can't help
but wonder if motivations other than "concern for the environment"
are at play here.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, Cardinal Roger Mahony said once again that there's no correlation
between celibacy and child abuse ("Mahony Says Victims' Requests Led
to Secrecy," April 3). If there are not many research studies made,
it is because there has not been any interest placed on the issue.
When we look at the inmate population in state prisons, one can see
that the incidence of rapes and sexual abuse among inmates is very
high. "Kandahar's Lightly Veiled Homosexual Habits" (April 3) further
proves this misconception. Depriving priests of marrying has led to a
high price paid by many victims. It's about time for the Roman
Catholic Church to move away from such dangerous so-called
"traditions."</LD>
<LD>   It is very obvious to me that depriving priests of this God-given
gift will make a person, by nature a sexual being, fulfill his
desires in some other way.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Victims Crushed in a Priestly Silence," April 3: Is there any
concern about balance in Steve Lopez's columns? Or is he trying to
pull off the Promethean task of "burying" the Catholic Church? We all
know by now that there are some bad priests. Would he care to write
anything about some good priests? Or would this lack newsworthiness?
The challenge has been extended.</TE>

<LD>If the Rev. Franklin Graham's defense of his father's anti-Semitic
remarks were correctly reported, the son has apparently inherited his
once-esteemed father's foot-in-mouth disease ("Billy Graham Remarks
Misconstrued, Son Says," April 4). As if getting caught in the act of
Jew-bashing wasn't bad enough, now Franklin tells us the following:</LD>
<LD>   Billy wasn't talking about all Jews, just those nasty, nefarious
ones who controlled the media (obviously to the detriment of the
Christian majority). I'll bet some of his best friends are Jewish
too.</LD>
<LD>   Billy's remarks were taken out of context. I'd like to know in
what context those anti-Semitic canards could be acceptable.</LD>
<TE>   Billy is really the victim because he thought his spurious remarks
were said in private and his "confidence was broken." Poor guy--he
got caught!</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Graham does his father no service by suggesting that his
anti-Semitic comments were either justified or not so bad. Shame on
both father and son.</TE>

<DH>Telecom: Moves by Genuity Solutions, Verizon Global
Networks follow bankruptcy warning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. said Sunday that Verizon Global
Networks and Genuity Solutions terminated their fiber-optic
agreements with the company.</LD>
<LD>   In a news release, Metromedia said Verizon Global has paid
$235million under a $350-million contract to lease fiber-optic
capacity. Genuity Solutions already had paid $140 million of a
similar contract worth $200 million.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at parent companies Verizon Communications Inc. and
Genuity Inc. weren't immediately available to comment on the matter
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Metromedia said Verizon is "continuing to engage in discussions"
concerning its relationship with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Metromedia warned in mid-March that it may file for bankruptcy if
it can't restructure its debt.</TE>
<TE>   In October, it avoided a bankruptcy filing by securing $611
million in lender and vendor financing.</TE>
<TE>   The telecom company said March 18 that it may default on the $975
million of convertible notes it issued to Verizon Communications in
March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Metromedia said it expects to begin negotiations with debt holders
"shortly" regarding a consensual restructuring of its obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The White Plains, N.Y.-based company moved a step closer to an
expected bankruptcy filing April 1, when it announced that it
defaulted on about $675 million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   The defaults effectively dismantle the $611-million financing
package arranged in October, as a missed payment on one part of the
package led to defaults on the rest.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Wins Ruling on Penske</HD>
<DH>Retail: Judge issues an order preventing the auto service
provider from closing outlets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troubled retailer Kmart Corp. won a temporary restraining order
preventing Penske Auto Centers from shuttering its 563 service
centers over the weekend. The two companies are to return to court
today to determine whether the order will be made permanent.</LD>
<LD>   Penske Auto Centers, which is partly owned by Kmart, had informed
the Troy, Mich.-based retailer Friday that it would shut down all of
its centers beginning Saturday. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Susan
Pierson Sonderby in Chicago issued a last-minute stay on Saturday
preventing Penske from taking any action until a hearing today.</LD>
<LD>   Although the auto centers were not among the retailer's primary
draws, analysts say the closures would almost certainly inflict
further damage on Kmart and its reputation at a time when it is
struggling to survive alongside fellow discounters Target and
Wal-Mart.</LD>
<TE>   "When you look at a Kmart, the last thing you want to do is see
parts of the store shut down," said Richard Giss, a partner at
Deloitte &amp; Touche Retail Service Group. That sends the signal "that
the whole place is getting ready to shut down."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, the
largest filing for a national retailer. Its reorganization has taken
a toll on Penske, as it has on other suppliers. Penske said Kmart
defaulted last month on a $5-million payment owed to Penske when
Penske was forced to shutter 63 auto center locations after Kmart
announced a round of store closings. The centers offer a range of
services, from changing oil to selling batteries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Penske Chief Executive Jim Wheat said the auto centers
still open were "strong and performing well."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said Saturday that it is "in discussions with Penske
regarding a mutually acceptable plan for the future of the auto
centers that would protect the interests of the centers' customers."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Penske officials, contacted late Saturday, called Kmart's
statement misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Penske Chairman Richard Peters said that during a March 27
meeting, Kmart Chief Operating Officer Julian Day "informed us that
Kmart had determined through their research that the auto centers
provided no value to its core business."</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart was therefore unwilling to provide any support to PAC and
agreed that the best course of action was to close PAC," Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart officials were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart owns 36% of Penske Auto Centers; the rest is controlled by a
unit of Troy, Mich.-based Penske Corp., which purchased the
auto-service business from Kmart in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said Penske is just one of a number of companies hurt by
Kmart's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Dorel Industries, a maker of children's car seats, took a one-time
charge of 5 cents per share in its last quarter from its Kmart
losses, and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. has reduced its
profit projections for 2002 because of Kmart's store closures.</TE>
<TE>   But Kmart won Bankruptcy Court approval to pay certain suppliers,
including Martha Stewart, to continue shipments of merchandise the
retailer deemed essential.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's stock closed at $1.28, down 9 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<LD>Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on the accelerated
pace of Jon Gruden's first practice Friday as the new coach of the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers: "It was loud, and it was fast. Chucky was
playing at fast-forward, running his players from drill to drill,
play to play, as if he were intent on cramming three hours worth of
practice into two hours on the field ...</LD>
<LD>   "It was like a punk band playing instruments as fast as possible,
and every coach seemed to have something loud to say to somebody
along the way."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Tiger Woods won the Masters last year and in 1997.
What is his worst finish in the tournament in five professional
appearances?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All action, no talk: Chicago Cub Manager Don Baylor commenting to
Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune on Sammy Sosa: "Until you're on
the inside, you don't see how he goes about his job every day. If he
plays to the crowd, so did Muhammad Ali. But he backs it up. He
doesn't talk about it. He's not that big, loud voice in the
clubhouse. He does his actions on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "If he strikes out, he's that much more determined the next time.
He doesn't pout. He's back up there grinding it out the next at-bat.
And that's hard to find."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rioting etiquette: The joyful rioting in Maryland that followed
the Terrapins' victory in the NCAA championship game is nothing new
in College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   After a November football game, another Maryland riot led the
school's humor magazine to run a flippant article titled, "Campus
rioting tips."</TE>
<TE>   The advice included: "When you're tearing down traffic signs, make
sure to leave a few behind. Otherwise, how will the police find their
way to the riot site?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Make it more: Fred Mitchell in the Chicago Tribune: "Harry Caray's
restaurants, located in Chicago and Rosemont, will give $1 million to
a randomly selected fan if the Cubs win it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, the current Las Vegas odds of the Cubs winning the
World Series are better than usual at 6-1, according to Caesar's
Palace spokesman Lou D'Amico."</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, so the odds should be
more prohibitive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fading out? Hubert Mizell in the St. Petersburg Times: "Maybe he's
dreaming there might be one more Wimbledon championship in his
superlative but fading tennis physique, but you wonder how Pete
Sampras, even being a low-ego chap, copes with being a borderline
has-been who seldom contends anymore and regularly gets kicked around
by cocky tour kids who have not won a Grand Slam [event]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1969, four expansion teams--Kansas
City, Seattle, Montreal and San Diego--recorded opening-day
victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Woods finished tied for 18th in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News asks if
Barry Bonds is fated to replace Chicago Cub legend Ernie Banks as the
greatest player never to have made it to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Said Banks: "If you haven't played in the World Series, after you
leave the game, and you don't have that chance again ... it is vital.
It took me five years to stop dreaming about being in the World
Series."</TE>

<HD>Drossin Feeling on Top of World</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Deena Drossin was impressed when Lornah Kiplagat of Kenya blazed
through the first half-mile of Sunday's Carlsbad 5,000 women's
invitational road race.</LD>
<LD>   "She went out like a storm," Drossin said. "She went out really
hard, which was good.</LD>
<LD>   "But I didn't want her to get too far ahead. In the 5K, it's
crucial not to let competitors get too far ahead. I kept her in sight
and slowly reeled her in."</LD>
<TE>   Drossin also reeled in a world record, adding another laurel to
her increasingly impressive resume.</TE>
<TE>   Drossin, who grew up in Agoura Hills and lives in Mammoth Lakes,
covered the course in 14 minutes 54 seconds, cutting three seconds
off the world record set a year ago in London by Paula Radcliffe of
Britain. She finished 25 seconds ahead of the runner-up, 17-year-old
Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, in becoming the first American woman to
set a world record in the 5,000 since PattiSue Plumer was timed in
15:31 at Carlsbad in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most exciting thing I can ask for today," said Drossin,
who earned a $10,000 bonus for setting a world record.</TE>
<TE>   She had many reasons to be excited.</TE>
<TE>   While the top 10 times in the men's race were slower than the top
10 last year, the top 10 women's times were faster than a year ago.
That's a testament to the quality and depth of a field that also
included Sydney Olympic 5,000 silver medalist Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland and naturalized American Colleen De Reuck, who was third at
last month's world cross-country championships behind Radcliffe and
Drossin.</TE>
<TE>   Two other young Ethiopians, Werknesh Kidane and Eyerusalem Kuma,
finished third and fourth, in 15:20 and 15:23, respectively. De Reuck
was fifth in 15:30, Kathy Butler of Britain was sixth (15:36) and
O'Sullivan seventh in 15:38. The race was O'Sullivan's third in 14
weeks since she gave birth to her second child.</TE>
<TE>   Kiplagat, who had a wrap on her left knee, didn't finish the race.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Kipketer of Kenya, who set the world road record of 13
minutes on the Carlsbad course two years ago and tied it last year,
won in 13:17.</TE>

<DH>Motor sports: Honda rider wins Superbike championship race
that is stopped with four laps remaining after accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four laps from what was to be the end of a 28-lap AMA Chevy Trucks
U.S. Superbike championship race Sunday at California Speedway,
Jeffrey Purk went down and his Suzuki lay in the middle of the track
at the exit of Turn 13. Officials waved the red flag, stopping
riders.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing unusual about that. It happens anywhere a racing accident
becomes a danger to competitors.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time the race was over. Nicky Hayden, who had his Honda
in front by as many as eight seconds, did a wheelie, coasted to a
stop and waved to a puzzled crowd. What about the last four laps?</LD>
<TE>   Rule G5 of the American Motorcyclist Assn. explained it: "Should a
race be stopped in which 80% or more of the total laps have been
completed by the leader, the race will be considered complete and
there will be no restart."</TE>
<TE>   That's not something you'd find in a NASCAR rule book.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, no one was going to catch Hayden, who won the Daytona
200 to start the season and finished third in Saturday's second round
of the 16-race series.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed how different I felt, and the bike felt this
morning, compared to yesterday," Hayden said. "The guys on the crew
worked last night and gave me a bike that felt a lot more
comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the weather helped me too. Today was warmer and the track
was better. After we sat around nearly all day yesterday, I didn't
feel much like racing. Today, on the warmup lap, I felt great."</TE>
<TE>   Kawasaki's Eric Bostrom, defending series champion Mat Mladin, on
a Suzuki, and old-timer Doug Chandler on a Ducati were waging a tense
race for podium positions at the time and Mladin said that "if we had
gone the full 28 laps, Chandler would probably have passed both of
us."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler, a 36-year-old Salinas rider who nearly retired this
year, was six seconds back of Bostrom and the Mladin before closing
the gap to less than a second in three laps just as the red flag
halted proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty confident I would have got both of them," Chandler
said. "I didn't expect to catch them so quickly and I decided to hold
back and wait for the final lap. Eric and Mat began to battle between
themselves so I thought I'd wait until they had nothing left and make
my move. Unfortunately, we were shortchanged."</TE>
<TE>   Hayden, 20, one of three racing brothers from Owensboro, Ky., led
19 of the 24 laps and once he got past Aaron Yates and Mladin, he was
never seriously challenged on the 2.36-mile, 21-turn road course. He
averaged 95.169 mph for the shortened race.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Hayden, Nicky's older brother, capped a big day for the
family when he won the 17-lap Superstock, which had been postponed
from Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's scene was quite a contrast to Saturday's stark
surroundings when Australian Anthony Gobert won the Superbike feature
on a Suzuki after a wild finish over Yates in cold, wet, miserable
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In the 17-lap Supersport final, the results were reversed as Yates
raced home 3.3 seconds ahead of Gobert.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's Superbike race, Gobert got off the line fifth and
raced near the leaders for 10 laps before a blistered tire caused him
to drop off the pace. At the end, he was lapped by the leaders, but
still finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Underwood, a Suzuki rider from Roseburg, Ore., went down on
the third lap of the Superbike feature and was air-lifted to Loma
Linda University Medical Center to be evaluated for a possible head
injury.</TE>

<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>NASCAR, the monolithic organization that has controlled stock car
racing in this country for 54 years, once again is under scrutiny.
And the person challenging it is controversial attorney Johnnie L.
Cochran Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Cochran says he has "in excess of 50 lawyers" ready to examine the
practices of NASCAR. At the center of the charges is the claim that
NASCAR engages in "monopolistic" business practices.</LD>
<LD>   A federal lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of the
shareholders of Speedway Motorsports Inc., the parent company of
Texas Motor Speedway, claims that NASCAR has a monopoly over
stock-car racing by owning the governing body and by having
controlling interest in International Speedway Corp., the company
that operates 13 major auto tracks.</LD>
<TE>   The suit really is aimed at the France family, which owns NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, Texas Motor Speedway is asking for a second racing
date, but it's the means to that end that make this case interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "The big picture really looks like, and smacks of, antitrust,"
Cochran said last week. He had planned to attend Sunday's race at the
glitzy, $250-million Fort Worth facility, but it was postponed
because of rain. "[NASCAR] needs a second look, an outside look."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, who was part of the legal team that gained an acquittal
for O.J. Simpson in his criminal trial, says he's prepared to
initiate legal action that could break up the France dynasty's iron
rule.</TE>
<TE>   "That [breaking up NASCAR/ISC] is the logical end result, and we
have the legal counsel to do it," Cochran said. "In addition, we have
the resolve."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran and his partners have invoked the provisions of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 under which high-profile businesses
have been sued and broken up to one degree or another.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 36 races on the elite Winston Cup tour, 18 are run on ISC
tracks. Of the last four expansion race dates granted by NASCAR,
three have gone to ISC facilities. Of the last five granted, another
date went to California Speedway, which was later acquired by ISC.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Motor Speedway is not owned by ISC and wants a second date.
In fact, if it gets the date, the suit may go away, according to
Cochran. But if the litigation were to go forward, it would lead to a
close examination of the business practices of NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   The France family has declined to comment on the matter. Mike
Helton, NASCAR president, said the company does not comment on active
litigation. Jim Hunter, NASCAR vice president of communications,
called the suit "absolutely without foundation."</TE>
<TE>   According to Samuel Cherry, the Cochran-firm partner who is
supervising the litigation, damages could reach $1 billion. He said
the lack of a second race at Texas has kept the stock price down.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas, on Feb.
13 by Speedway Motorsports shareholder Francis Ferko of Plano, Texas,
lists NASCAR, ISC and Speedway Motorsports (SMI) as defendants. Ferko
has declined to comment and referred all questions to his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   SMI is only a "nominal defendant," according to the suit. SMI was
named so that its executives can be kept informed of all aspects of
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The antitrust allegations illustrate how there is no other remedy
for Speedway Motorsports," Cherry said. "They just can't create a
second event, a NASCAR-formatted race, of their own. It's
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   That's because, according to the filing, "NASCAR has illegally
maintained a monopoly in the market for the provision of the right to
host a premier NASCAR-formatted stock-car race."</TE>
<TE>   The suit further alleges that NASCAR has cornered the market on
the best drivers and teams involved in stock car racing, in part by
creating the Winston Cup points system so that drivers must
participate to win the most lucrative season championship in American
motor racing.</TE>
<TE>   And "NASCAR has deterred drivers and their teams" from competing
in non-NASCAR events, the suit claims, by "[causing] drivers to fear"
that they could be targets of reprisal at NASCAR races, in the form
of fines or other penalties over technical inspection of cars and
driver behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry says he plans to use Bill France Jr.'s comments at a recent
meeting of ISC stock holders to his advantage. France Jr. reportedly
said that ISC was "uniquely positioned to take advantage of the
growth of NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry believes that statement helps prove his case. "Sure they
are [positioned]. That's because of the incestuous relationship that
exists between ISC and NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   Bruton Smith, the SMI chairman who controls six tracks on the
Winston Cup circuit including Texas Motor Speedway, finds himself in
the middle. He sees the suit as having the potential to shake NASCAR
to its roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see that occurring," Smith said. "Anybody who's been in
this [auto racing] as long as I have [nearly 50 years], I think we
all look at NASCAR and ISC as one and the same. Same management, same
ownership, same ol' same ol'."</TE>
<TE>   Smith bought the existent date at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1996 when he purchased half-interest in tiny North
Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway, which by tradition hosted two Cup races a
year. Smith tried to acquire all of the old track, but lost one-half
in the bidding to New Hampshire International Speedway owner Bob
Bahre.</TE>
<TE>   About all the two tycoons could agree on about Wilkesboro was to
shut it down. Smith moved one of the Cup dates to Texas, and Bahre, a
friend and ally of the France family, took the other to create a
second race at New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a quarter of a billion dollars building that big
monster," Smith says of the Texas track. "I think it was perceived by
everybody that that big monster could only make it if we had the two
dates."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR in recent years has awarded only one expansion Cup race a
season to newly constructed tracks, because the Winston Cup schedule
that runs from February through November is already overcrowded.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, and many of his stockholders, have argued for the last five
years that since he bought one date, he is still owed an expansion
date for Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, NASCAR and ISC have met legal challenges with their
own armies of lawyers and have rarely lost.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, however, doesn't view the action as an attempt to destroy
NASCAR racing, but to improve it.</TE>
<TE>   "If it goes far enough," he says, "it's going to be of benefit to
NASCAR [including member drivers and teams] and the public."</TE>

<HD>Johannesburg's Defeat Clouds Tabor's Picture</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Owner's plans aren't clear after leading
Kentucky Derby candidate suffers first loss in eight races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Tabor's weekend had an unsettling start when there was a
mix-up in the turf club about the well-known international horse
owner's Santa Anita Derby day reservations.</LD>
<LD>   Things would get worse. Mayakovsky, the second choice, led going
into the stretch Saturday at Santa Anita, but finished fourth, four
lengths behind Came Home. Then Sunday, Johannesburg, another Kentucky
Derby candidate that runs for Tabor, suffered the first loss of his
career when a 4-year-old filly, Rebelline, beat him by a short head
in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh near Dublin.</LD>
<LD>   With the Kentucky Derby to be run in less than four weeks, those
results left Tabor's plans for Churchill Downs as unclear as his
lunch reservations. The former London racebook owner won the Derby
with his first shot, Thunder Gulch in 1995, but he hasn't finished
better than seventh with five subsequent starters.</LD>
<TE>   Johannesburg's defeat, the first in eight starts for last year's
champion 2-year-old male in North America, probably knocked him out
of the Derby, because the seven-furlong grass race was his first
outing of the year and there isn't time for another prep. But his
trainer, Aidan O'Brien, said he would take more time to decide.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is still up in the air," O'Brien said. "It would have
been [up in the air] even if he had won."</TE>
<TE>   In Castle Gandolfo, O'Brien has another Derby hopeful--not owned
by Tabor--and this colt, who's by Gone West, the sire of Came Home,
helped his chances with a 21/2-length win at a mile Saturday in the
Fosters International Trial at Lingfield Park near London.</TE>
<TE>   A likely scenario is that O'Brien would send Castle Gandolfo, who
won at the Derby distance (11/4 miles) when he was a 2-year-old, to
Churchill Downs and save Johannesburg for the 2000 Guineas, the first
race in England's Triple Crown. The Guineas will be run at Newmarket
May 4, the same day as the Kentucky Derby. If Johannesburg doesn't
show up in Louisville, he would become the 18th consecutive winner of
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile not to win the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gladness, which was run on softer ground than Johannesburg
probably wanted, O'Brien gave the colt a target with Shoal Creek,
another of his horses. Johannesburg, ridden by Mick Kinane and
favored at 2-5, went by Shoal Creek, but then he couldn't hold off
jockey Declan McDonogh riding Rebelline, who carried 136 pounds, 11
more than her rival.</TE>
<TE>   "Johannesburg was fresh and over-raced himself early," O'Brien
said. "He got tired in the last 50 yards and was beaten by a good
filly. The race told us nothing, really."</TE>
<TE>   Nokoma, another horse owned by Tabor, is expected to run Saturday
in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. He'll be a longshot, after running
a badly beaten seventh in the Florida Derby. Other Kentucky Derby
preps Saturday are the Toyota Blue Grass at Keeneland and the
Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. Should Harlan's Holiday, the Florida
Derby winner, also win the Blue Grass, he would solidify his position
as the Derby favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Ken McPeek, who trains Harlan's Holiday, has two other Derby
prospects that ran with mixed results Saturday. His filly, Take
Charge Lady, was a convincing winner of the Ashland at Keeneland, but
Repent, who had won the Louisiana Derby, finished an unthreatening
second to War Emblem in the Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bach, who owns Take Charge Lady and Repent, doesn't seem to
be getting Derby fever over his filly. "She was nominated [for the
Triple Crown] because nobody has a crystal ball," said Bach. "But she
doesn't belong in the Derby."</TE>

<LD>Joey Clanton claimed his second consecutive American Speed Assn.
victory of the season, running away with the TireRack.com 300 at
Irwindale Speedway in front of an announced crowd of 4,222 at the
track's first Sunday race.</LD>
<LD>   "Once in a lifetime you get a car like that," Clanton said.</LD>
<LD>   Clanton held off Gary St. Amant and Kevin Cywinski for a $21,166
first-place prize.</LD>
<TE>   St. Amant was second and Cywinski third, with Reed Sorenson and
Mike Cope rounding out the top five.</TE>
<TE>   Clanton had lapped all but two cars, St. Amant and Cywinski, when
a series-mandated competition caution flag, which comes after 100
laps of green-flag racing, was issued on lap 213.</TE>
<TE>   But the field was set one last time when Tim Taylor, the only
other leader of the race, slid into the wall on Turn 3. On the
restart, St. Amant tried one last time to catch Clanton, but was not
able to reel him in.</TE>

<DH>Colleges: NCAA panel to vote on proposal that would
institute penalties for schools whose athletes fail to advance
academically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sweeping proposal aimed at restoring confidence in college
athletics would, if implemented, empower the NCAA to punish schools
whose athletes do not progress academically by banning the schools'
teams from postseason play.</LD>
<LD>   That's one of several recommendations scheduled to be voted upon
today in Denver by an NCAA management council, the first step toward
possible approval by the NCAA later this year.</LD>
<LD>   "You get too many kids who come into college and are unable to
finish," said Robert Sloan, president of Baylor University and
chairman of the committee that drafted the recommendations. "We are
not acting honorably if we bring in young people, use up their
eligibility, the scholarship money is gone and they don't have a
degree."</LD>
<TE>   The committee was made up of 12 university presidents from six
major athletic conferences--the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big Ten,
Big 12, Pacific 10 and Southeastern. The group has been working on
the recommendations since last summer.</TE>
<TE>   They include proposals to:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the number of required courses high school athletes
need to enter college, from 13 to 16. The committee also wants
admissions departments to in turn place greater emphasis on an
athlete's grade-point average and less on SAT and ACT scores.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sloan: "The NCAA's data shows the GPA in core courses
correlates best with [a student's] academic success in the freshman
year in college." He said an NCAA study shows that a high school
student with a 2.5 GPA and 700 SAT score is more likely to graduate
college than a student with an 820 SAT and 2.0 GPA. "We propose
having a cutoff on GPA at 2.0, but no cutoff score on SAT or ACT."</TE>
<TE>   * Require athletes to accelerate their progress toward a degree to
remain eligible. At present, student-athletes must complete 25% of
their degree work by their third year, 50% by the fourth year and 75%
by the fifth year--necessary in cases of injury or redshirting.
Sloan's committee seeks to raise those standards to 40% by the third
year, 60% by the fourth year and 80% by the fifth year.</TE>
<TE>   * Conduct annual, sport-by-sport evaluations to determine if
student-athletes are on track, and maintain a progress and graduation
rate consistent with the rest of the school's student population.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that do not comply would face sanctions ranging from the
loss of athletic scholarships to a ban on television appearances or
ineligibility for postseason tournaments, Sloan said.</TE>
<TE>   If the committee approves any or all of the recommendations, the
full NCAA legislative body would vote on them in October.</TE>
<TE>   Reform in college athletics has been an agenda item for university
presidents for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate
Athletics denounced the dismal graduation rates of football and
basketball players, the emphasis on television money in football and
basketball and the rising influence of commercial entities such as
sports shoe and apparel companies. The Knight Commission also
recommended punishing institutions that did little to graduate
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Helitzer, a professor of sports administration at Ohio
University, is critical of the Knight report and the recommendations
of Sloan's committee, asserting that such proposals are unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exercise in futility," Helitzer said. "There is no good
reform they can come up with; it's lip service. We drill these kids
on how to shoot baskets. We don't spend a lot of time giving them
geometric proofs."</TE>
<TE>   But Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen praised the proposed reforms as
progress, and predicted they will be approved today and adopted by
the NCAA in October.</TE>

<LD>Larry Dixon continued to set a dominating pace in NHRA Top Fuel
competition, scoring his third victory of the season Sunday in the
SummitRacing.com Nationals at Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon was consistently quick in his dragster and outran Cory
McClenathan in the final round to claim his 19th career victory and
first at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon covered the quarter-mile in 4.639 seconds at 319.29 mph to
cross the finish line in front of McClenathan, who posted a 4.728 at
313.88 in his first final-round appearance since the 2000 season.</LD>
<TE>   "What a great day," Dixon said. "I'm really happy. We had a few
problems early but we figured them out and got it done. This team is
awesome and we are really clicking right now."</TE>
<TE>   He increased his series points lead to 147 over defending champion
Kenny Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Densham earned his third career Funny Car victory in a
photo-finish win over Tommy Johnson Jr. Densham drove his car to a
5.409 at 205.13 to edge Johnson, who clocked a 5.447 at 272.61.</TE>
<TE>   Densham's victory gave some solace to team owner John Force, who
was denied again in his bid to earn his 100th career Funny Car
victory. Force was upset in the second round by Del Worsham.</TE>
<TE>   A daylong rain forced postponement of the Samsung/Radio Shack 500
at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR officials made the call about two hours after the scheduled
start. The 500-mile race will start today at 9 a.m. PDT.</TE>

at a strip club in Phoenix on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's lawyer, Darrell Soll, said the former boxing champion was
at the club early Sunday, but left before there was any
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   A brief police statement said there were "no visible injuries to
either victim" and that Tyson had left the Hiliter Club by the time
officers arrived shortly before 1 a.m.</TE>

<TE>   Former Miami Dolphin receiver O.J. McDuffie says the team lied to
him about the severity of a toe injury that has hobbled him the last
three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   McDuffie, released by the Dolphins partly for salary cap reasons
in February after nine years with the team, contends the injury
worsened when he continued to play with it in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dolphin spokesman Harvey Greene: "We would never do anything
that would jeopardize the health of any of our players."</TE>

<TE>   Washington's leading scorer Doug Wrenn said he will remain at the
school for his junior season rather than make himself available for
the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   Wrenn, 22, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward, averaged 19.5 points per
game and was named the Pacific 10 Conference newcomer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely returning to Washington next season," Wrenn said.
"A lot of people have been telling me to consider going into the
draft, but I really want to develop next year and help our team win
games."</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico Coach Ritchie McKay dismissed starters Patrick Dennehy
and Marlon Parmer.</TE>
<TE>   McKay, who succeeded Fran Fraschilla as coach last week, was on a
recruiting trip Sunday and not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A news release by New Mexico said McKay would hold a news
conference today to discuss details of the dismissals.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,200 fans showed up at a Bloomington, Ind., bookstore
for a book signing by former Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Fans began gathering for the signing nearly 12 hours before
Knight's arrival, all in an effort to get the coach's signature on
"Knight: My Story," co-written with Bob Hammel, a former sports
editor at The Herald-Times in Bloomington.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a Bob Knight fan from Day 1," said Janice Furnish,
wearing a Knight T-shirt, button and even a pair of earrings made of
photographs of Knight's face.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a great man. I can't find any fault with him
whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Former Clipper Jim Les, a star on Bradley's winningest basketball

<LD>Aaron Peirsol, a senior at Newport Harbor High, broke two world
records, one in a relay, and fellow American Lindsay Benko also
bettered a mark in the World Short Course Swimming Championships at
Moscow on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Peirsol won the men's 200-meter backstroke in 1 minute 51.17
seconds, shattering the old mark of 1:51.62, shared by Matt Welsh of
Australia and Gordan Kozulj of Croatia.</LD>
<LD>   He then teamed with David Denniston, Peter Marshall and Jason
Lezak as the U.S. 400 medley-relay team finished in 3:29.00, erasing
the record of 3:29.88 set by Australia in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Benko won the women's 200 freestyle in 1:54.04, eclipsing the
five-year-old record of Claudia Pol of Costa Rica by 0.13.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER GRAHAME L. JONES</KH>
<HD>Stamp of Disapproval for Italy</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bits and pieces picked up along the road to Korea/Japan '02....</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1934 and at the World Cup final in Rome things looked
bleak for Italy, trailing Czechoslovakia, 1-0, with only about eight
minutes remaining.</LD>
<LD>   That's when Italy's Raimondo Orsi took the ball and set off on a
run, weaving his way through the defense, faking a shot with his left
foot and hitting the ball with his right.</LD>
<TE>   Somehow, Orsi struck the ball in such a way that it swerved
erratically, beat the goalkeeper, tied the score and sent the game
into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: Italy 2, Czechoslovakia 1.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think something such as that would be remembered. Especially
in the Republic of San Marino, which is, after all, surrounded by
Italy. But no.</TE>
<TE>   The world's smallest republic recently issued a set of six
commemorative stamps honoring three-time world champion Italy's
accomplishments in the World Cup. One stamp showed the 1934 score as
4-2 in Italy's favor. Another, celebrating Italy's 1938 victory, said
Italy had beaten Hungary, 1-0, in the final in Paris. The actual
score was 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   The erroneous stamps won't be recalled. Unfortunately, 130,000 of
them were produced, so they won't be of much value to collectors
other than as a curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   Spiderman or Dragnet</TE>
<TE>   Belgian, Italian, Mexican and Tunisian hooligans, beware.
Spiderman awaits you in Oita.</TE>
<TE>   Police in the Japanese city have come up with a novel way of
apprehending those who cause trouble at the World Cup. It's a device
that looks like a rifle but fires a reinforced nylon net over a
distance of five yards or so, entangling those caught beneath it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit like casting a fishing net," a police spokesman told
Reuters. "Anyone caught in it will not be able to get out."</TE>
<TE>   Oita, on the southernmost Japanese island of Kyushu, is where
Belgium plays Tunisia on June 10, and where Italy plays Mexico on
June 13.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil, You Say</TE>
<TE>   Religious groups in South Korea, where a quarter of the population
is Christian, have been rebuffed in their attempts to get Belgium to
change the nickname of its team.</TE>
<TE>   "Devils are the enemies of Christians," one religious leader told
the Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique, complaining that by calling
themselves the "Red Devils," Belgium's players are sending the wrong
message.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the name for about 70 years and until now no one has
complained," said Nicolas Cornu, a Belgian soccer federation
spokesman. "I think we'll be sticking to it."</TE>
<TE>   It all makes one wonder how the good folks of Korea regard
Manchester United, whose players not only are known as "Red Devils"
but wear a devil logo on their jerseys. Then there's D.C. United's
Marco "El Diablo" Etcheverry. Is he unwelcome in Korea too?</TE>
<TE>   Nabbed in Shenzhen</TE>
<TE>   Even with Bora Milutinovic as coach, China has little chance of
winning the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. If they can't win any trophies, the Chinese sure
know how to make them.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on complaints from FIFA, authorities in the southern city
of Shenzhen last week seized 60 fake World Cup trophies.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't difficult to tell them from the real thing, however, the
China Daily reported. Each of the forged ones had "FIFA World Cup"
emblazoned in one spot, which is fine, but they also carried the
words: "Everlasting Memory of 2002 World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Sabotage</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria's soccer leaders are never happier than when they are
embroiled in some sort of fracas, no matter how ludicrous. And when
they are, the stories that come out of Lagos are, well, unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   Last week provided a good example.</TE>
<TE>   Edozie Enemuo, the marketing chief of the Nigerian soccer
federation, claimed, without offering any proof, that persons unknown
are trying to "sabotage" Nigeria's schedule of warmup games.</TE>
<TE>   "The fraud by this faceless, shameless group," he told Agence
France-Presse, is ruining Nigeria's buildup by causing hoped-for
opponents to cancel warmup games.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are only out to sabotage Nigeria," he said. "It is as
simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   No, it isn't. Nigeria will play Argentina, England and Sweden in
the World Cup's "group of death," and apparently the Nigerian
federation is preparing its excuses early.</TE>
<TE>   Get Real</TE>
<TE>   Al-Saadi Kadafi is the son of Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi. As
such, his comments that Libya wants to stage the World Cup in 2010
should first be listened to, then laughed at.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the younger Kadafi hasn't thought up a unique campaign.
"We do not have any diseases here, unlike in other African states,"
he told Italy's Corriere dello Sport. "And security is of the highest
level. In summary, whoever comes here can be more than calm."</TE>
<TE>   But less than sane.</TE>

<LD>After doing what he was supposed to do in the $106,800 Zany Tactics
Stakes Sunday at Santa Anita, Officer may be headed to the Lexington
Stakes on April 20 at Keeneland.</LD>
<LD>   Making his first start since finishing third in the Hollywood
Futurity Dec. 15, the 3-10 favorite beat up on a field of
California-breds, winning by six lengths in 1:15 3/5 for the 61/2
furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corporation and
trained by Bob Baffert, Officer has won all five of his races at
seven furlongs or less. It is when he is sent around two turns that
he has struggled. He has won only one of four races at 11/16 miles,
and that is the distance of the Lexington.</LD>
<TE>   "So far, so good," said jockey Victor Espinoza, who has been
aboard in all six of the colt's victories. "It looks like he's coming
back as the same horse he was last summer."</TE>

<HD>Sabathia Keeps Tigers Punchless, Winless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For C.C. Sabathia, having no-hit stuff for seven innings is nothing
new. It was trying for an eighth inning that proved to be the
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Sabathia, who pitched 11 seven-inning no-hitters in high school,
had his no-hit bid end Sunday when Randall Simon singled to lead off
the eighth inning, and the Cleveland Indians went on to defeat the
winless Detroit Tigers, 5-1, Sunday at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "I threw him a slider and he got it," Sabathia said. "I'd been
throwing him sliders all game, and I should have figured out that he
would make the adjustment."</LD>
<TE>   Sabathia got 11 outs on fly balls and popups, which he credited to
Comerica Park and the 42-degree weather. Center fielder Milton
Bradley had nine putouts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big ballpark on a cold day," he said. "No one wants to hit
one on the fists or off the end of the bat on a day like this, so I
was throwing them inside and off the plate."</TE>
<TE>   After Simon lined a clean single to center on the first pitch of
the eighth, Jose Macias hit into a double play. Wendell Magee reached
on an infield single and Andres Torres had an RBI triple for his
first major league hit.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shuey and Bob Wickman finished the four-hitter, completing
Cleveland's first sweep at Detroit since 1996. Wickman entered with
the bases loaded and got his third save when Simon grounded into a
game-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (1-0), who struck out two and walked two, was trying to
be the first Cleveland pitcher to throw a no-hitter since Len
Barker's perfect game against Toronto on May 15, 1981.</TE>
<TE>   At 0-6, the Tigers are off to their worst start since 1992. The
team record for losses at the start of a season is 13, set in 1920.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Tampa Bay 2--Roger Clemens completed a near-perfect
turn through the Yankee rotation, giving up one earned run in 71/3
innings as the Yankees swept the Devil Rays at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi drove in his first run with the Yankees and Derek
Jeter had three hits and three RBIs for New York, which has won five
in a row since losing, 10-3, on opening day in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Yankees starting pitchers had not given up a run since that game
until the Devil Rays scored an unearned run in the sixth. That ended
New York's 23-inning scoreless streak and a 331/3-inning stretch by
the starters.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi, three for 21 this season, got a standing ovation after his
run-scoring single in the eighth. Giambi, who has been booed much of
his first weekend in New York, laughed as he left for pinch-runner
Ron Coomer.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 10, Toronto 6--Corey Koskie hit a three-run homer in the
first inning at Toronto and Torii Hunter also had three RBIs as the
Twins won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Dustan Mohr and David Ortiz also homered for the Twins, who won
three of four against the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Woodward and Raul Mondesi homered for the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 9, Chicago 2--Chuck Knoblauch ended an 0-for-16 skid
with a two-run double in the seventh inning at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   A day after Kansas City lost 14-0 to the White Sox, Jeff Suppan
(1-0) held them to one run and six hits and no walks in seven
innings. The only run he allowed came on Frank Thomas' broken-bat
homer in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Seattle 5--Rookie Carlos Pena hit his fourth home run
and Eric Chavez returned to the lineup with a homer and three RBIs as
the Athletics won at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hudson (1-0) pitched six solid innings, giving up one run and
four hits. The A's took two of three in a series matching teams that
reached the playoffs the last two seasons.</TE>

<HD>Life Is Not a Movie to Rookie Donnelly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>One of Disney's baseball players has absolutely no desire to rush to
a theater and see Disney's latest baseball movie, "The Rookie."</LD>
<LD>   "I'll wait for it to come out on video," Brendan Donnelly said.</LD>
<LD>   The movie tells the story of Jim Morris, who in the summer of 1999
went from high school baseball coach to 35-year-old rookie with the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays. That summer is not as pleasant a memory to
Donnelly, who was pitching well for Tampa Bay's triple-A team when
they demoted him to double-A to make room for Morris.</LD>
<TE>   Donnelly took his release instead. He likes and admires
Morris--"He's a great dude," Donnelly said--but his real-life story
was not, well, a Disney movie. One step away from making his major
league debut with Tampa Bay, Donnelly then pitched in the minors for
the Pirates, Blue Jays, Cubs and Angels before getting his first
call-up to the majors Friday, at age 30.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Rhonda, was with him in Salt Lake City when he was
promoted Friday, so she drove to Anaheim to meet him there today.
After 10 years in the minors, Donnelly mused about how unfair it
would be if his wife did not get to see his major league debut in
person. But he did not pitch Saturday, the game was rained out
Sunday, and his wife will be present when the Angels open a nine-game
homestand tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "That," he said, "will be an added bonus."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Texas Rangers will make up Sunday's game as part of
a doubleheader during the Angels' visit here June 24-27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The rainout deprived infielder Scott Spiezio, suspended for the
first five games, of his season debut.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to have a Cessna for my opening day fly-by," he
joked. "I had Morganna coming out to give me a kiss."</TE>
<TE>   The rainout also means that third baseman Troy Glaus, with three
home runs in his last two games, will serve both games of his
suspension against the Seattle Mariners instead of one each against
Texas and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "For my money, all the clubs in our division are contenders,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "I don't think there's any advantage or
disadvantage to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon's poor 2001 season was not limited to offense. The
right fielder struggled on defense too, and no longer is he
considered one of the elite outfielders in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   For the second day in a row, with the Angels planning to use one
of their reserve outfielders, Salmon was the regular outfielder who
would have moved to designated hitter for the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess Garret and Darin fought harder than I did," Salmon said,
referring to left fielder Garret Anderson and center fielder Darin
Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he thought Salmon could "handle DH better" than Jeff
DaVanon, who would have started in right field. Scioscia also
said--and Salmon acknowledged--that his right knee still is swollen
from being hit by a pitch in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's an opportunity to get him off his feet, we'll take
it," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said that Scioscia told him he would be the DH in about 10
games this season, presumably when Brad Fullmer sits against tough
left-handers. "I don't have a problem with it," Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels turned nine double plays in their first five games
through Saturday, leading the majors in that category. The results
were particularly pleasing to Scioscia and to infield coach Alfredo
Griffin, the former Gold Glove shortstop who spent endless hours in
spring training tutoring the Angels' double-play combination of
shortstop David Eckstein and second baseman Adam Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the hard work they put in with Alfredo is paying off,"
Scioscia said, "and will continue to pay off."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels ranked eighth in the league in double plays last
season.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. puts tough week in past with 97-75
rout of Denver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers exercised their 1st Amendment rights to free speech
Sunday without embarrassing themselves or their community.</LD>
<LD>   They also managed to play a solid 48 minutes of basketball,
shredding the Denver Nuggets during a 22-point romp that left only
one question at game's end: Where was that poised play last week when
it counted?</LD>
<LD>   "If anything, this was one of our best games of the season,"
center Michael Olowokandi said of the Clippers' 97-75 victory over
the Nuggets before a sellout crowd of 18,964 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a real team effort. Everything was going for us tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi scored 23 points, took six rebounds, blocked six shots
and had one very important face-to-face meeting with General Manager
Elgin Baylor in the locker room after the game. Olowokandi made
critical comments last week about his lack of a contract for next
season and Baylor fined him $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   When he met with reporters after a short conversation with Baylor,
Olowokandi seemed more at ease than he has been in several days. He
even offered an apology for his remarks, which followed a loss
Wednesday to the Utah Jazz that all but eliminated the Clippers from
the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   "What I said maybe was out of line," he said Sunday. "I was very
frustrated. Maybe I could have handled it differently."</TE>
<TE>   After missing 13 of 15 shots and scoring only seven points against
the Jazz, Olowokandi vented. He said his uncertainty over his
contract status for next season was beginning to have an impact on
the team's play. He said he was speaking for all his teammates, who
were as uncertain about management's commitment to building a
consistent winner.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi was still steamed about the fine and has considered
appealing it, but he stowed the angry-young-man routine Sunday and
helped the Clippers end a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also moved within a game of the .500 mark at 38-39.
With five games remaining, the franchise's second winning record
since relocating from San Diego in 1984 is still possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have some goals we want to accomplish, and a winning
record is one of them," Olowokandi said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry gathered his players around him before
Saturday's practice and delivered a simple message. In short, he said
it was time for the players to forget about their frustrations over
missing the playoffs. They also should put thoughts of contracts and
who might or might not be on the team next season out of their minds.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers certainly played as if they were living in the moment
Sunday against the overmatched Nuggets (24-52). They often passed up
open shots to find a teammate who was stationed closer to the basket.
When a play or a call didn't go their way, they ran to the other end
of the court without complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out of our way, sometimes to a fault, to make the extra
pass," Gentry said. "Everyone made an extra effort to be
unselfish.... We don't have to play under any pressure at all now.
We're not talking about wins and losses now. We're talking about
playing and competing."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry acknowledged that perhaps he was to blame for some of the
pressure placed on his inexperienced team. The more he spoke of the
playoffs, the more his players felt the heat. He admitted it might
have been a mistake on his part.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought being in the playoff race and talking about it should
have been a good thing," he said. "If I had it to do over again, I'd
approach it differently."</TE>

<HD>Brand's Record Is Offensive</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elton Brand needed one offensive rebound to become the Clippers'
single-season record-holder with 372. He got it, taking a teammate's
miss and dropping it into the basket with 8:14 remaining in the first
half of a 22-point victory Sunday over the Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   Brand took three other offensive rebounds, part of a team-leading
10. He also scored 18 points on eight-of-11 shooting for his
franchise-record-tying 54th double-double. One more game with 10 or
more points and rebounds and Brand will pass Swen Nater's 1980-81
total.</LD>
<LD>   "Individual accolades are great, but I'd rather trade it for a
spot in the playoffs," Brand said. "Michael Cage [who set the
franchise record with 371 offensive rebounds in 1987-88] definitely
could hit the boards, so it's good to break that record."</LD>
<TE>   Brand also is the NBA's leading offensive rebounder over the last
three seasons with 1,008.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's sellout of 18,964 at Staples Center was the Clippers'
22nd of the season and 13th in a row. Both are franchise records.</TE>

<HD>Roddick Is Guardian Angel to U.S. Effort</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He improves to 7-0 in Davis Cup, clinching
quarterfinal victory with straight-set win over Spain's Martin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Andy Roddick was in fully animated character, which meant he was
playing a crucial Davis Cup match. Hyper turned into super-hyper
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing he could clinch the Davis Cup quarterfinal against Spanish
substitute Alberto Martin, who replaced an injured Alex Corretja,
Roddick's stomach started feeling it in the van ride more than two
hours before their match at Westside Tennis Club.</LD>
<LD>   Butterflies, he said. "I'm always nervous, man," Roddick said.</LD>
<TE>   It only took 1 hour 45 minutes on the court for butterflies to
turn into a "snow angel" on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick always manages to do something creative when he wins a big
match, or loses one, for that matter. When he put the United States
in the semifinals--after Martin hit a backhand return out--Roddick
fell to the grass on his back and started waving his arms after his
6-2, 6-4, 6-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing a snow angel," he said. "I did it when I first got
here. The first one was on my face."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, 19, may have spent a lot of time tumbling on the grass,
but he did not fall on his face when put in such a critical spot.
Though he clinched the match against India in October, that was a
relegation round, not in the World Group. He is 7-0 in Davis Cup
play, equaling the best American start since Andre Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   His victory against Martin gave the U.S. a 3-1 win against Spain.
The final reverse singles between James Blake and Tommy Robredo was
washed out by rain in the second set with Robredo leading, 6-1, 5-4.
It was not canceled until 6:15 because Spain apparently refused to
concede and wanted Blake to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "They're being babies," Davis Cup Coach Jim Courier said of the
Spaniards.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe said the injured Carlos Moya and Juan
Carlos Ferrero might have played if this match had been in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a real good chance they would have found their
way there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Next will be the semifinals against France in September, possibly
at Roland Garros in Paris on clay.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe said he spoke to Agassi about returning to the team during
the recent tournament in Miami, and sensed a flicker of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I've always sensed that it's possible he would come back,
just as I did with Pete [Sampras], I felt that under the right
circumstances," McEnroe said. "And obviously I'm not going to put
pressure on him. I only want him to play if he wants to play."</TE>
<TE>   By defeating Spain, McEnroe equaled the accomplishment of his
predecessor, older brother John, who reached the semifinals in 2000,
but lost, 5-0, to Spain on clay.</TE>
<TE>   He also had a John-like moment with the chair umpire Sunday,
unleashing some colorful language in the second set after consecutive
questionable calls.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only take so much," McEnroe said. "It was unusual, but
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   He probably ended up preventing a major explosion from Roddick.
Roddick, who had 17 aces and four double faults, was broken only
once, when he served for the second set at 5-2. It was his most
complete performance in Davis Cup action, and McEnroe thought it was
his best match.</TE>
<TE>   "I freak out a little bit during Davis Cup," Roddick said. "It's
just the emotion of playing for your country, and the crowd going
nuts. Playing for your teammates, it's just a rush."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick has shed the rookie status quickly. Others feel he has
become a leader, but he wasn't grabbing the title just yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go as far to say leader, but I definitely feel like
I'm part of the team, not just visiting," Roddick said.</TE>

<HD>Goosen Doesn't Let Slow Start Faze Him in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retief Goosen began the final round of the BellSouth Classic at
Duluth, Ga., with a bogey and a double-bogey, falling two shots
behind Phil Mickelson. But the South African bounced back for a
four-stroke victory over Jesper Parnevik, with Mickelson another shot
back.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew if I won or lost today, I was still going to wake up
tomorrow morning and have to do it all over again," said Goosen, who
closed with a two-under-par 70 despite treacherous conditions on the
TPC at Sugarloaf.</LD>
<LD>   He's so laid-back that countryman Ernie Els (The Big Easy) seems
hyper by comparison. That attitude is understandable considering
Goosen was struck by lightning as an amateur, damaging his heart and
costing him some hearing in his left ear.</LD>
<TE>   Goosen was tested again at last year's U.S. Open, where he missed
an 18-inch putt that would have given him the victory in regulation.
He bounced back the following day to beat Mark Brooks in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it a little bit easier out there on the golf course now
than I used to in the past," Goosen said. "I'm not so hard on myself.
I just try and enjoy the game a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   Goosen pulled away from the field with a 16-under 272. Parnevik,
who posted 65 early in the day for a 276, wasn't even around when the
winner finished.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson appeared to be Goosen's main challenger, starting the
final round two strokes back. The left-hander briefly claimed the
lead, only to fade to a 73 and 277.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually hit a lot of good shots," Mickelson said. "I just had
a hard time getting it close. It is hard to really describe. You just
have to see it."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Tewell added to his impressive senior tour resume with a
victory in the Legends of Golf at St. Augustine, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tewell shot two-under 70 to finish the tournament at 11-under 205,
one stroke better than Bobby Wadkins, who made a late run with a 66
in the final round.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Ginn shot 72 to tie with Bob Gilder (70) for third at
eight-under.</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old Tewell won for the second time this season. He
also has two senior major championships to his name.</TE>
<TE>   He hit all 14 fairways Sunday and finished the tournament hitting
41 of 42.</TE>
<TE>   The only one he missed came Friday at No. 7, when he hooked a
drive to the left.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in the first cut of rough," Tewell said.</TE>
<TE>   "No big deal."</TE>

<HD>Griffey Injury 'Serious'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Cincinnati Red outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. will be sidelined at least
three to six weeks after injuring his troublesome right knee in a
rundown during Sunday's game against Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Griffey partially tore the patella tendon and partially dislocated
his right kneecap. Cincinnati put the All-Star center fielder on the
15-day disabled list after a 10-inning, 6-5 victory over the Expos.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a serious injury," team doctor Timothy Kremchek said after
Griffey had an MRI exam.</LD>
<TE>   The Reds will try to treat Griffey with rest and rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Kremchek said there was an "outside chance" Griffey will need an
operation. If surgery is required, Griffey would likely be out for
the rest of the season, the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, who was bothered during spring training by tendinitis in
the same knee, was hurt as he was being tagged by Expo third baseman
Chris Truby in the seventh inning. Griffey had tried to score from
third base on a grounder and was trapped in a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey went down holding his knee and was briefly attended to by
Cincinnati medical personnel before limping gingerly off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Griffey missed most of the first three months because
of a partially torn left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the game, Griffey hit his 461st career home run.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see that he was in pain," said Sean Casey, whose single
won the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the last thing you want to see. I know his knee's been
bugging him for the past week or so. We don't need that cycle to
start again."</TE>
<TE>   Griffey's first home run of the season, a solo shot down the
right-field line, had given the Reds a 2-0 lead in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   With two out and the bases loaded in the 10th, Casey lined the
first pitch he saw from Graeme Lloyd for a single up the middle to
score Jason LaRue with the winning run.</TE>

<HD>Raptors Now in Playoff Position</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somehow, the Toronto Raptors look unbeatable even without Vince
Carter.</LD>
<LD>   Alvin Williams scored 26 points, and Antonio Davis had 21 as the
surging Raptors moved into playoff position with a 94-84 victory over
the Indiana Pacers on Sunday at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   The Raptors, on a remarkable roll since losing Carter to a
season-ending knee injury, set a franchise record with their eighth
consecutive victory after losing 17 of 18.</LD>
<TE>   "This is amazing," said Davis, who also grabbed 10 rebounds.
"We've come such a long way in such a short period of time. This is
such a great feeling because it would have been easy to give up."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto pulled a game ahead of the Pacers in the race for the
eighth and final postseason berth in the Eastern Conference. Both
teams have six games remaining, including Wednesday's rematch at
Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Keon Clark had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who
have defeated Indiana seven times in a row dating to last season.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 26 points. Jermaine O'Neal
scored 24, and Brad Miller had 15 points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto is only a game behind Milwaukee for seventh place and two
back of sixth-place Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors lead the four-game season series with Indiana, 3-0, so
if the teams are tied at the end of the regular season, Toronto would
win the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to go home and regroup," dejected Pacer Coach Isiah
Thomas said. "We have to make sure one loss doesn't totally
demoralize us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Toronto Coach Lenny Wilkens: "We played great defense and our
bench was awesome. I told them, don't let anyone walk in and make a
basket. If you're going to foul them make sure they don't make the
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 102, New Jersey 90--Paul Pierce scored 15 of his 32 points
in the fourth quarter, and the Celtics put the Nets' bid for their
first NBA division title on hold for a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   The victory not only ended New Jersey's 13-game home winning
streak, a franchise record, it also kept the Nets from clinching the
Atlantic Division title.</TE>
<TE>   The Eastern Conference-leading Nets can capture the division by
winning one of their final four regular-season games or having the
Celtics lose one of their remaining five.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 116, New York 82--Chris Webber led eight Sacramento
players in double figures with 16 points and 14 rebounds as the Kings
added another remarkable chapter to their best season in history with
a franchise-record 34th home victory.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA-leading Kings (57-19) returned from a perfect six-game
trip to humiliate the last-place Knicks with another dazzling display
of ball movement and shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac had 14 points and eight rebounds, while Peja
Stojakovic had 13 points in his second game back from a nine-game
absence with a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 89, Milwaukee 87--Aaron McKie and Derrick McKey made
big shots down the stretch as the 76ers sent the Bucks to their ninth
consecutive road loss.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Snow had 15 points and a season-high 14 assists for the
76ers, who moved out of a tie with Milwaukee for sixth place in the
Eastern Conference. The teams play again Tuesday at Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>Hernandez Does It All in Giant Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now Livan Hernandez likes April.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez has two victories in April in the same season for the
first time. He pitched a four-hitter, had three hits and drove in two
runs Sunday to lead the San Francisco Giants over the San Diego
Padres, 10-1, at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Even with Barry Bonds given a day off, Hernandez helped the Giants
(6-0) remain the only undefeated team in the major leagues. They are
off to their best start since 1930 and have outscored opponents,
41-5.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm trying to do more to win more in April," said Hernandez, who
began the season with a career record in April of 4-13 and an
earned-run average of 6.03.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (2-0) has given up three runs in 17 innings this season
for a 1.59 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is perfect now," he said. "Last year was tough for me.
I had a lot of things on my mind. I want to win 10 games in the first
half."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent, in his second game back from the disabled list, hit his
first home run of the season and drove in two runs.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (2-0) struck out five and walked one in his first
complete game since last Aug. 17, retiring 11 in a row at one point.
He is batting .714 (five for seven) with three runs batted in--only
three Giants have driven in more runs.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the Livan Hernandez show," San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy
said. "He pitched great and he swung the bat. He has a short swing,
swings through the ball and puts the ball in play."</TE>
<TE>   Padre pitcher Brian Tollberg (0-2) gave up seven runs and 10 hits
in six-plus innings, lowering his ERA to 15.57.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not used to getting out of the gate this slow," he said. "I
don't feel right mechanically and it's frustrating that way.</TE>
<TE>   "The game just got out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   About the only bad news for the Giants was that shortstop Rich
Aurilia had to leave the game because of a strained left groin after
sliding into second base in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, New York 2--Marcus Giles hit a three-run homer in the
14th off Saturo Komiyama (0-1) as the Braves avoided a three-game
sweep by winning the longest game by innings and time at Turner
Field, which opened in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Albie Lopez (1-1), Atlanta's eighth pitcher, pitched two scoreless
innings in the game that lasted 4 hours 59 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, who had won the first two games of the series, scored
two runs in the sixth off rookie left-hander Damian Moss, starting in
place of the injured Greg Maddux.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, St. Louis 6--Daryle Ward hit a leadoff homer in the
12th off Luther Hackman (0-1) as the Astros won at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Houston rallied from a 6-3 deficit in the ninth against Mike
Timlin on Jeff Bagwell's RBI double and Richard Hidalgo's two-run
single.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Stone (1-0) pitched two hitless innings and struck out
three.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Edmonds hit a two-run homer for the Cardinals and also stole
home as part of a ninth-inning double steal.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Florida 2--Pat Burrell homered off Braden Looper
(0-2) leading off the 11th innning to win it for the Phillies at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Floyd's homer off Jose Mesa in the ninth gave the Marlins a
2-1 lead. But the Phillies tied it on Mike Lieberthal's one-out RBI
single.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh at Chicago, ppd.--The game between the Pirates and Cubs
was postponed because of rain and will be made up as part of a
doubleheader on May 21 at Wrigley Field.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Presents Body of Evidence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>First, Pedro Martinez turned in a performance that proved his
shoulder is not a cause for concern.</LD>
<LD>   Then he hammered home the point.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope that everyone chills now. I'm not 100% strong yet, but
I'll get there," he declared.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez won for the first time since last May 30, rebounding from
an awful opening day outing to pitch six strong innings Sunday and
lead the Boston Red Sox over the Baltimore Orioles, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (1-0), coming off a season shortened to 18 starts because
of shoulder pain, gave up one unearned run and three hits, struck out
five and walked one. Shea Hillenbrand backed him with a pair of
two-run homers.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the idea that Martinez is dragging a sore shoulder to
the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "My health, thank God, I believe it's here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was pitching against a team in a horrid hitting slump,
it was a vast improvement from Martinez's first outing, when the
right-hander gave up seven earned runs and nine hits in three innings
against Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "The reports we were getting was that his fastball was not as
explosive as it had been," Oriole Manager Mike Hargrove said.
"Obviously, he had a real good fastball today."</TE>
<TE>   The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed only one runner past
second base and retired his last seven batters. Martinez threw 85
pitches, 54 for strikes, in lowering his earned-run average from
21.00 to 7.00.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty pleased with how everything went. I made some
adjustments today and felt like I was more consistent with
everything," he said. "I felt better. Now I'll just continue to work
on everything."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez had been winless in his previous eight starts.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Baerga had two hits for the Red Sox, who outscored
Baltimore, 11-3, in a three-game sweep. Ugueth Urbina pitched the
ninth to earn his third save, all in this series.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore has lost five in a row, scoring only four runs during
that span.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox got all the runs they needed in the second inning. Two
outs after Manny Ramirez drew a leadoff walk from Calvin Maduro
(0-1), Hillenbrand hit a liner into the left-field seats for a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand struck again in the fourth with his second homer,
after a double by Tony Clark.</TE>

<LD>Annika Sorenstam lost the championship by a shot to Se Ri Pak and the
Swede was smiling. Sometimes getting beat is better than winning by
five shots. Sometimes playing 18 holes when every stroke matters is
more fun than coasting. Sometimes having to go for the green with
your second shot on the par-five 17th is more fun than playing an
exhibition for the final three holes.</LD>
<LD>   While clothes and smiles and good hair might make the woman,
according to the new LPGA game plan for improving the visibility of
professional women's golf, what fundamentally helps is good
competition. Lots of it. The more competitors the better.</LD>
<LD>   It was a good day Sunday at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana.
From the first drive to the last putt, Pak, 24, from South Korea, and
Sorenstam, 31, fought hard and stayed close in the final round of the
Office Depot Championship Hosted by Amy Alcott.</LD>
<TE>   There were lead changes and well-struck putts, iron shots hit with
spin and nerve, controversial decisions, rimmed-out putts,
nerve-testing saves from the traps and rough, some bogeys, some
birdies and lots of fun.</TE>
<TE>   What would have made this a great day is if there had been more
challengers for Pak and Sorenstam, maybe even an American or two.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz, 26, a Wake Forest grad and Amelia Island, Fla.,
resident, played in the final group with Pak and Sorenstam. She was
there, in her light red shirt and blue pants. "What a pretty girl," a
man said. "Who is she?"</TE>
<TE>   She was the one always three or four shots behind, never quite
able to meet the challenge, never quite up to the task of making this
final round a three-way battle.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Pak said, "it would be good for the tour" if an American
were near the top.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Sorenstam and Australia's Karrie Webb have
dominated. Pak has joined the battle this year.</TE>
<TE>   But a tour played mostly in the United States, relying largely on
U.S. television and sponsorship money, needs U.S. stars. More than
friendly, nice-looking, fan-friendly athletes, the LPGA needs
Americans challenging for the top of the leaderboard.</TE>
<TE>   Women's tennis was a dead zone as far as U.S. fans and media were
concerned those few years when Steffi Graf, then Martina Hingis,
seemed to win everything in sight. TV ratings fell, attendance
plummeted, the WTA Tour lost major sponsors. Then along came Venus
and Serena Williams. Lindsay Davenport began winning. Jennifer
Capriati reappeared, and now women's tennis is hot. Women's golf
needs Williams sisters, a Capriati and Davenport of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Fans stood six and seven deep around the last few greens for
Sunday's final round. You could hear Korean and Swedish being spoken,
Spanish too. There were some Aussies who had hoped Webb might
contend. Pak said she felt almost at home with all the Korean fans
who had supported her all week.</TE>
<TE>   But when the tour leaves a multicultural place like Los Angeles,
and when the sport looks for TV viewers from around the country to
tune in, too many tune out when they see a leaderboard filled with
Swedes, Koreans, Brits, Aussies and Canadians. Only five of the top
15 on the LPGA money list were born in the United States. Diaz is No.
2 Cristie Kerr is No. 5, Juli Inkster No. 8, Rosie Jones No. 9 and
Heather Bowie No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways it would be good for the game," Sorenstam said, "if
there were more Americans near the top. But there are some young
American players coming up also."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the 26-year-old Diaz, Kerr is 24, Inkster 41, Jones 42 and
Bowie 27. This is not a group of youngsters on the rise. Pak is 24
and has already won three majors. She is a young player on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   That said, what happened on the course Sunday was enthralling.
Jamie Rose, an 11-year-old from Reseda who had pestered her father,
Ed, to bring her to the tournament Sunday, said she could hardly wait
to learn how to play golf. "I want to be like Se Ri," Jamie said.
"This is a cool game."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sorenstam: "I had a great time today. I was standing there on
17 and I have 165 yards to the pin with water on the left and it was
then that I told my caddie that this is why we are here. I enjoy
playing with Se Ri. I felt like this was a major with the crowd that
was out there."</TE>
<TE>   Pak had come to the par-five 17th with a three-shot lead. She left
one stroke ahead of Sorenstam. Because she was behind, Sorenstam had
to be bold. She went for the green with her second shot, had a
makable eagle putt and left with a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Because she was ahead, Pak played it safe. She thought. Pak laid
up with her second shot, had 89 yards to the pin and hit the ball
119. She had a tricky chip, left it short, made bogey and slammed her
bag with her hand. The crowd ran up the 18th fairway, jostling for
position to watch the leaders play the final hole, a par-four with
five bunkers around the green.</TE>
<TE>   What they saw while they were standing on tiptoes was Sorenstam
snaking a twisting, 30-foot birdie putt within breathing distance of
the hole and an exuberant Pak almost making her 20-footer for birdie.
Each made par, and they embraced as the crowd jumped up and down and
cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz finished out her par alone and unnoticed. Third place, four
shots from the lead, that was a nice week for Diaz. Nice but not
great. Great would have been better. For everybody.</TE>

<HD>Schilling Gets 17 Strikeouts</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling has never been more dominant than he was Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   He struck out a career-high 17 and threw his second career
one-hitter in overpowering Milwaukee and leading the Arizona
Diamondbacks past the Brewers, 2-0.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if he can pitch any better," Brewer Manager Davey
Lopes said. "And if he can I don't want to see it."</LD>
<TE>   But Eric Young swears he's seen Schilling sharper than this.</TE>
<TE>   "It was on TV," Young said. "In the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling had three stellar starts in the World Series, in which
he was named co-MVP with fellow ace Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling was so motivated by his postseason performance that he
vowed to approach the new season with similar ferocity. And it has
produced 16 shutout innings, and only seven hits and two walks to go
with 26 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal going into spring training this year was to be where I
was in October last year," Schilling said. "I feel that in my first
two starts I've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (2-0) gave up only Raul Casanova's clean single to right
field in the second inning. He did not permit a runner to reach
second base.</TE>
<TE>   The shutout was the Diamondbacks' third of the season in six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling was so dominating that Brewer fans took to cheering foul
balls in the latter innings.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling struck out seven of the first 10 batters he faced and
fanned the side in the third and fifth innings. He outdueled Ben
Sheets (1-1), who gave up one run and five hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling, who opened the season with seven shutout innings
against San Diego, fanned Young for the second out in the ninth,
breaking his previous career best of 16 strikeouts set Sept. 1, 1997,
against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   He fanned Geoff Jenkins, Tyler Houston and Jose Hernandez three
times each.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Taino's week was booked, and Brian Vahaly's was no picnic
either. They played a combined 17 matches in the last week, including
Sunday's final of the USTA Tarzana Challenger.</LD>
<LD>   Taino walked away the winner after defeating Vahaly, 6-2, 7-6 (6),
at the Braemar Country Club.</LD>
<LD>   Both finalists entered the main draw after winning qualifying
matches. Vahaly's first-round obstacle was former French Open
champion Michael Chang, whom he defeated, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (6), on
Tuesday. And the long week caught up to Vahaly with a flare-up of
tendinitis in his left hand Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Taino, who graduated from UCLA in 1997, had taken a quick 4-1 lead
in the first set when Vahaly took a three-minute injury timeout.
Vahaly came back to win the sixth game, but Taino edged him in the
next two, taking the first set, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Because the tendinitis impaired his backhand, Vahaly adjusted his
game and came to the net more often. But without much experience with
that approach, Vahaly was often one step slower than Taino.</TE>
<TE>   "All my winners are on my backhand side, and that's where I
dictate play," Vahaly said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without my best shot, I'm pretty bad, so I just tried to change
my game."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in part to frequent icing of his hand and a creative tape
job, Vahaly managed to push the second set into a tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   The tiebreaker was tied three times before Taino pulled out the
8-6 win. "It got tight there for a second, and it could have gone
either way, in the second set for sure," Taino said. "I tried not to
overhit and do enough just to win. I think that helped a lot, not
overplaying."</TE>
<TE>   Taino won $7,200, Vahaly $4,240.</TE>
<TE>   After the match, Taino traveled to Calabasas for his second
qualifying match in the USTA Calabasas Challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Vahaly is questionable for the Calabasas tournament because of the
tendinitis.</TE>

<HD>Are Sampras and Chang Going Uphill or Over It?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The week started with a short trip to Tarzana, and ended with a
longer journey to Westside Tennis Club here.</LD>
<LD>   One event was a modest $50,000 Challenger, the other a Davis Cup
quarterfinal against Spain. What was a routine checkup of the
Greatest (tennis) Generation, featuring Michael Chang and Pete
Sampras, turned depressing, and as for the diagnosis, well, these two
results tell the story:</LD>
<LD>   * In the Challenger, Chang lost in a third-set tiebreaker Tuesday
to a qualifier who was playing for the University of Virginia at this
time last year. Chang double-faulted on match point.</LD>
<TE>   * At Davis Cup, Sampras lost Friday to Spanish clay-courter Alex
Corretja, on grass, after winning the first two sets. And how does
Corretja like grass? Well, this was his 10th match on the surface,
and he hasn't even bothered to play Wimbledon the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two, Chang's mishap was the lesser surprise because he has
not won on the ATP Tour since October, dropping eight consecutive
matches. But this was where the struggling Sampras was supposed to
regain some swagger, a renewed sense of self. Instead, the loss
raised more questions than answers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stunning development, especially internationally. And it
didn't take long for some of Sampras' colleagues to start sniping at
the suddenly ultra-vulnerable 13-time Grand Slam champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Pete should think of quitting," Yevgeny Kafelnikov said
from Moscow during Russia's 3-1 victory against Sweden. "His loss
should tell him something, and I think it's a disrespect to himself
to keep playing."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras did not play in the final singles match Sunday, which was
rendered meaningless after Andy Roddick secured the quarterfinal
against Alberto Martin. Roddick was more than happy to defend his
Davis Cup teammate after he was told of Kafelnikov's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a statement from a guy who hasn't beaten him the last
three or four times," Roddick said.</TE>
<TE>   Said U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe: "You see who the
messenger is in that situation, and [Kafelnikov] pops off way too
much. And to make comments like that about Sampras is absurd and
disrespectful."</TE>
<TE>   The next Sampras-Kafelnikov match should be interesting, no matter
the surface or city.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon had been considered Sampras' best opportunity to win
another Grand Slam event. What this loss did was let others on the
circuit know they have a much better chance against him on grass,
hurting his previous aura of near-invincibility. If he can't close
out a match against Corretja ...</TE>
<TE>   There's always the chance of a boomerang effect. Sampras responded
to more muted criticism last year by coming on, quietly angered, to
reach the U.S. Open final, defeating Pat Rafter, Andre Agassi and
Marat Safin before losing to Lleyton Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   For Chang, the challenge is different but just as difficult. He is
simply trying to stay in the top 100.</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana was supposed to be the place to mend the psyche, rebuild
some confidence and gather enough points to remain in the main draw
of the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   What once worked for Agassi--dropping down to the minors to
regroup--backfired for Chang at Braemar Country Club in Tarzana.
Brian Vahaly beat the top-seeded Chang, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (6), in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   The former French Open champion, who turned 30 in February, is
suffering from a crisis of confidence. Once ranked as high as No. 2
in the world in 1996, he is barely within the top 100, at No. 92 as
of April 1.</TE>
<TE>   "My confidence ... can't get any lower right now. It's at pit
bottom right now," Chang said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just a fact. I know if I'm playing bad, and yet if I'm
still confident, I'm still a different player. I may not hit the ball
quite as sharp, but I'm able to get through these types of matches."</TE>
<TE>   Vahaly, ranked No. 196, reached the NCAA final last year, and the
athletic baseliner won a challenger last month in New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   His friends told him not to "get his butt kicked" by Chang.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Michael Chang [in the draw] and I had my bags packed,"
Vahaly said.</TE>
<TE>   When Chang will finally pack his bags and move on has been a
growing subject of speculation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too hard," Chang said. "I've always said I'd like to
play for at least a couple more years. I don't know if that's going
to be shorter or longer. If the day comes where I don't feel like
working out, both on and off the court, then I know my time has come.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I'm not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   Chang made his career by winning the French Open in 1989. In fact,
Chang has taken a title more recently than Sampras, winning the
tournament at UCLA in 2000. Chang and Sampras have won a combined 97
titles on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   What neither 30-year-old wants to do is leave prematurely. Sampras
looked ready to go after a Spanish reporter who asked after his loss
to Corretja whether he could be near the end.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the class and caliber of champion, Sampras and Chang
should be allowed to leave on their own terms.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, through USTA spokesperson Randy Walker, declined to
comment on Kafelnikov's withering critique on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But Chang's final, telling words on a chilly afternoon in Tarzana
could easily speak for Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for me. Once I walk away I don't ever want to look
back and say, 'I wish I had given more effort at the end,'" Chang
said. "It's important to walk away saying, 'I gave it my all. I did
my best.'"</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Hampton Isn't Much of an Ace to Green</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Green continues to enjoy unusual success against Colorado ace
Mike Hampton, but Green cannot explain it. Green had two hits and
drove in the first run in the Dodgers' 6-4 victory over the Rockies
on Sunday at Dodger Stadium. He is 10 for 12 with nine runs batted in
against the Colorado left-hander, who has lost four consecutive
decisions to the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Green drew a walk in the first inning, drove in a run with a
single to right in the third, drew an intentional walk with two out
and a runner on third base in the fourth and singled in the seventh.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't understand it," Green said. "For some reason, I just get
pitches to hit against him. When I hit them hard, they're hits, and
when I haven't hit them hard, they're hits. It's nice to know going
into a game that you have had success against a guy, but at the same
time, you know it's going to even out eventually.</LD>
<TE>   "I could see that he was being a little more careful today, but
there's no explanation. He's a great pitcher. There are just certain
guys, for some reason, that you get hits off of."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown hit his second career home run when he belted a pitch
from Hampton into the left-field pavilion in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Brown hit his only other homer last May 2 at Cincinnati against
Pete Harnisch.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was asked if he knew Sunday's shot was leaving the park as
soon as he made contact.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was, but it's not like I have a whole lot of
experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The change to daylight saving time meant one less hour to sleep,
but no one arrived at Dodger Stadium on Sunday morning looking more
relaxed and rested than pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese left-hander said he got only three hours of sleep
after his 10-strikeout debut Saturday night against the Colorado
Rockies. However, he added that it was probably the most restful
night he has experienced since his first spring training outing April
8. "It was a lot different," Ishii said through interpreter Scott
Akasaki. "I was a lot more relaxed when I went to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are off today and will start a nine-game trip Tuesday
that will take them to San Francisco, San Diego and Colorado. Manager
Jim Tracy said his team is looking forward to playing the Giants, who
swept the Dodgers in the season-opening series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for us to go there right now," Tracy said. "I think
we're a little better ballclub than we were when they came here. Why
wait?"</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies drove in a run with a
pinch-hit double in the eighth inning on Sunday. He returns to Coors
Field for the Rockies' home opener with another milestone.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Walker established a major league record for games
played by a Canadian-born player. Walker moved past Terry Puhl by
playing in his 1,532nd game.</TE>

<HD>Falling Stars Seen in Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Ducks win, 4-1, taking great pleasure in
sidetracking Dallas' push for a Western Conference playoff spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scoreboard told the final score: Mighty Ducks 4, Dallas Stars 1.</LD>
<LD>   But the grin said it all Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei was asked how it felt to manhandle
the Stars--again--and put Dallas' playoff hopes in jeopardy. Salei
stared off into the distance with a smirk that said it all.
"Obviously it feels great," Salei said. "What is it, three times
now?"</LD>
<TE>   Yeah, but who's counting?</TE>
<TE>   The Stars were 26-10-1-1 against the Ducks before going 1-3-1 this
season. Sunday was another sign how times have changed.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks got goals by Patric Kjellberg, German Titov, Mike
Leclerc and Paul Kariya in front of an announced 14,661 at the
Arrowhead Pond. They got another excellent performance from goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere. And they got plenty of satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely like beating this team," Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to stick it back to Dallas. We have taken a lot of
[junk] from them over the years. It's nice to give it back."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars have been dull and efficient in the last five seasons,
using that style to win a Stanley Cup in 1998-99. Now they are just
dull.</TE>
<TE>   They are also two points out of eighth place in the Western
Conference going into tonight's game against the Kings and could miss
the playoffs for the first time since the 1995-96 season.</TE>
<TE>   "These are points we feel we should get, points we haven't
gotten," Dallas forward Rob DiMaio said. "It's tough to lose to a
team like this."</TE>
<TE>   There are a few teams feeling that way the last two weeks. The
Ducks have beaten Phoenix, Edmonton and Dallas twice in that time. Of
course, all that means for the Ducks is they have a shot of passing
Nashville and Minnesota and finishing ahead of every expansion team
that followed them into the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care who is in the playoffs," Coach Bryan Murray said.
"If we're not in, it doesn't matter. We're not doing anybody any
favors. We're just going to play and try to prove some things.
Somebody from Edmonton said they played down to our level. They
didn't play up to our level."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars couldn't reach that level Sunday. The score was tied,
1-1, in the second period when Titov tried to center a pass to Matt
Cullen. Goalie Eddie Belfour dived to block the pass, but the puck
hit his stick and went into the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were outshot, 37-22, Sunday, but put more pucks in the
net. Leclerc took a pass from Cullen and chipped in a shot for his
20th goal. It gave the Ducks a 3-1 lead 6:45 into the third period.
Kariya then blasted a shot past Belfour three minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was nearly unbeatable. Only Brent Gilchrist got a shot
past him in the first period. It ended Giguere's shutout streak at
109 minutes 31 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple weeks have been unbelievable," Cullen said. "We
have been put into the role of the spoiler. It's not the role we
want, but we're happy to do it."</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>How Long Will Riley Be Able to Take Heat?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Welcome to Riles' nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   Back in his Showtime days, when Pat Riley fell out of Chick
Hearn's broadcast booth, practically onto the back of a championship
Laker team, people used to say he was the luckiest man in basketball
history.</LD>
<LD>   These days, basketball is evening up the score.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Riley's Heat fell out of the playoff race. Last
week, it clinched his first losing season in 17 years. Sunday Riles'
guys racked up another loss, falling, 96-88, to the Lakers in a
yawner before what was listed as a sellout of 19,600, but, in fact,
had half-empty sections in the upper deck and a lot of unoccupied
seats in the lower bowl too.</TE>
<TE>   You think Riley, who once said NBA life was divided into winning
and misery--in the days when he was winning all the time--isn't
embarrassed to the point of wanting to disappear? Since the Heat fell
by the wayside, he had been refusing to respond to routine questions
about whether he planned to stay. He tried to duck it again before
Sunday's game ("It's old news. Let's not get into this stuff right
now, OK?"), until finally he sputtered:</TE>
<TE>   "From my vantage point, the president's not going to fire the
coach and the coach is not going to stick a damn knife in the
president's back. So, that's it....</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if [Heat owner] Mickey Arison wants to do something about
it, that's up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Riley, of course, is coach and president, not to mention 10%
owner, with another 10% coming if he lasts three more seasons as
coach, or works in the front office, or just consults.</TE>
<TE>   So it's probably not his own financial considerations that are
upsetting him.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there's the question of what he has built and
where it's going.</TE>
<TE>   In his seventh season here, the Heat is 33-43, with no starter
under 30. Arison, the Carnival Cruise Lines magnate who once gave
Riley a blank check, has now put him on an allowance. Nor would you
say they're a big crowd-pleaser, with the No. 29 offense, running No.
19 in attendance, in a 3-year-old arena.</TE>
<TE>   They won 50 games last season, with Alonzo Mourning there for only
the last 13, but then unloaded bodies and salary over the summer,
because Arison didn't want to pay the luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   There went Anthony Mason and Bruce Bowen. Promising Ricky Davis
went to Cleveland for old Chris Gatling, whereupon Davis announced
that Riley couldn't coach young players.</TE>
<TE>   Now, according to the latest projections, the luxury tax won't
kick in this season.</TE>
<TE>   Get the idea that things weren't exactly going their way?</TE>
<TE>   Then Mourning, who has ongoing kidney problems, had trouble
getting his medication adjusted at the start of the season and the
next thing you knew, they were 5-23.</TE>
<TE>   Zo, the ultra-warrior, never made it all the way back and neither
did the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a playoff team," Riley said. "I think our team is good
enough to make the playoffs, and should have made the playoffs in the
Eastern Conference. It's not Zo. It's not anybody else. It's not
injuries, because we were healthy. We had a 24-10 run and then we
died. We hit the wall."</TE>
<TE>   So here they are, splattered all over the wall, wondering where
they go from here.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Riley has to worry about being fired. Arison has said
whatever happens is up to Riles.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's my choice?" Riley said. "Then you just heard my quote. I
like my job. I like this job, OK?</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if there's a groundswell of fans hanging me in effigy and
all of that, well, I'll consider it [leaving]."</TE>
<TE>   OK, but what then?</TE>
<TE>   Just how do you fix this, with no young players of note, no cap
room and Mourning due to become a free agent after next season? Riley
will have to start looking for a taker for the 32-year-old Mourning,
who will have to start looking for places he might like to go.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Mourning tries, but he just isn't quite Zo.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Riley kept him on the bench for the first 5:33 of the
fourth quarter, while the Heat, which had been behind by 15, came as
close as 73-71, and didn't put him back in until the Lakers had gone
back up by 11.</TE>
<TE>   Riley was asked Sunday evening what he'd do. Patch? Break them up?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll talk to you after the season about it," he said. "I can't
fix it today."</TE>
<TE>   The question is if he can ever fix it.</TE>
<TE>   He still has his health and his wealth, quite a bit of it, in
fact. But right at the moment, if you're looking for something to be
thankful for, be thankful you're not him.</TE>

<HD>This Is No Time to Relax</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Kings are fifth in playoff race, but nothing is
certain going into final week of regular season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Saturday morning in Detroit nearly five months ago, Coach Andy
Murray first told the Kings they would need 93 points to make the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, they were only hours away from a 4-2 loss to the
Detroit Red Wings that would leave them with a 5-11-1-2 record, 13
points in 19 games.</LD>
<LD>   They would need 80 more, Murray figured, in their last 63. A
struggling team that was six games under .500 at the time, in other
words, would have to play the rest of the season at 17 over.</LD>
<TE>   It was as if he had told them, "Oh, by the way, you might want to
prepare yourself: That marathon we're about to run will take us over
Mt. Everest."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, meeting without coaches before a game at St.
Paul, Minn., the players basically told themselves, "We'd better get
started."</TE>
<TE>   It must have seemed daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, it did," left wing Craig Johnson said Sunday. "We
knew we could do it, we still believed, but we knew we'd have to play
some unbelievable hockey."</TE>
<TE>   They ran in place for three weeks, going 3-3-3 in their next nine
games, but with a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Dec. 9
the Kings began a 30-11-7-2 surge, fashioning the NHL's best record
over the last four months.</TE>
<TE>   And with four games to play in the season's final seven days,
starting tonight against the Dallas Stars at Staples Center in the
finale of a four-game homestand, they are within two points of
Murray's magic number.</TE>
<TE>   But now, the coach has come to realize, "93 might not do it."</TE>
<TE>   Two points in four games--one victory, two ties or even two
overtime losses--might not be enough to get the Kings into the
Western Conference playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Their remaining schedule is loaded with potential landmines too:</TE>
<TE>   * The Stars and Vancouver Canucks, who they'll play Thursday night
at Vancouver, Canada, are struggling to remain in the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   * The San Jose Sharks, their opponents Saturday at San Jose, are
trying to win their first division championship and lock up the No. 2
seeding in the West. And, as if that weren't motivation enough,
they're 0-4 against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   * The Mighty Ducks, their opponents in Sunday's season finale at
Staples Center, are long out of the playoff picture but have warmed
to the role of spoilers in the last two weeks, defeating the Stars,
Phoenix Coyotes and Edmonton Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   Additional motivation: The Ducks are 0-3-1 against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have the toughest schedule of any of the teams left,"
Murray said Sunday, "but we've had the toughest [last] 20 games, the
toughest 15, the toughest 12, the toughest six."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the Kings control their future: "It's nice to be
able to say, 'Let's just win our games and take it from there.'"</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he doesn't usually set numeric goals for his teams but
that he believed the Kings' plight in mid-November demanded action.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just to try to put some immediate focus on that, we've got
to get it going right away here," he said. "I don't like ever putting
point totals on the board and saying, 'We need to get this.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I felt at that time we needed to have something tangible to
say, 'Hey, this is what it's going to take and we've got to get going
here.' We were setting a goal at that point of just getting into the
playoffs, and we felt with 93 we'd make it. I could have said 100
points, or whatever, but you've got to be somewhat realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "When you were playing at the level we were playing at, even to
get to 93 our winning percentage for the rest of the year had to be

<HD>Shaq Has Kidney, Liver Tests</HD>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal said Sunday that his frequent consumption of
anti-inflammatory medication caused him enough concern to have recent
diagnostic tests on his kidneys and liver.</LD>
<LD>   He provided little information, and even suggested his organs have
suffered some damage, but said he was satisfied with the results.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not great," he said, "but I'm cool."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the potential long-term complications--he's convinced
Alonzo Mourning's kidney ailment was caused by
anti-inflammatories--and his daily bouts with nausea, O'Neal has
taken Indocin for most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to stay off of them, but if I don't take them I can't
move or play," he said. "I was taking them. When my stomach was
giving me problems I had to get the test, the liver and kidney tests.
They came back OK. Not great, but they came back OK."</TE>
<TE>   He scored 40 points against the Miami Heat on Sunday, mostly
against Mourning, who had 15 points in 33 minutes but was overmatched
physically against O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously Zo is a different player," O'Neal said. "I'm sure he
fatigues a little bit faster because of all the medicine he's taking.
But he's a bigger man than I am. He has a lot of courage. I think
about if I had something like that, I don't know what I would do.
That he's still playing and still trying to win a championship shows
that he's a guy with a big heart. I commend him for that."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland called 56 consecutive games--the last
Sunday--while Chick Hearn recovered from heart and hip-replacement
surgeries. Hearn is expected to broadcast Tuesday's game against the
Utah Jazz at Staples Center. Sunderland will return to his regular
gigs, on the Laker pregame show for Fox Sports Net and broadcasting
playoff games for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "To be perfectly honest, I'm thinking the same way I have before
every game," Sunderland said Sunday before the Lakers played the
Miami Heat. "I've so looked forward to every game and so enjoyed
every quarter of every game, the last thing in the world I'd feel
right now is melancholy. Because I get to do the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience ... has been tremendous. How could it not be?"</TE>
<TE>   While Sunderland has become an easy choice to become the permanent
man when Hearn retires, he said he hasn't considered what those 56
games have done for his career. "That's something I haven't really
thought about," he said, "though this has certainly given me an
incredibly visible showcase."</TE>

<HD>Asteroid Offers a Plot Made for Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Discovered in 1950 and lost for half a century, the huge
rock has a 1-in-300 chance of hitting Earth with the force of
millions of tons of TNT, scientists say. But don't wait up for it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greatest known threat to Earth from outer space is an asteroid
barreling through the universe named 1950 DA. It is six times the
size of Morro Rock and capable of ending life as we know it.</LD>
<LD>   We are safe for the time being. So are our great-grandchildren.
And theirs. The space rock has a roughly 1-in-300 chance of smacking
the planet with the force of millions of tons of TNT and kicking up
enough dust to choke off life with a nuclear winter--on March 16,
2880.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not something to worry about," said Jon Giorgini, a Jet
Propulsion Laboratory engineer who led the team that analyzed the
asteroid and published its findings in this week's issue of the
journal Science. "That's 35 generations away."</LD>
<TE>   Rather than being seen as a potential disaster, the finding comes
as something of good news in a field better known for ominous
forecasts of planetary disasters. More than 1,000 large asteroids
capable of hitting Earth are circling through the solar system. Only
576 have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this thing could not hit until 2880. We can certify the
safety," said Steve Ostro, a JPL astronomer who studied the asteroid
using radar telescopes. "This is one object we're not losing sleep
over."</TE>
<TE>   1950 DA is about two-thirds of a mile wide. The projected impact
date falls on a Saturday. Talk about ruining a weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Its impact would generate enough energy to burn forests, spawn
huge tidal waves and turn the skies black. But it is far smaller than
the asteroid or comet that helped wipe out the dinosaurs 65 million
years ago: That one was about 10 miles across.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, astronomers can predict the track of an asteroid for
100 years--and can't say much about what will happen after that. So
many factors tweak an asteroid's path--from sunlight to the
gravitational tug of stars--that peering further into the future
becomes impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many uncertainties and they grow with time," Ostro
said.</TE>
<TE>   The JPL team was able to push forecasting limits to nearly 900
years using a blend of good fortune, detailed radar observations and
an awful lot of math.</TE>
<TE>   The good luck came in 1950, when the asteroid was observed for 17
days through an optical telescope. To optical telescopes that collect
light, dark asteroids are barely perceptible specks. But enough
information can be gained from these rough observations to pinpoint
their location relative to nearby stars.</TE>
<TE>   After that sighting, the asteroid was lost to science. It was not
sighted again until Dec. 31, 2000, when an astronomer at Arizona's
Lowell Observatory--who was working instead of ringing in the New
Year--saw the asteroid and deemed it a new discovery. Further
analysis showed the asteroid was good old 1950 DA, which had eluded
telescopes as it looped toward the solar system's outer reaches.</TE>
<TE>   The sightings so many years apart meant astronomers at JPL could
discern the current orbit of the asteroid. But the team needed to
know more about the rock's position and the rock itself.</TE>
<TE>   The group turned to Ostro and his colleagues, who used the
Goldstone Radar Telescope in the Mojave Desert in March 2001 to study
the rock.</TE>
<TE>   Radar telescopes like Goldstone glean information by bouncing
radio waves off an object. Because of this, they gather information
about dim objects that might escape optical telescopes, which rely on
light.</TE>
<TE>   The Goldstone radar dish gathered more specific information about
the asteroid's orbit and captured an image of the roughly spherical
object even though it was more than 4.8 million miles from Earth. The
orbit is expected to bring the rock close to Earth a dozen times, but
not uncomfortably close until 2880.</TE>
<TE>   The physical attributes of an asteroid determine its traveling
plans. The path can be affected by the rock's mass, shape and the way
it spins through space. The course of a rock is even altered by its
color, which influences the amount of heat it absorbs or reflects
from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Photons from the sun exert a gentle push on the asteroid, Giorgini
said. Heat re-radiating away from an asteroid exerts a push in the
opposite direction, like a weak rocket. These forces, known as the
Yarkovsky effect, are nearly imperceptible. But over time they can
nudge the trajectory of a giant rock by millions of miles.</TE>
<TE>   To refine predictions, Giorgini added a multitude of factors--from
the shrinking mass of the sun over time to the gravitational tug of
Earth, the other planets and even large asteroids--to his equations.
The result involved "trillions of calculations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like predicting a 15-bank shot in a pool game," he said. "It
draws on just about every aspect of astronomy, physics and computer
science that we know."</TE>
<TE>   The scientists plan to use the calculations on many more
near-Earth asteroids they discover and say predicting the fate of
space rocks for centuries could become more routine.</TE>
<TE>   The extra time could be put to good use if it becomes necessary to
protect Earth.</TE>
<TE>   If an asteroid is destined to pummel, say, Kansas in the next few
years, there are few technological remedies available now. The only
option would be to explode nuclear warheads near the rock in hopes of
generating enough force to alter its course, scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas: Pulling asteroids out of the way using lightweight
solar sails, pushing them off course with giant rockets that would
somehow be attached to the rocks as they fly by, or frying them with
massive mirrors. But don't hold your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Spitale, an astronomer at the University of Arizona,
suggests in an article in Science that harnessing the Yarkovsky
effect--that interplay of heat, light and motion on an asteroid's
path--may be a kinder, gentler way to steer rocks out of Earth's way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good candidate," Spitale said of 1950 DA. "It's big
enough to be dangerous and there's plenty of time to take advantage
of these effects."</TE>
<TE>   "If you have hundreds of years, all you have to do is slow a
threatening asteroid down or speed it up by less than 1 millimeter
per second to make it miss the Earth," said Donald K. Yeomans, who
manages NASA's Near Earth Objects program office at JPL. Asteroids
generally travel at speeds of several miles per second.</TE>
<TE>   Staying safe probably wouldn't require much more than changing the
roughness of the asteroid's surface with minimal explosives or making
the rock lighter or darker to change the amount of heat it radiates
into space, Spitale said.</TE>
<TE>   Suggestions on what to splash on the asteroid to alter its color
and reflectivity range from paint and chalk to powdered sugar--a
suggestion proposed by Italian astronomer Andrea Milani as a "sweet
solution."</TE>

<LD>What is an asteroid?</LD>
<LD>   An asteroid is a big rock, often called a minor planet, that
circles the sun. Asteroids are leftover material from the formation
of the solar system and range from 580 miles across to the size of
large boulders.</LD>
<LD>   How are asteroids different from comets? Or meteors?</LD>
<TE>   Comets are large blobs of ice and dust that streak across the sky.
Meteoroids--as meteors are known while in deep space--are small
objects, usually fragments of asteroids. When they enter Earth's
atmosphere and produce a flash of light, they are called meteors.
Meteorites are what these same rocks are called once they have fallen
to the surface of the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   How large are the craters that space rocks produce?</TE>
<TE>   Craters are much larger than the falling asteroids or comets that
produce them because of the explosive force generated by the impact.
For example, the 10-mile-diameter asteroid or comet that helped kill
off the dinosaurs left a 110-mile-wide crater in the Yucatan.</TE>

<TE>   Brain-Implanted Pellets May Aid Stroke Victims</TE>
<TE>   Implanting tiny pellets of medicine into the brain may prevent a
potentially dangerous complication that often affects victims of a
certain type of stroke, Japanese researchers reported in the April 4
publication Stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who undergo surgery to repair ruptured blood vessels
after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or SAH, often develop a vasospasm,
in which arteries in the head shrink, starving the brain of blood. A
vasospasm is most likely to cause brain damage but can sometimes be
deadly.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 20 SAH patients, researchers inserted two to 10
pellets the size of a grain of rice next to arteries that they
suspected would develop vasospasms. The pellets contained
nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker often used to treat high blood
pressure. In every case, arteries next to the pellets developed no
vasospasms.</TE>

<LD>Scientists have cast doubt on claims that genetically modified corn
has contaminated wild maize grown in a remote area of Mexico. Ignacio
Chapela and David Quist of UC Berkeley had reported in the journal
Nature about finding traces of transgenic DNA in the maize. The
research sparked calls for a global ban on genetically modified
crops. But other researchers said last week that the study was flawed
and the conclusions wrong. The editors of Nature said the study
should never have been published because of flaws in its methodology.</LD>

<LD>Q: My 7-year-old wants to know if there are more worms on the Earth

<LD>   A: Yes, indeed. Worms in soil can be brought to the surface for
counting by sprinkling it with a potassium permanganate solution or a
pepper extract. In 1877, Charles Darwin cited German studies showing
that there are about 53,800 worms per acre. With a global human
population of about 6 billion, that means there are as many
earthworms in about 175 square miles as there are people on Earth.</LD>

<HD>Albert F. Canwell, 95; Anti-Communist Zealot</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert F. Canwell, a one-term Washington state legislator and
anti-communist zealot who helped set the national stage for
McCarthyism, has died at age 95.</LD>
<LD>   Canwell died April 1 in his native Spokane of unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   In 1948, Canwell conducted the first nationally publicized
hearings into anti-communist activity, well ahead of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, whom he claimed to have befriended and tutored.</LD>
<TE>   "I was helpful to [McCarthy] in selecting targets. He wasn't the
expert I was [in 1948] but he was a quick learner," Canwell told the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1998, the 50th anniversary of his
notorious hearings.</TE>
<TE>   As his own state Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American
Activities began to earn national attention, Canwell also visited
California to tutor a committee that the state set up akin to
Washington's.</TE>
<TE>   Canwell's primary focus was the University of Washington. His
red-baiting, iron-fisted "Canwell Committee" subpoenaed 40 professors
and questioned 11 during five days of searing hearings in July 1948
in the former Seattle Armory.</TE>
<TE>   Three professors--Ralph Gundlach, Joe Butterworth and Herbert
Phillips--refused to testify and were held in contempt. All were
fired and never taught again.</TE>
<TE>   Gundlach, a social psychologist, spent 30 days in jail, then moved
to New York, where he became a successful psychiatrist. He died in
London in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, a philosophy professor, became a dairy farm laborer and
dockworker, dying in San Francisco at age 56.</TE>
<TE>   Butterworth, an English instructor, fell into alcoholism and
poverty and died in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Guthman, former national editor of the Los Angeles Times and
now a professor of journalism at USC, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1950
for his stories in the Seattle Times vindicating another accused
professor, Mel Rader, who wrote a book about his own experience,
"False Witness."</TE>
<TE>   Canwell also questioned and, when they refused to testify, held in
contempt Burton and Florence James, founders of the University of
Washington area's Repertory Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Burton died of a heart attack shortly after the hearings, Florence
was fined $125, and the theater closed--victims of the anti-communist
crusade.</TE>
<TE>   Canwell, who in 1997 provided the 400-page "Albert F. Canwell: An
Oral History" available through the Washington secretary of state's
office, remained unrepentant.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no time that we went overboard. I didn't accuse anybody
who wasn't guilty as hell," he told the Spokane Spokesman-Review in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'd do it the same way. I might
have even been a little harsher on those individuals. I have no
apologies," he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that year.</TE>
<TE>   And for the Seattle Times, he added: "I haven't any desire to be
remembered or not be remembered. I came and left. I did the job the
way I think I'd do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Canwell grew up around Spokane, working on eastern Washington's
farms and orchards.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping out of Gonzaga University, he became an itinerant
journalist during the Depression, working in Yakima, Spokane and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   While reporting on labor strikes, he became convinced that
Communists were taking control of unions and began keeping files on
people he suspected.</TE>
<TE>   He stepped up his surveillance when he joined the Spokane
Sheriff's Office and worked with other local and federal agents on
the "Red Squad" tracking radicals.</TE>
<TE>   Canwell had no intention of becoming a politician, but after a
"somebody ought to do something" chat with his friend, Spokane
Spokesman-Review columnist Ashley Holden, he found himself mentioned
in Holden's column as a candidate for the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican in a Democratic district, he did not expect to win,
spent little on his campaign and kept his promises simple: no new
taxes and "do something about the communists in Washington state." He
won.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities
was established in 1947, Canwell became its obvious chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Although his single four-year term gained Canwell widespread and
enduring fame--or infamy--it did not launch a long political career.</TE>
<TE>   He stood for election four more times--to the state Senate, the
U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives--but never won,
despite campaign help from such figures as the young U.S. Sen.
Richard M. Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   Canwell went home to Spokane and spent the remainder of his
working life running a private security business and a bookstore.</TE>

<HD>Dear Professor: The Only Way to Change Politics Is to
Participate in Politics</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   There I was, lounging lazily on a sunny deck overlooking Lake
Tahoe, when my eyes fixed on a jarring commentary in the Sacramento
Bee. A retired college professor was urging people to boycott voting
so they could grab the attention of politicians.</LD>
<LD>   How naive, I thought. It made my sunburn turn redder.</LD>
<TE>   What especially irritated me was the guy's e-mail address: csus.
edu. Cal State Sacramento. Here's some academic who has been eating
out of the public trough, I figured, but doesn't want the public to
help decide how that trough is used.</TE>
<TE>   He denounces a democratic process that has provided him with
generous public benefits and California with a first-rate, affordable
university system. He wants to boycott the ballot booth and thereby
surrender the electoral process to voters who conceivably couldn't
care less about CSU, but would spend their tax money on, say,
playpens for super-rich pro athletes--or widening corporate
loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that is not the end result envisioned by retired
biology professor Emil Bernstein. He merely wants to send politicians
a message: We're fed up.</TE>
<TE>   This is what he wrote, in part, for the newspaper's opinion page:</TE>
<TE>   "Every two years we are told it is Americans' duty to cast their
ballots--not just a right or privilege, mind you, but a duty ...</TE>
<TE>   "Did it ever occur to editors that the nonparticipating electorate
is delivering its own message to political parties and candidates?
We, the people, are fed up with lies and broken promises. Why vote
for either candidate when all are thick as thieves?</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the candidates are men and women who sell their services
to the highest bidders . . .</TE>
<TE>   "The electorate should stop voting en masse.... We should stop
whining for 'campaign finance reform' and demand an end to what we
really have: bribery. Like the civil rights actions taken against
segregated buses and lunch counters in the 1960s, a national voter
boycott must be organized ...</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a national boycott would get Congress' attention."</TE>
<TE>   There's already practically a boycott, given that only 24% of
voting-age citizens cast ballots in the California primary. Others
clearly share Bernstein's dismal view of politics.</TE>
<TE>   After returning from vacation, I called the professor. He's a
pleasant-sounding man, 72, who taught at the universities of
Connecticut and Maryland before moving to Sacramento. Here, he has
instructed part time at community colleges and has e-mail privileges
at Sac State. He's a lifelong political activist, especially for
campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   The reform bill just signed by President Bush is "namby-pamby,"
the Democrat contends. He wants partial public financing of
congressional and state races--but no tax money for negative ads--and
lower ceilings on private contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all for voting and I'm not lazy," he asserts. "But when an
idiot out of nowhere like [Bill] Simon can buy himself that
[Republican] nomination and when an idiot [Gov. Gray] Davis from the
opposite party can spend millions to influence the Republican
primary, we don't have democracy anyway. It's an illusion ...</TE>
<TE>   "People shouldn't vote until politicians clean up their act."</TE>
<TE>   By his criteria, however, that could mean never voting again.</TE>
<TE>   There'd definitely need to be some new 1st Amendment
interpretations by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding money and speech.</TE>
<TE>   Professor, they're not all "thick as thieves." But that aside, the
only way to change politics is to participate in politics. People who
don't get no attention.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't vote and if you don't give money, then you're
totally ignored [by politicians]," says Darry Sragow, a Democratic
campaign consultant. "If you're not going to help decide the result
of my next race, I'm not going to have any time for you."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, candidates often plot to turn off people from voting who
are likely to support their opponent. One aim of negative ads is to
sicken people on politics.</TE>
<TE>   Those 69% of registered Democrats who stiffed the March primary?
Simon will try to goad them into also stiffing the November election
by denigrating Davis. A Bernstein boycott would suit Simon fine.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has the opposite problem. He'll try to demonize Simon and
convince Democrats disenchanted with his governorship that they can't
trust their fates to this untested conservative. Davis has his work
cut out with the professor.</TE>
<TE>   No law requires a citizen to vote. But the law does require that
some politician be elected--even if it's only by his wife, mom and
guru.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons why people don't vote: lazy, disgusted,
indifferent, ill. It's inconvenient. They're sending a message. But
don't expect any politician to care after election day. No-shows draw
no attention.</TE>

<HD>Outlook May Be Brighter for Chief</HD>
<DH>Police: Some observers say intensity of the review process
suggests commissioners remain open to the possibility of
reappointment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced he opposed a new term
for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, many assumed the chief's fate was
sealed: that he would be ousted, even though the decision rested with
the Police Commission, not Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   But this week, as the commission enters what probably will be its
final days of deliberations on Parks' future, some observers say the
intensity of the sessions might suggest a possible surprise. "Maybe
I'm naive," said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League
and a Parks supporter.</LD>
<LD>   Many people still see Parks' chances as slim. But the chief, for
his part, said, "I feel good about my chances," adding that he is
pleased the commission saw that "the issues are very complex."</LD>
<TE>   All five commissioners say they are still undecided, and
three--Rick Caruso, David Cunningham and Silvia Saucedo--described
themselves in various states of inner conflict. "Definitely, one of
the toughest decisions I will have to make," said Saucedo, 28, a
lawyer in her first stint on a city board.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth member, Rose Ochi, said she has not made up her mind
either. And the fifth, Bert Boeckmann, while acknowledging he has a
good idea of how he will vote, said he doesn't understand why anyone
would be certain that members' minds are made up. After all, he said,
with the vehement partisans on both sides, "it's a no-win deal either
way."</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, there were still people, both inside and outside
the department, who remained skeptical that the commission's process
is anything more than a formality.</TE>
<TE>   But some close to the commission say that its members are
wrestling with a number of questions: Parks knows the department like
the back of his hand, but can he lead and inspire? He is a strong
boss, but is he too stubborn and inflexible?</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Caruso said a "rambunctious," closed-session
argument followed the lengthy interview with the chief last week.
It's not the considerable political heat that is getting to them,
commissioners insist, but rather the vexing personality and
management style of the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Even as commissioners have extended their closed-session
deliberations into this week, they say the man whose job is on the
line has done virtually nothing to curry their favor. His refusal to
do so leaves some commissioners--who view the process as an extended
job interview--shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-hour interview over two consecutive days began with an
awkward discussion about whether the chief could have a lawyer
present. After the lawyer left, the session progressed in the
businesslike manner that commission meetings regularly do, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the room said Parks appeared more relaxed and convinced of
commissioners' sincerity as time wore on.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, the chief presented point-by-point responses on
each of eight performance criteria on which the commissioners said
they would judge him, fielded a barrage of questions and entered into
new discussion topics raised by them.</TE>
<TE>   Parks used as reference an inch-thick binder of materials he had
prepared, mostly devoted to explaining the efforts he has made to
change LAPD organization, procedures and policies.</TE>
<TE>   The largest section extends more than dozen pages on at least 20
topics under subheads, ranging from tougher policies against false
statements to the creation of an audit division. It covers his
efforts to respond to the Christopher Commission, the 1991 report
exploring LAPD racism and brutality after the beating of motorist
Rodney King, and assorted other reform mandates.</TE>
<TE>   The report also promises commissioners that he would "maintain
advances" in his "reform agenda" among his goals, meaning that much
of the work had already begun.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said the material was mostly familiar, presented to
them in previous reports. But they went home with stacks of new
papers to study.</TE>
<TE>   After his presentation, Parks said commissioners "were very
interested in the system. There was a lot of note-taking. I was very
gratified to see that."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had been businesslike, as he always is, before the
commission and made no special effort to charm. "I would not want to
be in a situation where commissioners see me as their buddy," he
said. "These are situations and relationships that are very
professional."</TE>
<TE>   Such an outlook is vintage Parks. Often asserting that he is only
interested in doing "the right things for the right reasons," Parks
said, "I don't ingratiate myself."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in ingratiating myself to gain favor," he said.
"The way to gain favor is the way you do your job."</TE>
<TE>   Those who think otherwise, he added, "are often the people who
bring the least substance to the job."</TE>
<TE>   Parks is credited, even by his enemies, with a relentless work
ethic and an insider's knowledge of the LAPD that is second to none.
He is faulted for not being open to suggestion, for stifling dissent,
for being too dogmatic. He is not, said former LAPD Chief Ed Davis,
"over-endowed with humility."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' signature style is almost universally described as
pedantic. In public, he often appears stiff. He is grandiloquent,
rather than eloquent, tending to make his sentences more
grammatically complex than they need to be. His diction is so
measured that some accuse him of droning. He conveys passion mainly
by talking faster.</TE>
<TE>   For the civilian overseers judging his fitness for the job, the
issue of Parks' receptivity to outsiders is key. They are looking for
signs the chief will adapt to their vision of good leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The rub comes on issues such as officer morale.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners want Parks to aggressively pursue the raising of
morale. Parks disagrees with the premise of the question, arguing
that reforms to the LAPD's discipline system have been a priority of
both his and his overseers--and "reforms are what officers are upset
about."</TE>
<TE>   In the view of Mayor Hahn, the most important reform mandate is
"the willingness of the LAPD, and particularly the chief ... to
accept the fact that they are answerable to civilian control." And
under Parks, Hahn has concluded, the LAPD has "an us-versus-them
mentality."</TE>
<TE>   That picture is at odds with the view of Parks inside the LAPD.
Outside, Parks is sometimes described as the rigid defender of the
status quo. But inside, his underlings insist it's the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Parks and many who work under him say he has worked furiously at
implementing myriad changes. By the same token, people close to Parks
believe his initial opposition to the 2000 consent decree--an
agreement with the federal government to reform the department--was
less out of resistance than injured pride: He thought the LAPD
deserved praise for crafting reform without being told, but felt no
one would acknowledge this.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said they want to make their decision on Parks'
reappointment about merits, and now they have abundant material with
which to do so.</TE>
<TE>   But it remained unclear last week whether this would really render
their decision any easier.</TE>
<TE>   The Parks they saw was a Parks they already knew: a hard worker, a
reformer and a problematic leader. The commissioners, Ochi said, "are
agonizing."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Grapple With Mixed Feelings on Church Scandals</HD>
<DH>Religion: Some blame the news media as priests address
allegations against Mahony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON, CHRISTINE HANLEY and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southland Roman Catholics wrestled with conflicting feelings about
the sexual-abuse scandal rocking their church, while several priests
used their pulpit Sunday to direct harsh words at the media for its
reporting on the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   In the first congregational gatherings since an accusation against
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony surfaced Friday, some of the homilies
tailored around the story of "Doubting Thomas" were laced with
skepticism on the means and motives of those who revealed the details
of the allegation.</LD>
<LD>   Two priests implied that the media had stolen a series of internal
church e-mails, which contained a Fresno woman's unproved allegation
of abuse by Mahony 32 years ago, as well as the prelate's ruminations
on what he called his archdiocese's "huge mistake" for not promptly
revealing to authorities the names of priests accused of molesting
minors. Eight priests had been fired in February, but as recently as
March 27, the hierarchy had not provided authorities with full
identification of three of the accused.</LD>
<TE>   "The church is being persecuted by the media," the Rev. Msgr.
Padraic Loftus of St. Mel Parish in Woodland Hills told about 300
parishioners. "They didn't let up during Holy Week .... Our cardinal
is viciously attacked and publicly humiliated. One must ask why? ....
Is it a deep-seated anti-Catholic attitude? Is it prejudice? Is it
even hatred?"</TE>
<TE>   Loftus asked the congregants to deal with the issue through
"prayer, education, justice, healing, forgiveness and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only the abused who suffer," Loftus said. "Our cardinal
is also suffering greatly. Priests who have dedicated their whole
lives are suffering. All Catholics are suffering because the church
is the body of Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners gave Loftus mixed reviews. "I was hoping he [Loftus]
would take full responsibility before he blamed others," said Wayne
Bradshaw of Woodland Hills, who has been attending St. Mel's with his
wife and young daughter for three years. "To point it at the media is
a little shaky."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Trabold, a Woodland Hills resident and 23-year St. Mel's
parishioner, dismissed the Fresno woman's allegations that Mahony
molested her 32 years ago, and praised the cleric's handling of the
larger scandal. "Mahony is doing a good job," Trabold said. "It's a
tough spot to be in."</TE>
<TE>   Trabold's comments on the newest allegations were echoed Sunday by
congregants from Camarillo to Balboa Island. The woman who made the
charges told The Times that she suffered from schizophrenia, and her
accounts of the alleged incident were short on detail.</TE>
<TE>   A priest who first heard the woman's allegations told the
Associated Press on Sunday he believes the claim is false.</TE>
<TE>   "She claimed that happened with 40 different youths watching,"
said Msgr. John Esquivel after leading mass at St. John's Cathedral
in Fresno. "There's no way that is going to happen in front of all
those people. I don't believe the allegations are true."</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The vicar at Eagle Rock's St. Dominic Church, the Rev. Christopher
Terry accused the media of "yellow journalism" for its treatment of
the accusations against the cardinal, according to a parishioner. The
e-mails that revealed the Mahony allegation were stolen, he added,
though he did not specify by whom, the parishioner reported.</TE>
<TE>   At Padre Serra Catholic Church in Camarillo, a visiting priest,
who briefly referred to the scandal during his sermon, afterward
berated media outlets for publicizing the Mahony e-mails, which were
obtained by radio station KFI, and passed on to the Los Angeles
Times. The archdiocese took The Times to court late Thursday in an
unsuccessful attempt to prevent their publication.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really mad at the L.A. Times," said the priest, who requested
anonymity. "Those e-mails are stolen property. To take something that
is protected under attorney-client privilege is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   During the two masses he celebrated at St. John Vianney Chapel on
Balboa Island in Newport Beach, Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, who was
accused of an improper sexual advance toward a female parishioner,
frequently alluded to the scandal, comparing it to a "crisis in
faith" similar to the stubborn doubtfulness of St. Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Baird thanked the congregation for its supportive e-mails, phone
calls and letters, but did not address the accusations made against
him and later refused to comment further on it. "The statement I made
at the press conference earlier this week is the only comment I'm
making," Baird said between services.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were leveled last week by Lori Haigh, who won a
million-dollar settlement from the Catholic Church last Monday for a
relationship she had with a priest 20 years ago while she was a
minor. Haigh says Baird kissed, hugged and rubbed against her after
she reported the relationship to him.</TE>
<TE>   A high-profile spokesman for the Diocese of Orange, Baird has
denied the allegations and threatened Haigh with a defamation of
character lawsuit, saying he did not remember meeting her and did not
engage in inappropriate contact with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe it at all," Rose Gramme, 42, said of the
accusations leveled at the popular Baird. "He's not like that. He
would never do anything like that. He's well-educated, articulate and
truthful."</TE>
<TE>   Joan Marie Fredericks, 81, said she was appalled with the way the
church is handling sexual-abuse allegations. "This has been going on
such a long time," said Fredericks, of Michigan, who was visiting her
son's family. "They haven't responded quick enough. Those priests who
committed those terrible sins, and took away children's innocence,
they should have been stopped years and years ago."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, the Rev. Paul Fitzpatrick cautioned about 400
parishioners at St. Monica's Church. "Don't judge too quick--be
open."</TE>
<TE>   As they shuffled out of the church, many parishioners said they
were content with how the matter was being handled by their parish
and the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt my faith or my church because of this," said John
Vanderloop, a retired mechanic in Santa Monica. "Within the church
walls, everyone is talking about it, examining what has gone
on--that's a good thing," he said. "There are so many more positive
things that the priests have done quietly, out of the public eye,
with no attention. You have some who are flawed, they need to be
dealt with, but that doesn't take away from all of the good so many
have done."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Marc Trudeau told a congregation of more than 700 people
at St. Pius X in Santa Fe Springs, "This is painful for all of us,
but the important thing is that we always know what our mission is.
The end will be positive, and like Cardinal Mahony said, it will be a
'purification of the church.'"</TE>
<TE>   For parishioner Sandra Garcia of Santa Fe Springs, the process
can't move fast enough. "I want to see it resolved and get back to
normal. I'm tired about hearing all the bad things that people are
saying about the Catholic Church," Garcia said.</TE>

<HD>New Commander for 40th Infantry</HD>
<DH>Military: Maj. Gen. Jeffrey L. Gidley takes over state's
largest National Guard unit from retiring Maj. Gen. Peter J. Gravett.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maj. Gen. Jeffrey L. Gidley, who flew rescue missions as a helicopter
pilot during the Vietnam War and led medical troops during the Gulf
War, was named Sunday to lead California's largest National Guard
division.</LD>
<LD>   Gidley, 54, became the 26th commanding general of the 40th
Infantry Division during a ceremony at the Joint Task Training Base
in Los Alamitos, succeeding Maj. Gen. Peter J. Gravett, who is
retiring.</LD>
<LD>   "I am overwhelmed with the scope and challenge presented by this
assignment and as I reflect on all of the commanders who have come
before me," Gidley said during his speech.</LD>
<TE>   "It is an honor and privilege to stand now as one of those chosen
to lead this great division."</TE>
<TE>   Gidley, who earned biology degrees at UC Davis and Cal State
Sacramento, joined the military in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he was assigned to the 237th Medical Detachment Qui
Nhon in the Republic of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   He spent about a year there, transporting wounded soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to battle in 1990, commanding the 980th Medical
Logistics Battalion in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Gidley, who was most recently deputy commander of maneuvers for
the 40th Infantry Division, will be in charge of 12,500 soldiers in
130 units, most of them based in California.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 40th Infantry forces are deployed to fight the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women protect California airports and bridges, the Mexican
border and military depots in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Gidley lives in Fair Oaks, and is chief of finance and
administration at the Emergency Medical Services Authority, a state
agency in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He said he plans to shuffle his schedule to be at Los Alamitos
once or twice each week.</TE>
<TE>   "This position is going to require me to be here more often," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gravett began his military career in 1968 and became commanding
general in July 1999.</TE>

<HD>Crime Rate Falls for 10th Straight Year</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: In contrast to state and national trends,
the area posts a 3% drop, continuing its reputation for safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's crime rate fell for the 10th straight year in 2001,
defying state and national trends and buttressing the affluent
county's rank as the safest urban area in the West.</LD>
<LD>   Reported offenses dropped 3% last year, including steep declines
in homicide, rape and felony assault, as the county's crime rate
plummeted to half its peak in 1991, a Times analysis shows.</LD>
<LD>   The rate of criminal offenses in the county, one of California's
richest, dipped to 22 per 1,000 residents.</LD>
<TE>   By comparison, the California crime rate was 37 offenses per 1,000
residents, and the U.S. rate was 41, in the most recent reports. A
new survey of crime in the state's large cities showed about a 6%
increase in 2001, while crime in the nation leveled off after a
decade of decline.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ventura County, we tend to pay a lot of attention to crimes at
the lower end of the spectrum, misdemeanors and vandalism, that are
ignored in other jurisdictions," Sheriff Bob Brooks said. "We
prosecute those crimes and that keeps them from becoming larger
ones."</TE>
<TE>   The county also benefits from an unusually strong economy,
involved citizens who regularly supplement police patrols and special
enforcement squads that quash youth gangs and attack emerging
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Total offenses in the county's 10 cities and its unincorporated
areas dropped by 540 last year to 16,994, compared with more than
30,000 a decade ago, when the county had far fewer residents. Felony
violence was off 6.8% in 2001 compared with the year before, and
property crime was down 2.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers reflect crime in eight categories reported annually to
the FBI--homicide, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, theft,
auto theft and arson.</TE>
<TE>   Crime dropped in seven local cities but increased 13% in Santa
Paula and 5.5% in Camarillo, partly because of surges in violence,
and 2.8% in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Declines were most dramatic in the county's smallest
cities--Fillmore, Port Hueneme and Ojai, where offenses were off from
12% to 18%.</TE>
<TE>   The white-collar commuter enclaves of the east county were far
safer than the cities of the agricultural west, which are more
reflective of California as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, 32,000-resident Moorpark was the county's safest city
and among the safest in the state, with a crime rate of fewer than 10
offenses per 1,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Moorpark is a very, very involved community with crime
prevention," said Brooks, whose department polices that upscale city.
"We have a high level of citizen volunteers. And, like many of the
residents in this county, they came here to improve the quality of
life. They came here with high expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly as safe were Moorpark's east county neighbors, Simi Valley
and Thousand Oaks, which regularly rank nationally as the two safest
cities with at least 100,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Crime was up slightly in Simi Valley, because of a string of
high-profile homicides.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough year," Police Chief Randy Adams said. "But these
weren't random acts of violence. They were individual acts of
terrorism directed at someone they knew."</TE>
<TE>   Crime was down slightly in Thousand Oaks because of a reduction in
burglaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to be safer, and that's driven by the involvement of
people who are not afraid to call the police," said Sheriff's Cmdr.
Keith Parks, who serves as the Thousand Oaks police chief.</TE>
<TE>   In actual numbers, Oxnard, the county's largest city, had the
biggest decrease, with 400 fewer offenses reported in 2001 than the
year before. The 7% drop accounted for three-fourths of the county's
crime loss.</TE>
<TE>   Yet blue-collar Oxnard still had 31% of the county's crime and 41%
of its violence, although its 178,000 residents make up just 23% of
the local population.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a large city," said Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, "so we
do have some active gangs and some characteristics of larger cities.
But when you look at cities our size, our figures really aren't too
shabby."</TE>
<TE>   Even before last year's reductions, Oxnard ranked as the fifth
safest of 43 U.S. cities with populations between 150,000 and
200,000, according to a Police Department analysis.</TE>
<TE>   While crime keeps dropping in Oxnard--its rate is off 56% from a
decade ago--robberies increased to 393 in 2001 from 375 the year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Victims are often farm workers who do not have adequate
identification to set up bank accounts and often carry large amounts
of cash on paydays. Lopez said he met last week with the Mexican
consul in Oxnard to try to create an ID card for Mexican nationals
that would be accepted by local banks.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity is there for street thugs to take advantage of
some of the less fortunate," Lopez said. "People are not as well
educated as we'd like to see them, and they make good targets. So
we're trying to harden the target."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura reported 3,370 offenses, compared with 5,300 in Oxnard,
but had the most crimes per resident in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's crime rate of 32.9 offenses per 1,000 residents is
slightly higher than Oxnard's and Santa Paula's. But when violence
alone is considered, Ventura's rate is far lower than its two closest
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura rate of violence last year was 2.7 crimes per 1,000
residents, compared with 4.6 in Oxnard and 4.3 in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Total crime in Ventura was almost the same as in 2000, down just
three offenses. But violence fell 18% in 2001, as felony assaults
dropped from 230 to 160.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a very successful gang violence suppression program,"
Ventura Police Lt. John Garner said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula--a farming community of about 29,000 residents--had
the biggest increase in crime. Offenses were up nearly 13%, with
increases in six of eight criminal categories, especially robbery and
theft.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Robert Gonzales said crime is closely tied to the
number of drug addicts and career criminals on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on who's out and who's in [prison]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula recently announced receipt of a $1-million federal
grant to fight crime and build a base of community activities in one
crime-plagued portion of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this grant will create an opportunity for education
and training for those who are involved in crime and drugs," Gonzales
said.</TE>

<TE>   The Ventura rate of violence last year was 2.7 crimes per 1,000
residents, compared with 4.6 in Oxnard and 4.3 in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Total crime in Ventura was almost the same as in 2000, down just
three offenses. But violence fell 18% in 2001, as felony assaults
dropped from 230 to 160.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a very successful gang violence suppression program,"
Ventura Police Lt. John Garner said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula--a farming community of about 29,000 residents--had
the biggest increase in crime. Offenses were up nearly 13%, with
increases in six of eight criminal categories, especially robbery and
theft.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Robert Gonzales said crime is closely tied to the
number of drug addicts and career criminals on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on who's out and who's in [prison]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula recently announced receipt of a $1-million federal
grant to fight crime and build a base of community activities in one
crime-plagued portion of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this grant will create an opportunity for education
and training for those who are involved in crime and drugs," Gonzales
said.</TE>

<HD>Debate Team a Power in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Speech: Forensic team from Saddleback, Irvine colleges
beats some of the nation's biggest schools. Next goal: the division
title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The keys to success are the same in athletics and forensics--smart
recruiting and good coaching. On the baseball diamond, football field
or basketball court, community colleges are no match for such storied
four-year institutions as Notre Dame and USC. But in forensics, it's
quite a different story.</LD>
<LD>   Coaches aren't looking for the biggest or strongest or the
fastest. They want the brightest, most motivated and most effective
communicators.</LD>
<LD>   And if the final standings of the National Parliamentary Debate
Assn. are any indication, the South Orange County Community College
debate team is near the top of the heap.</LD>
<TE>   The debate team, comprising students from Saddleback and Irvine
Valley colleges, finished fourth in the yearlong national
competition, ahead of Notre Dame, Oregon and Florida. Only UC
Berkeley, the Air Force Academy and Point Loma Nazarene University
finished ahead of southern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The debate team competes this week in Fort Worth, Tex., for the
national community college title. But Coach Larry Radden is thinking
about next year's squad.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be in a constant mode of recruiting," said Radden,
who has taught forensics at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo for
eight years. "And you have to somehow find the people with inherent
ability from the school's regular classes that we're teaching. If
you've got the ability and the tenaciousness to succeed, I can work
with that."</TE>
<TE>   For Radden and his other five coaches, the work seems to never
end. Radden figures he spends at least 45 hours a week preparing
students for their next competition through research and practice
sessions. That doesn't include his full-time teaching schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coaches overextend themselves," said Erin Rice, who recently
won a silver medal at the state community college championships. "I'm
sure if they broke down their salary, they'd make about a dollar an
hour."</TE>
<TE>   Most top debaters have schedules that are just as grueling. Rice
estimates she spends 20 to 25 hours a week on forensics. Each week,
she meets for 30 minutes with each of her six coaches. In spring,
when tournaments take place nearly every other week, her life is
essentially consumed with the debate team. "It's not for everybody,"
the Irvine Valley College sophomore said. "If you aspire to be good,
you can be good. With all the time we put in, it's almost like we're
members of some athletic team."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday afternoon, Rice prepared for the national tournament
by giving a 10-minute analysis about the U.S. government's policy on
controlling the AIDS epidemic. During her speech, Rice was often
encouraged by Radden to "show more empathy" or to "watch what your
hands are doing."</TE>
<TE>   "They can be tough on you," Rice said. "I cry all the time. But
they're just trying to get the most out of you."</TE>
<TE>   Rice didn't see herself as a debater until she took a beginning
speech class as a freshman. But it wasn't long before she realized
she had found her passion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally outgoing," she said. "I never shut up. Forensics gave
me a forum to express myself."</TE>
<TE>   It also convinced her that she could become a pretty good
attorney. So after one year on the debate team, Rice changed her
major from liberal arts to pre-law. Gary Rybold, Irvine Valley's
co-director of forensics, said it's no accident that many of his best
orators are pre-law students.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the most highly motivated people," he said. "They want
to excel."</TE>
<TE>   Rybold also finds that his best debaters are former high school
student-body presidents, drama students or simply the loudmouth in
the hall. Rybold also found Rebekah Baker in a beginning speech
class. An experienced actor who has appeared in a children's movie
and dozens of plays, Baker had no forensics training.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea what I was getting into," said Baker, a sophomore
who specializes in interpretation of literature. "It's tons of work.
You have to sacrifice your job and your family."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who is interested in a career as a radio producer, said she
had a difficult time adjusting to the strict rules of forensics
competition. In the interpretive presentations, competitors must hold
the book they are reading a certain way, their arm movement is
limited and they can't stride around the room as they speak. And
crying is not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "You can build up to a cry," Baker said. "But you can't show
tears."</TE>
<TE>   During parliamentary debate practice, there were no tears. But
there were plenty of terse exchanges between members of the
two-person teams arguing the pros and cons of universal health care
in America. Rybold, whose specialty is parliamentary debate, knows
health care could be one of the topics this week in Texas, and he
wants his students prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably have researched about 80 current-event issues by
the time competition begins," Rybold said. "And we'll have gone over
1,000 pieces of evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Taylor, the forensics coach at Cal State Long Beach, said the
dedication of South Orange County's coaches has a lot to do with the
team's success.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a heck of a lot to do with the teachers at those
institutions," said Taylor, whose team finished eighth in the
national competition. "They make a huge investment in their kids and
the programs. They make these kids feel like someone cares about them
in ways that make them exceed their potential."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Taylor says, team titles and individual gold medals are
only a few of the benefits that forensics competitors receive. The
rest come later in life.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are exposed to so many different ideas and solutions,"
Taylor said. "It's easy to see problems, but very hard to solve them.
In forensics, students see that it takes time and the patience to
work through solutions. It's a great activity that teaches you so
much, but also introduces you to a world of possibilities. Not only
do they know the world can be better, they know they can have a role
in making it better."</TE>

<HD>It's a Do-It-Yourself Era for Budding Benefactors</HD>
<DH>Charity: More donors of relatively modest means are setting
up their own nonprofit foundations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Miller's investment strategy was fittingly modest for a man
who has spent more than 50 years tuning pianos: Just set aside a
little money on a regular basis and hope for the best.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy worked. Even after the ongoing stock market troubles,
Miller's portfolio is worth nearly $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Which was really kind of a surprise," Miller said. "This isn't
the kind of occupation you make a lot of money in....Fortunately,
those [stocks] that we invested in turned out to be mostly pretty
good."</LD>
<TE>   Now comes the fun part: giving it all away.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Miller and his wife, Pauline, both in their 80s,
created a nonprofit family foundation in Mission Viejo, joining a
national trend that made the 1990s a decade of unprecedented giving.</TE>
<TE>   Two of five foundations with assets of more than $1 million began
in the '90s, fueled by huge increases in personal wealth and a desire
by donors to exert more control over their philanthropy, foundation
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the number of foundations grew to 56,582 in 2000, up
12.7% from the prior year, the largest single-year increase since
1975, according to estimates released last week by the Foundation
Center, a national organization that analyzes foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of them are small--I would say the majority are
under $1 million in assets and are giving less than $100,000 [in
grants]," said Loren Renz, vice president for research at the
Foundation Center.</TE>
<TE>   That continues a long-running trend in which more than 60% of
foundations have assets of less than $1 million, according to the
center's statistics. In 1999, the last year for which such figures
have been analyzed, only 48 foundations had assets of more than $1
billion, but were responsible for 24% of grants.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those large foundations were formed two and three
generations ago--some dating to the early 20th century--with a few
exceptions, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which
began in 1995 and holds $24 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the 30,791 foundations worth less than $1 million
accounted for 7.7% of grants given in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Renz said the size of the smaller and newer foundations is
less significant than what they can do in the future, because many
are created by philanthropists who plan to include large bequests in
their wills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the potential," Renz said. "People are forming them
when they're younger ... and, for the most part, are setting them up
as multigenerational foundations."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what the Millers have in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and his wife have long supported humanitarian and
environmental causes, including setting up annuities that benefit
specific organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the couple was advised to go one step further and
establish the foundation. They also placed their portfolio in a
"remainder trust," which supports them while they are alive and, upon
their death, goes to the foundation bearing their names.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Miller said, the couple wanted to ensure their
descendants would continue their good works. So they donated about
$100,000 to their foundation, appointed two daughters as officers and
placed six grandchildren on the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Miller Foundation, with assets of about $90,000, gave
away $4,175 in mostly $50 and $100 grants to more than 50 groups,
including the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Red Cross and
the National Wildlife Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Miller sees those gifts as a practice run for his children and
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, when we leave the scene, the foundation will continue
and with the objectives we have set," Miller said. "They will help
implement it and keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Economic Downtown Cuts Value of Portfolios</TE>
<TE>   While the foundering economy of the last two years has eroded the
value of the Millers' portfolio--it was well above $1 million before
the downturn--it has also cut into giving by established foundations,
the Foundation Center said.</TE>
<TE>   Grants given by foundations grew in 2001 to a record $29 billion,
up 5.1%, but that was the smallest annual increase since 1994, it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the center saw the increase as unexpected good news against
a backdrop of crumbling stock values, belly-up dot-coms and national
pessimism over the direction of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the growth came from multi-year commitments made by large
institutions before the recession, and part from a strategy by
foundations to invest conservatively, shielding assets from the most
volatile market swings.</TE>
<TE>   "They think about giving in terms of how much they need to
produce, and in terms of their assets over a period of a few years,"
Renz said. "That helps to even it out."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Lawrence is learning about those cycles firsthand. Lawrence
and his wife, Diane Troth, created the Santa Monica-based Lawrence
Foundation two years ago with $12 million, part of the $300 million
that Intel paid for their Trillium Digital Systems in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the foundation's assets have fallen with the rest of
the technology market, and the foundation is worth about $5 million
now. Lawrence said the sudden depreciation hasn't lessened the
couple's ambition to aid educational, health and environmental
causes.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's important to help other people with their vision and
help them succeed," Lawrence said. He added that developing a
foundation brings the same sense of satisfaction that came with
developing their business. "Plus, we can influence the direction of
our giving more closely."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Banks and Marie St. Germain stand at the other economic end of
the foundation scale.</TE>
<TE>   The couple formed a foundation in 1995 to qualify for tax
deductions for the more than $2,000 a year they spent caring for
feral cats near their home in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, a lawyer, prepared the paperwork, cutting the costs
associated with obtaining nonprofit status from the Internal Revenue
Service.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, establishing an independent foundation can cost
$5,000 to $10,000, depending on the complexity, said Shelley Hoss,
president of the Orange County Community Foundation. Annual legal and
accounting fees vary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Recipients Can't Even Say, 'Thank You'</TE>
<TE>   The Feral Felines Feeders Inc. of Huntington Beach began after St.
Germain spotted a neighbor tending to a colony of more than 40 cats
on vacant land south of downtown Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   St. Germain said she and her husband believe stray cats are
neglected by animal control officers.</TE>
<TE>   "People abandon [cats], thinking they can take care of
themselves," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking over for the neighbor, who has since moved, St. Germain and
her husband began feeding the cats. They also rounded them up for
trips to the veterinarian to get spayed, neutered and inoculated,
then returned the cats to the colony.</TE>
<TE>   It got expensive. IRS forms the couple filed for Feral Feline
Feeders list more than $6,700 in expenses for 1997-2000. That
spending pace dropped two years ago after the couple moved the
dwindling colony of about 18 cats to Rancho Lotsa Cats Feline Rescue
in San Diego's Valley Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now their donations to Feral Feline Feeders are passed on to the
sanctuary. "We feel responsible for them," St. Germain said about the
cats. "We took them down there. A lot of other people do similar
things, but lots of people don't have a way to write off what they
spend."</TE>

<HD>4 Members of Human Rights Panel Resign</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara County: They clashed with colleagues over
issues such as same-sex unions and slavery reparations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE DE TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four of 15 members of a commission created to promote tolerance and
understanding in Santa Barbara County resigned last week, accusing
their colleagues of using the group as a forum to disparage America.</LD>
<LD>   "[The commission] is a soapbox for those who wish to run down
America and criticize the ideals and values that have made it a
success and the envy of the world," said the letter of resignation.</LD>
<LD>   The departing commissioners said they hope their dramatic gesture
shakes up the county and changes the way the group operates.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioners Ed Hennon, Peter Adams, Tony Fox and Jerry Sherrod
launched the latest chapter of discontent in the group's sometimes
rocky 11-year history with their April 1 resignations. The defections
followed a public spat at the commission's March meeting, where
members clashed over the issue of reparations to descendants of
American slaves.</TE>
<TE>   When the quartet found themselves on the losing end of a vote to
write Congress urging that reparations be made, they decided to quit.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is to make the opportunities in Santa Barbara County
available to each person without discrimination, not to spend time
debating things we have no control over," said Hennon, 77, a retired
aluminum company executive from Orcutt. "The commission has become
involved in partisan politics and personal agendas and the broader
mission is gone."</TE>
<TE>   The departing commissioners had previously found themselves in the
conservative minority on many of the panel's liberal stances.
Hot-button topics included same-sex unions and the commission's
decision to denounce the Boy Scouts of America for discriminating
against gays.</TE>
<TE>   But their supporters say the problem stems from a pair of county
supervisors who want to disband the Human Relations Commission and so
have appointed people to it who disagree with its mission.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some supervisors who don't care for the commission and
have made inappropriate appointments in the past several years for
the sole purpose of wreaking the sort of havoc we're seeing now,"
Supervisor Gail Marshall said. "These have tended to undermine the
group's mission, which is unfortunate at this time of divisiveness in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Group's Mandate Is to Promote Tolerance</TE>
<TE>   The Human Relations Commission, formed in 1991, is one of 37
commissions and committees in Santa Barbara County. Staffed by
volunteers appointed by county supervisors, the group's mandate,
written by the supervisors, is to "promote tolerance and
understanding between divergent groups throughout Santa Barbara
County." Tolerance and understanding among the members, however, has
sometimes been in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of its formation, the group struggled through a
snarl of personality conflicts and infighting. County leaders decided
to reorganize it, paring down the commission's membership from 21 to
15--three appointees per supervisorial district--and adopting bylaws.
The group has an annual budget of about $170,000, which pays for an
administrative staff and miscellaneous operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to same-sex partnerships and the Boy Scouts' stand on
gay rights, the commission tackles issues as diverse as "junk" guns
and overnight camping in cars. Keith Davis, the commission's
administrator, says the group sponsors forums and educational events
throughout the county, and advises county lawmakers on policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors which helped
craft the county's sweatshop ordinance," Davis said. "Because of it,
the county is prohibited from purchasing clothing from distributors
who are partners with sweatshops--that's $250,000 a year that has to
be spent in a more enlightened way."</TE>
<TE>   Last week's dispute stemmed from an upcoming exhibit in Santa
Barbara of a slave ship, the Henrietta Marie.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen thousand kids will tour the slave ship exhibit--they'll
see artifacts and pieces of the ship and they'll have questions about
it all," Davis said. "Slavery is not a taboo subject, and the
commission takes seriously its role in discussing issues which are
complex. Unfortunately, sometimes our voices are lost in the emotions
of the issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schism Between North and South Growing</TE>
<TE>   Geography may also play a part in the commission's woes. The
departures highlight a growing schism in Santa Barbara County between
the rural, conservative north and the increasingly urban, more
liberal south.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a deep north-south county split," said Supervisor Joni
Gray, who had appointed two of the commissioners who quit. "A vast
majority of the people in the north are tied to the land, with
farming and mining and building. We have a different way of looking
at life than the south county, and so we often clash on values."</TE>
<TE>   Although the departing commissioners asked that their seats remain
vacant, Gray said she wants to think things over before deciding what
to do. She favors blending the Human Relations Commission with the
existing Affirmative Action Commission and the Commission for Women.</TE>

<HD>James Karales, 71; Photographed Selma March</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Karales, whose dramatic photograph of civil rights marchers
making the pilgrimage from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., became an
iconic image of a movement and an era, has died. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Karales died April 1 of cancer in Westchester County, N.Y.,
according to the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York City, which
represents his work.</LD>
<LD>   Although his image, which first appeared in Look magazine, became
well known, Karales was little known to the public, as is the case
with many photographers who produce iconic images.</LD>
<TE>   A self-effacing man, he never pursued fame in the manner of other
photographers. No books exist of his work.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Fetterman, owner of the Peter Fetterman Gallery in Santa
Monica, who has shown Karales' work, recalled the photographer Friday
as "the real thing. A gentleman of great passion, the essence of a
concerned photographer."</TE>
<TE>   The march from Selma to Montgomery to press Gov. George C. Wallace
for voting rights for blacks in Dallas County, which includes Selma,
was a key point in the civil rights movement. After the initial march
was beaten back by charging Alabama state troopers and a second
attempt was blocked by a federal judge, the march was finally
sanctioned by the court. The five-day march drew 25,000 people, and
an equal-rights petition was eventually presented to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Federal voting rights legislation was introduced in Washington a
short time later.</TE>
<TE>   "The moral pageantry of the movement is portrayed in the image,"
Marshall Frady, the critically acclaimed biographer of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., Jesse Jackson and George Wallace, said in an
interview Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "That image absolutely stuns the breath and the heart. It takes
those kinds of arrested stills to work in a way that the
much-celebrated interplay between television and the [civil rights]
movement just doesn't do."</TE>
<TE>   Frady said that civil rights leaders of the period had the highest
appreciation for that kind of iconic imagery being made by
photographers like Karales and Charles Moore, who photographed many
of the violent street confrontations between police and protesters in
Southern cities.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave them a greater overall appreciation for what they were
doing," Frady said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Karales' photograph] is like a mural, and the Selma march
requires that kind of sweep to it. It perfectly matches the moment
and the movement."</TE>
<TE>   Historian Taylor Branch selected the Karales image for the cover
of the first book of his authoritative series on the civil rights
movement, "Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-63."</TE>
<TE>   "It may very well be the seminal image to come out of the civil
rights marches in the South," Branch said. "It is an amazing
combination of movement and shadow. It looks like they are marching
out of the Red Sea."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Canton, Ohio, Karales studied photography at Ohio
University and earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts. After
graduation, he moved to New York hoping to find work as a
photographer. He showed his portfolio at the prestigious Magnum
agency but failed to land work there or at any of the other avenues
he investigated in the city.</TE>
<TE>   He was discouraged and ready to return to Ohio when Magnum's
editorial director, John Morris, called him. According to a history
of the agency written by Russell Miller, Morris asked if he wanted a
two-week assignment making prints for the noted photographer W.
Eugene Smith. The pay was $50 a week.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Smith was photographing his Pittsburgh essay, which
became one of the hallmark projects of his career. According to
Miller, Karales' two-week assignment ended up taking more than two
years and he made more than 7,000 prints for Smith, also known as a
master printer with exacting standards.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Smith, and perhaps inspired by the Pittsburgh work,
Karales returned to Ohio and began work on a photo essay documenting
life in the community of Rendville. At the time, Rendville was one of
the few integrated working communities in the country.</TE>
<TE>   A stop on the underground railroad during the days of slavery,
Rendville had attracted many blacks because it offered rare
employment opportunities in its mining industries.</TE>
<TE>   Back in New York, Karales showed his Rendville photographs to
Edward Steichen at the Museum of Modern Art and sold two for the
museum's permanent collection.</TE>
<TE>   A showing of his Rendville photos brought Karales to the attention
of a photo editor at Look magazine, who hired him in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Look, a large-format magazine published biweekly, was the main
competitor to the weekly Life magazine. With its six-week lead time,
Look favored photo essays as a way to compete with Life's breaking
news photos.</TE>
<TE>   While at Look in 1962, Karales followed King across the South and
completed an impressive series on the civil rights leader's
activities.</TE>
<TE>   His photograph of the Selma march in 1965 came during an
assignment for Look called "The Turning Point of a Church." It ended
up winning an award from the National Press Photographers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Karales went to Vietnam to cover U.S. Special
Forces. For three years he photographed alternately the war in
Vietnam and social unrest in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a photojournalist in the '60s," Karales told the New York
Times some years ago, "was heaven, utopia."</TE>
<TE>   After Look folded in 1972, Karales worked as a freelance
photographer for the Saturday Review, Life and Money.</TE>
<TE>   His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern
Art, the International Center for Photography and the Hallmark
Collection.</TE>
<TE>   In exhibitions, Karales' work, primarily in black and white, was
known for its strong social context and his excellent printing. But
above all, Karales was known for his masterful eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Art like Karales' ... has to come from some inner instinct,"
Frady said. "Those kinds of photos don't happen by accident."</TE>
<TE>   Karales is survived by his wife, Monica; four sons; three
grandchildren; and a brother.</TE>

<HD>Help From a Tightknit Group</HD>
<DH>Benefit: Celebrities craft squares for two blankets that
are being auctioned to aid New York terror victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's elbow to elbow celebrities at La Knitterie Parisienne, an
internationally known knitting boutique in Studio City that's become
a refuge for actors, agents, directors and producers.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent afternoon, "Ally McBeal" newcomer Julianne Nicholson
hunts for a seat, squeezing in next to comedic actor Antoinette
Spolar-Levine. After a long day of shooting the NBC sitcom "Will &amp;
Grace," cast members Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Shelley
Morrison often turn up, praising one another's stitching.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, so many knitters are fashioning scarves, handbags and
baby booties around the store's big, yarn-strewn table that Daryl
Hannah has to crouch on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the store's celebrity
customers have been on a mission: to knit or crochet 7-by-9-inch
squares for two charity blankets to sell on EBay, with proceeds going
to the New York Police &amp; Fire Widows' &amp; Children's Benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-day auction began Friday and includes squares by Elizabeth
Taylor, Tyra Banks, Caroline Rhea, Julianne Moore, Bridget Fonda and
Camryn Manheim. Also contributing were Sofia Coppola, Nora Dunn,
Joanna Gleason, Annette O'Toole, Jennie Garth, Laurie Metcalf and
Parker Posey. Bidding begins at $1,000 per blanket.</TE>
<TE>   The woman behind the charity effort is boutique owner Edith Eig,
57, a Paris-born artisan beloved by Hollywood insiders as a knitting
guru and surrogate mother.</TE>
<TE>   The curly-haired craftswoman with the gentle voice was working on
a star-studded blanket for another charity on Sept. 11. Many of her
clients--which also include non-celebrities with a passion for
knitting--flocked to the store to knit, talk and seek comfort in one
another after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The tragedy broke my heart," said Eig, who opened the Ventura
Boulevard boutique six years ago after she and her family moved here
from New Jersey. "I knew the victims' family members needed the
money. I wanted to help as much as I could."</TE>
<TE>   So Eig enlisted her famous customers and donated the yarn--the
silk, wool, cotton, raffia, chenille and cashmere, in textures both
delicate and sturdy and colors bright and subtle. The store is filled
wall to wall with bins and boxes overflowing with 13,000 types of
yarn, knitting needles and needlework as well as shimmering displays
of buttons--porcelain, vintage, designer and semiprecious stone.</TE>
<TE>   Eig spent long hours coaching and coaxing the celebrity knitters
before crocheting the Hollywood squares into two blankets that dazzle
with patches reflecting the whims of its creators (a deep lavender
for Taylor, a glittering rust for Messing and an eye-popping pink and
yellow for Rhea).</TE>
<TE>   "Edith is a friend, teacher and mentor who is always giving," said
Morrison, who plays Rosario, the spunky housekeeper on "Will &amp;
Grace." "When she called me about the blanket, the first thing I said
was, 'Bless you.' The tragedy is hard to comprehend. I wanted to
help. We all wanted to help."</TE>
<TE>   In July, Nicholson arrived from New York to play a new lawyer on
"Ally McBeal." She quickly discovered Eig's boutique.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know many people in L.A.," Nicholson said. "Edith made
me feel welcome right away."</TE>
<TE>   Eig put Nicholson to work. "She told me she needed a square for
the blanket," Nicholson said as she stitched the finishing touches on
a frilly patch of sunburst yellow and orange.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to do it," Nicholson said. "A lot of care is in the
blankets."</TE>

<HD>Tall Tales Blossom in Desert</HD>
<DH>Lies: An Old West prevaricator inspired an annual contest
that brings storytellers from afar to fib their way to the top.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BORREGO SPRINGS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When it comes to lies and liars, some are better than others.</LD>
<LD>   By all accounts, one of the most accomplished prevaricators of the
Old West was Thomas "Pegleg" Smith, Indian fighter (possibly), horse
thief (probably), and world-class drunk (most assuredly).</LD>
<LD>   A man whose made-up deeds have outlived many people's real
exploits, Pegleg's legend for truth-stretching brought 250 people
from around the country to this white desert hamlet this weekend.
Weaving tales of burrowing rhinos with golden toenails and snowstorms
on the hottest day of the year, contestants in the 27th annual Pegleg
Smith Liars' Contest paid tribute to a man celebrated for the things
he didn't do and the discoveries he never made.</LD>
<TE>   "This brings all kinds of people together--desert rats,
ecologists, geologists, historians," said Larry Scrivener, 72, a
retired airline pilot who was working as a soundman for this
weekend's competition, held around a campfire on a blustery Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what could keep a liars contest going for so long, Bill
Jennings, 80, the master of ceremonies for the event, shrugged.
"Everything is weird around here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some contestants were from as far away as Virginia. Some came in
costume, others with props, but all with mendacity in their hearts.
The crowd sat on lawn chairs, bundled in blankets, cheering for their
favorites and calling out "your five minutes are up" to those whose
lies didn't measure up.</TE>
<TE>   Adjacent to the campfire was a 6-foot-high mound of rocks.
According to legend, anyone wishing to find Pegleg's gold must add a
few stones to the pile.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by a group called CACTI--Committee to Accumulate Curious
Tales of Incredibility--the contest honors the best storyteller on
the basis of content and delivery. Not that anyone loses. Everyone
gets an award: a certificate and one of the dozens of used bowling
and swimming trophies organizers scrounge up from thrift stores.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean contestants don't take the competition
seriously. As the crowd gathered, several contestants cast
semi-nervous glances at Phil Brigandi, a local historian who had won
three times. He summed up his attitude toward the competition by
quoting Mark Twain: "The problem with facts is they cramp a fellow's
style."</TE>
<TE>   One of his past winning tales concerned Pegleg's poor sense of
direction. To keep from getting lost, so it was said, he started
taking a penguin along on his desert travels. When he lost his
bearings, he set the penguin loose, knowing it would head north.
While the tale was ridiculous on almost every level, the punch line
was that there are no penguins at the North Pole.</TE>
<TE>   Like Brigandi, some of the tale-spinners tend to intellectual
arcana and word tricks. Jeff Jones, an English teacher from Vista who
had finished second to Brigandi more than once and was looking for a
win, said he used to rehearse his narrative in front of his students.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Pinkie and the Yo Hos, a group of women in costume,
planned to wing it.</TE>
<TE>   Pegleg Smith was a real person, and he apparently had a real peg
leg. How he got it is a matter of debate. Some say he was shot in the
leg with an Indian's arrow and amputated the leg himself. It's pretty
reliably believed that he stole horses.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a horse thief and a fine one," Jennings said. "He used to
steal horses from the Mormons in San Bernardino and take them up and
sell them to the Mormons in Utah."</TE>
<TE>   An account of the John C. Fremont expedition in 1854 contains this
reference to Pegleg: "While encamped on this spot we met a party of
gold explorers from Los Angeles....They were under the command of a
man with one leg, known as Peg-leg Smith, a celebrated mountaineer.
He is a weather-beaten old chap and tells some improbable tales."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont didn't know the half of it. But the story that earned
Pegleg many a shot in San Francisco bars over the years was about his
discovery of gold in the Anza-Borrego Desert west of the Salton Sea.
According to the story, he picked up some rocks coated black and took
them to Los Angeles, thinking they were copper. They turned out to be
gold, but he got drunk and couldn't find his way back to the strike.
He launched at least two expeditions to find the gold, without
success.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings puts no stock in Pegleg's stories of gold. Pegleg's
fortune was his tongue. "He spent his whole life getting grubstaked
in bars."</TE>
<TE>   Although the competition honors Pegleg and his wanderings, his
fame is owed to a Hollywood set designer and desert newsman named
Harry Oliver. It was Oliver who started the Pegleg club around 1930,
and it was Oliver who helped build the Pegleg monument. Oliver called
himself the "agent for Pegleg's ghost."</TE>
<TE>   Ninety miles inland from San Diego, this community of 3,000 is
rapidly losing its frontier rawness that affected Pegleg. It has
become a popular golfing and sunning destination in recent years.
Residents also boast that the area, surrounded by mountains on three
sides, is protected from the inland smog that now reaches Palm
Springs. But heavy wind comes howling off the mountains, and Saturday
night it slapped around the campfire and forced the crowd to pull
blankets and sleeping bags tight under their chins.</TE>
<TE>   At the competition, there were several tellers of tall tales who
local folk believed could have gone nose-to-nose, and drink for
drink, with Pegleg.</TE>
<TE>   A man claiming to be Pegleg's great-great-great-grandson said that
he had discovered his relative's treasure map and found that the gold
was in a tunnel 642 steps from a certain landmark. He couldn't find
it until he realized that Pegleg had only one leg and then doubled
the steps. He passed around a gold-painted rock as proof of his find,
then asked a member of the audience to hide a gold-painted bar, which
he proceeded to find with his sonar gold-detector--a megaphone
attached by a hose to a toiletries case.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has false teeth," he said, pointing it at the crowd and
causing the device to beep.</TE>
<TE>   Brigandi was next up. Some of the newcomers do skits on other
themes, but Brigandi is a traditionalist. All his tales concern
Pegleg.</TE>
<TE>   Gesturing in the firelight, he said Pegleg was caught in the
desert on the hottest day ever recorded and was desperate to cool
off. Finding no shade, he decided to blow open a cavern in the ground
with dynamite and climb in. He dug a hole, but it was too small for
the sticks of dynamite, so in desperation he threw the dynamite high
into the air. It blew a hole in the ionosphere and reversed the air
inversion over the desert, causing an unlikely snowstorm, which
locked Pegleg in an icy tomb. Pushing against the ice, he was finally
able to get it rolling across the desert.</TE>
<TE>   "He rolled all the way to Julian [a mountain town 30 miles away]
before it melted. And that's how Pegleg survived the hottest day ever
on the desert," Brigandi said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there was Jones, the 53-year-old high school teacher from
Vista.</TE>
<TE>   His tale was even more fanciful: Pegleg was thirsty one day and
chopped at what he thought was a yucca shoot. Instead, it was the
horn of the mythical burrowing rhino, which proceeded to leap out of
the ground and thunder away.</TE>
<TE>   In its wake, Pegleg found several pieces of gold. "Its toenails
were made of pure gold," Jones said of the burrowing rhino.</TE>
<TE>   That gave Pegleg an idea. He mounted his burro and galloped off
across the desert, slashing at yucca shoots/rhino horns as he went.
Then he'd chase the rhinos and knock off their gold toenails with his
wooden leg.</TE>
<TE>   Later, said Jones, when Pegleg was fabulously rich, "he looked
back on his life and realized he was the first rhino stone cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd groaned, then cheered. But it wasn't enough. Jones
finished second to Brigandi once again.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd broke up, and some retired to Carlee's bar down the
highway to warm up and begin planning for next year.</TE>

<HD>Agency Criticized for Not Treating Teen</HD>
<DH>Health: Judge may order the Ventura County department to
aid the mentally ill detainee at a work camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's troubled Behavioral Health Department is again at
the center of controversy with its refusal to treat a mentally ill
teenager sentenced to a Camarillo work program.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John Dobroth will hold a hearing today to
outline the department's failure to provide care for the juvenile
offender.</LD>
<LD>   Dobroth has threatened to order treatment if the county does not
provide it voluntarily.</LD>
<TE>   After hashing out the issue in closed session, the Board of
Supervisors last week instructed County Executive Officer Johnny
Johnston to appear before Dobroth and assure the judge that treatment
will be provided--and that broader changes are underway.</TE>
<TE>   "We will take care of this," Johnston said last week. "The last
thing we want is a fight with the bench."</TE>
<TE>   At the supervisors' meeting on April 16, Johnston will recommend
separating Behavioral Health from the larger Health Care Agency, a
move officials acknowledge would make it easier to focus on
administrative tasks and establish clearer lines of authority.</TE>
<TE>   "That would help expose the problems we have and make it easier to
fix them," Supervisor John Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff is the latest evidence of the county Behavioral
Health Department's free fall in recent years. Once held up as a
national model for interagency cooperation, the department has seen
squabbling and turf wars reduce it to a cautionary tale for mental
health administrators across the state, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura showed everyone else how to run a model agency," said Dr.
Sandra Naylor Goodwin, executive director of the California Institute
of Mental Health in Sacramento. "Now we're not sure what they're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Behavioral Health chief David Gudeman defended his department and
his three-year tenure as its leader. He said his department has
treated more people on fewer dollars--and has done it at a higher
level of quality--than his predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that he is being asked to further expand services
for incarcerated youths, Gudeman said, with no extra funding to pay
for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't particularly like to feud, but I think there are real
issues that need to be resolved," he said. "I can't treat all these
kids myself. I need money to hire people to go do what I can't do
without money."</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman's boss, Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand, was on
vacation and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Gudeman, a UCLA-trained psychiatrist, lacks
the skills to run a large government agency.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by supervisors three years ago with little
administrative experience, Gudeman finds reasons why his department
should not provide services instead of finding ways to make the most
of his $50-million budget, detractors say.</TE>
<TE>   He has feuded with Cal Remington, the county's probation chief,
over which department should pay for mental health services.
Behavioral Health is also weighed down by internal politics and
byzantine regulations on how money can be used, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Even Gudeman's staunchest supporters on the Board of Supervisors
are voicing alarm at the continuing problems.</TE>
<TE>   "He's extremely cautious and protective of funding streams and
making sure everything is done correctly," said Supervisor Judy
Mikels. "But it's time to make the laws and rules work for us and not
against us. If we're not willing to make the effort as servants of
the public, then we ought not to be in the job."</TE>
<TE>   The latest flare-up came last month after the Behavioral Health
Department refused to treat a teenage boy who had been sentenced to a
work program in Camarillo. County lawyers argued in court that
Behavioral Health psychiatrists were not contractually obligated to
drive the 13 miles from their Ventura offices to the Camarillo site
where the youth is incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   That drew a sharp response from Dobroth at a March 27 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically you're saying these psychiatrists don't make house
calls," the judge said. "If we're all in this together for these
kids, what's the bloody harm in having a doctor drive out there?"</TE>
<TE>   Dobroth then threatened to issue a court order requiring the
treatment. He scheduled today's hearing to present his findings and
possibly issue a written order.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said he hopes to persuade Dobroth that a legal fight is
not necessary. The Probation Agency has agreed to drive the youth
offenders to the psychiatrists' office, if necessary, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Gudeman said he intends to expand a psychiatric residency
program, a move that could make more doctors-in-training available to
treat disturbed youths at Juvenile Hall and the Camarillo work
program.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position has always been that this is a significant program
expansion and we want to make sure we have adequate resources to do
it right," the mental health chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said the larger problems are also being addressed.
Supervisors have told him to look at every option, from pushing for
more flexibility in how they spend money to reviewing Gudeman's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering all of the problems Gudeman has had, one has to
dissect that and find out what is causing them," Flynn said. "We
didn't have these problems four years ago."</TE>

<TE>   Johnston said the larger problems are also being addressed.
Supervisors have told him to look at every option, from pushing for
more flexibility in how they spend money to reviewing Gudeman's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   The department's troubles began four years ago when an attempt by
the Board of Supervisors to merge the mental health department and
social services agency sparked a bureaucratic war.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors rescinded the action within a year, after it became
clear that the merger ran afoul of federal regulations. But the snit
indirectly led to a federal Medicare investigation that uncovered
improper billings and cost the county $15.3 million in penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Behavioral Health chief Steve Kaplan was ousted, and Gudeman, who
opposed the merger, was appointed as his replacement. Bitterness
among opposing camps on the merger issue lingers, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The billing fiasco is one reason Gudeman is so scrupulous about
following rules on how money is used, his supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   But others say Gudeman's approach to running the 400-employee
department contrasts sharply with his predecessors'. Gudeman has
appointed other psychiatrists to top positions and takes a
physician-directed approach to treating mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan took a broader approach, providing clients with teams of
doctors, nurses, social workers and educators. They brainstormed ways
to address not just the medical problem but other factors
contributing to mental health. It was that cooperative effort that
brought Ventura County acclamation two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Under the leadership of director Randy Feltman, the county's
mental health agency received national attention by working closely
with the probation department, social services, schools and others to
help children with mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The cost-saving "systems of care" that they developed have been
replicated across the state and nation and expanded to include
adults.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Ventura County's troubles are so jarring, officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering all of the problems Gudeman has had, one has to
dissect that and find out what is causing them," Flynn said. "We
didn't have these problems four years ago."</TE>

County cleric facing accusation gives thanks for support.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southland Roman Catholics wrestled with conflicting feelings about
the sexual-abuse scandal rocking their church, while several priests
used their pulpit Sunday to direct harsh words at the media for its
reporting on the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   In the first congregational gatherings since an accusation against
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony surfaced Friday, some of the homilies
tailored around the story of "Doubting Thomas" were laced with
skepticism on the means and motives of those who revealed the details
of the allegation.</LD>
<LD>   Two priests implied that the media had stolen a series of internal
church e-mails, which contained a Fresno woman's unproved allegation
of abuse by Mahony 32 years ago, as well as the prelate's ruminations
on what he called his archdiocese's "huge mistake" for not promptly
revealing to authorities the names of priests accused of molesting
minors.</LD>
<TE>   Eight priests had been fired in February, but as recently as March
27, the hierarchy had not provided authorities with full
identification of three of the accused.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, the Diocese of Orange has dismissed two
accused priests and paid nearly $6.5 million in settlements to sexual
molestation victims.</TE>
<TE>   During the two masses he celebrated at St. John Vianney Chapel on
Balboa Island, Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, who was accused of making a
sexual advance toward a female parishioner, frequently alluded to the
scandal, comparing it to a "crisis in faith" similar to the stubborn
doubtfulness of St. Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Baird thanked the congregation for supportive e-mails, phone calls
and letters, but did not address the accusations made against him and
later refused to comment further. "The statement I made at the press
conference earlier this week is the only comment I'm making," Baird
said between services.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning's sermons reflected the discomfort, frustration
and, at times, indignation about the intense news media coverage of
the allegations against Southern California church officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The church is being persecuted by the media," the Rev. Msgr.
Padraic Loftus of St. Mel Parish in Woodland Hills told about 300
parishioners. "They didn't let up during Holy Week .... Our cardinal
is viciously attacked and publicly humiliated. One must ask why? ....
Is it a deep-seated anti-Catholic attitude? Is it prejudice? Is it
even hatred?"</TE>
<TE>   Loftus asked the congregants to deal with the issue through
"prayer, education, justice, healing, forgiveness and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only the abused who suffer," Loftus said. "Our cardinal
is also suffering greatly. Priests who have dedicated their whole
lives are suffering. All Catholics are suffering because the church
is the body of Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners gave Loftus mixed reviews. "I was hoping he [Loftus]
would take full responsibility before he blamed others," said Wayne
Bradshaw of Woodland Hills, who has been attending St. Mel's with his
wife and young daughter for three years. "To point it at the media is
a little shaky."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Trabold, a Woodland Hills resident and 23-year St. Mel's
parishioner, dismissed the Fresno woman's allegations that Mahony
molested her 32 years ago, and praised the cleric's handling of the
larger scandal. "Mahony is doing a good job," Trabold said. "It's a
tough spot to be in."</TE>
<TE>   Trabold's comments on the newest allegations were echoed Sunday by
congregants from Camarillo to Balboa Island. The woman who made the
charges told The Times that she suffered from schizophrenia, and her
accounts of the alleged incident were short on detail.</TE>
<TE>   A priest who first heard the woman's allegations told the
Associated Press on Sunday he believes the claim is false.</TE>
<TE>   "She claimed that happened with 40 different youths watching,"
said Msgr. John Esquivel after leading mass at St. John's Cathedral
in Fresno. "There's no way that is going to happen in front of all
those people. I don't believe the allegations are true."</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   At Eagle Rock's St. Dominic Church, vicar Rev. Christopher Terry
accused the media of "yellow journalism" for its treatment of the
accusations against the cardinal, according to a parishioner. The
e-mails that revealed the Mahony allegation were stolen, he added,
though he did not specify by whom, the parishioner reported.</TE>
<TE>   At Padre Serra Catholic Church in Camarillo, a visiting priest,
who briefly referred to the scandal during his sermon, afterward
berated media outlets for publicizing the Mahony e-mails, which were
obtained by radio station KFI, and passed on to the Los Angeles
Times. The archdiocese took The Times to court late Thursday in an
unsuccessful attempt to prevent their publication.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really mad at the L.A. Times," said the priest, who requested
anonymity. "Those e-mails are stolen property. To take something that
is protected under attorney-client privilege is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the allegations against Baird were leveled last
week by Lori Haigh, who won a million-dollar settlement from the
church April 1 for a relationship she had with another priest 20
years ago while she was a minor. Haigh says Baird kissed, hugged and
rubbed against her after she reported the relationship to him.</TE>
<TE>   A high-profile spokesman for the Diocese of Orange, Baird has
denied the allegations and threatened Haigh with a defamation of
character lawsuit, saying he did not remember meeting her and did not
engage in inappropriate contact with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe it at all," Rose Gramme, 42, said of the
accusations leveled at the popular Baird. "He's not like that. He
would never do anything like that. He's well-educated, articulate and
truthful."</TE>
<TE>   Joan Marie Fredericks, 81, said she was appalled with the way the
church is handling sexual-abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on such a long time," said Fredericks, of
Michigan, who was visiting her son's family. "They haven't responded
quick enough. Those priests who committed those terrible sins, and
took away children's innocence, they should have been stopped years
and years ago."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, the Rev. Paul Fitzpatrick cautioned about 400
parishioners at St. Monica's Church. "Don't judge too quick--be
open."</TE>
<TE>   As they shuffled out of the church, many parishioners said they
were content with how the matter was being handled by their parish
and the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt my faith or my church because of this," said John
Vanderloop, a retired mechanic in Santa Monica. "Within the church
walls, everyone is talking about it, examining what has gone
on--that's a good thing," he said. "There are so many more positive
things that the priests have done quietly, out of the public eye,
with no attention. You have some who are flawed, they need to be
dealt with, but that doesn't take away from all of the good so many
have done."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Marc Trudeau told a congregation of more than 700 people
at St. Pius X in Santa Fe Springs, "This is painful for all of us,
but the important thing is that we always know what our mission is.
The end will be positive, and like Cardinal Mahony said, it will be a
'purification of the church.'"</TE>

<HD>Paint-Ball Victim Declared Dead</HD>
<DH>Crime: Newport Beach skater was shot with pellets two weeks
ago. Police are still looking for his assailants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach in-line skater who was critically injured last month
after being struck by paint-ball pellets, causing him to fall and
strike his head, was declared dead Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Gary M. Holdren, 54, had been in a coma at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo since March 24, when he was
shot by several assailants while skating at the Upper Newport Bay
Ecological Preserve.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, more than 50 relatives and friends held a memorial walk
for Holdren where he fell.</LD>
<TE>   Holdren's fiancee, Bonita Young, 48, said she is angry and amazed
that no one has come forward to identify three boys who Newport Beach
police believe shot the pellets from a bluff overlooking the street
where Holden was skating.</TE>
<TE>   "I handed out fliers and spent the morning talking to people,"
Young said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave out T-shirts that said, 'Speak Out for Gary.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so angry. I want people to get outraged in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Young, a marketing professional, said she plans to attend a
Newport Beach City Council meeting and to speak to local school
officials to stir up interest in the case and find Holdren's
assailants.</TE>
<TE>   She said more needs to be done to stop attacks in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been throwing rocks and bottles out there. This has
been going on for a long time, and this is not going to stop until we
get the parents involved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm furious. I mean, there are parents who bought these paint
guns, and they've been silent."</TE>
<TE>   Police have continued the investigation and worked "long into the
night" Saturday after they received word that Holdren had been
declared dead, said Newport Beach Police Sgt. Frederick Heinecke.</TE>
<TE>   Police intend to examine the autopsy report, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Paintball Products Manufacturers Assn. is offering a $1,500
reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Informants are asked to call police at (800) 550-6273.</TE>
<TE>   Holdren was a salesman for Sulzer Carbomedics, an Austin, Texas,
manufacturer of heart-valve replacement and repair products.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors harvested several of Holdren's organs to help other
people, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned for this week.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a brother, Mark, of Rochester, N.Y., and a
daughter, Kristie, of Aliso Viejo.</TE>

<HD>A Shrine to the Penny</HD>
<DH>Kern County: Hotel owner has glued 800,000 copper coins,
one by one, on almost every surface of his barroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>McKITTRICK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>McKITTRICK, Calif.--Pity the poor penny, the unwanted child of
American currency.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody likes it. Nobody wants it. The government periodically
considers relegating it to the numismatic scrap heap. If it's given
in change, it's just as likely to be left on the counter. Or tossed
into a jar sitting on a kitchen shelf.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes Mike Moore, who not only admires the humble qualities of
the lowly 1-cent piece, but has even built a monument, a veritable
shrine, to the little copper coin.</LD>
<TE>   Moore, 60, is the owner of Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel, the
tallest building in this dusty oil town of 160 in eastern Kern
County. Moore, a congenial sort whose cheerful face is framed by a
beard so white it looks rented, boasts that he offers the "best
rib-eye in Kern County. I cook every one."</TE>
<TE>   Many visitors these days, however, stop in not to eat but to gawk
at Moore's "penny bar."</TE>
<TE>   In most respects, the pub at the rear of the restaurant resembles
any other tavern, with a long bar and winking neon signs advertising
beer brands. The difference is that almost every surface--the bar,
the walls, even the floor--is covered with pennies, 800,000 of them
so far, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Some folks "sit here for two hours and never notice it," said
Moore, leaning over the bar.</TE>
<TE>   In the dim light, the decor is obvious mostly in the
reddish-orange hue it casts over everything. The visitor has the
feeling of having wandered into some ancient temple or counting room.</TE>
<TE>   "I put on every penny myself," he said, one at a time, month after
month, for the past three years. He won't let anyone help. In case
the Guinness Book of Records folks come around, he doesn't want
people bragging that they helped glue on a single penny.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's eccentricity arrived late in life. "We were in the termite
business for 25 years," he said glumly. Finally, he got sick of
killing bugs and of northwestern California.</TE>
<TE>   "All you see up there is trees," he said. "You can't see the hills
for the [darn] trees."</TE>
<TE>   Moore understands why people might choose the lush northern coast
over the parched southeastern San Joaquin Valley. When he first saw
the area, in the early '60s, "the first thing I said was, 'Who would
live in a Godforsaken hole like this?'"</TE>
<TE>   But a decade later, he and his wife, Annie, now married 41 years,
rented the hotel for a few months. Three years ago, he heard it was
for sale. "We kind of always wanted it back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He snapped it up, though he won't say how much he paid. Business
is good, despite the emptiness of the landscape and the fact that
only the cafe and bar are open. The two-story hotel hasn't rented a
room in 30 years. Most of the customers are oil workers, who arrive
as early as 5:30 for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel sits on Highway 33, up the road from Taft, far from the
nearest interstate. The biggest city around is Bakersfield, the
destination 40 miles east that folks here are talking about when they
say they are "going into town."</TE>
<TE>   Gluing up pennies was not a spur of the moment thing, or even the
brain-addled product of too much sun. Moore and his wife had long
planned that if they ever owned a saloon, they would use the coffee
cans full of coins they had saved over the years to cover the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after buying the hotel, he was watching television when
Annie asked, "When are you going to get started?"</TE>
<TE>   He took out his Elmer's and started gluing them up, one drop of
glue per penny. When he finished the bar, Moore found he couldn't
stop. His oldest coin is an 1883 Indian head, prominently displayed
on the bar.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread, more and more visitors stopped in not just for the
steaks but to gaze on Moore's creation. Sometimes he sees people
wearing copper bracelets, which some believe improves health. Moore
said he tells them they could get the same benefits by "rolling
around on the floor a while."</TE>
<TE>   Moore gets a lot of his coins from the bank in Taft. "They all
know me there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has also received donations from outsiders. One man brought him
two five-gallon buckets containing $500 in pennies--although that
didn't qualify him to help with the gluing.</TE>
<TE>   Moore puts up pennies "whenever I get in the mood," though  he
covered the floor in one three-day marathon, working 12 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I get the walls covered and reach a million, then I'll
stop," he promised.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was sure about that, he looked around in the
coppery gloaming and said, "Probably."</TE>

<HD>John Pierce, 92; Engineer, Inventor, Teacher, Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Robinson Pierce, a multifaceted electrical engineer with a flair
for words, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce, who spent the past two years in an assisted-living
facility in Sunnyvale, Calif., died Tuesday in a Mountain View
hospital of pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce named the ubiquitous transistor, fathered the
communications satellite, and became an expert on computer music and
musical acoustics--and wrote about all of it, sometimes in
entertaining science fiction format.</LD>
<TE>   The inventive engineer held some 90 patents, wrote or co-wrote
more than 20 books and 300 scholarly papers, and--under the pseudonym
J.J. Coupling--published more than two dozen science fiction short
stories in magazines such as Fantasy, Science Fiction and Penthouse.</TE>
<TE>   His thoughtfully named "transistor," which replaced cumbersome
vacuum tubes and forms the core of missiles, heart pacemakers,
blenders, compact disc players, televisions, the telephone system and
computers, among other things, was invented in 1947 by three of
Pierce's colleagues, who shared a Nobel Prize in physics for the
effort in 1956--William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain.</TE>
<TE>   Like Pierce, they all worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in
Murray Hill, N.J., and Brattain, knowing Pierce's talents as a
wordsmith, asked him what to call their little miracle. (The trio had
dubbed the gizmo the "persistor" for their own persistence in
perfecting it.)</TE>
<TE>   "It was supposed to be the dual of the vacuum tube. The vacuum
tube had transconductance, so the transistor would have
'transresistance,'" Pierce once said on the PBS "Transistorized!"
program. "And the name should fit in with the names of other devices,
such as varistor and thermistor. And ... I suggested the name
'transistor.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pierce earned his own greatest accolades for his work in
communications satellites.</TE>
<TE>   He was the major force in creating the 100-foot-diameter
aluminum-coated polyester balloon called Echo I, launched by NASA on
Aug. 12, 1960. Able to reflect radio waves, Echo I made possible the
first coast-to-coast television transmission and stayed in orbit for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The first message, recorded by President Eisenhower, was bounced
from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory antenna near Goldstone, Calif., to a
Bell Labs station in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce then set to work on Telstar I, his instrumented
communications satellite that transmitted the first transatlantic TV
signals and speeded phone calls around the world. It was launched
July 10, 1962.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Pierce was honored for his work on the satellites,
sharing the first Japan Prize and splitting a stipend of $190,000.
The prize is granted for "significant and revolutionary achievements
of originality" in science and technology "for the peace and
prosperity of mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, he shared the $400,000 Charles Stark Draper Prize
of the National Academy of Engineering with Harold A. Rosen, the
former Hughes Aircraft Co. engineer who designed and developed Syncom
II, the first satellite sent into a constant orbit of 22,300 miles in
1963.</TE>
<TE>   Noted science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke had envisioned the
communications satellite in a 1945 article, and duly saluted Pierce
and Rosen, calling them in 1995 "the fathers of the communications
satellite."</TE>
<TE>   "They designed, developed and produced it, making real that which
I and others thought only to write and dream about," the writer said.</TE>
<TE>   During his long tenure at Bell, from 1936 to 1971, Pierce also
invented the Pierce Gun, a vacuum tube that transmits electrons and
is still used in linear-beam microwave tubes that play a role in
satellites and in powering linear accelerators.</TE>
<TE>   But Pierce wasn't through yet. After his first retirement in 1971,
he spent more than a decade at his alma mater, Caltech, teaching
engineering and working at JPL as chief technologist.</TE>
<TE>   After a second retirement, he decided to pursue a subject that had
intrigued him for decades--computer music. He became a visiting
professor of music at Stanford University in 1983, and visited for 12
more years.</TE>
<TE>   At Stanford, he helped secure funding for the creative study of
computer music and studied psychoacoustics--the science of how people
perceive sound.</TE>
<TE>   His book "The Science of Musical Sound," published in 1983 and
revised in 1992, became an important textbook in the neophyte field
for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "This lavishly illustrated introduction to musical acoustics," a
reviewer for Science magazine wrote in 1984, "demonstrates once again
the wide-ranging wisdom, infectious enthusiasm, and unique flair for
rendering the complex comprehensible that John Pierce has manifested
in numerous earlier scientific books (not to mention several
science-fictional entertainments....)."</TE>
<TE>   Titles of Pierce's literary work over the years reflect his
scientific work: "Theory and Design of Electron Beams" in 1949,
"Traveling Wave Tubes" in 1950, "Electrons, Waves and Messages" in
1956, "Symbols, Signals and Noise" in 1961, "The Beginnings of
Satellite Communications" in 1968, "Almost All About Waves" in 1974,
"Introduction to Communication Science and Systems" in 1980,
"Information Technology and Civilization" in 1984, and (with A.
Michael Noll) "Signals, The Science of Telecommunications" in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Des Moines in 1910, John Robinson Pierce earned

<HD>GOP's Helpful Reminder of Old Democratic Battles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York is campaigning in California this year, but the new contests
are bringing back memories of old battles.</LD>
<LD>   Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani came west first, beating the
drum for Bill Simon for governor, and last week Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton (D-N.Y.) jetted into the sunset to cut the ribbon on the
"women for Davis" campaign in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Helpfully, the state Republican party--whose symbol is the
elephant, an animal with a reputation for a long memory--sent out
e-mails citing the 10-year-ago primary battle between Davis and
now-Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</LD>
<TE>   The blistering Senate primary was notable for a Davis ad comparing
Feinstein to haughty hotelier and tax-cheat Leona Helmsley, because
of a civil suit alleging that Feinstein improperly reported $8
million in campaign dough. The ad backfired big time, and Democratic
women were using words like "despicable" and "desperate" to
characterize Davis. Feinstein's campaign manager zinged back about a
"cheap, sleazy ad by a cheap, sleazy politician ... you get the
feeling he's running for grand wizard of the KKK and not the United
States Senate."</TE>
<TE>   (The current GOP e-mail, citing another 1992 slam at Davis,
misidentified the group in question, the National Organization for
Women, as the National Organization of Women.)</TE>
<TE>   As always happens, everyone made up publicly after that 1992
primary. The Republicans are doing the same thing now, after their
own street-rumble gubernatorial primary, where comments like
"Republican in name only," "sanctimonious hypocrite" and "unelectable
extremist" were tossed around like confetti, all of which is now
being swept up and thrown away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild's Show of Gratitude</TE>
<TE>   In the headquarters of make-believe, believe it--a Republican
being feted by the film world.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David Dreier, the GOP congressman from San Dimas, was the man
of the hour at the Directors Guild of America on Sunset Boulevard
last week. A sixth-floor sushi reception with the likes of renowned
directors Arthur Hiller and Taylor Hackford lauded Dreier for
midwifing HR 3131, a federal income tax credit intended to put a plug
in runaway film and TV production that has too often fled to Canada
and overseas (like a film about the American Civil War made in
Romania).</TE>
<TE>   The bill, whose co-producer is L.A. Democratic Rep. Howard Berman,
waits right now in the House Ways and Means Committee, which is under
the gavel of California's own Rep. William M. Thomas, a Bakersfield
Republican. At least three of Thomas' Golden State GOP colleagues and
16 of the Democratic ones are among the bill's 54 co-sponsors, and as
the bill's supporters like to point out, it has the backing of Sens.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who probably
couldn't agree on which way north is.</TE>
<TE>   Dreier acted his part with verve, telling a Democrat-disarming
joke about a woman with criminals and junkies in the family writing
to Dear Abby about whether she should tell her fiance the real family
secret: that one of her relatives is a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   And he gave Martha Coolidge, the DGA's first woman president, a
gift: a black-and-white cotton blanket with a pattern of the Capitol
dome. And that's a wrap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riordan Gets the Presidential Treatment</TE>
<TE>   Still in all the best Rolodexes: former L.A. Mayor Dick Riordan,
who lost the GOP gubernatorial primary after holding a comfortable
lead for months.</TE>
<TE>   The first chat was with Bill Clinton, calling with "a very
pleasant apology for losing the election for me by playing golf with
me and jogging with me," recounted Riordan, who got slammed from the
right for his warm relationship with the former president. "I said
that I'd supported Republicans pretty much all along, but certainly
Clinton was a great friend of L.A.'s, especially after the [1994]
earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   Lest Democrats appear quicker on the keypad than Republicans,
Riordan pointed out that President George W. Bush had tried calling
two days earlier, but the indefatigable Riordan was off hiking in the
Santa Monica Mountains, and finally hooked up with the White House a
couple of days later. Bush invited Riordan for lunch, and told him he
appreciated the fact that he'd run in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Before the election, Riordan spent some phone-chat time with
former Prez Gerald Ford, thus hitting a commander-in-chief triple.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staying Friends Through Right and Left</TE>
<TE>   It was a very amiable stop on the mea culpa book tour: the home of
a scion of the author's publishing house.</TE>
<TE>   David Brock, the journalist darling of the right-wing
Clinton-hating crowd, spent the 1990s savaging Clinton and Anita
Hill, and has begun the '00s with another bestseller, a penitent
180-degree confessional, "Blinded by the Right, the Conscience of an
Ex-Conservative."</TE>
<TE>   The book is published by Crown Books, and the meet-and-greet was
in the Hollywood Hills home of Brock's friend Ronnie Haft, who has
stuck with him through right and left and whose family founded Crown
Books, then famously argued over the millions it made.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation we'd most like to have eavesdropped on: between
Brock and Tom Hayden.</TE>

<TE>   Dispatches From the Poetry Wars</TE>
<TE>   This is a political column--what are we doing writing about poets?</TE>
<TE>   Because not even iambic pentameter and those who pen it are beyond
the reach of politics.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the California Arts Council has had its say and selected
three finalists for the post of state poet laureate, the art part is
over--and the political jockeying has begun.</TE>
<TE>   The finalists, all published and well-regarded poets, are Francis
X. Alarcon of Davis, Diane Di Prima of San Francisco and Quincy
Troupe of La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz poet Morton Marcus, sizing up the finals: "It gets very
political. There's literary and racial politics, a Latino, African
American and a woman. Now the politicos come out, the people engaged
in poetry wars."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis must choose one and submit the name to the state Senate
for its approval--a lot of public eyeballing for a term-limited
two-year title and a spot of cash, up to $20,000 each year.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators haven't shown much of an ear for poetry, in part
because the most memorable of five previous poet laureates--all of
them appointed for life, which explains present poet term limits--was
a colleague, Assemblyman Gus Garrigus, whose body of work was topped
by the classic "Ode on the Groundbreaking for the San Luis Dam."</TE>

Diamond Bar's Gary Miller will be talking taxes first thing next
Monday morning, tax day, outside the Brea post office--free doughnuts

<TE>   * Oh those printing deadlines: An invitation to a July banquet for
the Southwest Voter Registration education project still lists among
the invited speakers Richard Riordan, Republican candidate for
governor of California.</TE>
<TE>   * The Washington Post reports that the GOP's gay group, the Log
Cabin Republicans, has taken note in its e-mail newsletter of an L.A.
political dust-up, the one where Police Commission chief Rick Caruso
supposedly privately called Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters
the B-word ("rhymes with Abercrombie and ... ," the e-mail noted
coyly). "OK, it's tacky to call a congresswoman the b-word, but
still, how many of you didn't immediately think of sending him a
thank-you note?"</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. City Council member Dennis Zine today unveils the sign

<HD>Mahony E-Mails Revive 'Prior Restraint' Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's attorneys failed to persuade a Los
Angeles judge on Thursday night to block media outlets from
publishing some of Mahony's confidential e-mails, the cardinal met
the same fate as many powerful interests over the past 70 years.</LD>
<LD>   Since the landmark 1931 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Near vs.
Minnesota, it has been very difficult for individuals, large
corporations or even the U.S. government to get a "prior restraint"
against the press.</LD>
<LD>   That landmark decision, written by Chief Justice Charles Evan
Hughes, struck down a Minnesota law seeking to curb so-called "yellow
journalists" of the era. The ruling, a ringing endorsement against
state censorship, has grown in power over the years.</LD>
<TE>   By 1976, the Supreme Court said that prior restraints constitute
"the most serious and least tolerable infringement on 1st Amendment
rights" and are "presumptively unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't stopped efforts to obtain court orders blocking
the press from publishing sensitive material, said Jane Kirtley,
professor of media, ethics and law at the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people think their claim is different, unique," only to
be disabused of that notion, Kirtley said. She acknowledged that
trial judges sometimes order such restraints and on rare occasions
those restraints are upheld by appellate courts.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, at a hearing that started at 10:30 p.m. after urgent
pleas from the Los Angeles Archdiocese, attorney Donald H. Steier
expressed anguish at the prospect that the Los Angeles Times would
publish previously confidential e-mails between Mahony and an
archdiocese lawyer about the sexual abuse scandal engulfing the
church. Steier cited a California statute that prohibits "use" of
material that was illegally obtained.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelli Sager, the attorney representing The Times, countered
that a 2001 Supreme Court decision held that news media have a
free-speech right to publish lawfully obtained information of public
concern even if the media's source illegally intercepted phone calls
or electronic transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   Steier then conceded that he could cite no case to trump the one
Sager relied on and Superior Court Judge David Yaffe did what
hundreds of others have done over the past seven decades--denied the
request for a prior restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, media organizations prevail in the overwhelming majority
of cases where prior restraints are sought. In the landmark 1971
Pentagon Papers decision, for instance, the Supreme Court rejected
the government's contention that U.S. "national security" would be
gravely endangered if a secret history of the Vietnam War were
published by the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the court cautioned, as had Hughes 40 years earlier, that
there could be situations where a prior restraint was
justified--citing the possible publication of troop movements in
wartime. The court never has been confronted with that set of facts,
though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conflict of Free Press vs. Fair Trial</TE>
<TE>   Prior restraints frequently are sought in situations where an
individual charged with a crime asserts that publication or broadcast
of certain information will endanger his 6th Amendment right to a
fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   The seminal case on the "free press-fair trial battle" arena came
to the Supreme Court in 1976. A Nebraska trial judge had issued an
order forbidding the press from publishing a murder defendant's
confession that had been discussed in an arraignment attended by
reporters in a small town. The judge said the order was necessary to
protect the defendant's 6th Amendment right to a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Although the justices acknowledged that publicity about the
confession "might impair the defendant's right to a fair trial," the
Supreme Court, in Nebraska Press Assn. vs. Stuart, overturned the
prior restraint, saying that such orders violate the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The court said that a party seeking to restrict what could be
published would have a "heavy burden of demonstrating, in advance of
trial, that without a prior restraint a fair trial will be denied."</TE>
<TE>   The justices also said "pretrial publicity, even if pervasive and
concentrated, cannot be regarded as leading automatically and in
every kind of criminal case to an unfair trial."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past quarter-century, the Supreme Court and many
appellate courts have rejected prior restraints in a variety of
situations.</TE>
<TE>   The degree of protection afforded the press in situations where it
has lawfully obtained information--regardless of how a source
obtained the material--was vividly illustrated in the celebrated
narcotics case involving auto mogul John Z. DeLorean.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, CBS obtained a copy of a key tape that federal
prosecutors planned to use at trial, in which DeLorean was inspecting
a suitcase full of cocaine and proclaimed it "better than gold." A
federal trial judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary restraining
order barring CBS from airing the tape. But the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned him, saying the order violated the prior
restraint doctrine first enunciated in the Near case and refined in
the Nebraska Press decision.</TE>
<TE>   Both DeLorean's attorneys and the prosecutors contended that CBS
should be barred from showing the videotape. But Judge William Norris
said they had failed to establish that "further publicity, unchecked,
would so distort the views of potential jurors that 12 could not be
found who would, under proper instructions, fulfill their sworn duty
to render a just verdict exclusively on the evidence presented in
open court." Ultimately, DeLorean was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, several media experts emphasized that defendants in
criminal cases have a slightly better chance than parties in civil
cases to obtain a prior restraint because there are instances where
courts decide that a defendant's 6th Amendment right trumps the 1st
Amendment rights of the press.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in 1990, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in
Miami ordered CNN not to broadcast tape recordings it had obtained of
conversations between deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and
his attorney in a prison where Noriega was awaiting trial on
drug-trafficking charges. CNN refused to turn the tapes over to the
judge so he could review them, and it broadcast one of the tapes. But
it eventually paid a price for this action.</TE>
<TE>   The network had contended that under the Nebraska Press decision,
no prior restraint could be issued unless two conditions were met: a
finding that broadcasting the information would threaten Noriega's
right to a fair trial and that prohibiting the broadcast was the only
means of protecting that right.</TE>
<TE>   However, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled CNN could
not insist that the trial judge make these findings while denying him
access to the tapes. CNN asked the Supreme Court to review the
decision, but the high court declined.</TE>
<TE>   Hoeveler eventually held CNN in contempt for broadcasting the
first tape and threatened to impose a "substantial" fine on the
network. To avoid that outcome, CNN broadcast an apology and paid
$85,000 to cover the government's legal fees for prosecuting the
contempt case.</TE>
<TE>   "The Noriega decision is an extraordinary exception" to the
general pattern, Floyd Abrams, the noted 1st Amendment attorney who
filed CNN's brief in the Supreme Court, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge Bars Photos of Accused Officer</TE>
<TE>   Just a few days before Mahony was spurned in his bid for a prior
restraint, a San Bernardino police officer obtained one in another
situation where 6th Amendment rights were raised.</TE>
<TE>   On March 29, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Robert
Fawke ordered the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers not to
publish photographs of officer Ronald A. VanRossum, who is accused of
assaulting 11 women while on duty.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day--one day after VanRossum was arrested--Fawke
initially granted requests from several media organizations,
including The Times and the Riverside Press-Enterprise, to take still
photographs or film in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after meeting in chambers with VanRossum's attorney and the
prosecutor in the case, Fawke changed his mind, according to
statements he made in a subsequent proceeding. But before Fawke took
any formal action, photographers from The Times and the
Press-Enterprise took pictures of VanRossum as he entered the
courtroom. The judge then ordered the papers not to publish the
photographs or risk being held in contempt of court.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the order would remain in effect until April 19,
when VanRossum is scheduled to be formally arraigned. He said that if
VanRossum's photograph appeared in a newspaper before investigation
of the case was completed, it could compromise the investigation and
VanRossum's right to a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for The Times and the Press-Enterprise asked the judge
to reconsider his decision. The newspapers, citing state and federal
cases, maintain that because the judge's order granting permission to
photograph was in effect at the time the pictures were taken, he had
no authority to restrain their use.</TE>
<TE>   Fawke declined on Thursday, saying VanRossum's "picture adds
nothing to the story." However, the judge said he would be hard
pressed to continue the restraint after April 19.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the newspapers filed an emergency appeal with the state
Court of Appeal in Riverside asking that the judge's prohibition be
lifted as soon as possible.</TE>

<HD>Artist-Teacher Turned Trash Into Treasure</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Watts event honors John Riddle, who often used
discarded items to depict the African American experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deborah Riddle will always remember her father on trash day.</LD>
<LD>   It was on those mornings, during the short commute to school, that
John Riddle, a prolific painter and sculptor, would scan the
curbsides for "art materials" from his neighbors' trash cans. Old
pipes. Junked kitchen electronics. Used garden tools.</LD>
<LD>   For young Riddle, who recalls riding to her Los Angeles elementary
school with other people's garbage in the car, it was a humiliating
experience.</LD>
<TE>   But even she had to acknowledge her father had a knack for
transforming that twisted and broken heap of castoffs into something
special. Into art.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, it was glorious," Riddle told more than 100 people packed
into the Watts Towers Art Center on Sunday. "But getting there could
be torturous."</TE>
<TE>   The standing-room-only crowd smiled along with Riddle at the
memory of her father, who died in Atlanta on March 3 of complications
from a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's event was held to remember the man who dedicated his life
to the arts--painting it, teaching it and often creating it with
other people's junk. Friends and relatives remembered him as a strong
man who taught others about the African American struggle through his
work.</TE>
<TE>   Even the "found art," as it's been called, was part of that
message, said Riddle's oldest son, Anthony.</TE>
<TE>   "For him, the message was about what was possible in all that
discarded material that came from people who have been largely
discarded as well," Anthony Riddle said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his paintings, Riddle often invoked black leaders of the
past, such as his painting of Harriet Tubman that hangs now in M.
Hanks Gallery in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "He understood that for black people, it's important to embrace
all of our experiences in the past and not sweep everything under the
rug," said gallery owner Eric Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to look into himself and look at the situation of
black people as a whole and tell a story."</TE>
<TE>   But Riddle was not important to his community only because of his
work as an artist. He was an example of a dedicated family man who
worked just as hard to be a success in his private life.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Air Force in 1953 and later married Carmen Riddle,
his wife of nearly 50 years. They had six children.</TE>
<TE>   After the Air Force, Riddle worked various jobs during the day and
went to night school for nine years, earning a master's degree in
fine arts from Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, he practiced the art he loved so much. He even
taught some of his artistic philosophy at high schools in Los Angeles
and Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watts Riots Were a Major Influence</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the event that influenced him the most was the infamous
1965 Watts riots. Afterward, Riddle roamed the burned-down stores and
debris-riddled streets looking for inspiration, for a way to tell of
the tragedy that was happening there.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually stumbled upon a cash register in a burned-out store.
That register was used in an exhibit he called "The Ghetto Merchant,"
put on display in 1989 at the California African American Museum in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Riddle suffered a debilitating heart attack in Atlanta after
flying there to visit family for Thanksgiving. He lingered in the
hospital for months before dying last month. Those who knew him said
they will hear him and his messages every time they look at his art.</TE>
<TE>   "A really good artist can accomplish all the elements of pure art
and still create a message," Anthony Riddle said. "And that's what he
did. He created art without ever taking away from the message."</TE>

<HD>The Center of the South Gate Storm</HD>
<DH>Politics: City treasurer is facing charges, has been called
a bully. He says he stands up to 'sharks.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Robles has called opponents hallucinating dogs with rabies and
pigs at the trough. He has brawled atop boardroom tables, scuffled
with rivals, screamed Spanish-language profanities in South Gate City
Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Harmless bravado and bluster, it seemed to many.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday morning, the South Gate treasurer is scheduled to
appear in criminal court, to be charged with making murderous threats
against two state legislators and a police officer. Robles, also
accused of possessing illegal weapons, denies the charges.</LD>
<TE>   Before Robles came along, the working-class city of South Gate,
population 96,000, rarely captured much notice outside southeast Los
Angeles County. It does now.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 months, investigators from the district attorney's
office have probed one Robles ally after another. Secretary of State
Bill Jones last month declared the city's electoral system the most
corrupt in California.</TE>
<TE>   Angry residents have staged raucous acts of civil disobedience,
often at increasingly riotous City Council meetings, calling Robles
and other leaders "crooks" and "liars" as police escort them out of
the council chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Standing defiantly at the center of it all is Robles.</TE>
<TE>   A former foster-care child who became South Gate's youngest mayor
at 26, he has never made excuses for his outsider status within
Latino political circles. Always nattily attired and at turns affable
and intense, the 37-year-old Robles can quote Shakespeare and John F.
Kennedy one minute, and then lean in the next, chin forward, spitting
out his words like punches.</TE>
<TE>   "Call me a pit bull, say that I lack tact, say that I'm crude,"
said Robles in an interview before his arrest. "I'm not that suave,
go-along, get-along kind of guy. I call a spade a spade. I decided I
wasn't going to be a whore of the big guys, the big sharks. The only
reason I have these big political enemies is because I do tell them
no."</TE>
<TE>   His supporters call him a brilliant visionary, a misunderstood
politician unfairly targeted because he bucked the political
establishment. Critics call him a street-smart bully.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backers, Opponents Agree on His Tenacity</TE>
<TE>   One point everyone agrees on is this: Robles, a fiercely
intelligent and scrappy competitor, will tenaciously fight the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Albert would be the perfect villain in a Hollywood movie," joked
Pico Rivera, a cop spearheading an anti-Robles voter recall drive.
"He's chubby and ugly, but he gets the girls, drives the best cars,
and no matter what you do, you can't kill him. At the end of the
movie, it's his bloody hand that comes across the screen. He's still
alive to come back and haunt you another day."</TE>
<TE>   Robles launched his career 10 years ago, a recent UCLA graduate
bent on changing the world. Someday, he hoped, he would be in the
governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   But first came South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived there in 1991 and within one year entered City Hall a
councilman. He was elected city treasurer in 1997 and a year later
ran for state treasurer, stunning political observers by placing
second in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign, instead of creating excitement among Latino leaders,
was dismissed as a fluke because his was the only Latino name on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The finish served mainly to cast a permanent spotlight on Robles.
As a board member at a local water district, he was criticized for
using public money for acting and flying lessons, as well as travel
to exotic locales. A financial management firm where Robles works
received contracts at a water district where his sister was a board
member.</TE>
<TE>   Robles denied allegations of a conflict-of-interest violation,
saying his sister had never benefited financially from the contract.</TE>
<TE>   His feuds with fellow politicians have blasted across television
screens and the dais. He called state Sen. Martha Escutia a pig at
the trough and dismissed state Sen. Richard Polanco with an
expletive. One South Gate councilman said tearfully at a public
hearing that Robles' personal attacks contributed to a suicide
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   At a closed-door water district meeting, in front of witnesses,
Robles jumped atop a table and took a swing at a fellow board member,
according to sources. He also scuffled with his elderly rival, South
Gate Councilman Henry Gonzalez, who said he suffered a bruised rib
from the altercation.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' tenure has coincided with a sweeping degeneration in South
Gate politics. All sides have been targets, but the most vicious
attacks have been aimed at opponents of Robles.</TE>
<TE>   In campaign mailers, Robles' opponents have been called deadbeat
dads, tax scofflaws and drunks. Robles' most recent victory in the
treasurer's race was over a man once falsely portrayed in fliers as a
child molester.</TE>
<TE>   One Robles opponent has been shot--Gonzalez suffered minor head
injuries--and another's business was firebombed in crimes that have
never been solved. Police will not comment on their investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The treasurer has strongly denied any culpability, saying he is
set up as a "boogeyman."</TE>
<TE>   Robles could also be called the invisible man.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, he vanished from public view, an absence that
fuels the perception that he runs a shadow government, deciding the
city's future in meetings at his favorite health clubs, diners and
coffee shops.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to his arrest, an odd game of
cat-and-mouse developed. Robles' enemies tailed Robles' black Lexus
in traffic, photographed him at his restaurant meetings with
associates, watched him work the phones at the gym.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like an instant network," Rivera said. "People see
him, they start calling and it gets back to community leaders.
Everybody feels responsible to report Robles sightings."</TE>
<TE>   Robles said he had to alter his lifestyle. He bought a corner
house, "watches his back," and sleeps with a loaded 9-millimeter
handgun near his bed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't live in fear. Do I take a lot of precautions? Absolutely.
God helps those that help themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles denies controlling the city, saying he is merely the
treasurer, a nonvoting office. But when three Robles-backed council
members took control of the council in December 2000, the city
changed course immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Council salaries tripled, longtime employees were fired, and
Robles' allies and business associates won city contracts. A
sampling:</TE>
<TE>   This February, the council allowed a former business partner of
Robles to lease a 15-acre plot of city land at a fraction of its
market value, for as long as 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, Lou Moret, who was a board member at a
financial firm where Robles worked as a consultant, was hired last
year as a special consultant and launched a drastic restructuring of
city government that drew strong protests.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested, for example, that the city explore obtaining police
services from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, a move
that would essentially disband the city Police Department. Both
police unions are leaders in the recall drive to oust Robles.</TE>
<TE>   Moret's hiring did not violate any laws but deepened suspicions
that Robles wields significant influence over his council allies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angry Residents Attend Council Meetings</TE>
<TE>   Lashing back at the city's police and other proposals, angry
residents have turned weekly council meetings into rowdy
standing-room-only affairs--Latino immigrants sitting with off-duty
cops and senior citizens. They have banged sticks and waved signs
reading, "Albert Robles, the party is over," and "We're taking back
our city." Some dangled marionettes in front of the council members,
suggesting they are Robles' puppets.</TE>
<TE>   But where was Robles during all this?</TE>
<TE>   Although he stopped attending council meetings--Robles likens the
experience to visiting a zoo--his presence still loomed. Off-duty
officers once went so far as to scour the City Hall grounds during a
council meeting, peeking in windows and roaming hallways trying to
find out whether the elusive treasurer was literally working behind
the scenes. They didn't find him.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the council ordered a curious addition to Robles'
office: a bulletproof window.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent interview, Robles touted his accomplishments, saying
he has helped modernize the city and planned improvements for its
aging sewer system.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Robles said, his greatest satisfaction comes from the
little things, like the time he helped a woman change a flat tire,
and the fact that many residents send him cards at Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, when I'm thinking about what I've done, those are
things that remind that I'm a good human being, and that my creator
looks down on me and winks every once in a while and says, 'Keep up
the good work,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds at council meetings take a different view.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent session, Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, a Robles ally,
started to tell a fable-like story about a small village terrorized
by a murderous hillside villain who kills children. It was her
roundabout way of explaining how she voted on a council matter.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba continued her tale, saying the villagers asked
themselves who was "the maniac throwing the children down the river"?</TE>
<TE>   The crowd interrupted her. They had their own answer, more than
100 voices screaming as one: "Albert!"</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Bar New Homes at Rocket Facility</HD>
<DH>Safety: Measure would restrict development and accelerate
cleanup at the Santa Susana lab, site of a 1959 nuclear reactor
accident, other research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Future housing development at Boeing's Santa Susana Field Laboratory
near Chatsworth would be prohibited under legislation proposed by
state Sen. Sheila Kuehl.</LD>
<LD>   Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) wants to permanently bar housing
construction on the scenic hilltop should Boeing ever vacate the
property, which is operated by the company's Rocketdyne division.</LD>
<LD>   Kuehl's concerns stem largely from a partial nuclear meltdown that
occurred at the lab in 1959. Cleanup of radiation and chemical
contamination from decades of nuclear research and ongoing
rocket-engine testing at the site continues to this day.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to barring residential development, Kuehl's bill would
accelerate cleanup of radioactive contamination and tighten
restrictions on disposal of affected materials.</TE>
<TE>   It would also prohibit the sale or transfer of Boeing's 2,800-acre
Santa Susana property until all contaminated soil is removed or
determined to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to protect people from the possibility of radiation
poisoning," Kuehl said.</TE>
<TE>   Her bill is still in the development stages. A Senate committee
said last week that the legislation must undergo more revisions
before it can come back for a vote. One issue is whether the
restrictions should apply to the entire site.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl's bill as currently proposed has met with strong resistance
from Boeing officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It's placing an egregious restriction on our ability to determine
what we want to do on our property," said Dan Beck, a Boeing
spokesman. "We've been engaged in a very extensive cleanup program,
cleaning it up to a level that the regulatory agencies say [the
property] could be used for residential use in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Boeing property is never sold to a developer, Beck
said local governments should have final say over zoning and
development issues regarding the lab site.</TE>
<TE>   "There are private property rights in this country, and beyond
that, local authorities have the right to make zoning decisions,"
Beck said. "Where does it end? Next week, maybe it's something about
fuel spills or pesticides on other properties."</TE>
<TE>   Beck said Boeing has no plans to move its rocket-engine testing
facility, but it might do so in the future if it made good business
sense. Over the years, residential development has cropped up at the
base of the lab on both sides of the county line.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in 1947, the Santa Susana lab had the first nuclear reactor
in the United States to produce power for a commercial grid. At the
time, the lab was operated by Atomics International.</TE>
<TE>   The plant was crippled by a serious accident in July 1959, when 13
of its 43 uranium fuel rods ruptured or suffered a partial meltdown.
The plant was repaired and operated until 1967. But the accident was
unknown to the public until 1979, when an anti-nuclear group released
records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Energy officials have maintained that radioactive
contamination at the lab was quickly contained and did not pose a
threat to the public, but the issue has long been a source of heated
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear testing and research were halted at Santa Susana in 1989.
Cleanup of the nuclear portion of the site continues and could be
completed within five years, officials said.</TE>

<HD>A Watershed Event Ahead for Runoff?</HD>
<DH>Environment: Interim coastal manager wants to battle
pollution on a regional basis. More than 35 agencies now oversee the
county's large drainage areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clasping his hands behind his head, Don McIntyre, the county's new
watershed expert, leaned back in his office chair, his mind searching
for an answer to one of the region's most difficult problems.</LD>
<LD>   For too long, he said, Orange County's 13 watersheds have been
controlled by more than 35 city and county agencies, each forming a
veritable barrier to effective water-quality management.</LD>
<LD>   As the local water guru, McIntyre believes that one of his main
tasks in the months ahead is to smooth relations among all the
regulators and tackle water-quality issues on a regional basis.</LD>
<TE>   "These 13 watersheds take up a vast amount of land with no real
legal jurisdiction tying any one watershed [to another]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McIntyre, who was the city manager of Pasadena for 17 years,
recently assumed the watershed responsibilities of Larry Paul, the
county's coastal manager who retired late last year. McIntyre, 71,
will work part time until a permanent replacement is hired.</TE>
<TE>   He served as president of the Central City Assn., a Los Angeles
business group, and then as executive director of the Orange County
Sanitation District for five years. He began consultant work on
water-quality issues for the county last year after a six-month stint
as interim city manager for Seal Beach. In February, his $50,000
contract was increased to $100,000 and his assignment was broadened
to include watershed management. He has been dealing with divergent
views and approaches ever since.</TE>
<TE>   South County is slightly ahead of the curve because of early
efforts to improve such chronically polluted tributaries as Aliso
Creek in Laguna Beach and San Juan Creek in Dana Point. Both areas
have been targeted for improvement with the help of the Army Corps of
Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the county is turning to the north, where comparatively
little work on water-quality management has been done.</TE>
<TE>   McIntyre and local officials have scheduled an April 18 meeting
with public works departments from Los Angeles County and cities that
share Coyote Creek, the polluted San Gabriel River and their
tributaries. They hope to have frank discussions about mutual
environmental problems. The meeting, which is the first attempt at a
regional approach for northern Orange County, coincides with tougher
new state rules for controlling storm runoff, which pollutes streams,
rivers and coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   Cities in northern and central Orange County estimate that the
cost of compliance could be as much as $14 million, although
environmentalists say that figure is grossly inflated.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, in Laguna Woods, compliance might cost as much as
$630,000, "about the same as what we pay for police services," said
City Manager Leslie A. Keane.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods, with a population of 16,500, is conforming to some
of the new runoff requirements such as catch-basin filters for new
parking structures and improved street sweeping. The city is also
studying grease traps for restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the annual budget for the general fund is $4.3
million, Keane said that improving water quality in Laguna Woods is
"a major dollars-and-cents issue." But Orange County's costs pale in
comparison to Los Angeles County's, where it might cost as much as
$54 billion over the next 10 years to install the required controls
for storm water, said Signal Hill City Manager Ken Farfsing.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill is a member of the Coalition for Practical Regulation,
which includes Los Angeles County and 42 cities, including Artesia
and Cerritos along the Orange County line. The group contends that
the new runoff rules could slow development and cost jobs. But,
Farfsing said, the coalition supports a regional approach and looks
forward to starting talks on water quality. "When it rains, the rain
doesn't stop at the city limits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the upcoming meeting, officials hope to discuss storm-water
controls, how to pay for them, what studies are necessary, and their
relationship with the Army engineers.</TE>
<TE>   McIntyre said he is confident that the public is willing to pay
more to protect the environment. He cited a recent poll in San
Clemente in which 80% of the respondents said runoff and water
quality are their top concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The public will support quality-of-life issues," said Chris
Evans, director of the San Clemente-based Surfrider Foundation. "But
the county needs a 25-year plan. There needs to be a shift of the
paradigm. We have to stop looking at the ocean as a resource and also
as a dumping ground. We need a new ocean ethic."</TE>
<TE>   With the financial costs for new runoff regulations on people's
minds, McIntyre said he is aware that making headway on a consensus
for watershed projects may be slow going: "We will be asking cities
and the two counties to fund their share of these studies, and I
imagine they will not be too happy with that."</TE>
<TE>   But paying for water controls is only part of the problem, he
said. There are no agencies that control whole watersheds and no
models to go on. Aliso Creek's 34-mile course, for example, sweeps
through seven cities before it reaches the Pacific in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   McIntyre said he has spent years thinking about the management
difficulties of regulating such a watercourse. Perhaps, he said,
there should be a watershed authority, a joint-powers
agency--something like the Orange County Transportation Authority--or
separate agencies for each of the 13 watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about very important economic and political
issues," McIntyre said. "The county is taking its first baby steps
toward regional watershed management."</TE>

<HD>Brown Puts Doubts to Rest</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He rebounds from poor opening-day start to shut
out Rockies over seven innings and also homers in 6-4 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown came out throwing and swinging Sunday against the
Colorado Rockies, laying to rest any doubts that the veteran
right-hander is fully recovered from elbow surgery.</LD>
<LD>   With his fastball registering 96 mph at times, Brown rebounded
from his rocky opening-day start and devastated the Rockies from the
mound and at the plate in a 6-4 victory before 28,452 at Dodger
Stadium that completed a three-game sweep.</LD>
<LD>   Brown (1-1) gave up four hits, struck out five and did not issue a
walk in seven brilliant shutout innings. He threw 79 pitches, 57 for
strikes, and faced one batter over the minimum. Ben Petrick, who hit
a double in the third inning, was the only runner to reach second
base.</LD>
<TE>   Brown not only outpitched Colorado left-hander Mike Hampton (0-2),
he also outhit the ace of the Rockies, which is no small feat. Last
season, Hampton batted .291 and tied a National League record for
pitchers with seven home runs.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Brown who delivered the big hits Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He doubled and scored a run in the fourth inning, hit his second
career home run into the left-field pavilion against Hampton in the
sixth and drove in a run with a single against Mike James in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a career .120 hitter, equaled last season's hit total.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier when you can pick up a bat and not feel like your arm
is going to fall off," said Brown, who underwent surgery to repair a
torn flexor muscle in his elbow last Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that, I make no boasts."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it was a solid day's work for a pitcher who gave up
seven runs and nine hits in four innings against the San Francisco
Giants on Tuesday. Brown's performance followed outstanding efforts
by Andy Ashby and Kazuhisa Ishii as the Dodgers prepare for their
first trip, which begins Tuesday at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "The key when you have a bad outing is to try not to have another
one," Brown said. "It's not about strength, it's about timing. And at
times, yes, my timing was better today."</TE>
<TE>   Brown was replaced by Paul Quantrill at the start of the eighth
inning with the Dodgers leading, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies scored four runs in the inning and had the tying run
at the plate after Benny Agbayani singled to center against Eric
Gagne with two out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   But Gagne got Terry Shumpert to hit a fly ball to center field for
his first save.</TE>
<TE>   It was a noteworthy achievement for a young pitcher the Dodgers
hope will emerge as their closer.</TE>
<TE>   The game, though, was dominated by Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like he was in midseason form rather than a guy who is
still fresh from surgery," said catcher Chad Kreuter, who made his
first start of the season and threw out two runners attempting to
steal second. "He pitched today. He didn't go out and throw and rely
on movement."</TE>
<TE>   Kreuter's starting assignment was one of several moves made by
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, who juggled the lineup for the second
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "The bench guys need to get their at-bats," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to burn guys out in April."</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts got the day off and shortstop Cesar
Izturis moved into the leadoff spot and went two for five and scored
a run. Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek moved up from eighth to
second in the order and went one for four, drove in a run and also
scored a run. Marquis Grissom made his first start in center field
and went two for four with a run batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca, starting in place of Eric Karros at first base, went
two for five.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who caught Brown against the Giants, said after the
opening-day loss that he would not be surprised if Brown rebounded by
throwing a one-hitter in his next start.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, making his 400th start, came close.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our ace and always has been our ace," Lo Duca said. "He
showed everybody why today."</TE>

<HD>Now You Can Call Him the Big Dipper</HD>
<DH>Lakers: O'Neal scores 40 and has Riley comparing him to
Chamberlain after L.A. defeats Heat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Whatever postseason edge he will pursue for a Laker team that has its
vulnerable moments, Phil Jackson's only calling would appear to be to
take Shaquille O'Neal, this Shaquille O'Neal, and deliver him to Game
1, Series 1 of the Western Conference playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   On the floor for the first time in three games, since the morning
he awoke to a swollen right wrist and the next four days off, O'Neal
was fierce and fluid Sunday afternoon, all that makes the Lakers
imposing from April through June.</LD>
<LD>   He scored 40 points and took 11 rebounds in a 96-88 win over the
moribund Miami Heat, a bit livelier for national television. He
blocked two shots and had two assists and, even in the face of a
late, awkward attempt at a Hack-a-Shaq by the has-no-shame Pat Riley,
made 12 of 19 free-throw attempts, a handful even arcing and falling
softly.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the Shaq that will take us to another championship,"
forward Rick Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the other one, the toe-wrapped, orthotic-wearing,
Indocin-chewing center, is some treat for a league bereft of others
like him. O'Neal will finish in the top three in the most valuable
player vote despite a physically miserable season that probably will
be followed by surgery. He has averaged 26.7 points and 10.8 rebounds
and made 57.6% of his shots, all below his career numbers, all while
wincing on every step.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after a few days' rest, he's above the floor again, taking
rebounds, dunking without regard to a wrist he now believes was
sprained by repeated hacks--meaning the actions, not those who
attempt to defend him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get hurt," O'Neal had said. "I get taken out."</TE>
<TE>   When he returns, he is strong and spry and angry, and so even
Alonzo Mourning and Brian Grant, two of the NBA's tough guys,
flinched. O'Neal scored the Lakers' first 13 points and had 22 by
halftime, at which time there appeared to be little doubt the Lakers
would win for the second time on the four-game trip that ended
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat did push back late in the third and early in the fourth
quarter, when the Lakers stopped switching with Miami's high
screen-and-roll, and Heat jump shooters were open, and their shots
drew them to within 73-71. The Lakers scored the next 10 points, four
by O'Neal around the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I am just trying to get back on track," O'Neal said. "We are a
better team when all of our components are in place. Tonight my
teammates looked for me and I did what I always do."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant went to bed Saturday night feeling ill and woke up the
same way, and O'Neal hadn't played since Tuesday in Washington, so it
was predictable when O'Neal took hold of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Mourning was game, but O'Neal was particularly determined, and so
Zo had no chance. Bryant had 19 points and 11 rebounds and Devean
George had 11 second-quarter points, most of them when his defender
chased after O'Neal. But the Lakers went to O'Neal first, and if his
wrist bothered him, it didn't look like it, because his short jumpers
were soft and true.</TE>
<TE>   "He just picks you apart," Riley said. "He is very skilled now. He
sees everything very well. When he is ready to power you, he senses
you are not coming anymore and he makes up his mind and goes to the
rim.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the strongest player in the league and he has been for the
last four or five years. The only guy that I ever thought was close
to him was Wilt."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal would like that, of course, and for that compliment might
forgive Riley his late Hack-a-Shaq attempts. The Heat clearly hadn't
much practiced it, once fouling O'Neal before the ball was inbounded,
and then fouling him with less than two minutes to play, giving the
Lakers the option to have anyone shoot the free throw. Jackson
ignored the fun of having O'Neal shoot it, however, opting for Bryant
instead.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now, of course, is maintaining O'Neal's Chamberlain
mode through June.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have Shaq back," Jackson said, in understatement.
"It makes a difference in the team."</TE>

<HD>Decision Questioned but Not Pak's Result</HD>
<DH>Golf: She hangs on for first head-to-head win over
Sorenstam, despite laying up on 17th at Tarzana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Se Ri Pak heard the footsteps, and the source was right in front of
her: Annika Sorenstam was making a charge. The LPGA's top two ranked
players were in the same group Sunday for the final round of the
Office Depot Championship --locked in a head-to-head battle for the
title.</LD>
<LD>   A difficult layout at Tarzana's El Caballero Country Club, where
no one shot better than 68, only added to the drama. Pak, who wilted
slightly early and made what could have been a costly mistake late,
withstood No. 1-ranked Sorenstam and shot one-over-par 73 to win her
first title of 2002. Her three-round total of seven-under 209 was one
better than Sorenstam, who shot 71 Sunday. Pak earned $150,000 and a
new car.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Diaz, also playing in the final group, shot 73 and finished
four shots behind Pak in third place, but wasn't a major factor. Pak
and Sorenstam passed the lead back and forth on the front nine and
twice were tied before Pak took control midway through the back nine.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew [Sorenstam] was right behind me, but I tried not to think
about it out there," Pak said. "I knew she wasn't going to back off
easily, but I was not just going to give my trophy away."</TE>
<TE>   She nearly did on No. 17. Pak came to the par-five hole with a
three-shot lead and decided to play it safe. After a drive down the
middle of the fairway, Pak, who eagled the hole Saturday, was only
180 yards out, but laid up with a sand wedge.</TE>
<TE>   Her third shot, also a sand wedge, carried past the pin and into
the rough behind the green. She chipped up, then two-putted for
bogey. Sorenstam, meanwhile, hit to the fringe with her second shot
and barely missed an 18-foot eagle putt. She tapped in for birdie and
went to the 18th one stroke back.</TE>
<TE>   Pak responded by hitting her approach on 18 to within 20 feet and
coming within one roll of the ball of making it. Sorenstam missed her
30-foot birdie attempt and Pak won.</TE>
<TE>   "Today it was a risky shot the way my ball was positioned," Pak
said of laying up at No. 17. "I wasn't going to just go for it and
make a stupid mistake. If I missed a birdie then fine, I'd just make
a par and leave, but I hit it too good and it went over."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam questioned Pak's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really quite surprised she made that play," Sorenstam said.
"That pin and where she laid up wasn't an easy shot either, so I
don't really know what she was thinking. That could have been a
turnaround in that tournament, easily. That could have been a costly
mistake for her, but she regrouped and played really solid on the
last hole and almost made birdie."</TE>
<TE>   It was exactly the type of victory Pak needed. Although Pak won a
career-high five tournament titles last year, she finished second to
Sorenstam twice and had never beaten the Swede head-to-head in a
final round. "It's a little bit painful, so don't ask me about it
anymore," Pak joked.</TE>
<TE>   Although she is ranked No. 2, Pak still considers herself a step
behind Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   "Her game is 100% all the time," Pak said. "I'm only 70%. She hits
a lot of difficult shots every day, and I need more experience
playing to help my game. Everything is perfect for her already. For
me, right now I'm close but not 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sorenstam and Karrie Webb have won the last five
player-of-the-year awards, the Swede wouldn't be surprised if Pak
challenged for the award soon.</TE>
<TE>   "She won five times, and she is still in the shadow," Sorenstam
said. "I mean she doesn't get the credit she deserves. She's a
wonderful player, and I'm sure we'll have several more battles like
this."</TE>

<HD>Wooden Award Goes to Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the trophy for the Wooden Award was designed, John Wooden wanted
one more figure to depict the complete player besides the passer, the
shooter, the defender, the ballhandler and the rebounder.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted someone with a cap and gown," Wooden said.</LD>
<LD>   That can be a lot to ask in an age of players leaving early for
the NBA, but Wooden couldn't have been more satisfied Sunday when
Jason Williams of Duke won the award.</LD>
<TE>   Although Williams is making himself eligible for the NBA draft
after his junior season, he is on track to earn his degree in
sociology this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm exceptionally pleased by his graduating early, going to
summer school to get the extra units which he'd need," Wooden said.</TE>
<TE>   "When anyone who receives it gets his cap and gown, it pleases me
very, very much."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who averaged 21 points a game for a Blue Devil team
ranked No. 1 in the nation much of the season, became the third Duke
player in the last four years to win the award. Shane Battier won
last year and Elton Brand won in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The runner-up to Battier last year, Williams won by a considerable
margin with 5,223 points, followed by junior forward Drew Gooden of
Kansas with 4,323 and senior guard Juan Dixon of Maryland with 3,845.
The other finalists were Cincinnati senior guard Steve Logan and
Gonzaga senior guard Dan Dickau.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden said an announcement should come this week on whether or
not he will make himself eligible for the draft.</TE>
<TE>   "[Not winning an NCAA championship] makes the decision a little
tougher because I do want to win and I wanted my last game to end on
a good note, but you also have to look at some other reasons," Gooden
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Athletic Club also honored former Louisville coach
Denny Crum with its fourth Legends of Coaching award for a Hall of
Fame career marked by the 1980 and '86 NCAA championships.</TE>
<TE>   Because Crum played and coached under Wooden at UCLA, the award
had special meaning to both men.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard me say it before: He was born to coach," Wooden
said. "Some of the national championships we won, we probably
wouldn't have if we hadn't had him, and he might have won some more
if he hadn't played us when we had some of the players he'd recruited
for us. I'm very proud of him."</TE>
<TE>   The previous coaches to earn the honor were Dean Smith, Mike
Krzyzewski and Lute Olson.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a couple of awards that probably mean as much to me as
they possibly could," Crum said. "Coach presented me when I was
inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. That was probably
the proudest moment of my professional career, and to receive this
award in his name is something special. You don't even dream about
having these kinds of awards."</TE>
<TE>   Accepting the award, Crum looked to Wooden and said, "I love you,
Coach."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' margin in the player of the year award would have been
larger if not for Duke's regional semifinal loss to Indiana in the
NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden and Dixon, who took their teams to the Final Four, picked
up votes in balloting that continued until March 25, the day after
the regional finals, but Williams' lead was far too big.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it was disappointing we didn't get a chance to make it
to the Final Four or have a chance to play Maryland in Round 3 in
what would have been one of the biggest games ever," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams won a national championship last year, and said he
was happy for Dixon, a player he paid tribute to after winning the
award.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, sitting back and watching the game ... just to see them
win it, just tasting the glory we had last year, knowing the feeling
of how it feels to win a national championship and knowing all the
hard times it takes to get there.... " Williams said. "It's great to
see him feel that same kind of sensation. I was really happy for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon beat out Williams for Atlantic Coast Conference player of
the year and was the most outstanding player of the Final Four as
Maryland won the NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Wooden Award voting gone a week longer, Dixon might have
won that too.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could make a case for it, but I'm not sweating it,"
Dixon said as the formal rivals complimented each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows how much respect we have for each other," he said.</TE>

<DH>Legendary Bobby Jones Still Towers Over Augusta Event</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Jones died more than 30 years ago, but something he left behind
still manages to summon vivid memories of golf's greatest player. The
Masters begins Thursday at the course he carved out of an old nursery
on hilly, rolling terrain in Augusta, Ga.</LD>
<LD>   It's still Bobby Jones' tournament, fully grown into one of golf's
most treasured and revered institutions--much like Jones himself.</LD>
<LD>   Jones attained an unusual status in sport, as an icon, and
maintains it more than three decades after his death. Many in the
game feel about Jones the same way Arnold Palmer does.</LD>
<TE>   "Bobby Jones was a real gentleman golfer," Palmer said. "What he
accomplished in golf, no one else has and probably never will. He's
also the father of Augusta National and the Masters, and all those
factors are significant to his enduring popularity."</TE>
<TE>   How Jones has endured is a story--his own story, actually--of
achieving great fame through heroic achievements, showing the best
examples of sportsmanship and humility, getting out of the spotlight
early and dying too young.</TE>
<TE>   According to Jones' historian and biographer, Sidney L. Matthew,
Jones knew exactly what he was doing when he stopped playing
regularly in 1930 at age 28.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the confidence and grace to leave the stage at the top,"
Matthew said. "That's something very few people can do. And he went
on to become a respected ambassador whose opinion was sought because
everyone knew it would be reasoned and conservative and completely
thought out."</TE>
<TE>   The Jones legacy is storybook stuff, but also powerful. Hootie
Johnson, who follows Jones in the line of chairmen of Augusta
National, invokes Jones' name often. "The spirit of Bob Jones is
alive today," Johnson said. "It is evident here at Augusta National
and in the Masters, in his outstanding player record and the decency
and honesty he brought to the game of golf.</TE>
<TE>   "He is missed by those that knew him and those who didn't."</TE>
<TE>   How Jones has achieved such a following is not simply told, but
it's worth retelling. It is his own story.</TE>
<TE>   A Humble Beginning</TE>
<TE>   Jones was born on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1902, in his
parents' house across the street from Grant Park in Atlanta. It was
an old house, and the Joneses shared it with their friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan M. Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Tyre Jones Jr., was named after his paternal grandfather,
Robert Tyre Jones, who was 6 feet 5 and weighed 235 pounds. But there
was nothing in the physical characteristics of young "Rob" to remind
relatives of his grandfather. He would grow up to be known as the
most famous golfer in history, but as a child, Jones was frail and
sickly, the result of a gastrointestinal disorder, the same ailment
that killed his younger brother, William, at 3 months. Jones couldn't
eat solid food until he was 5.</TE>
<TE>   But Bobby Jones, whose family was far from impoverished, was able
to enjoy some of the privileges of wealth. His grandfather was a
successful entrepreneur who established the Jones Mercantile Co. in
1879 and then the Canton Cotton Mill. Bobby Jones' father, Robert
Purmedus Jones, was an attorney and also excelled at athletics,
especially baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jones' father was called "the Colonel," as an affectionate
term. But as a young man, the Colonel was treated more like an
enlisted man as far as sports went. Robert Tyre Jones never saw his
son play baseball at the University of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "No son of mine is going to be a baseball player," the elder Jones
is supposed to have said. "You're going to have a profession."</TE>
<TE>   So Robert Purmedus Jones went to Mercer Law School and became
general counsel to an emerging local company that seemed to have
promise, called Coca-Cola.</TE>
<TE>   Young Rob was attracted to golf almost as soon as he could walk,
eventually playing at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. .</TE>
<TE>   Fulton Colville, a member at Atlanta Athletic Club who was playing
one day at East Lake, gave Jones his first club: a cut-down one-iron,
called a "cleek."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, neither Jones nor his friend, Frank Meador, was old
enough to play at the club, so they had to find other places to swing
their hickory-shafted clubs. On most days, you could find Bobby and
Frank playing in the draining ditch or along the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Jones built up his club collection, including a brassie,
the equivalent of a two-wood, cut down from a club from his mother,
Clara. He followed his parents around the course and hit shots when
they said it was all right. Jones started imitating the swing of
Stewart Maiden, the pro at East Lake, and showed uncanny ability from
the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Jones to prove his skill at golf. He won
his first cup in a tournament when he was 6 and kept the trophy
polished. He even slept with it.</TE>
<TE>   A Prodigy</TE>
<TE>   At 11, Jones shot an 80 at East Lake. At 13, he shot a 70 and won
the club championships not only at East Lake, but at Druid Hills Golf
Club as well.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Georgia Amateur and reached the quarterfinals of the
U.S. Amateur at Merion Cricket Club in Haverford, Pa., as a
14-year-old. The U.S. Amateur took a two-year break for World War I
in 1917-18, but the next time it was held, Jones made it to the final
at Oakmont, where he was defeated by S. Davidson Herron.</TE>
<TE>   By now, it was no secret that Jones was something special. At 18
in 1920, Jones won the Southern Amateur in Atlanta, was a
semifinalist at the U.S. Amateur and tied for eighth at the U.S.
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had graduated from high school at 16 and graduated from
Georgia Tech in 1922, earning a degree in mechanical engineering. At
Tech, Jones was so devoted to his studies, he earned the nickname
"Deac." Walter Coxe, a college classmate, said of Jones: "Jones was a
fine, clean, friendly, healthy, fun-loving, smart, modest and
hard-working man."</TE>
<TE>   It was a description that would serve Jones for years, until his
health began to gradually fail.</TE>
<TE>   Jones excelled off the golf course nearly as much as on it. He
earned his second degree, in English literature, at Harvard. He would
eventually take two semesters of law at Emory University, then passed
the bar exam on his first try.</TE>
<TE>   Said Matthew: "Jones could be just as conversant in discussing
'The Heart of Midlothian' by Sir Walter Scott as studying a putt on
the golf course. He was the most intellectually brilliant player who
ever played the game, no question.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Jones, golfers were mostly former caddies and not very
well thought of. The players were not educated. Jones changed the
perception and set the standard."</TE>
<TE>   Jones never turned professional and was basically a part-time
golfer, a decision that he never regretted and in fact affirmed
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   On the golf course, Jones was uniformly brilliant. His playing
career was like a huge, bright comet that blazed across the sky and
captured everyone's attention and then was gone too soon.</TE>
<TE>   Jones competed in major championships for 13 years, and for nine
of those years he was either a high school or college student. He was
a part-time player and full-time genius. He played in 52 tournaments
during that period, an average of four a year, and won 23.</TE>
<TE>   A Heroic Champion</TE>
<TE>   Jones was 28 when he retired from regular competition on Nov. 17,
1930. He had won 13 of the 21 majors he had played from 1923-1930:
five U.S. Amateurs, four U.S. Opens, three British Opens and one
British Amateur.</TE>
<TE>   Even when Jones didn't win, he was close. In 11 of the last 12
U.S. Opens and British Opens he played, he was either first or
second.</TE>
<TE>   His greatest achievement in golf took a year. In 1930 Jones won
all four of what were at the time considered the biggest tournaments
in golf--the U.S. Open at Interlachen, the U.S. Amateur at Merion,
the British Amateur at St. Andrews and the British Open at Hoylake.</TE>
<TE>   It was the grand slam. No one had ever done it, and although Tiger
Woods' achievement of holding all four major titles at the same time
is stunningly remarkable, Woods has not matched Jones' record of
winning all four of golf's biggest championships in the same calendar
year.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Warren Wind wrote in 1930, after Jones had won the U.S.
Amateur for a fifth time and completed the one-year sweep: "In the
clubhouse, after a talk with his father, he began to digest the
reality that the Grand Slam was factually behind him and with that,
the ever-accumulating strain he had carried for months ... when he
appeared for the presentation ceremonies, he looked years longer."</TE>
<TE>   Even more than 70 years ago, the sporting public was enthralled by
dominant athletes. The fact that Jones actually lived up to his image
as a sportsman of the highest degree only enhanced his already
considerable reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' wife, Mary, his high school sweetheart, once said that
after she kissed Bobby Jones for the first time, she knew she would
never kiss another man. Jones felt the same way about her.</TE>
<TE>   "Surely a lot of hotel-room keys were thrown at his feet," Matthew
said. "But he never picked them up."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' reputation as a sportsman was cemented on the golf course
and it can be illustrated in two examples. Competing in the first
round of the 1925 U.S. Open at Worcester Country Club in Worcester,
Mass., Jones was addressing a chip shot on the 11th hole and his ball
moved. No one saw it but Jones. Later, he was congratulated for
calling a requisite one-stroke penalty on himself, but Jones was not
impressed with his own action.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jones: "You might as well praise a man for not robbing a
bank."</TE>
<TE>   Jones wound up losing the Open by one shot to Willie Macfarlane in
a 36-hole playoff. Jones was playing the 1926 British Open at Royal
Lytham and left the course to eat lunch at a hotel. When he returned,
he had forgotten his player's badge. Instead of talking his way in,
Jones stood in line with the fans and paid the two pounds admission
fee.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Jones was on his way toward becoming a national
treasure, but nowhere was this greater than in Atlanta. In 1927, a
group of appreciative local people presented Jones with a $50,000
gift so he could buy a new house. Jones tearfully accepted the gift,
but after considering how it might affect his avowed amateur status,
returned the money, thus showing his political awareness of the USGA
as well as his own finesse and judgment.</TE>
<TE>   He represented the finest ideals of amateurism. Matthews, the
author of "Life &amp; Times of Bobby Jones, Portrait of a Gentleman,"
says that none of our modern athletes compares to Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one of our role models has had the full, complete package
Jones has," Matthew said. "Babe Ruth, he had a turbulent childhood, a
turbulent marriage. He was a broken man in many phases of his life. I
say that Bobby Jones was a hero at 5 o'clock. What you saw on the
field of play was exactly what you saw on the train when he was
exhausted going home.</TE>
<TE>   "Jones never lived a double standard. He was a genuine hero, 24
hours a day."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew said Jones bridged significant eras of golf, from Harry
Vardon to Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "People like Bobby Jones, they come around only once a century."</TE>
<TE>   A Noble End</TE>
<TE>   One of Jones' playing partners was Charlie Yates, 11 years his
junior and a member at both East Lake and Atlanta Athletic Club. As a
kid, Yates used to sneak under the fence at East Lake to take a peak
at the prodigy.</TE>
<TE>   Yates is the only person still living who played in the first
Masters, in 1934, a tournament Jones and Augusta National partner
Clifford Roberts organized for their golfing friends.</TE>
<TE>   Yates says Jones made the right decision that November day in 1930
when he decided to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "It think what he did was so smart," Yates said. "Having conquered
all worlds, he retired, because he loved to play with his friends."</TE>
<TE>   Once retired, Jones turned his attention to creating a golf
course. He enlisted famed architect Alistair MacKenzie to design a
layout that would suit players of all abilities, a risk-reward type
of course. And that is just what Augusta National has represented
since its formal opening in January 1933.</TE>
<TE>   The first several tournaments were called the Augusta National
Invitational, not the Masters, because Jones considered such a name
pretentious, but he changed his mind after urgings from Roberts.
Jones played in the first 12 Masters, though never finishing higher
than 13th, his place in the inaugural event.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also made a celebrated series of golf motion pictures for
Warner Bros., became a vice president for A.G. Spalding &amp; Bros.,
wrote several books, continued his career as a lawyer with Coca-Cola
and was a vital business and social leader with Mary in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he never really missed tournament play.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf is like eating peanuts," he once said. "You can play too
much or too little. I've become reconciled to the fact that I'll
never play as well as I used to."</TE>
<TE>   His last round of golf was Aug. 15, 1948, at East Lake Golf Club.
Yates had played with Jones a few weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall quite vividly and sadly how one day in 1948 ... Bob said
that he had trouble getting the club down from the top of his swing
because of the pain in his back."</TE>
<TE>   Only 46, Jones was stricken by syringomyelia, a neurological
spinal disease. When he was officially diagnosed some eight years
later, Jones was told that the disease afflicts about one person in a
million each year. Jones did not give in to self-pity. He once said
he would not accept "this thing" as he referred to his rare ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "I fight it every day. When it first happened to me, I was pretty
bitter, and there were times when I didn't want to go on living. But
I did go on living, so I had to face the problem of how I was to
live. I decided that I'd just do the very best I could."</TE>
<TE>   Jones underwent spinal surgery in 1948 and in 1950. He used a
cane, then two canes, then was forced into a wheelchair. His weight
dropped to less than 100 pounds and he never saw the Masters after
1967. The feeling in his hands had become so bad that he could sign
letters only by holding a pen taped to a tennis ball.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1952 he had a heart attack, but he was well enough
three months later to attend a ceremony in his honor at the USGA
headquarters in New York.</TE>
<TE>   At the ceremony, a letter from one of Jones' close friends and
Augusta National members was read. It was from President Dwight
Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have been fortunate enough to know him realize that his
fame as a golfer is transcended by his inestimable qualities as a
human being," the letter said. "His gift to his friends is the warmth
that comes from unselfishness, superb judgment, nobility of
character, unwavering loyalty to principle."</TE>
<TE>   It is said that Jones wept openly.</TE>
<TE>   He died Dec. 18, 1971, in Atlanta. He was buried two days later at
Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta. The 66th Masters will be played this
week at Augusta National. Jones would have been 100 years old.</TE>

priorities could suffer.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The cost of bolstering airport security is mounting rapidly, and
this year alone could run more than triple what has been budgeted,
congressional and aviation industry officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The unexpectedly steep costs facing the new Transportation Security
Administration, created after Sept. 11, stem from greater manpower needs,
more expensive bomb detection equipment at airports and other factors.
They have prompted the Bush administration to ask Congress for an
additional $4.4 billion for the fledgling agency, which would bring its
funding in the current fiscal year to more than $6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   It could go higher. In a San Francisco speech last month,
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said the TSA will be bigger
than the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Border Patrol combined.
The agency may have to hire more than 50,000 employees, he said, a 25%
increase over previous estimates of about 40,000 workers.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional aides said some scenarios call for as many as 70,000 TSA
screeners, special agents and air marshals. Whatever the final number, it
illustrates the high price that government and many private companies
will have to pay as an open society seeks to transform itself into a
bulwark against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Congress appropriates billions more dollars for security,
concern is growing that funding may be diverted from two other
priorities: improving aviation safety and reducing runway congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be enormously expensive to do what is needed in the
area of security, so staying focused on safety and capacity issues is
going to be more important than ever before," Federal Aviation
Administration head Jane Garvey said in a recent speech.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that Congress didn't guarantee enough cash flow
when it created the TSA in November and gave it a little more than a year
to erase the reputation of U.S. airports as an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers imposed an airline ticket fee on passengers of $2.50 per
flight segment, with a maximum of $10 per round trip. That is expected to
generate only about $1 billion a year. An additional $700 million to $1
billion a year would come from airline contributions, required by the
legislation for two years. The rules for assessing those levies are still
being drafted.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of people studying this in the federal government,
and they are having a hard time admitting to themselves what it's going
to cost," said Charles Barclay, president of the American Assn. of
Airport Executives. "If we take all that money away from runway and
taxiway improvements, [passengers] will find that we have a security
system, but we can't handle the traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Paying for aviation security will be a priority when Congress returns
from recess on Tuesday. The House Appropriations Committee has scheduled
a hearing on April 17. Airports are only one component in a
transportation security equation that includes ports, rail, transit,
trucks and pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   Security sticker shock is spreading on Capitol Hill and in the Bush
administration, said officials involved with transportation issues.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers want to follow through on their commitment to stronger
security, a Senate staffer said. But some projects may go at a slower
pace as funding requests get more detailed scrutiny from Capitol Hill and
the administration.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Senate staffer said the TSA originally had asked the
White House to request $6 billion in supplemental funding from Congress.
The White House pared the request to $4 billion, with the result that
additional upgrades to cargo and airport perimeter security may be
delayed.</TE>
<TE>   TSA spokesman Jonathan Thompson said cost estimates have been
particularly difficult because the agency is being built from scratch,
and key issues such as what technology to use for detecting explosives in
baggage have not been fully worked out.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA plans to use a mix of bomb detection systems. There will be
state-of-the art machines that cost $1 million apiece and use CT
technology similar to medical scanners. These require fewer operators.
Other devices, such as the equipment being used to check for shoe bombs,
are much less expensive but require more workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't figured out what the proper mix is going to be," Thompson
said. "We fully expect to have a detailed accounting [for Congress] of
where we are going and where we have been."</TE>
<TE>   Escalating security costs at the federal level have direct
implications for local authorities, who own and operate airports such as
Los Angeles International, and for the airline industry.</TE>
<TE>   Barclay, of the airports association, said local governments are
concerned that Washington may not make good on promises to defray their
security costs. For example, he said the TSA is estimating a cost of only
$175,000 per unit to install CT scanners for baggage. Airports reckon
many of these huge machines will cost $1 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just a huge variance in perception between what people in
the federal government are estimating versus what our members are
seeing," Barclay said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry says it is also bearing significantly higher
costs for security. Some industry officials fear that the government will
raise the new security fee on tickets, making it harder for carriers to
raise their own prices. While passengers are flying again, airlines have
had to offer discounts to entice them, and profitability continues to
elude the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The [security] cost is huge, and we are getting very concerned," said
Dick Doubrava, a security expert with the Air Transport Assn. "Ticket
prices go up, but we're not getting the added revenue."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Attacks Persist Despite Call for Pullout</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Ahead of Powell's visit to region, army gains ground in
two West Bank militant hot spots. A general says assault there could wind
down as soon as today.</DH>

<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops and helicopters hammered away Sunday at determined
but weakening Palestinian resistance in Nablus and in the Jenin refugee
camp, the prime remaining targets of an Israeli military under
international pressure to curtail its West Bank offensive.</LD>
<LD>   Officials on both sides of the conflict reported that Israeli forces
had gained ground, and a senior Israeli general predicted that the
assault on the two strongholds could wind down as soon as today.</LD>
<LD>   At least 30 Palestinians have been killed in house-to-house combat
here in the last two days, including a legendary chief who fell Sunday as
his forces retreated in a warren of underground tunnels and winding
alleys.</LD>
<TE>   And in a troubling development at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, a fire broke out early today on the second floor of the parish
building of the Catholic monastery adjacent to the besieged church, which
is occupied by more than 140 Palestinian gunmen and civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli gunfire killed a Palestinian policeman in the incident,
according to a priest and a Palestinian official inside the historic site
revered as Jesus' birthplace. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the
exchange of fire with the Palestinians, according to Israeli officials.</TE>
<TE>   At Israel's northern border, Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon unleashed
another barrage of mortar and antitank fire into Israel, wounding six
Israeli soldiers. That elicited a counterattack with artillery and
rockets and an Israeli warning to Syria, which supports the guerrillas
and permits their activity in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   And on the increasingly sensitive political front, Israeli leaders
defended their West Bank incursion a day after Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon rebuffed President Bush's call for Israel to withdraw from
Palestinian territories without delay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fateful battle," Sharon said at a Cabinet meeting Sunday,
"a war for our homes."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon and his top aides sent conciliatory signals as well, saying
they hope to finish the operation soon. Israeli leaders hinted that
pullbacks could occur in calmer areas and announced the temporary lifting
of curfews in cities including Ramallah, the site of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's battered headquarters, and the town
of Jenin near the embattled refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Our time is running out" because of Bush administration requests and
this week's diplomatic mission by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell,
Defense Minister Bin-yamin Ben-Eliezer told Israeli radio. "But we will
not pull out only to return soon."</TE>
<TE>   The military cannot move more quickly, Israeli leaders argued, because
it must uproot the infrastructure of terrorist groups while refraining
from aerial and artillery bombardments to minimize civilian casualties.
Israeli defense officials warned that an abrupt withdrawal--as demanded
by European and Arab governments--could result in another calamitous
round of Palestinian terrorism and Israeli retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everybody wants us to get out of the territories," said Maj. Gen.
Dan Harel, operations chief of the Israeli army, expressing reluctance to
leave a mission unfinished. "If we do it too soon, another wave of terror
will hit Israeli cities and streets. And we'll go back in again.
Paradoxically, if we stay in we can do more to put an end to terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown has been a success, Harel said, noting that intelligence
reports of suicide bomb plots in Palestinian territory have dropped
dramatically. After near-daily suicide attacks killed 128 Israelis in
March, a week has gone by without a major suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Since the offensive was unleashed March 29, about 12 Israelis and 200
Palestinians have died in the hostilities, Harel told reporters. About
1,300 Palestinians have been detained by the Israelis, who have
identified 500 to 600 prisoners involved in terrorism and 60 to 70
hard-core terrorists, he said. Israeli forces say they have also
dismantled more than 10 labs dedicated to preparing terrorist explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say civilians have been undeserving victims of the
violence and destruction. Their plight caused the foreign ministers of
Spain and Belgium to warn Sunday that the European Union will consider
sanctions if the Sharon government does not relent.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions of a cease-fire seemed fanciful, though, amid the blood
and hate in war zones such as Nablus, the biggest and most militant West
Bank city, where close-quarters combat felled three Palestinian leaders
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Tabouk died about noon in the casbah, the old market area where
he was undisputed top dog. Tabouk commanded his own armed militant group
after years as a feared chieftain of the Fatah movement during the first
intifada in the late 1980s and early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Tabouk was cut down in the street during an exchange of fire with
Israeli infantry. His body lay face down, clad in black jeans, sweatshirt
and holster.</TE>
<TE>   In a frenzy stoked by days of gunplay and nights without sleep,
anguished fighters tried to retrieve Tabouk's corpse. A gunman darted
from a narrow lane toward his fallen leader as another shouted for
protective fire: "Cover, cover!"</TE>
<TE>   Before reaching Tabouk's corpse, the fighter was hit and went down,
blood pouring from his mouth and leg. His comrades dragged him away.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurry up, hurry up!" yelled a Palestinian. "Give me something to
carry him on. He's alive, he's alive!" Wearing black ski masks and green
headbands, fighters fired from behind sandbags, pressed themselves
against stone walls, sprinted through underground tunnels. A fighter
crouched in a tunnel over a car battery with wires in his hands, ready to
set off an explosive booby trap if the Israelis approached. In the
windows of hillside homes, Palestinian women and children cheered on the
men with shouts of "God is great!"</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Nablus have spent five days huddled in their homes. A few
terraced streets above the casbah, Ranin Henna, 23, gazed from her
apartment building at smoke rising from the city and Apache helicopters
swooping in.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sleep," said Henna, mother of a 2-month-old baby. Henna's
grandmother has run out of medication for her diabetes and high blood
pressure. "It's extraordinary, the sounds and the fighting. We are
terrified. . . . At any time the Israelis can come into your home. They
came in yesterday afternoon. They knocked on the door, searched the house
and inspected the roof. They wanted to see if they could put a sniper up
there."</TE>
<TE>   Two other leaders were killed in Nablus as the Israelis pressed
forward, their generals predicting they would soon dominate most of the
casbah. Palestinian legislator Hussam Khader remained defiant, though.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what Sharon does, he will never be able to kill the spirit
of the Palestinians," Khader said in a telephone interview. "The
resistance will still continue."</TE>
<TE>   Resistance turned self-destructively desperate in the Jenin camp,
where five Palestinians approached Israeli soldiers offering to surrender
then attempted a suicide bomb attack. The five were gunned down, and one
was blown up as the explosives strapped to him went off, army officials
said. There were no Israeli casualties.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll in the refugee camp is close to 100, according to
Palestinian sources. Fighters were being pushed into the center of the
camp amid helicopter barrages but were determined to fight to the death,
said Jamal Shati, another Palestinian legislator.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real war of annihilation," Shati said.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the incident at the church raised tensions, but the fire
apparently was put out. There were differing versions of the deadly
incident, which took place close to dawn.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli military source said Palestinian gunmen fired from the
Church of the Nativity and adjacent St. Catherine's Church on Israeli
soldiers in two rooftop posts outside the compound. Gunfire and grenades
wounded two Israeli soldiers, who are believed to be in serious
condition, and troops returned fire, the military source said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians speaking by phone from inside the compound identified the
slain man as Khaled Siam, 23, a Palestinian Authority police officer.
Gunfire could be heard in the background as an agitated Bethlehem Gov.
Mohammed Madani called on his fellow Palestinians not to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   At about 7 a.m., a Franciscan monk said by telephone that Israeli
troops outside and Palestinian gunmen inside had allowed firefighters
into the compound to put out the blaze in the parish building, an
administrative annex of St. Catherine's Church connected to the
monastery. The cause of the fire was not clear.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers were seen on the roof of the building that caught
fire, Madani said. They retreated, apparently leaving behind three M-16
rifles that were recovered by Palestinian fighters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The civil defense has been allowed inside," the Rev. Ibrahim Faltas
said by telephone from St. Catherine's. "We call for an immediate
investigation of what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army did not comment on the allegation that troops entered
the compound, but Israeli commanders say they are taking pains to protect
the nearly 80 clerics and the church.</TE>

<HD>Simon Offers Few Specifics as 'the Candidate of Ideas'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr. pledges that as governor he would
cut taxes, balance the budget, create child-care programs at every school
and preside over a freeway- and reservoir-building spree.</LD>
<LD>   But despite spending much of the last year touting himself as "the
candidate of ideas" who will focus on the nuts-and-bolts issues Simon
says Californians care about, he has put forward only sketchy plans on
how he would achieve several of his ambitious goals.</LD>
<LD>   On some issues, such as the budget, Simon furnishes long lists of
proposals. In other areas, however, he offers fewer details.</LD>
<TE>   Simon argues for relying less on state bonds to fund school
construction and more on private companies, but has not spelled out how
he would do that. He has not explained how to fund a child-care program
that experts say would cost more than $2 billion. Nor has Simon issued an
energy plan, though he has indicated he would rely more on the free
market than has Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign said its candidate was not available to be
interviewed for this article. Spokesman Jeff Flint said the campaign has
a limited staff and cannot, for example, issue the lengthy budget
document that one would expect from a governor's office. Still, he said
more detailed proposals will be rolled out over the next several months.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a 7 1/2-month general election campaign to run, during
which you can count on us to provide more details," Flint said. "We ran a
pretty policy-based campaign [in the primary] and we will continue to do
that in the general."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Wittman of the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington,
D.C., said he is not surprised that Simon, a surprise winner in the
Republican primary, relies more on generalities than detailed proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the difference between a longshot primary candidate and the
one who actually has a chance to win the pot of gold," he said. "That
transition can be very painful and very arduous for a candidate."</TE>
<TE>Davis Campaign Seizes on Lack of Specificity</TE>
<TE>   The lack of specificity in some of Simon's ideas has already been
seized upon by the Davis campaign. The governor's chief political
advisor, Garry South, circulated a memo to political reporters after a
Simon speech to a doctors' group describing the Republican's approach as
"take few questions and don't call me in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   What Simon has released are mainly broad-brush proposals that rely on
traditional conservative ideas to attain what many say is an impossible
goal--melding the expansionist legacy of former Democratic Gov. Pat
Brown, who presided over a massive expansion of government to build much
of the state's public schools and roadways, with the small-government
principles of the man who ousted Brown, Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like an oxymoron," Wittman said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a wealthy financier, insists that the combination is possible,
even during tight economic times. The public sector, he has repeatedly
argued, is tapped out and now must rely on the private sector's muscle to
keep California growing. Saying the state needs $175 billion worth of new
projects, Simon proposes an increased role for corporations in everything
from running troubled schools to building new freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a $175-billion need and there's no way any particular
entity can satisfy that--in this case the entity is the
government--you've got to look to someplace else to finance that need,"
Simon said at a recent Los Angeles news conference. "Even if you did not
think the private sector was the best, which I do in most instances,
you'd still have to look at options."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, a former Democratic political consultant who now teaches
at UC Berkeley, said Simon's attempt to meld the two distinct views of
government stems from his life in both small-government Republican
circles and the business world, which sees the need for greater
investment to spur growth.</TE>
<TE>   "He's clearly trying to do something different, and we have to give
him credit for that," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cain added: "There probably, on balance, is far less of an
explicit vision of his ideas than you would expect from the 'candidate of
ideas.' "</TE>
<TE>   Simon has called his proposals "traditional Republican" ideas, and
observers generally agree.</TE>
<TE>   "His program," Wittman said, "has pretty much been cribbed from the
language of conservative thoughts you would get out of a bunch of
propeller heads in Washington."</TE>
<TE>   In California, where Republicans have been pummeled in recent
statewide elections, Democrats have pounced on that lineage.</TE>
<TE>   On primary night, Davis called Simon "a true-blue think tank
conservative"--a reference to the GOP nominee's tenure on the board of
the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. South, the governor's
chief strategist, argued in an interview that Californians will not back
the financier's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "I see ideas 100 years old--let's go back to laissez faire and let the
private market handle everything," South said. "He wants to privatize
schools and infrastructure and transportation. Do you think that's going
to sell in California?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon's strategists contend it will. Flint summed up Simon's approach
as "trust individuals, trust people to solve problems, and I think that's
very consistent with Californians' philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   "What [voters] are going to reject," Flint added, in a reference to
criticism that Davis favors political contributors, "is people who make
decisions based on something other than what's good for this state."</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, Simon boasted that he had assembled 17 policy
groups to propose solutions for California's ills. A disciplined
candidate, Simon would repeatedly refer to his three favorite subjects
rather than hot-button social issues such as abortion, on which he
acknowledged that he disagrees with most Californians.</TE>
<TE>   On the budget, Simon has accused Davis of permitting runaway state
spending and trying to hide it through "fiscal sleight-of-hand." The GOP
candidate has proposed cutting all new state spending, though he has
acknowledged he may reconsider that when he examines the specific new
programs that have been approved.</TE>
<TE>   He also has called for a 15% cut in all state operational spending--a
part of the state budget that funds the bureaucratic support of agencies
such as the state departments of Social Services and Finance. Simon would
cut $1.6 billion more from the Health and Human Services portion of the
budget and $936 million more from higher education funding than Davis
proposed in January, before the state's deficit grew. Simon has not
identified what specific programs in those areas would be trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   In future years, Simon would have to cut even deeper to fulfill two
other goals: the creation of a reserve of 6% of the general fund for
economic downturns and a $1.4-billion cut in homeowners' taxes. He has
not said how he would pay for those undertakings.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Simon wants to cut state capital gains taxes, a traditional
conservative proposal that several economists say would decrease the
amount of money available to the state, though Simon and other analysts
argue that it ultimately would increase state funds by stimulating the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also proposes repealing several laws signed by Davis, including
ones restricting development and requiring that more employers provide
overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours per week.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Rueben, an economist at the Public Policy Institute of California,
praised some of Simon's ideas, such as his proposal for the state budget
reserve. "They are thinking about things and issuing numbers that go
beyond what I think you see from most campaigns," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rueben said, it is difficult to evaluate the entire package.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know what precisely he's doing because there isn't
enough detail," she said. "It might be possible he can do this, but until
specific programs are laid out it'll be hard to determine how viable it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also has been vague with respect to how he would address
problems with education in California. Saying he is sick of politicians
making promises on education and failing to deliver, Simon presented his
own list of "10 commitments" during the campaign, but did not say how he
would fulfill them.</TE>
<TE>   The promises are ambitious--child care at all schools, for instance,
and a commitment to teaching every child to read by the third grade.
Simon calls for greater involvement by charter schools and less reliance
on bond initiatives to fund school construction.</TE>
<TE>   To cut down on the debt the state issues to fund construction, Simon
has proposed that the state create incentives to get the private sector
more involved in building schools. Failing schools, he said, may be
turned over to private, for-profit corporations such as Edison, which
runs a high school in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But other than a few general speeches during the primary and a
suggestion of using more general fund money to pay for kindergarten
through 12th-grade education, Simon has not issued detailed plans on how
he would involve the private sector in construction or school operations,
rely less on state bonds or improve student performance.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School
Business Officials, said the amount of school construction needed in
California reaches $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "A problem that exceeds $40 billion in magnitude is not going to be
solved through the goodness of the heart of private enterprise," said
Gordon, who dismissed many of Simon's proposals as "Mom and apple pie
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has argued that money for child care is spread among different
state agencies and can be combined to fund an expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley, said that may be
so, but that the available money--most of which is dedicated to
preschoolers rather than school-age children--will fall far short of
Simon's goals.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a monumental undertaking for the state," said Fuller,
putting the price tag of child care for students ages 6 through 12 at
about $2 billion--more than the cost of Simon's proposed property tax
cut.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's policy director, Jesse Huff, said child-care expansion may
have to happen slowly because of its cost.</TE>
<TE>   On infrastructure, Simon has spent perhaps the most time talking about
energy, relentlessly criticizing Davis' handling of the state's
electricity crisis and blaming the governor for negotiating long-term
contracts that cost $43 billion. "He didn't exercise financial
professionalism," Simon said of the governor during a speech in Costa
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon himself has yet to issue an energy proposal. He said he
favors a more deregulated energy market in which utilities and power
generators can freely trade electricity, is averse to price caps and that
the state needs to explore alternate ways of providing electricity, such
as wind power. Other than that, he has provided no details or proposals
and spent most of his time attacking Davis and demanding that he
renegotiate the long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   There are more details in two other areas--water and roads.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has proposed building additional reservoirs by allowing private
companies to construct them and earn back the money over the years
through water rates or other methods. But he said the method of repayment
would vary from location to location, and has declined to say how
independent projects would be built.</TE>
<TE>Highway Construction Plans Remain Vague</TE>
<TE>   Simon has followed a similar approach on transportation. He criticizes
Davis for a vow last year to build no new freeways, saying the private
sector can build desperately needed roads. But other than a fourth lane
in Contra Costa County's Caldecott tunnel to be funded through tolls,
Simon has not said what roads should be built or how companies would be
compensated. Nor has he said which of the various models for private road
construction he would select.</TE>
<TE>   Flint, Simon's spokesman, said private companies will set some of
those priorities by proposing expansions in places they believe they can
make money. "Part of that is not only attracting the capital but putting
some of the risk on the private sector," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation consultant Tom Rubin called Simon's road proposals
"good ideas."</TE>
<TE>   "Now let's see some more detail," he said. But then he reconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, let's face it--if he puts out more detail now, he makes
himself vulnerable to attack," Rubin said. "Politically, it's very
dangerous to put out more detail at this point. They [politicians] put
out glittering generalities."</TE>

<HD>Powell Starts High-Stakes Mideast Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell left on a high-stakes mission to
the Middle East late Sunday after firmly pressing Israel both publicly
and in a call to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to withdraw "now" from
Palestinian-governed cities.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon "understands clearly," and President Bush's call for a pullout
"will not be ignored," Powell predicted.</LD>
<LD>   "I know that [Sharon] is trying to move the operation forward as
quickly as possible. And we'll see what happens in the next couple days,"
Powell said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</LD>
<TE>   Under mounting pressure from the Arab world, Powell said that "if
circumstances permit," he would meet with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat. Powell once again called on Arafat to stop stalling and
demand an end to suicide attacks that have killed scores of Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But in blunt language that reflects why the Bush administration is
getting more deeply involved in the continuing crisis, Powell warned that
Israel's incursion into the West Bank to root out extremists could
backfire, increasing the risks to both Israel and the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We may well be radicalizing a new generation, many more terrorists
waiting to act once this incursion is over," he said on "Fox News
Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Even after Israel withdraws, Powell added, the Jewish state will face
the same pressures, frustration and anger from the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "And perhaps it'll be even greater and will give rise to this kind of
activity again--unless the Palestinians see hope, unless the Palestinians
see Israel, the United States, the Palestinian leaders, the Arab leaders,
the international community all coming together to support a cease-fire
which rapidly leads to negotiations that will create a political
solution," he said on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The obstacles to Powell's mission, including turbulent protests in the
Middle East and the wider Muslim world, make it the riskiest diplomatic
venture the secretary has undertaken, according to Arab diplomats and
U.S. analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction to Israeli reoccupation of every West Bank city except
Jericho in the last 10 days has engulfed the entire region.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had 220 demonstrations all over the country over the last five
days. This is no longer an Arab-Israeli problem," Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Muasher said in an interview Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers were underscored Sunday along Israel's border with
Lebanon, where guerrillas from the Syrian-backed Islamic militant
movement Hezbollah traded fire with Israeli forces.</TE>
<TE>   Powell tried to lower the expectations of what he can achieve in a
week. "If we have brought the violence down, if we have started to create
a dialogue again between the two sides, then my trip will have been worth
the energy that I'm going to put into it and the effort we're going to
put into it," he said on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   As the uproar grows, the United States is stepping up pressure on
Sharon to withdraw his troops and tanks. National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice said Bush used the word "now" several times during a
telephone conversation with Sharon on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The clear message to the Israelis is that we understand that a
military mobilization of this kind, an operation of this size, cannot be
undone in moments, but the important point is to begin now, without
delay. Not tomorrow, not when Secretary Powell gets to the region, but
now, to reverse the situation, because there's a lot at stake here," Rice
said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Sunday that Washington does not have a timetable, in part
because the United States does not "give orders" to a democratically
elected leader of a sovereign nation.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Sharon tried to
convince Bush on Saturday that Israel is in the middle of an operation
that "might save life and maybe might save the peace process in the long
run" and that it should continue.</TE>
<TE>   Israel expects the United States to understand the Jewish state's
basic needs, Ben-Eliezer said on ABC's "This Week."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli diplomat in Washington said Sunday that Israel is likely to
comply by week's end, when Powell is scheduled to arrive in the nation.
"The expectation is that by the time Powell gets there, the operation
will be winding down--and maybe more," said the diplomat, who asked not
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is also pressing Arafat in preparation for Powell's
visit. On Sunday, Powell warned that he cannot win Israel's consent to
focus on a political solution unless the Palestinians halt suicide
bombings and other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the violence goes down hopefully to zero, but at least to a
level where you can see that both sides are acting in a responsible way
and trying to cooperate in a cease-fire, you're not going to get to a
peace agreement," Powell said on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Washington had hoped to be able to squeeze Arafat into long-delayed
action by holding out on a meeting with Powell and suggesting that the
United States is looking for alternative Palestinian leadership. But
shifting regional dynamics have made that a difficult ploy.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of talking to anyone but Arafat is a nonstarter," said
Muasher, the Jordanian foreign minister. "No one in his right mind will
step up from the Palestinians if Powell does not see Arafat. Arafat has
become a hero."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on "This Week," Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said
flatly that Powell's mission will fail if he does not talk to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the role of the U.S.--just to meet with Sharon? What about
the other side? Arafat is the elected chairman of the Palestinians. It is
not up to any power . . . to deny the Palestinians or to deny Arafat this
responsibility bestowed on him by his people," Moussa said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's first stop is Morocco, where he will hold talks with King
Mohammed VI in Agadir and then with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah in
Casablanca. He flies to Egypt on Tuesday to meet President Hosni Mubarak.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will visit Spain on Wednesday and Thursday for talks with his
counterparts in the European Union, with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and, in preparation for Bush's visit to Russia next month, with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. Then he will return to the
Mideast, first to Jordan and then to Israel.</TE>

<HD>The Shoes Fit, but Feet Grow Rare</HD>
<DH>China: Company caters to dwindling numbers of elderly women whose
feet were bound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARBIN, China
</DL>
<LD>Death has already claimed many of the Zhiqiang Shoe Factory's loyal
customers. With more likely to succumb in the next decade or two, the
company has had to think creatively to stay in business.</LD>
<LD>   But as long as there are clients who need them, the factory plans to
manufacture the products for which it is known: the tiny shoes worn by
women whose feet were bound as young girls.</LD>
<LD>   Across China, the number of such women is diminishing by the year.
Most are in their 80s and 90s, their very bodies serving as reminders of
a bygone era in the world's most populous nation.</LD>
<TE>   For centuries such women were toasted as the epitome of feminine
beauty and allure. Then they were scorned as the embodiment of backward,
feudal thinking. Now they're the object of study by sociologists,
physicians and historians.</TE>
<TE>   But to Du Guanghua, such women are flesh and bone, however disfigured.
They still need to get around, and she is determined to keep them
well-shod.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't make much money from it," said Du, the boss at Zhiqiang.
"We're doing this now more as a contribution to society."</TE>
<TE>   Her company is among the last in China to manufacture such shoes. Most
other cobblers, seeing only dwindling returns in a dying market, either
scrapped that part of their business long ago or switched to selling the
slippers as daintily embroidered souvenirs rather than as footwear.</TE>
<TE>   The Zhiqiang factory has watched demand plummet for "little shoes," as
the Chinese call them, by nearly two-thirds in 10 years. It now clears a
mere 700 pairs a year, most of them destined for customers here in
northeastern China, but some for women elsewhere. "People from other
provinces come to put in orders because they know of this factory," Du
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tianjin, southeast of Beijing, a shoemaker that has been around for
nearly a century sells about 20,000 pairs annually but also has suffered
a steep drop in business.</TE>
<TE>   The market almost certainly will vanish within the next two decades,
and the deaths of the women who wore such miniature slippers will close a
chapter of social history that lasted a thousand years and still
fascinates people.</TE>
<TE>   Books have been written about the phenomenon, which involved wrapping
young girls' feet to restrict their growth. A Columbia University
professor devotes a class to the subject. A few years ago, the discovery
of a village in Yunnan province with 300 elderly women with bound feet
made headlines, especially after they were found to enjoy disco dancing
and playing croquet.</TE>
<TE>   But foot-binding is a topic that many Chinese approach with reluctance
and embarrassment, preferring to forget what seems a shameful legacy of
their imperial past.</TE>
<TE>   The government is highly sensitive to anything that might tarnish
China's image as a modern country, and women with bound feet seem too apt
a metaphor for the encrusted ideals and practices that crippled this
society in the early 20th century and impeded progress.</TE>
<TE>   It took American academic Pam Cooper several years to overcome the
suspicion of her contacts in China when she tried to track down women
with bound feet for interviews during the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it would be somewhat of a struggle," said Cooper, who teaches
at Northwestern University. "I was surprised that even my friends at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong were reluctant to talk about it or put me
in touch with people."</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing attitude, Cooper said, was "it's past; move ahead; just
forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   Once she found the women, however, they were eager to share stories
that even their own children and grandchildren had never heard--stories
of the pain involved in foot-binding, but also of pride in the beauty
they felt they achieved.</TE>
<TE>   It was a beauty, of course, defined by men. "It's the same in every
culture," Cooper said. "There's a standard of beauty, and whoever's in
power gets to determine that. And generally it's men in power."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly when foot-binding began in China remains shrouded in mystery.
The custom existed at least as early as the 10th century. One story tells
of an emperor enchanted by a concubine with small feet who danced atop a
lotus-shaped platform, which set off the foot-binding craze and gave such
feet the nickname of "golden lotuses."</TE>
<TE>   Other sources say that "golden lotuses" refer to the shape of the feet
themselves, a curled-up form achieved only after years of binding with
strips of cloth wound tight enough to break the bones, bend the foot and
stunt growth.</TE>
<TE>   Binding began for girls as young as 5 or 6, a tradition passed from
mother to daughter. The bandages would fold down the four small toes
toward the sole of the foot and force the heel inward, exaggerating the
arch. The process was excruciating. Flesh would rot. Girls wept in agony,
sometimes unable to eat or drink or think because of the pain.</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when their only value was as a marriageable asset, the
girls had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it was painful," said Wang Yixian, 78, casting back to her
girlhood in Shandong province. "If you didn't bind your feet, you
couldn't find a husband."</TE>
<TE>   Many Chinese men found the feet highly erotic, in part because women's
feet were never exposed and were considered the most private part of
their anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   A successfully bound foot was, astonishingly, just 3 to 4 inches long.
Walking was difficult; women swayed from side to side, which in flowing
robes also evoked the image of lotuses in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers during the last Chinese dynasty, the Qing, tried more than
once to ban the practice but failed. Only after the Communists swept into
power in 1949 was foot-binding abolished.</TE>
<TE>   Women who had their feet bound for most of their lives were told to
stop as well, though their feet remained deformed. What they once were
told was beautiful had become ridiculed as repulsive. Women who had
endured pain to match male ideals of beauty were suddenly objects of
derision--again by men. In either case, the women were powerless.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a child and had no control when my feet were bound, and I had
no control when I was told to unbind them," Cooper's interview subjects
told her angrily.</TE>
<TE>   The outlawed practice apparently had lasting health effects on women
whose feet had once been bound. A 1997 study in the American Journal of
Public Health showed that they were more likely to fall and were at
greater risk for hip and spine fractures.</TE>
<TE>   Although the custom seems cruel and barbaric to modern sensibilities,
scholars note that in the West, some women buy shoes too small in order
to appear more attractive and subject themselves to wearing high heels.
And in some versions of the fairy tale of Cinderella, the ugly
stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit the glass slipper.</TE>
<TE>   In China, finding shoes that fit has become more difficult for the
women whose feet were bound. "The great majority of these women are
probably still making these shoes for themselves or wearing children's
shoes," said Du, the head of the Zhiqiang Shoe Factory here in Harbin.</TE>
<TE>   Zhiqiang's "little shoes" are not of the tiniest variety, the ones
designed for women whose feet are barely 4 inches in length. The
company's smallest slippers, about 7 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide,
can still fit in a man's hand.</TE>
<TE>   The company employs one worker who makes each pair individually,
stitching plain black cloth to rubber soles for a soft but sturdy shoe
reminiscent of the Mary Janes worn by American girls.</TE>
<TE>   There is no ornate embroidery or anything colorful, partly because the
women have no desire to call attention to something that for most Chinese
bespeaks a shameful, primitive past.</TE>
<TE>   "Now everybody has big feet," said Wang, who moved from Shandong to
Harbin more than 50 years ago. "Only old people have small feet."</TE>
<TE>   Wang owns eight pairs of shoes put out by Zhiqiang--four for summer
wear and four wool-lined ones for winter. Her children buy them when they
can, to build up a reserve for Wang in case production one day ceases.</TE>
<TE>   Zhiqiang long ago stopped relying on the small slippers to keep it in
business. Revenue from the sale of little shoes is minuscule. At the
department store down the street, the slippers sell for about $3 a pair;
the factory's profit is a fraction of that.</TE>
<TE>   The company, a collective enterprise with about 20 employees, has
since branched out into producing regular-sized shoes for men and women.</TE>
<TE>   How much longer does Du expect to go on making shoes for women whose
feet were bound?</TE>
<TE>   "At most 10 years," she said, then added: "And that's being generous."</TE>

<HD>Limited Arctic Drilling Won't Harm Caribou, Scientists Say</HD>

<LD>Setting the stage for a contentious debate on oil drilling in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, government scientists have concluded
that oil wells limited to the northwest corner of the refuge would do
little or no harm to the thousands of caribou who bear their young on the
coastal plain.</LD>
<LD>   In a follow-up of an earlier report, the U.S. Geological Survey
concluded that predictions that oil drilling would impair caribou
reproduction and survival do not hold true if the eastern half of the
Arctic coastal plain is left untouched, a plan now under consideration by
some drilling proponents.</LD>
<LD>   "The impact was minimal on the Porcupine caribou herd," Interior
Department spokesman Eric Ruff said of the new two-page report, prepared
by USGS biologists and scheduled for release this week.</LD>
<TE>   The biologists were ordered to take another look at the issue after
their earlier assessment of wildlife impacts considered a wider range of
drilling scenarios that left its findings open to debate.</TE>
<TE>   The new report could influence the oil-drilling debate, as the Senate
prepares to resume debate this week on energy legislation. For the first
time, drilling proponents come to the hearings armed with scientific
cover for tapping the portion of the refuge thought most likely to
contain readily accessible oil.</TE>
<TE>   Critics dismissed the revised findings, however, saying they do not
provide a realistic assessment because they look only at what happens if
caribou are prevented from calving in the northwest quadrant. They do not
examine whether that area might be important to caribou in other ways,
said Ken Whitten, a caribou biologist who contributed to the original
report.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be pretty confident that there would be impacts, but we don't
have a model yet to measure them," Whitten said.</TE>
<TE>   The 123,000 caribou are the most visible of the thousands of
wildlife--birds, grizzly bears, polar bears, musk oxen and others--that
inhabit the narrow, 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic refuge,
America's largest wildlife reserve and its most northern.</TE>
<TE>   The annual migration of the herd--named after the Porcupine
River--from the mountains of Canada to the Arctic coast is North
America's last great mammal migration, and the spring and summer weeks
spent along the coast, relatively free of insects and predators, is
thought to be crucial to survival of the herd.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials estimate there are 5.7 billion to 16 billion barrels
of oil underneath the coastal plain, and the original USGS report looked
at how wildlife would be affected under a range of five development
scenarios for extracting that oil.</TE>
<TE>   The original findings, unveiled March 29, ranged from little to no
effect on wildlife, if oil drilling is limited to the western edge of the
refuge, to a decrease of as much as 8.2% in caribou calf survival, if
there is massive development of the plain. Though that number seems
small, biologists say it could be potentially crippling to the herd's
viability.</TE>
<TE>   After its release, USGS Director Charles G. Groat asked the authors to
go back to the table and evaluate additional scenarios. Over the last
week, they looked at what would happen if oil wells were limited to the
area that the USGS believes is most likely to contain exploitable oil
reserves, in the northwest quadrant.</TE>
<TE>   The House, in its version of the energy bill, limited oil development
at ANWR to 2,000 acres, presumably in the geologically accessible lands
of the northwest.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also looked at development in lands controlled by Native
Alaskans who have a share in oil reserves within the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   USGC biologist Brad Griffith, who authored the original caribou
report, said in this latest study that the USGS computer model, which
looks at what would happen if calving caribou were displaced by oil
development in the northwest quadrant, found changes in calf survival
rates ranging from a 1.4% improvement to a 2.9% decline, with an average
of a 0.7% decline--essentially negligible.</TE>
<TE>   "Any displacement that's less than 10 kilometers total in the model as
an average resulted in little or no change in the June calf survival,"
said an Interior official familiar with the report.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Whitten said, is that applying the computer model to the
northwest quadrant is unrealistic, because very few caribou use the
quadrant for calving. On the other hand, about 30% of the herd uses that
area after calving, an indication that it may provide valuable forage or
insect protection that is vital but cannot be measured simply by looking
at calf distribution, Whitten said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have ready-made models to estimate [impacts in this area]
like we do on [the rest of] the coastal plain," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gamers' Perks, or 'Playola'?</HD>
<DH>Video game press junkets include the Four Seasons in Tokyo, target
practice, Disney World. Journalists say they aren't swayed, but critics
raise their brows.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Ham has strapped himself into the back seat of a barrel-rolling
fighter jet. He has duked it out in a Las Vegas boxing ring. He has
tumbled thousands of feet in free fall from a plane. He has spent the
night in a creepy medieval castle in England. And he has attended the
premiere of "Ocean's 11" with its stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.</LD>
<LD>   Ham lives a life any 10-year-old boy would love. When he's not flying
first class, riding around in limos or attending the Super Bowl, the
34-year-old spends eight hours a day--five days a week--playing video
games sent free to his Reston, Va., home.</LD>
<LD>   As one of several dozen opinion makers in the $20-billion global games
industry, Ham is showered with gifts and travel by publishers and
developers eager for him to bless their latest shooter, racer or dungeon
crawler.</LD>
<TE>   "There are times when I'd be on a trip Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
Then I'd go home on Friday in time to drop off and pick up my cleaning
and be off again," said Ham, who's racked up more than 100,000 miles each
of the last three years in frequent flier miles on video game junkets.
Called "playola" by some in the industry, the exotic trips and
over-the-top outings are used by video game companies to drum up buzz for
their titles. Once relegated to obscure fan magazines, the reach and
influence of game reviewers have spread to mainstream magazines and
newspapers as revenues from the video game industry eclipse movie box
office receipts.</TE>
<TE>   So it's little surprise that video game junkets now rival the lavish,
flashy soirees sponsored by the movie and music industries.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's no evidence that the junkets generate more positive
reviews, they do produce more publicity for some middle-of-the-road games
that might otherwise draw little attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the nature of marketing," said Glenn Rubenstein, a longtime game
journalist from Petaluma, Calif. "It creates vast awareness and sometimes
gives some games a false sense of priority."</TE>
<TE>   Games differ from other entertainment media in that they are
interactive. Players control the action, and they are demanding
ever-higher levels of realism. Since few have ever raced a stock car or
piloted a jet or called plays for the NFL, sponsored adventures give
reviewers such as Ham unique firsthand experience. A reviewer can better
appreciate the physics of, say, an aerial combat game if he loses his
lunch in an F-14--or so goes the rationale.</TE>
<TE>   For some game journalists, the trips are mainly a means of getting a
job done. They're often the only ways to grab interviews and get their
hands on games still in development. But critics call them a blatant
attempt to buy favorable coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "These are young journalists writing for young readers," said Keith
Woods, who teaches journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute in St.
Petersburg, Fla. "The question is whether there's a way for them to get
the information they need without having to jump out of airplanes or
spend the night in a castle."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of game reviewers are men in their 20s and 30s. Many
started writing when they were teenagers drawn to the business as
star-struck fans. Although most eventually learn to shrug off the special
treatment, some can't handle the responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "You see young guys coming in, getting sucked into the parties,"
Rubenstein said. "There's an addictive quality to these things. They
begin to think, 'Hey, I can do this all the time!' And they forget to
cover the games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen lots of people burn out. I remember being this 17-year-old
kid, being flown around and taken to fancy dinners, hanging out with
older kids. Imagine doing that and having to go home so you can study for
a test at school the next day. It was nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has celebrities to draw journalists and technology companies
have expensive gadgets, but game companies often rely on extracurricular
activities to lure writers. And over the years, the events have become
increasingly elaborate. But they didn't start that way.</TE>
<TE>   The video game junket arguably dates back more than 10 years, when fan
magazine writers had little access to information on upcoming titles.
Sega Corp. decided to change that. It held a daylong conference in San
Francisco to inundate journalists with details on the company's upcoming
titles. The access gave Sega a lot of ink.</TE>
<TE>   "Until then, Japanese game companies had a reputation for being
horrible with the press," said Rubenstein, who attended the Sega event as
a 14-year-old freelancer and is now 26. "Sega struck the first blow.
There was no polish. They just got everyone into a hotel conference room
for eight hours while product managers showed us games. It was like an
insurance seminar."</TE>
<TE>   But it worked. Reviewers returned from the meeting and wrote up every
game they saw.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing years, Sega flew the press to Disney World, hosted
hundreds of journalists in Alcatraz and footed the bill for rides on an
F-14 combat jet.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies followed the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Codemasters, a British game developer, took journalists to
a gym in Las Vegas to tout its "Mike Tyson Boxing" game. The company paid
a professional boxing trainer to give them a few lessons, and then let
them box while two bikini-clad "ring girls" looked on. One writer got a
bloody nose and another a dislocated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Take Two Interactive hosted an event in the Arizona desert to promote
its new combat driving games. Writers, dressed in camouflage, practiced
drive-by shootings with 9-millimeter Glock handguns while driving Jeeps
at high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   For "Syphon Filter 2," published by 989 Studios, the writers were
given SWAT team training in Tucson and supplied with facemasks, goggles,
paint guns and maps. After the training, they played out a mock rescue
operation that left some bruised and bloodied.</TE>
<TE>   A game set in a dungeon was previewed to the press in a 12th-century
English castle complete with jousting knights and bows and arrows as
parting gifts. A jet skiing game was promoted at a Dana Point resort,
where writers spent the day getting massages and soaking up the sun on
actual jet skis. A horror action game was unveiled at a haunted house in
the Santa Cruz mountains, where the evening's entertainment was a Blair
Witch-style treasure hunt.</TE>
<TE>   When such trips are strung together back-to-back, life on the junket
circuit can be grueling.</TE>
<TE>   "I was home for all of four days in July and August last year," said
Todd Mowatt, a veteran freelance game reviewer from Toronto. "It was
nuts."</TE>
<TE>   But swanky accommodations and other perks can ease the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Junket writers have stayed at the Mondrian Hotel, the Standard and the
St. Regis in Los Angeles, the Hudson Hotel in New York, W Hotel in San
Francisco, the Four Seasons in Tokyo. Limousines courier them from place
to place.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a personal butler once come press my clothes and shine my
shoes," Ham said.</TE>
<TE>   For the companies, it's worth the expense--anywhere from $20,000 to
$100,000. They compare the tab with the often higher cost of advertising
in magazines or on television. The events also bring dozens of writers to
one place, obviating the need for companies to go on long road shows to
promote their games or fly journalists to development studios that may be
scattered throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us valuable one-on-one time with the media," said Marci
Ditter, director of public relations and promotions for Midway, a game
publisher based in Chicago. In July, Midway brought 25
journalists--paying the way for most of them--to Amberley Castle in West
Sussex, England, to promote "Legion: The Legend of Excalibur," a game set
for release this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Midway and other companies insist they don't expect quid pro quo in
terms of coverage. Most say they simply hope to establish good relations
with the game journalists while giving them relevant information.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalists aren't obligated to cover the games at all," Ditter said.
"We see this as building brand awareness."</TE>
<TE>   Ethicists disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the idea behind any junket is to curry favor with the
reviewer," said Woods of the Poynter Institute. "The more substantial the
entertainment, the clearer the intent of the host."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the potential conflict of interest, most game publications,
including Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer and Official PlayStation
Magazine and some online sites such as GameSpot and GameSpy have policies
against taking free trips and accepting gifts worth more than $25 to
$100. "We have to pick up the tab pretty much everywhere we go," said
Amer Ajami, senior editor at GameSpot, a San Francisco-based online game
news site owned by CNet Networks.</TE>
<TE>   The policies, however, are unevenly enforced, according to several
junket organizers. Often, the rules don't apply to freelancers, who work
independently and sell their articles to a variety of publications.</TE>
<TE>   But freelancer or not, no writer will admit to being swayed by the
extravaganzas.</TE>
<TE>   "You can wine and dine me all you want, but if your game [stinks], I
have no qualms saying the game is awful," said Ham, who freelances for
publications including the Washington Post, USA Today and GameSpy. In his
review of "Time Crisis II," Ham wrote that the game's story line was "a
bit thin." That was after he was brought to a Las Vegas target range for
practice with an Uzi submachine gun.</TE>
<TE>   Ham's editor at the Post, Rob Pegoraro, said the paper cannot dictate
how its freelancers spend their time. But it does have a policy against
free trips for both staff writers and freelancers working on behalf of
the newspaper. Pegoraro said he was not aware of some of the junkets Ham
attended and would have advised against them had he known.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom's reviews can stand on their own," Pegoraro said. "On the other
hand, he--like every writer, freelance or staff--needs to think about how
his actions might look to his readers."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, USA Today and Gannett News Service
also have printed the work of freelancers who have accepted junkets.
These publications, too, have policies that forbid all writers from
accepting free trips and accommodations. When staff writers do attend,
their employers pay the tab.</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves a raft of writers from "fanzines" who may work
without limits. And impressing them gets harder all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Game journalists are so jaded," said George Ngo, a former game writer
who is now a public relations manager for Tecmo Ltd., a Japanese game
publisher. "You really have to pull something out of a hat to make it
memorable. So each year, it gets bigger, brighter, glitzier and louder."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A rocket exploded just yards from a camp housing international
peacekeepers Sunday, the first such attack since security forces began
patrolling the Afghan capital last year.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody was hurt in the rocket attack on the Kabul camp of German and
Danish troops, which occurred about 2:30 a.m., said Flight Lt. Tony
Marshall, a spokesman for the British-led International Security
Assistance Force.</LD>
<LD>   A 107-mm rocket flew over the peacekeeping compound and exploded to
the northwest, Marshall said. Another rocket also was seen flying over
the compound and an explosion was heard, but peacekeepers had not located
the detonation site, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The attack probably was linked to efforts to destabilize the interim
Afghan administration ahead of the loya jirga, a grand council meeting in
June to select a new government, Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan authorities last week arrested at least 160 people on suspicion
of plotting against the government.</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Roots May Be at the Bottom of Hoteliers' Woes</HD>
<DH>Turkey: Sudden opposition surprises Armenian American and his wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>VAN, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>Nestled beneath snowcapped mountains along the border with Iran,
this area wrapped around a vast lake and brimming with archeological
treasures is among Turkey's best-kept secrets. So why not open a hotel
here for adventurous travelers, tour operator Victor Bedoian from Arizona
wondered during a visit in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   After several years of meticulous planning and plenty of encouragement
from the Turkish government, Bedoian did just that in March 2001. Two
months later, police in Van told Bedoian and his wife, Kristy, that the
couple could not operate the hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "There's only one reason," said Bedoian during a recent interview
here. "It's because I'm an ethnic Armenian."</LD>
<TE>   He's probably right. Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians remain
bitterly divided, much of the anger traced back to the slaughter of
hundreds of thousands of Armenians in eastern Turkey around the time of
World War I. Turkey denies charges of genocide and says many of the dead
fell victim to starvation and exposure while fleeing wartime fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring nation of Armenia's refusal to recognize its existing
borders with Turkey also feeds the anger, as does Armenia's occupation of
territory claimed by this nation's closest regional ally, Azerbaijan.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Van, where some of history's bloodier clashes between Turks
and ethnic Armenians took place, some residents still fear that Armenians
who fled will one day return to reclaim their lost property.</TE>
<TE>   The local branch of the Nationalist Action Party is at the forefront
of a campaign to portray Bedoian as an Armenian agent whose "sinister
agenda," according to local party boss Coskun Tatar, is to sow the seeds
of "a greater Armenia" in Van by buying property in Van province.</TE>
<TE>   Media reports have accused Kristy Bedoian of links with ethnic Kurdish
rebels who long fought Turkish troops in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not against foreign investment; that would be really stupid,"
said Feyat Erdemir, a spokesman for the ultranationalist party. "But this
man has different intentions, he is a mischief-maker."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, when Victor Bedoian first approached Turkish officials in 1999
about the possibility of investing here--together with 10 American
partners, none of them ethnic Armenians--"they promised us the moon," he
said. Operating licenses, work permits, all were swiftly issued amid
smiles and piping hot glasses of tea.</TE>
<TE>   "Having an Armenian freely operating here would have been a great
propaganda tool for Turkey," noted Kaan Soyak, co-chairman of the
Turkish-Armenian Business Development Council, which is seeking to
promote trade and cultural exchanges between the two ethnic groups. "They
blew it."</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, the couple opened a carpet showroom in Van to "test the
waters" and made national television headlines as the first foreigners to
invest in the largely Kurdish-populated region. "People were really
thrilled to have Americans here, they knew we would help the local
economy," said Kristy Bedoian, 49.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband said it was only after he bought the hotel, paying
$700,000, that his troubles began.</TE>
<TE>   Police began to visit the premises repeatedly, demanding to see the
couple's papers and grilling Victor Bedoian about his ancestry. Employees
were threatened and asked why they were "working for those Armenians."
Pressures escalated last May when Bedoian was informed that his residency
application had been rejected and he was no longer authorized to do
business in Turkey. As a result, all of his other permits were rendered
invalid.</TE>
<TE>   The couple could get no further explanation from officials. Rumors
were rife in Van that the provincial governor was opposed to their
presence because of Bedoian's Armenian roots. Fearing official reprisal,
friends began to stay away from the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, police entered the hotel and kicked out a group of foreign
tourists who were trying to check in. In November, while the Bedoians
were in the United States, police evicted employees and sealed the
hotel's doors.</TE>
<TE>   When pressed for an explanation, Gov. Durmus Koc declined to comment.
A senior Turkish official who requested anonymity said the Bedoians' case
did not "reflect Turkey's national policy" and was a "local problem."</TE>
<TE>   During an official visit to Turkey in December, Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell pressed national leaders to resolve the issue. A senior
U.S. official familiar with the case terms the treatment of the Bedoians
"outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   "All it does is scare away foreign investors and tarnish Turkey's
reputation, which admittedly isn't that great anyway," said the official,
who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   However, further prodding from the Bush administration has yielded no
results, and U.S. officials say there is little else they can do.</TE>
<TE>   Bedoian disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "If America wanted to fix this problem, it could do so right now,"
said Bedoian, 48. "We are facing systematic persecution by the Turkish
state, and the American government, our local senators and
representatives have all abandoned us."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, many Turkish and U.S. officials argue that the hotel's
name--Vartan, the Armenian word for victory--lies at the root of
Bedoian's woes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like waving a red rag at a bull," said Haydar Celik, the hotel's
26-year-old Turkish manager. "Local sensitivities have been inflamed."</TE>
<TE>   Bedoian said he named the hotel after his only son and had no
political agenda. "That stuff happened nearly a hundred years ago," he
said of the widespread Armenian deaths. "It's time to move on, the
accusations are insane."</TE>
<TE>   Born in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York, Bedoian is a
second-generation American. His grandmother was spirited out of central
Turkey during the wartime violence by Turkish neighbors after her family
"disappeared," as he puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Bedoian hardly fits the stereotype of the revenge-seeking nationalist.
Describing himself as "an ex-bum until I discovered Christianity," he
defied family pressure to marry "a nice Armenian girl" and instead chose
Kristy, a Scottish American from Alaska. They opened a travel agency in
Wickenburg, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   When the couple first decided to set up a business here they had no
inkling of the troubles that lay ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It made perfect sense at the time," Victor Bedoian recalled. "It was
a ground-level opportunity to bring in American tourists for cultural
tours."</TE>
<TE>   Bedoian has launched four lawsuits against the governor and government
agencies over what the couple says is the illegal revocation of the
hotel's licenses and denial of his residency. Hearing dates have not been
set for the cases. The couple has vowed to keep returning on tourist
visas until justice is done.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that Armenians back home kept calling us traitors,
warning us that it would all go horribly wrong," said Kristy Bedoian.
"Sadly, they proved to be right in the end."</TE>

<HD>Colombians Fear a New Front</HD>
<DH>South America: Pair of bombs kills 12 people, amid concern urban
areas are now targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH MORRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Two bombs ripped through a strip of nightclubs and restaurants in a
provincial Colombian capital early Sunday, killing at least 12 people and
fueling fears of stepped-up terrorist attacks in urban centers.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the first bomb exploded at 1:08 a.m. in a parking lot in
the most popular entertainment district of Villavicencio, 45 miles
southeast of Bogota, the national capital. Minutes later and just yards
away, a car packed with 150 pounds of dynamite blew up, dismembering many
of the victims. Authorities said more than 70 people were being treated
in nearby hospitals and that several were in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   None of Colombia's armed groups claimed responsibility for the attack,
but military and police chiefs quickly singled out the Marxist-inspired
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as the likely culprit.
The 17,000-strong guerrilla group has carried out a sabotage campaign
since February in retaliation for President Andres Pastrana's decision to
end peace talks and send government troops into a southern rebel haven.</LD>
<TE>   "The way this attack was carried out points toward them," said Chief
Prosecutor Luis Camilo Osorio, referring to the FARC, which has waged a
38-year insurgency. "It's a possibility we're not dismissing."</TE>
<TE>   Video images from the scene showed twisted car frames in a street
carpeted by glass shards and rubble. Several building facades collapsed,
and crumpled barroom furniture littered the sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the first blast was meant to draw anguished spectators
closer to the scene so that the second bomb would claim more victims.</TE>
<TE>President Vows to Pursue Bombers</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana traveled with top military advisors to Villavicencio on
Sunday to devise security measures aimed at thwarting further terror
attacks. Speaking to reporters later, the president offered a $45,000
reward for information leading to the capture of the bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to pursue these terrorists wherever they are. They're not
going to find a hiding place anywhere in the world," Pastrana said,
adding that nine teenagers were among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   The attack also kindled fears that Colombia's bloody civil conflict
was spilling into city streets. Until recently, the conflict mostly
consisted of territorial battles fought between the rebels and their
ultra-right paramilitary foes for control of drug crops and gun-running
routes.</TE>
<TE>   But in January, suspected FARC guerrillas detonated a bicycle bomb in
front of a Bogota cafeteria, killing six civilians, including a young
child. And since peace talks collapsed on Feb. 20, the FARC has knocked
out dozens of bridges and electricity pylons, punching holes in the
nation's power grid and isolating several mid-size cities.</TE>
<TE>   A military spokesman said the FARC had recently detonated at least
three car bombs in remote rural areas but that Sunday's attack was far
deadlier. He said FARC fighters have long been stationed around
Villavicencio and often slip into town in civilian clothing "to rest."</TE>
<TE>Urban Attacks Outrage Colombian Public</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts link the wave of urban violence to increased
mobility and improved air surveillance on the part of the Colombian armed
forces. Feeling vulnerable from the air, analysts say, the rebels are
concentrating on hit-and-run attacks that bring their struggle right to
city-dwellers' doorsteps.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the urban attacks have inspired widespread indignation, which
appears to have reshaped Colombia's political landscape. With
presidential elections little more than a month away, hard-line
presidential candidate Alvaro Uribe Velez leads opinion polls by a huge
margin. Uribe promises to crack down on the rebels by expanding the armed
forces and by mounting a million-man civilian security force.</TE>
<TE>   The shift in rebel tactics also comes as Washington contemplates
expanding its role in this war-torn Andean nation. Among other requests,
Pastrana has asked the White House to lift current restrictions so that
U.S.-donated anti-narcotics helicopters can participate in
counterinsurgency missions.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Probing Reports of Three Mass Graves of Taliban Victims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A U.N. team flew to the central Afghan town of Bamian on Sunday to
investigate local reports that three mass graves containing victims of a
Taliban massacre late last year had been uncovered.</LD>
<LD>   Bamian residents said the graves, located near the town's airport,
contained bodies of ethnic Hazaras, who have a long and bloody history
with the Pushtuns who dominated the Taliban. No details were available on
the number of victims found, the precise dates of the killings or the
circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   "Representatives of the Hazara community in Bamian believe that the
graves contain bodies of members of their community killed approximately
one month before the fall of the Taliban," said U.N. spokesman Manoel de
Almeida e Silva.</LD>
<TE>   U.N. officials, who traveled to the area with a representative of
Afghanistan's interim government, said they would prepare a report before
releasing any public statement on their findings.</TE>
<TE>   Bamian province, a stronghold of ethnic Hazaras, has been the site of
several massacres in recent years. But the graves reported to the United
Nations on Friday were previously unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's population is weary of war and longs for peace, but one
of the biggest threats to stability is bitter rivalry among ethnic
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Hazaras, who make up 19% of Afghanistan's population, are Shiite
Muslims, while the majority of Afghans are Sunni. The Taliban frequently
targeted Hazaras in areas such as Bamian province and Mazar-i-Sharif in
the north, but Hazaras also have massacred Pushtuns at various times.</TE>
<TE>   De Almeida e Silva said the bodies at the Bamian site, about 50 miles
northwest of Kabul, the capital, had not been exhumed. Community leaders
were eager to bring the mass graves to international light, he said, but
at the same time were anxious to rebury the victims as quickly as
possible for religious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   One of the U.N. mission's tasks was to discover how long the local
community was willing to delay reburial to permit a fuller investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. has reported that several hundred villagers, along with
hospital staff and representatives of international organizations, were
killed in Yakaolang, in western Bamian province, in January and February
2001. Local Hazara commanders later claimed to have intercepted radio
messages in which Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar personally
authorized the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Men were rounded up and shot outside a relief agency, near a hospital
and behind a mosque, among other sites, according to the U.N. report. A
number of mass graves were found in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Hazaras also were targeted in 1998, when about 50 elderly men who had
surrendered to the Taliban reportedly were slain.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations also has recorded recent cases in which Hazaras and
others have carried out reprisal killings against Pushtuns for their
support of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   In Bargah, in northern Afghanistan, 37 Pushtuns reportedly were slain
by Hazaras in early December. The latest graves in Bamian date from a
similar time, around November or December, according to De Almeida e
Silva.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the worst ethnic killings have taken place in or near
Mazar-i-Sharif, where mass graves have been discovered. In 1997, Hazara
militias massacred Taliban members, and the following year the Taliban
swept back into the city, massacring thousands of Hazaras and Uzbeks.</TE>

<DL>RABAT, Morocco
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in the Islamic
world on Sunday to protest Israel's offensive in the West Bank and
against U.S. support for the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest rally filled the main boulevards of the Moroccan capital,
Rabat. "The five-hour pro-Palestinian march ended in a civilized manner.
. . . First estimates put the number of protesters at at least half a
million," a senior government official said.</LD>
<LD>   "Sharon assassin! Bush his dog!" chanted veiled women and bearded men.
"God is great! . . . We want jihad [holy war]!"</LD>
<TE>   It was the first pro-Palestinian protest allowed by the Moroccan
authorities since October 2000, and took place a few hours before the
arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Political groups that organized the march claimed as many as a million
took part, including political leaders such as Prime Minister
Abderrahmane Youssoufi.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, thousands of people chanting "Death to America! Death to
Israel!" joined a funeral procession for a 24-year-old Bahraini who died
of injuries sustained during a violent pro-Palestinian rally at the U.S.
Embassy on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We call on the government to kick out the American ambassador," Abdul
Amir Jamri, an influential Shiite Muslim cleric, told mourners setting
off from the capital of Manama to the village of the dead man, Mohammed
Jumaa Ahmed.</TE>
<TE>   Women in black wept as youths carrying the coffin chanted: "There is
no God but God! The U.S. is the enemy of God!"</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of demonstrators, many Palestinian, marched throughout
Lebanon. In the center of Beirut, about 3,000 supporters of the militant
group Hamas gathered in front of a United Nations regional headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   A similar demonstration organized by pro-Syrian Lebanese groups took
place in Tripoli.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organization
marched in Tyre, to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Between 3,000 and 5,000 Indonesians, mostly from the Muslim-oriented
Justice Party, gathered near the presidential palace in central Jakarta,
the capital, and burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>

<HD>Pope Urges End to 'Vendettas' in Middle East</HD>

<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, leading world prayers for peace in the Middle
East, urged Palestinians and Israelis on Sunday to free themselves from
the "thirst for vendetta" and return to the negotiating table.</LD>
<LD>   The pope made his appeal as details emerged of a proposal by Vatican
diplomats in the Holy Land to end a standoff at Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity, revered as Jesus' birthplace.</LD>
<LD>   "When all around us the cruel logic of weapons dominates, only God can
lead hearts to thoughts of peace," the frail, 81-year-old pope said from
his window overlooking St. Peter's Square.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of people marched to the square after attending Mass in Rome
churches, where they took up John Paul's call to make Sunday a day of
prayer for peace in the Holy Land in churches around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Only [God] can provide the energy that is so necessary to free
oneself from hate and the thirst for vendetta," the pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian gunmen and civilians took refuge in the Bethlehem church
Tuesday, and about 140 have remained holed up inside, along with dozens
of monks and priests and a few nuns. Israeli troops ring the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican sources said Saturday that Vatican diplomats and church
officials in the Holy Land had put forward a proposal to Israelis and
Palestinians to end the Bethlehem standoff. Under the proposal, the
Palestinians in the basilica would be given safe passage to the Gaza
Strip, leaving their weapons behind.</TE>

<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of demonstrators divided over the Middle East conflict
battled in Paris on Sunday during a march against anti-Semitism,
attacking journalists and stabbing a police officer before authorities
dispersed them with tear gas.</LD>
<LD>   The clash at the historic Place de la Bastille occurred on the
sidelines of a march by 50,000 people protesting a wave of attacks on
Jewish schools, cemeteries and synagogues in France amid escalating
violence in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after the clash, four gasoline bombs were thrown at a synagogue
in La Corneuve, a working-class suburb north of Paris. The outside walls
were blackened, but no injuries or damage were reported. Two other
synagogues in France reported similar weekend attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Violence also was reported at pro-Israeli marches in other French
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Palestinian demonstrations were held throughout Europe on Sunday.
In Belgium, at least 10,000 people marched through the capital, Brussels,
burning American flags near the U.S. Embassy and yelling, "Sharon-Bush:
murderers!" About 5,000 staged a peaceful rally against Israel in
Goteborg, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred pro-Israel militants and up to 500
counter-demonstrators were involved in the fighting in Paris, police
said. About 1,500 police and scores of anti-riot vehicles were deployed.
A police officer was stabbed in the stomach, police said.</TE>

<HD>Journalists Are Kept at Bay by Israeli Bullets</HD>
<DH>Media: Army seeks to prevent coverage of West Bank offensive.
Gunfire apparently is meant as a warning, but some shots have come too
close.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>In his three decades covering wars in the Mideast, television
producer Charles Enderlin has had his run-ins with Israeli soldiers--but
never a nasty rebuff like the one he got last week.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to reach Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
besieged West Bank headquarters, Enderlin and his TV France 2 crew were
turned back at an Israeli checkpoint. Before leaving, they tried to film
the soldiers but were ordered to stop.</LD>
<LD>   "Show me a written order that I cannot film here," the producer
demanded.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead of a paper, you're going to get a bullet in your camera,"
snarled an Israeli reservist, raising his automatic rifle.</TE>
<TE>   After more bickering, the producer turned his back and headed toward
his car.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the reservist's parting shot. A bullet sliced through the
air between Enderlin and his cameraman at chest level.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel wages its biggest military campaign in the West Bank in 35
years, journalists trying to cover it are running up against the ultimate
roadblock--Israeli bullets fired at them, often without warning. Veteran
correspondents and a media watchdog group say the restrictions are the
tightest they have ever seen here and are meant to conceal what the
Israelis are doing in reoccupied Palestinian cities.</TE>
<TE>   At least 20 journalists have come under Israeli fire since the
offensive began March 29, according to the Paris-based watchdog group
Reporters Without Borders. In most cases, the fire apparently is meant as
warning shots, but five journalists have been wounded, including one
American, Anthony Shadid of the Boston Globe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a form of nonverbal communication, their way of saying, 'Please
leave the area at once,' " said Cameron Barr, a Christian Science Monitor
reporter who has been shot at twice in recent days. "They want to get a
message across. Believe me, I left with alacrity. It was an extremely
effective message."</TE>
<TE>   A convoy of correspondents got the message Friday when it approached
Arafat's compound in Ramallah and came under attack from two Israeli army
jeeps. Without warning, one of the jeeps rammed a clearly marked CNN
vehicle, and soldiers threw several stun grenades. As the convoy
retreated, soldiers fired plastic bullets, chipping the CNN car's
reinforced glass windows.</TE>
<TE>   Five journalists from Agence France-Presse and Spanish television got
the message Sunday as they walked into the West Bank town of Yatta
wearing flak jackets bearing the letters "TV" in big white tape and
waving a white flag. They retreated under Israeli gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   And journalists who stayed in Ramallah after Israel declared it a
closed military zone got the message all last week. Israeli snipers took
potshots at their hotel, and passing tanks fired into the air.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli army is knowingly targeting journalists in a deliberate
policy of intimidation," Robert Menard, general secretary of Reporters
Without Borders, said Sunday. "The Israelis want a news blackout so they
can work in a vacuum and do as they like."</TE>
<TE>   Israel now controls all the West Bank's cities save one and has
declared most of them off limits to reporters. Israeli officials warn
that any reporter who enters those cities is provoking Israeli troops and
violating Israeli law, even though Israel ceded the area to Palestinian
control in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, senior army officials have defended the use of stun
grenades against journalists but insisted that shooting at them is
contrary to orders. They say various shooting incidents are under army
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters, editors and other critics of the restrictions insist that
journalists must have freer access to the West Bank to report fairly on
Operation Defensive Shield. Israeli leaders say the assault is to uproot
Palestinian terrorist networks; Palestinian leaders say it is aimed at
destroying Palestinian self-rule and has killed scores of noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   One of the enduring controversies of the offensive, for example, is
whether dozens of monks, priests and nuns inside Bethlehem's Church of
the Nativity are hostages or willing companions of the 140 or so
Palestinian gunmen and civilians who took refuge in the shrine after
Israeli troops surrounded it last week.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists trying to get close to the church have been repelled by
Israeli gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare public debate on the subject on Israeli television Sunday
night, Tami Allen-Frost, a producer for Britain's ITN television network,
confronted Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the army's chief spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We are filming the tanks because we are not allowed in any deeper,"
she said. "Allow us to film the Palestinian population, the suffering."</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking here about a war," Kitrey replied. "People are
shooting at each other, and the instruction to minimize the journalists'
presence in the area was made to minimize the 'teasing effect,' which
instigates violence. We get enough from our enemies and work hard to save
our soldiers' lives. At times we cannot deal with the media as well."</TE>
<TE>   He promised an easing of restrictions in the coming days, when the
offensive is expected to conclude.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and foreign journalists had somewhat freer access to Israel's
conflict zones during the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, Israel's war in
Lebanon 20 years ago and the army's previous actions against Palestinian
uprisings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the tighter restrictions now, Israeli journalists say,
is the army's furious reaction to an Israeli broadcast last month of an
army raid on a Palestinian refugee camp near Ramallah. The footage,
filmed by an Israeli Channel Two crew that was allowed to accompany
soldiers, showed the troops blowing off the door to a family's house with
explosives--only to find that they had fatally wounded a woman inside.</TE>
<TE>   "The army does not want anyone watching too closely because they know
that what they do does not make for pretty pictures," said Amos Harel,
military correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. "The American
army acted this way in its last few wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
the Israelis have learned from this."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has done more than shoot at journalists to get across the
message that they are not welcome in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The government has expelled crews from CBS News, NBC News, Al Jazeera
and Abu Dhabi Television from Ramallah. It revoked the credentials of two
reporters from Abu Dhabi TV, accused of broadcasting anti-Israeli
incitement; one of the two was deported Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A cameraman for Reuters and one from the Dubai-based Middle East
Broadcasting Co. were strip-searched by Israeli soldiers on a street in
Ramallah. Israel has arrested at least eight Palestinian journalists,
according to Reporters Without Borders, and has renewed fewer than half
the permits of the 600 Palestinian journalists accredited here last year.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident last week, soldiers forced a group of journalists
out of an interview with a Palestinian family at its Ramallah apartment.
A member of the family had been arrested and released by the Israelis,
and the journalists wanted to talk to him.</TE>
<TE>   An hour into the interview, soldiers turned up outside the apartment
and sent word that the journalists had to go. As they left, the reporters
were confronted by soldiers with guns pointed at them and ordered back to
their hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government spokesman Daniel Seaman denied any intent to block
coverage of the West Bank. "We could have cut off cables, limited
satellite accessibility, but we haven't done that stuff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he defended the arrests and restrictions on Palestinians working
for foreign news organizations, saying they are "no doubt employed" by
Arafat's Palestinian Authority. "They will use every method to hurt us,
including exploiting the media and Israeli democracy. We have to put a
stop to this matter."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Mideast Flexibility Could Serve His Domestic Agenda Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's decision to send Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell to the Middle East last week has inspired both loud praise and
quiet gloating. Most analysts welcome the initiative. But critics see it
as a tacit admission that Bush's initial decision to disengage from the
region was a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   That's a common reflex in Washington--and a destructive one. When a
politician changes position, the capital's general assumption is that
there are only two possible explanations. One is political opportunism.
The other is that the initial position was wrong to begin with. Measured
against those yardsticks, change almost always looks like a sign of
weakness.</LD>
<LD>   It shouldn't be. Politicians can also change positions because they
learn from experience. Or because they are confronting changing
conditions. Indeed, of all the skills a president needs to succeed, the
ability to adapt to new circumstances may be the most often overlooked.</LD>
<TE>   Effective presidents have uniformly understood this. Franklin D.
Roosevelt relentlessly reversed course in the search for a cure to the
Great Depression. Ronald Reagan condemned the Soviet Union as the "evil
empire," then seized the opportunities for new agreements Mikhail S.
Gorbachev presented. After the Republicans captured Congress in 1994,
Bill Clinton revived his presidency and reshaped the domestic debate by
embracing the balanced budget he had earlier resisted.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the best example of presidential flexibility is Abraham Lincoln.
No one would accuse Lincoln of lacking conviction. But it was Lincoln,
during the Civil War, who said: "I am controlled by events. My policy is
to have no policy."</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln didn't mean he had no goals. He was steered by a single
overriding principle: preserving the Union while preventing the spread of
slavery. But, as events demanded, he adjusted the tactics he employed
toward that end, especially on the momentous decision of when and where
to emancipate slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln's brilliant improvisation was the paramount example of a
persistent truth. "Anyone who is going to be even halfway effective in
the presidency is going to have to be someone with a pragmatic outlook,"
says presidential historian Robert Dallek. "That doesn't mean you should
be unprincipled. But you have to understand that reality is always
challenging whatever principles or preconceptions you bring to office.
You can't sit back and wait until the world comes around to the way you
would like it to look."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Bush and the Middle East. Bush certainly
arrived in office with a preconception: Under Clinton, the U.S. had been
too heavily involved in mediating between the Israelis and Palestinians.
It's reasonable to debate whether that was the right decision at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   In Bush's defense were signs Clinton's intervention had reached an
impasse after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected the Camp David
peace offer in 2000. (Even some former Clintonites share that view.) On
the other side was the historical evidence that without sustained U.S.
pressure, the two sides tend toward their worst instincts. On balance,
historians are likely to side with Bush's critics.</TE>
<TE>   But for Bush to change course now doesn't require him to agree he was
wrong then. Whatever the merits of his original disengagement, his
decision to dispatch Powell suggests that he is adjusting to changed
circumstances--the radically increased level of violence in the
conflict--and learning from experience, after watching how conditions
deteriorated without American involvement. That should be exactly what
America wants in a president.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think what he is doing now entails any act of
self-repudiation; it is adapting to a new circumstance," says Will
Marshall, executive director of the Progressive Policy Institute, a
centrist Democratic think tank.</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly inconceivable that after dispatching Powell, events may
again force Bush to tilt the dial back in support of Israeli military
action. Or to vacillate between talking with Arafat and promoting other
Palestinian leadership. Or even to reconsider his reluctance to deploy
American troops as part of a multinational peacekeeping force to police
any agreement that is ultimately reached. No one can realistically expect
Bush today to have a road map that will take the parties all the way to
peace (or just calm). What he needs is a commitment to stay with the
journey, even if that means occasionally changing course.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, America would probably be better off if Bush was willing
to adapt to new circumstances more often. Especially on domestic issues,
Bush usually resists changing his views until it is unavoidable, and
sometimes he doesn't move then.</TE>
<TE>   The best example is the federal budget. The world has been utterly
transformed since last spring when Bush pushed through Congress his
$1.3-trillion tax cut. It's difficult to imagine Congress would have
approved a reduction nearly so large if it knew it would face the massive
bills for increased spending over the next decade on defense (nearly $500
billion) and homeland security (possibly another $300 billion to $400
billion) that emerged after Sept. 11. The tax cut today is an
anachronism: a luxury of peace in a time of war.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has adamantly refused to reconsider it. His intransigence
makes it unlikely Congress will agree on a budget this year. According to
the Congressional Budget Office, it also means that through 2012,
Washington will have to divert more than $2 trillion in taxes collected
for Social Security to pay for the rest of government and the cost of the
tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Initially that money was slated to reduce the national debt. By using
it instead to operate the government today, Bush guarantees a larger
federal debt tomorrow. That means Washington will pay more in interest
costs, which will demand higher taxes on future generations. That amounts
to funding the war against terror, and the tax cut, by borrowing from our
children rather than paying for it ourselves--hardly a model of shared
sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson in both these arenas is that principle detached from
pragmatism can carry a cost: red ink at home, streets run red in Israel
and the West Bank. Presidents are always praised for standing on
principle. But sometimes it's better just to bend. Bush is learning that
in the Middle East. He'd do well to apply that insight at home too.</TE>

<LD>Brian Rohrbough, his face lined and pale, works to keep his tone
even as he talks about the time that has passed since his son Danny died
in the fusillade that ripped through Columbine High School.</LD>
<LD>   Three years gone, he says, and police have yet to fully account for
their actions that April day when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold rampaged
through the school. Rohrbough takes the stonewalling personally. He
believes a policeman killed his son that day.</LD>
<LD>   "I think victims' families have certain rights--to be told the truth
about what happened," he says. "All I want is the truth."</LD>
<TE>   The worst school shooting in U.S. history has left not only many
lingering questions but also a legacy of rancor and continued
accusations.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, someone leaked Columbine crime scene photos to the
Rocky Mountain News, one of Denver's two daily newspapers. The Jefferson
County Sheriff's Department had pledged they would never be made public.
Though the paper ended up not publishing the photos, the resulting
brouhaha prompted Sheriff John Stone to order his entire department to
take polygraph tests to identify the paper's source.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of the 12 slain children had been pinning their hopes on an
independent legislative investigation, complete with subpoena power, to
resolve unanswered questions about the massacre and its aftermath. Many
of the parents broke into tears last month when the state Legislature,
citing the high cost, voted down a bill calling for the investigation.
The state representative who sponsored the legislation has vowed to
reintroduce it soon.</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado attorney general and the Jefferson County district
attorney have taken their own steps to staunch criticism of the Columbine
investigation. They recently asked the approximately 35 law enforcement
agencies that responded to the April 20, 1999, massacre to turn in
everything they possess, including investigative interviews and other
records related to the case.</TE>
<TE>   They hope to create a clearinghouse of information and curtail the
numerous accusations that authorities either withheld data or gave out
wrong information. Critics applaud the effort but say it should have been
done long ago, before evidence was lost or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Sheriff Stone, still smarting from the accusation
that a policeman may have shot Danny Rohrbough, has asked the sheriff in
nearby El Paso County to look into the thoroughness of his Columbine
investigation. The results of that review are expected to be made public
within several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Jefferson County Dist. Atty. Dave Thomas recently asked the
county coroner to conduct an inquest into Rohrbough's death. But the
coroner declined, saying he did not want to put witnesses, many of them
students, through more trauma. He also said the inquest would serve "no
purpose" because it would not change the official conclusion about Danny
Rohrbough's death unless new evidence surfaces.</TE>
<TE>Father Keeps Fighting</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Columbine-related lawsuits have dwindled to a single case.
More than a dozen suits, filed by the victims' parents against the Harris
and Klebold families, the police and others have been settled or thrown
out of court.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining lawsuit was filed by the family of Columbine teacher
Dave Sanders, who bled to death inside the high school even as students
begged rescuers to help him. The suit, for which no trial date has been
set, contends that Sanders died because rescuers waited three hours to
enter the building.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a story with the longest legs I've ever known," Thomas said.
"There's always something new. The latest is the release of these photos.
It didn't just happen by accident. Someone wants to keep this story
alive."</TE>
<TE>   One person keeping the Columbine story from fading is Brian Rohrbough,
who installs high-end sound equipment from his industrial park shop in
suburban Englewood.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough has joined with his former wife, Susan Petrone, in the quest
for information about the death of their only son. Rohrbough, 43, whose
neatly trimmed hair is going gray, is one of several parents of Columbine
victims who have appeared on television and radio programs to demand a
complete accounting of the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough has long contended his son was killed by "friendly fire,"
based on his interpretation of the evidence. But he stunned the Columbine
community late last year by filing a federal court document asking for
the reinstatement of a lawsuit that named Denver Police Sgt. Daniel
O'Shea, who had been decorated as a hero for his actions at Columbine, as
the man who accidentally shot Danny Rohrbough.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he shot Dan," Rohrbough said. "I think O'Shea got on the
scene and then Dan comes running down the stairs and he mistook Dan for a
gunman and shot and killed him."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough's evidence is circumstantial. He first named O'Shea after
learning that soon after Columbine, an emotional O'Shea told an
acquaintance that he thought he might have shot an innocent student
during the melee.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with that is the tape-recorded statement of a former deputy
sheriff--also a onetime family friend--who told Rohrbough he saw Danny
shot much later than the official version of events. According to
Rohrbough's analysis, that would have put O'Shea at the scene rather than
on his way to it. The former deputy, Jim Taylor, later said he had not
seen Danny fall to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Rohrbough points to the fact that the bullet that killed his
son was never found, making it impossible to link the shooting to Harris
and Klebold.</TE>
<TE>   O'Shea denied Rohrbough's accusation. What he had told the
acquaintance, O'Shea explained, was that he was glad he hadn't
accidentally shot a student--any student--during the shootout. He also
said television footage shot during the massacre backed up his version of
what happened. Rohrbough says the footage was shot an hour after the
attack began and proved nothing.</TE>
<TE>   O'Shea said after seeing the film: "Daniel Rohrbough was shot by
Klebold and Harris right at the outset of this, before anybody had a
chance to dial 9, much less 911." He declined to be interviewed for this
report.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Stone and his chief lieutenants also declined to comment.
Citing the advice of their attorneys, they also refused to testify before
the governor's commission investigating Columbine.</TE>
<TE>Sheriff Criticized</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff has come under fire from various quarters, mostly from
parents battling for records about what happened on the day of the
massacre. Stone also has been criticized for making speeches outside
Colorado while staying silent at home, as well as for giving videotapes
made by the killers to Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he announced he would not run for reelection, citing the
strain of the job since the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "John Stone is a very complex individual and one I haven't been able
to figure out," said Thomas, the district attorney. "I think what's
happened is sad for him personally and sad for his department."</TE>
<TE>   Critics fault Stone's department for bungling the post-Columbine
investigation and for not recognizing Klebold and Harris as dangerous
when, a year before the shootings, it received complaints about them.</TE>
<TE>   Just recently, it became clear that no detailed record exists of how
O'Shea expended 60 rounds of ammunition, more than a third of all shots
fired by officers that day. Law enforcement was again criticized last
month because ballistic experts didn't run complete tests on the bullet
found in the backpack of student Corey DePooter, killed in the school
library. The bullet came from the carbine fired by Harris, but a
sheriff's spokesman said the oversight was discovered only recently.</TE>
<TE>   And then came the pictures leaked to the Rocky Mountain News. One
purportedly shows Harris and Klebold after they committed suicide inside
the school.</TE>
<TE>   "What this shows is that it's an incompetent department," said Randy
Brown, whose son Brooks was killed at Columbine. "These photos were
trophies, things to take home and show around."</TE>
<TE>   Brown and his wife, Judy, were the parents who complained to the
Sheriff's Department a year before Columbine that Harris was making death
threats on the Internet, including one against their son. The complaint
was never acted on.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Jefferson County and the state of Colorado are about as
corrupt as it can get," he said. "They know this is a major failure by a
police department and no one will admit it. They have no interest in
finding the truth here."</TE>

<LD>Strong wind hampered cleanup efforts as workers tried to contain a
90,000-gallon crude oil spill off the southeast Louisiana coast.</LD>
<LD>   Four-foot waves made it difficult for boats called skimmers to collect
the oil, said BP Amoco spokesman Daren Beaudo. By early Sunday afternoon,
the Coast Guard said about 6,720 gallons had been recovered.</LD>
<LD>   Officials were still trying to determine what caused the BP pipeline
to rupture Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   No damage to wildlife had been reported, but Beaudo said he expected

<LD>More than 300 DePauw University students were evacuated when a fire
burned through a residence hall built in 1917. None of the students was
injured, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The morning fire at Rector Hall apparently began on the fourth floor,
which later collapsed from the fire and intense heat. The blaze sent
flames and thick, black smoke rising above the school.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear what sparked the fire at the campus in Greencastle,
which was still burning at midday. Damage estimates were not immediately
available.</LD>

<HD>Crimes Against Latinos Decrease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States became a safer place for Latinos during the 1990s
as the rate of violent crime against them dropped by 56%, the Justice
Department reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The drop in nonfatal violent crime against Latinos from 1993 to 2000
tracked national trends for other racial groups in a period that saw a
sustained economic expansion and policing strategies that combined tough
enforcement with efforts to improve community relations.</LD>
<LD>   "For Latinos, violent crime mirrored what was happening in the rest of
the country--it was down significantly," said Lisa Navarrete, a
spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Washington-based
Latino advocacy organization.</LD>
<TE>   The decrease for Latinos over the eight-year period was more
pronounced than the 50% decline in the victimization rate for whites.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Latinos were about as likely to be victims of nonfatal
violent crime as whites. Overall, there were 28 victims of violent crime
per 1,000 Latinos age 12 or older in 2000, compared with 27 among whites
and 34 among blacks. In 1993, the first year covered by the report, there
were 63 victims of nonfatal violent crime per 1,000 Latino residents.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the improvement may lie with an influx of
Latinos into police department ranks, said Jose C. Miramontes, president
of the National Latino Peace Officers Assn. The growing visibility of
Latino officers has changed attitudes in many neighborhoods in which law
enforcement was previously viewed as an outside power, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there are gangs, but people are interacting more with law
enforcement," said Miramontes, who lives in Los Angeles County. "People
are not afraid to go and talk to the police now. When I was growing up,
it wasn't like that." His organization represents 10,000 Latino officers
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Jason Lee said more analysis was needed to see whether
local statistics fit with the national pattern. Latinos comprise more
than 40% of Los Angeles County residents. "We need to look at our own
statistics before we can comment," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   One major crime--homicide--is not covered by the household surveys on
which the Justice Department report is based, since the surveys rely on
firsthand reports from crime victims. And the murder statistics for
Latinos are not good.</TE>
<TE>   At 9.1 victims per 100,000 people, the murder rate for Latinos remains
about 50% higher than for the nation as a whole. Those numbers are for
1999, the most recent year for which complete data are available, and
come from a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   The report on nonfatal crimes found that Latinos were more likely than
whites to be victims of crimes involving firearms, which may help explain
why the murder rate is higher. About 15% of Latino victims reported that
the offender had used a gun, compared with 7% of white victims and 17% of
black victims.</TE>
<TE>   The report includes data on assaults, robberies and sexual assaults.
About 6 in 10 violent crimes against Latinos in 2000 were simple
assaults. Robbery accounted for 20% of the crimes, followed by aggravated
assault (19%) and sexual assault (2%).</TE>
<TE>   The report is based on the National Crime Victimization Survey, an
ongoing survey of about 50,000 households across the country. More than
730,000 individuals age 12 and older were interviewed; the statistics
regarding Latinos are culled from those respondents who described
themselves as Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Chicano, Mexican, Cuban,
Central or South American or other Spanish origin.</TE>
<TE>   For Latinos, violent crime rates fell the most among women, persons
age 35 to 49, divorced or separated persons, those in low-income
households earning from $15,000 to $24,999 and residents of rural areas,
the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete said the drop in the victimization rate for Latinas may be
partly attributable to a national campaign against domestic abuse. "This
was done in Spanish as well as English for the first time during the
1990s," she said. "You can now call the National Domestic Abuse Hotline
and talk to somebody in Spanish."</TE>

<HD>Cincinnati Rally Urges Justice for Blacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI
</DL>
<LD>A year after an unarmed black man was shot and killed by a white
police officer, hundreds of protesters gathered downtown to mark the
anniversary and demand the city do more to hold police accountable for
their actions against blacks.</LD>
<LD>   Fountain Square was filled with people listening to speeches by civil
rights activists and relatives of Timothy Thomas, whose shooting led to
the city's worst rioting since the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination in 1968. Officer Stephen Roach was acquitted in Thomas'
death.</LD>
<LD>   The city says much has changed since Thomas was killed, but black
activists disagree. They say the city still has not done enough to help
black residents economically and that the rights of blacks continue to be
violated.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Damon Lynch III, head of Cincinnati Black United Front, urged
residents to work for reforms to curb what he called excessive use of
force by police and to ensure justice for blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "History shows us if there is no pressure, there is no change."</TE>
<TE>   After the rally, several hundred people marched to City Hall, where
they rang a small bell a dozen times to mark the months that have passed
since Thomas, 19, was shot as he fled police on misdemeanor charges.</TE>
<TE>   Police on horseback escorted the crowd, which continued the march for
five blocks to police headquarters. There were no arrests or violence
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Black activist William Kirkland organized the rally to focus attention
on justice, police brutality and economic exclusion of blacks here.</TE>
<TE>   City and business leaders say much has been done in the last year to
boost education and job opportunities for blacks, including employment
training and funding to revitalize poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Dan La Botz, an assistant professor of history at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, who helped organize the march, said police haven't taken
responsibility for past infringements on the rights of blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We think people should understand that they've been dragged kicking
and screaming into the 21st century," he said of city leaders and police.
"We want to claim that victory for the people of Cincinnati."</TE>

<LD>Delaware Court Plans to Issue HP Ruling</LD>
<LD>   A Delaware court Sunday said it would issue in the next few days a
ruling on whether it will throw out a lawsuit filed against
Hewlett-Packard Co. by dissident board member Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett, who is fighting HP's acquisition of competitor Compaq
Computer Corp., asked the Delaware Chancery Court at the end of March
to stop the deal, alleging that HP management bought votes and misled
a key advisor.</LD>
<TE>   HP, which believes it won a March 19 shareholder vote on the deal,
in turn on April 1 asked the Delaware court, which specializes in
corporate law, to dismiss the suit.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Walter Hewlett, who owns an HP stake through the
William R. Hewlett Revocable Trust said, "We're grateful the court
took up this issue on such short notice and we await a court ruling
and in the meantime discovery on the complaints is ongoing."</TE>
<TE>   The spokeswoman said the court would issue a ruling in the coming
days.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor William Chandler III considered the motion in a 2
1/2-hour court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is now due to go to trial in the Delaware court
starting April 23. The judge has reserved three days for the trial,
although it could go longer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the lawsuit's outcome, the companies are waiting
for a final tally of HP shareholders votes, which should be ready in
the next few weeks.</TE>

<TE>   KirchMedia May Seek Bankruptcy Protection</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia's expected filing for protection from creditors as
early as today may spark a battle between banks and investors for the
most valuable assets of Germany's second-biggest media company,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch Holding, which has $5.7 billion in debt, may seek bankruptcy
protection for its main film business today after talks about a
rescue failed Friday, people familiar with the plans said. Kirch and
the banks declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The filing would end months of negotiations to bail out the
company run by founder Leo Kirch, 75. KirchMedia owns a controlling
stake in ProSiebenSat1 Media, Germany's No.1 television broadcaster,
as well as Europe's biggest film library.</TE>
<TE>   Commerzbank, Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale and HVB Group,
Kirch's main creditors, may present a plan to take over KirchMedia,
install different managers and find new investors for the business
Monday, the people said. One of the investors may be Axel Springer
Verlag, the country's biggest publisher.</TE>
<TE>   The Bavarian state government would support the banks' proposals,
the Welt am Sonntag newspaper said, citing unidentified bankers.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight banks have more than $88 million at stake,
according to BayernLB, the biggest creditor with $1 billion in loans
to Kirch. HVB Group has about $400 million at stake, the Munich-based
company has said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main obstacles to a restructuring is Kirch's
organization, where its own units are its main customers, analysts
have said. Premiere, Kirch's pay-television channel, is the only
pay-TV customer of the film-rights business.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch ran into financial difficulties after acquisitions,
including the rights to Formula One racing and World Cup soccer,
failed to add to earnings, and banks including Dresdner Bank started
calling in their loans. Kirch needs $1 billion in April alone to pay
back loans and buy out minority investors.</TE>
<TE>   An insolvency filing can be avoided only if the banks agree to new
talks with investors such as Rupert Murdoch and companies controlled
by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi over the weekend, people
familiar with the company have said.</TE>

<TE>   Retail Sales Rising Along With Optimism</TE>
<TE>   U.S. retail sales probably rose more in March than at any time in
five months, bolstered by consumers who are becoming more optimistic,
economic reports this week are likely to show.</TE>
<TE>   Sales rose for the third month in the last four, the Commerce
Department is expected to report Friday. Spending is likely to rise
again this month because consumer confidence may have climbed to its
highest level since December 2000, the closely watched University of
Michigan survey is expected to show Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, higher energy prices are the reason behind a probable
surge in the producer price index for March. The Labor Department's
producer price index is expected to show a 0.7% increase for the
month. That would mark the biggest gain since January 2001 and follow
a 0.2% increase in February.</TE>
<TE>   The core producer price index, which excludes food and energy
costs, probably rose 0.1% after showing no change a month earlier.
That would put core inflation at the wholesale level up 0.5% over the
last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts suggest that retail sales last month rose 0.4%, which
would be the largest gain since sales surged 6.4% in October. In that
month, auto makers introduced interest-free financing on new
purchases. Excluding automobiles, sales probably rose 0.5% in March,
the sixth increase in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are higher as optimism about the economy increases.
Thursday's preliminary report of the University of Michigan consumer
sentiment index for April is expected to show a rise to 96.8 from
95.7 in March, according to a Bloomberg survey. That would be the
highest since December 2000 and compares with a low of 81.8 reached
after September's terrorist attacks.</TE>

<TE>   Yahoo Is Expected to Report Results</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies begin reporting their quarterly earnings in earnest
this week.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter earnings are expected to be down 9% year-over-year,
slightly lower than last week's forecast of 8.8% after a slew of
profit warnings from tech firms.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies issuing results this week will be Internet
media company Yahoo Inc., which is expected to report another quarter
of ho-hum results Wednesday, reflecting the stubbornly weak Internet
advertising market and limited progress in developing new sources of
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street analysts say there could be some upside over the
official forecasts for a small operating profit, if any of the
company's new ad formats, or its new fee-based services, show
strength.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo, which has reported five straight quarters of net losses,
continues to depend on online advertising for the bulk of its
revenue, although it has made some progress at widening its revenue
base by adding fees for services ranging from personal ads to e-mail
storage and games.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average expect the company to show a first-quarter
operating profit of 2 cents a share on revenue of $173.6 million.</TE>

<TE>   Bush to Discuss Bill on Terrorism Insurance</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting today with business and labor leaders, President Bush
will emphasize the possibility that jobs could be lost if the Senate
does not act on terrorism insurance legislation, a senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to use the meeting to highlight the growing "drag on
the economy" created by a lack of available terrorism insurance since
Sept. 11, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House wants Congress to create a federal backup plan to
help insurance companies pay future terrorism claims.</TE>
<TE>   The House passed a bill last year that would lend insurers money
to pay claims. The Senate has not acted on a competing proposal that
would require insurers to pay part of claims resulting from a
terrorism attack before the government would step in to cover the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa and Edward Sullivan, president of
the AFL-CIO construction trades department, are among the 125 people
the White House expects to be at the meeting today. Homeland Security
Director Tom Ridge and Bush's chief economics advisor, Lawrence
Lindsey, also are to attend the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has collected evidence of cities and property
owners that have not been able to obtain terrorism insurance.</TE>

<TE>   Debate Heats Up Over Energy Derivatives</TE>
<TE>   A proposed amendment to the energy bill scheduled for debate in
the U.S. Senate today could mean even less transparency in the
secretive energy derivatives market, which some blame for the
collapse of its biggest player, Enron Corp., market players say.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts welcomed California Democrat Sen. Dianne
Feinstein's push for price disclosure and capitalization requirements
for participants in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, which are traded
outside regulated exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   But other traders, exchanges and members of the market--estimated
at some $3 trillion in notional value--saw dire results if the
amendment were passed into law.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, it would probably make the players obfuscate more," said
Peter Fusaro, head of energy risk management consultancy Global
Change Associates, adding it could drive the market offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The legislators and some analysts allege manipulation of the
highly secret over-the-counter market led to power price spikes and
rolling blackouts last year and contributed to Enron's collapse.
Enron built up huge OTC positions on its Internet trading platform
EnronOnline, in which the now-humbled energy giant was counterparty
to every trade.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's bill, co-sponsored by other lawmakers from Western
states hit by an electricity crisis last year, would give the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of all OTC-traded
energy and metals derivatives.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators say the bill would allow regulators to better track
trades and to respond faster to any illegal activity in the market.</TE>

<TE>   Negotiators Want United Impasse Declared</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for 23,000 United Airlines employees want mediators to
declare an impasse this week in their contract talks with the carrier
so the union can start laying the groundwork for a possible strike by
ramp, customer service and other workers, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The company and negotiators for the International Assn. of
Machinists will meet with the National Mediation Board Thursday in
Washington for the first time since talks broke off three weeks ago
after a deadlock over wages and other compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The IAM will press the government to release it from meditation
and begin a 30-day cooling-off period after which a strike date could
be set. Union members have authorized their leadership to call a
strike, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists say, however, that the two sides are close enough
to an agreement that triggering a strike deadline could, in fact, be
the key to reaching an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Railway Labor Act, which governs airline contract
talks, allows negotiations to continue open-ended, even in mediation,
until threat of a strike brings the dispute to a head. If mediators
do not declare an impasse, another round of talks could resume later
this month, the union said. Nnegotiations between United and the IAM
District 141 Lodge have been ongoing since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   If an impasse is declared this week in the latest United dispute
and the White House intervened after 30 days, a strike could not take
place before July at the earliest. That is in the middle of the
critical summer travel season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based United, a unit of UAL Corp. and the world's
second-biggest airline, says it has put an industry leading package
on the table for its ramp workers, customer service agents, food
service employees and security guards.</TE>
