<LD>DESIRABLE DAUGHTERS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Bharati Mukherjee</LD>
<TE>   Theia</TE>
<TE>   310 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bharati Mukherjee's sixth novel follows a contemporary Brahmin
Bengali family's efforts to maintain the traditions of its homeland
while accepting the cultural changes sweeping through India.
"Desirable Daughters" portrays the divergent lives of three sisters
raised in upper-class Calcutta society: Padma, Parvati and Tara
Bhattacharjee, who deal with the demands of family and society in
their own ways. Mukherjee examines the consequences of abandoning
one's cultural heritage and of remaining absolutely faithful to it.
To what extent is assimilation acceptable, and to what extent is it a
betrayal of one's past?</TE>
<TE>   "We're a billion people," she writes, "but divided into so many
thousands or millions of classifications that we have trouble
behaving as a monolith. Yet each Indian is so densely packed with
family that he or she seems to contain hundreds of competing
personalities." Indeed, the Bhattacharjees are so steeped in high
society that images of Mother Teresa and a squalid Calcutta are as
foreign to them as to those in the Western world.</TE>
<TE>   The three sisters, while expected to marry into the right caste
and to do so by a certain age, are raised with an immersion in art
and literature. They lead carefree lives, and because of their wealth
and beauty, every opportunity awaits them. "We have genes to die
for," Tara, the novel's narrator, explains: "natural emollients,
soft, black hair, and white teeth that have never known cavities or
the need for straightening." The novel opens with a Bhattacharjee
family legend about Tara Lata the Tree-Bride, a distant 19th century
relative for whom Tara was named, and whose ghost haunts Tara. As a
child, the legend goes, Tara Lata was preparing for her wedding when
the bridegroom died suddenly of snakebite, putting her family under a
curse. "She was now not quite a widow," Mukherjee writes, "which for
a Bengali Hindu woman would be the most cursed state, but a woman who
brings her family misfortune and death. She was a person to be
avoided."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Tree-Bride's doomed fate freed her to lead an
entirely independent life in a society that shunned unmarried women.
Free from the burdens of a husband and children, Tara Lata lived the
rest of her life alone in her father's house. As a modern woman, Tara
Bhattacharjee seems to have little in common with her namesake, yet
she feels a strong connection, as she too has ended up without a
husband. Tara realizes that Tara Lata "had turned the tragedy of her
husband's death and a lifetime's virginity into a model of selfless
saintliness," while she had simply ended her marriage because she
felt like it.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, Tara can't help wondering if her bold decision to
move to California with her husband (and divorce him 12 years later)
has somehow brought shame to her family and perhaps thwarted her
happiness. At 36, living in San Francisco with her teenage son Rabi
and her American boyfriend, she isn't as fulfilled as she'd like to
be. The promises of American life have failed her. And considering
that her ex-husband, Bish, is a Bill Gates-like billionaire, she
isn't entirely sure that leaving him was the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Mukherjee offers an insightful portrayal of a family dynamic
frustrating and comic. Bish was a good Indian husband, fulfilling his
duties honorably, yet he did not satisfy his Americanized wife. Tara
views Bish as dull and almost too Indian, while her family regards
her as not Indian enough; they think she has bought into shallow
American values. Tara is caught between remaining loyal to her family
and satisfying her desires.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is most interesting when it reads as a family saga:
Tara's amicable, unresolved relationship with Bish; her distant
relationship with her disapproving elder sister, Padma; and her
closeness with Parvati, who is her only confidante. Tara also has a
close but challenging relationship with Rabi, who is wrestling with
his sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Mukherjee is an astute observer of Indian culture and tradition,
and the guilt and ambivalence that such a rich history often
engenders. Each of the daughters feels a pull toward home, and each
handles it in a different way: Tara feels the most ambivalence about
meeting her family's expectations yet is ultimately drawn back home.
Padma has also left India for America, and she leads an insular,
private life in New Jersey. Parvati is a dutiful daughter who lives
in Bombay and visits her ailing parents regularly; yet she upset them
years ago by choosing her husband and "jumping the marriage queue."</TE>
<TE>   "Desirable Daughters" gets off track with some busy subplots,
including one about a man who shows up at Tara's door claiming to be
a family member and who turns out to be a stalker. It's almost as if
Mukherjee was attempting to find a balance between a literary novel
and a commercial one, and decided to write both. Yet Mukherjee is at
her best when she zooms in on her characters' interior lives and
relationships; she ought to leave the melodrama to lesser writers.</TE>

<LD>Bonsai</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever seen a miniature version of a wind-swept tree
growing in a tray? Bonsai is the Japanese art of growing trees in
shallow trays so that they don't grow as big as they normally would.
They look like very old trees in miniature.</LD>
<LD>   The word "bonsai" can be translated as "tray-planting." Trees are
kept small by pruning and shaping branches and roots and pinching off
new growth. Many kinds of plants are made into bonsais, including
juniper, maple, cypress and wisteria. Becoming a bonsai master can
take many years of training, but anyone can learn the basics of this
ancient art form.</LD>
<TE>   One of the goals of bonsais is to copy what takes nature a very
long time to do--hundreds of years of exposure to wind, lightning and
snow. A bonsai master can make a young tree look aged. When shaping a
tree, the bonsai master must first decide which style is best suited
to the tree's natural form. Basic styles have such names as
"wind-swept," "cascade" and "informal upright." The great care and
attention bonsais require can make them very valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Bonsai trees go through all the normal seasonal changes that other
trees do: flowering in spring, bearing fruit in summer, showing red
and gold foliage in autumn and losing leaves in winter. They serve as
symbols of nature's enduring beauty through all seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington has a permanent collection of bonsai in its Bonsai
Court. This weekend you'll have the chance to see many examples of
bonsais when the California Bonsai Society presents its 45th annual
show on Saturday and Sunday. More than 100 beautiful bonsais
skillfully created by masters will be on display, including miniature
deciduous (leaf-bearing) trees such as maples and elms. For more
information, call (626) 405-2141 or visit www.hunt ington.org.</TE>

enhancers, known in red-carpet circles as "chicken cutlets" right,
mold to the chest using body heat. There are also no-hose shaper
panties for the bottom, but going commando is also an option "if it's
not a sheer dress," says stylist Vincent Boucher. "Many actresses
don't wear underwear at all." And don't sweat the small stuff like
deodorant and sweat stains. The "it" treatment this year is underarm
Botox. Muscle tissue surrounding the sweat glands is injected with a
form of botulinum toxin, below right, paralyzing tissues and
temporarily suspending perspiration under the arm. "It stops sweating
so you don't have to wear deodorant," says Dr. Karyn Grossman, who is
making house calls as part of the Estee Lauder mobile Oscar spa.
"Plus, if you have to give your dress back, you don't have to worry
about getting sweat stains on it." Free for nominees, the treatment
normally costs $800 to $1,200 and lasts three to six months.</CP>

<HD>So Influential, So California: 'The Grapes of Wrath'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are a handful of American books that changed not only their
readers' hearts and minds, but also the country's legal and political
landscape.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the most notable--Frank Norris' "The Octopus," Upton
Sinclair's "The Jungle" and John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of
Wrath"--were written by Californians. So, it's particularly apt that
the California Council for the Humanities has chosen Steinbeck's
masterpiece as the catalyst for a statewide reading and discussion
program that will get underway in October.</LD>
<LD>   A variation of the popular "one city, one book" movement (in Los
Angeles, Mayor James Hahn has proposed Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit
451"), the commission's initiative is the first "one state, one book"
plan and will involve 180 public libraries.</LD>
<TE>   It's only coincidental that Steinbeck was chosen this year, on the
100th anniversary of his birth, says the commission's executive
director, Jim Quay. The commission, he says, has an ongoing project
"to encourage contemporary Californians to tell their California
stories .... We wanted a book for people to model. My associate
director, Ralph Lewin, and his wife, Caitlin, were driving down the
Central Valley, thinking about what book might serve, and Caitlin
suggested 'The Grapes of Wrath,' which seemed like the perfect
choice."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, are the questions Quay would like to see readers pose:
"Who are the Joads of today, but also, where are the Steinbecks?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Words of Charles Colson?</TE>
<TE>   Since serving time for his part in the Watergate scandal, onetime
Nixon aide Charles Colson has founded a national prison ministry and
emerged as a leading figure among evangelical Christians. His 38
books have sold more than 5 million copies, and he is a daily radio
commentator and a columnist for Christianity Today, generally
regarded as America's most influential evangelical magazine.</TE>
<TE>   There, Colson's column occupies an entire page topped by his
byline and photograph. And the prose suggests that while the author
may have found God behind bars, he lost none of the confrontational
style that made him one of the hard men in a self-consciously tough
administration. In the magazine's most recent issue, for example,
Colson attacks the "Post-Truth Society," and one of the column's two
sub-headlines notes that "even the man on the street sees little
wrong with lying."</TE>
<TE>   Colson names names, clubbing everyone from football coaches to
hysterical teenagers. Historian Stephen Ambrose comes in for
particular censure and is described as "dealing in deceit" because he
"plagiarized portions of other historians' works and--notwithstanding
his public apology--seemed hardly disturbed by the resulting
controversy."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with all this is that--notwithstanding his byline and
picture--Colson did not write the column, according to current and
former employees. The actual author, they say, was Anne Morse, one of
two full-time writers Colson employs, along with various "contract"
writers and an editor.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is this the first time questions have arisen about Colson's
actual contribution to the books and commentaries ascribed to him. In
the mid-1990s, Christianity Today received a letter that criticized
Colson's reliance on ghostwriters.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, he decided to share credit for his column with
Nancy R. Pearcey, who says that at that point, she had been writing
the column "for two years." Colson, she says, "sometimes suggested
ideas he wanted inserted, but usually just approved the drafts I had
written."</TE>
<TE>   According to Pearcey, who no longer works for Colson, that
relationship "continued until 1999, when Chuck and I wrote a book,
[the bestselling] 'How Now Shall We Live?' with the understanding we
would share credit. I wrote the majority of the chapters, Chuck wrote
some, and another contract writer wrote nine. But when the cover
design and the ads came out, my name wasn't on them."</TE>
<TE>   Pearcey said that when Colson's most recent column appeared, she
recognized it as Morse's work and "called to compliment her. She told
me how she'd researched it and run it by other friends ... before
Chuck approved the final version."</TE>
<TE>   Another Colson employee, who asked to not be identified, agreed
with Pearcey's account. Colson was unavailable and Morse declined
comment.</TE>
<TE>   David Neff, who edits Christianity Today, says that "with Mr.
Colson we presume people understand that he has a gigantic output and
that one human being can't put out all those words."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Neff said, he was under the impression that after the
relationship with Pearcey ended, Colson "started writing his own
columns ... but I have been thinking that the time has come to raise
the question with him again."</TE>
<TE>   When Neff does, Pearcey believes, he will find that "overall,
Chuck's contribution is much less than the public imagines."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What They're Working On</TE>
<TE>   Bestselling short-story writer and novelist Janet Fitch is the
author of, among other works, the novel "White Oleander."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about her work in progress, she replied: "I'm writing a
novel set primarily in Los Angeles in the 1920s. My grandmother came
here in 1922 as the wife of a studio wardrobe man. He had gone back
to his old neighborhood in Brooklyn, married a 15-year-old girl and
proceeded to make her life a living hell with his womanizing and
alcoholism. I asked myself why. I posited the idea that he must have
been trying to prove something to someone and--with that in mind--I
started to write their story. And everything changed: He became a
cameraman and then a photographer. She is now 16. I am trying to make
them unique characters, pieces of myself really and no longer my
grandmother and her rotten first husband.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I am in 1922, seeing Los Angeles as it was then.
People had come here from all over the world trying, for various
reasons, to find a new way of being, and that's what I'm really
interested in exploring. It was a time when the First World War had
discredited the past and only the modern was still untarnished."</TE>

<HD>Toast to a Reigning Paparazzo and His Subjects</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar week has never felt so much like an L.A. fashion week. This
year, a record number of big name designers (Donatella Versace, Tom
Ford, Alberta Ferretti and Angela Missoni to name a few) are in town
hobnobbing in the hopes of landing a gown on the red carpet. What
this fashion frenzy adds up to is parties and air-kissing all week
long.</LD>
<LD>   One of the weirder events was a celeb-heavy cocktail reception
Ford hosted Wednesday for legendary paparazzo Ron Galella at the
Gucci store in Beverly Hills. The Bronx-born lensman, who made a
career out of harassing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, is having a
moment in the sun as a society darling.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems odd to fete a paparazzo, someone you spend your life
trying to get away from, but I think he has been elevated to iconic
status," said Rita Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   The party was pegged to the release of "Photographs of Ron
Galella" (Greybull Press, 2002), which has a foreword by Diane Keaton
and an intro by Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "Gucci owes so much of its history to the paparazzi photographs of
the 1960s and '70s--the Jackie bag, people arriving at the airport
carrying all those GGs," said Ford, 40.</TE>
<TE>   The designer added that Galella's photos of Robert Redford, Marlon
Brando and hundreds more boldface names were a benchmark for his
generation. "Like a lot of other people my age, I lived vicariously
through them," he said. "Even though there is quite a bit of
controversy surrounding Ron, he's a great photographer. If you look
at those pictures now, no one looks bad."</TE>
<TE>   Not one to hang with the VIPs, Galella, 71, spent most of the
party outside on the sidewalk, camera in tow.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is this guy?" the snap-happy photographer asked, his shutter
firing away. "Oh, I know who that is, it's Usher." (It was Cuba
Gooding Jr.)</TE>
<TE>   Sure he could have gone inside, but why? Galella was already in
heaven. He said, "I just can't let it go."</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, Women's Wear Daily hosted its second annual
pre-Oscar party at the mid-century modern "White House" on Rossmore
Avenue in Hancock Park. The bash is fast gaining a reputation as the
one pre-Oscar party where people actually party. (Imagine Imitation
of Christ designer Matt Damhave brandishing a gin bottle and you'll
get the picture.)</TE>
<TE>   For the all-white event, L.A. club promoter and party planner
Bryan Rabin transformed the private residence into a temple of mod
with white shag rugs and cube-shaped tables and chairs galore.
Outside, by the pool, Rufus Wainwright played a set on a white piano.</TE>
<TE>   Party co-sponsor the Diamond Information Center supplied some
serious rocks for the diorama-like display cases that adorned the
walls of the living room. (In one, two white rats scurried around an
exercise wheel that had a diamond necklace fastened around it. )</TE>
<TE>   Gina Gershon, Rose McGowan, Lisa Marie and Portia de Rossi glammed
it up in white gowns, along with WWD editors Rose Apodaca Jones and
Merle Ginsberg.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight, it's not about who's going to win or how much money a
film is going to make," Ginsberg said. "We're saying it's OK to think
about the superficial and how people look."</TE>
<TE>   But Gwyneth Paltrow ignored the dress code altogether, showing up
in corduroy pants and coat from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. "I'm in town
doing some reshoots, and [the party] was on my way home," she said
nonchalantly. "I thought, 'I never go out in L.A., I'll stop by and
at least pretend to be social for a while.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yep, that's pretty much the drill.</TE>

<DH>Exercise guru whips Spacek into shape for red-carpet
workout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I really can't reveal yet what I'm wearing," Sissy Spacek says with
a laugh when asked to describe her gown for the red carpet walk
Sunday night at the 74th Academy Awards in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The best actress nominee for "In the Bedroom" says she is sworn to
secrecy but adds that she will look like a million bucks whatever she
wears because of "Guru D from NYC."</LD>
<LD>   He's otherwise known as David Kirsch, a personal trainer who has
been helping the actress in Manhattan for the last six weeks to buff
up and slim down for her close-up at the Kodak Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm working on myself from the top of my head to the bottom of my
feet," the 52-year-old Spacek says by phone from New York. "I know
that I will have a happy body underneath whatever I wear."</TE>
<TE>   Kirsch is just one of the many personal trainers working overtime
in the days leading up to the Oscars. Most are sworn to secrecy by
their celebrity clients, for whom they serve as culinary and
spiritual coaches as well as workout police. At Crunch, a fitness
center on Sunset Boulevard, trainers and instructors are busy working
with several celebrity clients, says spokeswoman and assistant
manager Tracy Antoniewicz.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have at least one Oscar nominee up for one of the big
categories doing cardio, cross training and treadmill, getting ready
for the big night trying to fit into something outrageously small,"
she says. Many clients who will make the Oscar night party scene are
working out with the Crunch staff, even participating in the gym's
newest craze, cardio striptease, a dance class taught by Jeff Costa
that helps one achieve rock-hard abs and concludes with 15 minutes of
lap dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The class, says Antoniewicz, "reflects our culture right now in
that people are dressing very sexy and they want a lean body to show
off. They all want to make sure they look the part, and the part is
young Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   That's why 41-year-old Kirsch has moved West for a week and set up
shop at the Mondrian Hotel to help Spacek, model Heidi Klum and at
least four other stars and models achieve toned biceps and
gravity-defying derrieres in a matter of days.</TE>
<TE>   Spacek, a size 4, according to her trainer, was the only one of
his clients who would talk. Perhaps the actress plans to shed her
usual conservative black pantsuit and bun hairdo, which she donned
again to accept the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama for her
role as the uptight, grieving mother in "In the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Making a splash on the red carpet can be as arduous as landing a
plum acting assignment. Designers may throw gorgeous dresses at
celebrities, but it's all how a star wears a gown--the camera puts on
an instant 10 pounds, and there's no take two on the red carpet. For
some--such as Halle Berry--any angle will do. For others, Joan
Rivers, for instance ... well, you get the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsch has worked with Klum, Naomi Campbell, Bridget Hall and New
York fixtures such as Ivana Trump at his private gym, Madison Square
Club on Fifth Avenue. He charges $150 to $250 an hour for his
exercise and diet sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to ride the Oscar frenzy, Kirsch, who arrived Sunday, is
working with his clients in the Mondrian's gym and using the hotel's
kitchen to oversee the preparation of fat-free, broiled, baked and
leafy green meals--three to six a day. Snacks will include power
drinks, a handful of almonds or nutrition bars that will be delivered
to clients by messenger.</TE>
<TE>   Described by Time magazine in 1999 as a "cross between Cal Ripken
and a machine that crushes cars," Kirsch will even escort his
Hollywood clients to meals in the days before the Oscar ceremony.
Serving as a menu monitor of sorts, he'll smack the hands of Spacek
or Klum if they reach for anything that has been sauteed, deep fried,
drowned in sauce or drizzled with butter.</TE>
<TE>   He allows no alcohol, no bread, no complex carbohydrates. In other
words, you'll never eat cake in this town again.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the name of the game," says Kirsch, who left a career as a
lawyer in the late 1980s to devote himself to fitness and health.
"But my game isn't a numbers thing. I don't care about the pounds. I
want the person I'm working with to feel better, to have a better
sense of wellness about herself. You can be a size 12 and look
gorgeous and healthy and fit, and you can be a size 2 and have none
of that going on. At the end of the day, it's about finding that
balance in yourself--mind, soul and body."</TE>
<TE>   One of his clients, he explains while munching on roasted chicken
breasts, green beans and half a baked yam at a Koo Koo Roo in the
mid-Wilshire area, has hired him to help her look great in black
Gucci pants for the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "I can do that," he says. "I can make her feel better in those
pants because if she feels better in them, she's gonna look better
too. That's the balance. And that's better than someone telling me,
'I need to lose 5 or 10 pounds in three days,'" which he says he can
help someone accomplish with the right balance of food and rigorous
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   It's wellness that he wants his clients to achieve, as he explains
in his book "Sound Mind, Sound Body" (Rodale Press, 2002). Spacek
rang him up, having heard about him by word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "David is highly motivated and infectious," Spacek says. "His
techniques have been a lifesaver for me and have given me a real
peace of mind, something I think we can all use about now."</TE>
<TE>   Spacek says she had been traveling a lot and not getting enough
sleep. She contacted Kirsch for help. Her energy level was low, and
she wanted to eat better and fit in some workouts even though "I've
been into exercise my whole life, been a runner and been into health
and fitness always."</TE>
<TE>   About six weeks ago she decided to set aside time to learn about
fitness and nutrition with Kirsch. "I'm just a beginner at all this,"
she says, "but so far it's been great--knock on wood. There are no
frills in my plan, but it's been very healthy, and I'm working on my
body."</TE>
<TE>   In town since Wednesday night, Spacek will follow Kirsch's meal
plans and work out with him. Mostly, she'll be eating lots of
spinach, broccoli rab, salads, vegetables and protein such as chicken
and fish that will be broiled, boiled, baked and skinless. The
actress has eliminated bread, pasta and desserts. For snacks she'll
down strawberry and blueberry shakes mixed with whey protein and
mineral water. She'll munch on cantaloupe and honeydew.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a fan of low-carb peanut butter bars, so we'll have some of
that too," Kirsch says. Her daily two-hour workout routine will
include running, push-ups, rowing and treadmill time. "And we'll
throw in some boxing; she loves that," Kirsch adds.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to focus on two areas: her arms and upper body and also
on the lower body. I don't know who's designing her dress or what
it's gonna look like, but she is definitely open to possibilities if
the arms are toned and the butt is nice and tight and the hips are
smaller. So really it's about all those things."</TE>

<HD>Oh, Hush! Depending on the Style, Puppies Are Still Popular</HD>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: Hush Puppies: In or out?</LD>
<LD>   --MY DOGS ARE</LD>
<LD>   BARKING</LD>
<TE>   Dear My: In, if we're talking about some of the brand's newer
retro and casual styles that have done a 180 for the company's image.
Hush Puppies used to be synonymous with fuddy-duddy, and no hip soul
would be caught dead wearing them.</TE>
<TE>   That all changed in the mid-1990s, when the Rockford, Mich.-based
company revamped its line, adding retro lace-up styles in two-tone
colors, in addition to loafers, that became all the rage. They began
showing up on New York runways in collections from John Bartlett and
Anna Sui.</TE>
<TE>   The brand continues to evolve and expand its horizons--there's a
Hush Puppies store in the tony Ginza shopping district in Tokyo.
Today you can find styles for men and women that emphasize comfort
and compete with trendier labels such as Kenneth Cole and Steve
Madden.</TE>
<TE>   The HP 360 line for men includes the Blaze, a slip-on with a thick
contoured sole and sculpted upper in leather or suede that retails
for about $75, and the Lunar, a sleek leather slip-on with side
elastic gores for about $70.</TE>
<TE>   For women there's the Streak, a flexible, sporty clog that sells
for about $65, and the Mega loafer, a cross between a skimmer and an
athletic shoe. That's about $60.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ramey, vice president of global marketing, says for fall,
expect more loafers and two-tone lace-ups, both with square toes.
They're also introducing shoes and boots with a concealed heel--sort
of like lifts.</TE>
<TE>   Hush Puppies has sent pairs of special Swarovski crystal-studded
red and black suede loafers to several Hollywood stylists for their
clients to wear on Oscar night this year (those high heels start
taking a toll after a while). So keep your eyes on the red
carpet--literally.</TE>
<TE>   For those of you who covet the more traditional-looking Hush
Puppies, don't worry--they're still around.</TE>
<TE>   Old styles and new can be found online at www.hushpuppies.com, or
call (800) 545-2425.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I bought a great pair of lightweight wool
pants at Loehmann's. They are unfinished at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   The question: If I get them cuffed, will they look weird by next
winter? I love cuffed pants, but when they're out, they are so out.</TE>
<TE>   --WEARING SKIRTS IN THE</TE>
<TE>   MEANTIME</TE>
<TE>   Dear Wearing: You are so right. The good news is that come fall,
cuffs will be back. They were spotted on runways in New York's recent
fall/winter shows.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, both cuffed and uncuffed pants will be in, but cuffs
were seen on the new wider-leg pants, as well as skinnier pants with
flared bottoms, and on dressy pantsuits as well as casual looks. The
cuffs themselves are getting bigger, starting at 2 inches and going
up.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that, if you do decide to get your pants cuffed, the good
news is that often they can be uncuffed. According to tailors at
Golden Needle Tailoring in Los Angeles, most cuffed trousers can be
made plain again.</TE>
<TE>   However, it does depend on how the cuffs were done in the first
place. So when you consult with your tailor, let him or her know that
you might at some point want to have the cuffs taken out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<DH>Young New York designer Zac Posen is poised to make his
mark in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a kid growing up in New York, Zac Posen loved musical theater and
crooned with a choir every day for 12 years. He always figured he'd
come to Los Angeles to sing, act or direct. The 21-year-old has
finally made it here, but not as an entertainer. Posen is in Los
Angeles as a fashion designer, his creations hot off the catwalks of
Manhattan, where he generated the kind of fashion buzz that Oscar
week produces for Academy Award-nominated stars.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with a rolling suitcase filled with the fierce and feminine
collection he debuted last month, the freshman designer is poised for
a Hollywood Zac attack.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the time to launch myself here, to take L.A. by storm,"
Posen says while setting up shop Wednesday at the Tracey Ross
boutique on Sunset Boulevard. He opens the suitcase to reveal his
ammunition: deep-V-neck gowns, silk and leather bias-cut cocktail
dresses, sleek and sexy halter numbers ready for their red carpet
close-up, Mr. DeMille.</LD>
<TE>   He's hoping the likes of best actress nominee Renee
Zellweger--and, if she's in town, Madonna, his favorite icon--will
honor him by stepping out in one of his sexy numbers. "I'd love to
make clothing for Michael Jackson. I think he's totally nuts," he
adds. But for now he's just thrilled that best supporting actress
nominee Marisa Tomei is interested in wearing one of his creations
for an Academy Awards-related luncheon. And Leelee Sobieski is keen
on a Posen gown for Sunday night's Vanity Fair bash at Morton's
restaurant, where he too will be a party guest. "Wouldn't she look
great in this?" he asks, reaching for a deep-V number. "She'd look
great in anything, but this--this would be incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Ross, who is always searching out unique items for her shop, read
about Posen, met him in New York and then decided that "the week of
the Academy Awards, 'You are coming out here,'" she told the
designer, who is staying in Los Feliz with Vogue's West Coast editor.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night Ross threw a cocktail party for Posen, who was
thrilled to learn that many guests would later attend a party hosted
by Tom Ford at the Gucci store in Beverly Hills. "We're competing
with Tom Ford tonight," Posen says out loud before the party. "So
we've got to give the crowd everything we've got. How about I put a
lineup of mannequins outside, chained together on a red carpet?" Says
a Ross employee: "Zac, you rock!"</TE>
<TE>   A big fan of Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, Ross speaks glowingly
about Posen and "his fabulous silhouettes--fresh, young, beautifully
designed couture-like pieces. Talent like Zac's needs to be exposed.
Besides, I'm such a cheerleader for the underdog."</TE>
<TE>   Smart, charismatic and courteous, Posen has become a darling of
the fashion crowd, and it's easy to see why. At his New York fashion
week show, friends--among them one of the First Twins, Barbara
Bush--often shouted out his name as models paraded the runway in
jumpsuits, a red-hooded raincoat dress and a gown intricately
constructed from strips of brown leather connected by more than 1,000
hand-sewn hooks and eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to stage his first show in February with $20,000
awarded to him from the Ecco Domani Foundation for young designers.
Following that show, he was named one of five finalists in the Enka
International Fashion Design competition, which recognizes rising
stars of the fashion world "with the greatest artistic vision." Among
the judges were designers Donna Karan, Jean Paul Gaultier and Yohji
Yamamoto.</TE>
<TE>   When Posen was in Milan earlier this month for the Italian fashion
shows, he met with Enka officials to discuss using fabrics from one
of the world's leading manufacturers of viscose filament yarn for his
spring/summer 2003 collection. He will also design his own fabrics
and knits. The collection, to be financed by Enka, will be shown in
Milan this fall. A smaller ready-to-wear sportswear line will also be
shown this fall in New York.</TE>
<TE>   If Posen's collection wins, he will be awarded a European press
campaign for his line and will design an Enka collection for at least
three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "After New York, things have just been rolling for me," Posen says
about the interest in his clothes from several stores there and here,
including Barneys New York, Henri Bendel and several specialty shops.
Coming to L.A. was definitely on his radar not only to test the
red-carpet waters but because aside from designer Rick Owens, an
Angeleno, "I haven't seen anything coming out of L.A. that has a
different feel. I want to show L.A. something great."</TE>
<TE>   His cell phone rings. It's his mom calling from their New York
home, where she has been contacting party-givers in L.A. about
getting her son into swanky shindigs. Mom knows only too well that
making the rounds of the Oscar party circuit could pay off handsomely
for her son.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Mom. It's been great," he says. "Everything's fine.
Everyone's taking care of me. OK, I'll talk to you later. I love
you."</TE>
<TE>   After the call, he continues, "My mom is really good with people,
but she's really scary to buyers because even though she's really
sweet, she's also tough. I never thought I would be working with my
mother, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm keeping my head on
straight. That's really important. I'm really a down-to-earth person,
and I'm never gonna lose that. I'm a real person who's planning on
having my company for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Posen established his privately owned company, Outspoke LLC, after
graduating from Central St. Martin's Design School in London in 2001.
While there he started doing private couture work on the side,
selling a dress a week. Back in New York he converted his parents'
SoHo loft into a design studio and, with $10,000 seed money, began
work on his first official collection.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Stephen, is a well-known painter and artist in New
York. His mother, Susan, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer for 22
years, is now chief executive officer of her son's company. His
sister, Alexandra, 29, is his creative director. A master mask maker
who graduated from the Jacques Lecoq School of Theatre in Paris, she
helps her brother produce his shows as well as research and develop
the lines.</TE>
<TE>   Posen says being a fashion designer is something he always wanted
to do. Starting at the age of 3, he created fantasy outfits for his
She-Ra Princess of Power dolls: A piece of seaweed and netting formed
a Spanish flamenco gown; paper doilies were transformed into a
raglan-sleeved kimono.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing it, he was learning about silhouette and form,
about draping and the lines of the human body. During high school he
spent a summer at Parsons School of Design in New York, studying the
techniques needed to draw correctly and execute patterns. He also
interned for three summers and after school at the Costume Institute
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Under then-curator Richard Martin,
he learned the importance of research in fashion--and peeping under
dresses. Posen recalls how he would "lie on my back under Madeleine
Vionnet dresses on exhibit and follow the seams," soaking up as much
as he could about the craft of dressmaking.</TE>
<TE>   And now he finds himself on the floor at Tracey Ross, laying out
his collection, deciding what should go on mannequins. "Sometimes
it's hard to believe this is where I am in my career right now
because, you know, I'm 21."</TE>
<TE>   He's barely old enough to order a cosmopolitan, and just three
days ago his mom "gave me a hard time about driving because I don't."</TE>
<TE>   "I am young, but I'm not naive," he says. His age puts him "in a
unique position" in the industry. It's an advantage, he says, because
he can break from the play-it-safe fashion pack, offering edgy
creations and new silhouettes for women of all ages in a culture he
finds "really sick because so much emphasis is placed on youth."</TE>
<TE>   "I love exploring and finding new ways for women to present
themselves in clothes and the kinds of reaction that gets. That's
what you do when you are making clothing--you study people's
reactions. I'm a student of that--of reaction. I'm also an inventor
who admires inventors like Walt Disney and Jim Henson. And I want to
invent and find my own silhouettes and evolve" much in the same way
that his fashion heroes, Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons and
Azzedine Alaia, have done.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he says, "What I love most about fashion is that I
think fashion is really funny. It's a joke. And you have to take it
really lightly."</TE>

<HD>Our Teacher Is a Giant</HD>
<DH>Part 5 / The story so far: The students in Room 120 have
planned a strike against their substitute teacher, Mr. Thomas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOLORES JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The strike planned by the students of Room 120 against Mr. Thomas
lasted all of 15 seconds. By the time he asked them to open their
reading books to page 52 for the third time, the students raced to do
it. Some of them were so anxious that they dropped their readers,
pens and sometimes themselves to the floor.</LD>
<LD>   "What's the matter?" Mr. Thomas asked. "The principal, who's a
friend of mine, said some of you had a problem with me. Would anybody
like to explain?"</LD>
<LD>   Maria Lopez finally spoke up. "We're scared of you, Mr. Thomas."</LD>
<TE>   "Scared of me?" Mr. Thomas almost looked as if he was going to
cry. "What did I do?"</TE>
<TE>   Billy Ochoa said, "You talk in that really deep voice, and you
never smile!"</TE>
<TE>   Robin Chang said, "You fold your arms and have creases in your
forehead."</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miller said, "And you're so talllll!"</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Thomas said, "I can't help it if I'm tall. I don't mean to
scare you." He sat down in his little chair. "I'm sorry if I don't
smile much, but my favorite teacher, Mrs. Winthrop, always taught me
that there's a time for learning and a time for play. This is my
first teaching job. I guess I'm doing it badly."</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you say that?" Maria asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Mr. Thomas said, "if I were a good teacher, everyone would
be willing to let me try out this new wrestling move I just learned."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Thomas!" the whole class gasped.</TE>
<TE>   "Gotcha!" Mr. Thomas said as he collapsed laughing. "You kids are
going to be a great audience for my silly jokes." And they all
laughed and told jokes for the rest of the afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Allstars Learn From Their Early Mistakes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Black Crowes might be an unusual band for an English dance act to
be compared to, but there were multiple similarities apparent between
the Crowes and England's Lo Fidelity Allstars during the latter's
75-minute set on Wednesday at Vynyl.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the retro appearance and sometimes indulgent jamming, the
two acts have similar career paths. Each came out with an abundance
of hype and an arrogance to match it, and each has been humbled by
commercial disappointment. And each seemingly has become a better
band for it.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly the Allstars' eccentricities, such as the retro style
and the indecipherable banter, were more tolerable without the
attitude. And the crowd was pulling for them.</LD>
<TE>   The six-piece band (including a turntablist) showed off its live
chops early on, following the keyboard-heavy new wave sound of "The
All, the All" with the funk stylings of "Cattleprod," from its
recently released second album, "Don't Be Afraid of Love."</TE>
<TE>   While its playing was impressive, it took the group far too long
to embrace the dance side of its music. When it did, though, the
one-two punch near the end of the warm, inviting techno of "Lo Fi's
in Ibiza" and the fast-paced beats of "Disco Machine Gun" made for a
truly memorable close.</TE>

<HD>Raunch, Dressed in Sentiment</HD>
<DH>'Sorority Boys' proudly, if harmlessly, goes where other
frat-boy comedies have gone before, and transparent attempts at
mushiness are no disguise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of "Sorority Boys" pretty much does tell all. Adam (Michael
Rosenbaum), the social chairman of Kappa Omicron Kappa, and his two
best pals, Dave (Barry Watson) and Doofer (Harland Williams), get
drummed out of their fraternity when they are falsely accused of
misappropriating funds--and wind up taking refuge in drag in the
sorority across the street, Delta Omicron Gamma, home to the campus'
female misfits, which means girls who are rabid feminists, in some
way unattractive or both. Naturally, the fraternity and the sorority
are known by their obvious acronyms.</LD>
<LD>   The pals' foray into drag is part of an elaborate scheme to get
back in the good graces of their fraternity brothers and to expose
the real thief. First-time writers Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge and
director Wally Wolodarsky use the trio's predicament ostensibly to
subject the guys to a little consciousness-raising as to the crude
ways fraternity guys treat coeds. There's also some sentimental
business about the friends seizing the opportunity to build the DOGs'
self-esteem.</LD>
<TE>   This is also a lot of hooey: The makers of "Sorority Boys" have
only one thing sincerely in mind, and that's to revel in as much
tried-and-true frat-boy raunchiness as an R rating will bear. The
result is crass but reasonably harmless, although to hear one of the
guys hold forth on how much he's learned about family and loyalty in
just one week living with the DOGs is enough to make a person gag.</TE>
<TE>   As mushy as the film gets over the strong spirit the DOGs develop
under their new pledges' tutelage, it basically exploits a group of
largely ungainly young women for easy laughs. Among them, alas, is
"Welcome to the Dollhouse's" talented Heather Matarazzo, here asked
little more than to provide a squeaky voice and to make faces.
"Sorority Boys" is best when it sticks to physical comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Ungainly, however, does not apply to the sorority's president,
Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), who is a very pretty and bright but
humorless, doggedly politically correct blond. Even so, mutual
attraction sets in between Leah and Dave's "Daisy," much to the
predictable confusion of the first and the frustration of the second
in the time-honored tradition of drag comedies. Meanwhile, Adam, as
"Adina," is having to fend off the advances of his erstwhile Kappa
Omicron Kappa little brother (Tony Denman) while attempting to get
his hands on a video that will incriminate unctuous house president
Spence (Brad Beyer).</TE>
<TE>   The movie has the requisite abundance of gross-out humor, some of
which draws some laughs. Watson, Rosenbaum and Williams are game, and
costume designer Melinda Eshelman, makeup designer Tommy Cole and
hair designer Donna Gilbert and their teams come up with amusing and
passable drag camouflage for the guys. "Sorority Boys," however, is
best left to the easily pleased.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for crude sexual content, nudity, strong language
and some drug use. Times guidelines: heavy on raunchiness.</TE>

<HD>'Son of the Bride' Faces His Midlife Crises</HD>
<DH>The Oscar-nominated Argentine film is a brisk, involving,
good-humored tale of a man trying to live with his choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Jose Campanella's "Son of the Bride" is a warm and affectionate
Argentine film of wide appeal that is an Academy Award nominee in the
foreign-language category. It stars Ricardo Darin as the 42-year-old
proprietor of an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant, and reunites Hector
Alterio and Norma Aleandro, stars of the 1985 Oscar-winner "The
Official Story," as his parents.</LD>
<LD>   As a child, Darin's Rafael Belvederes loved to imagine he was
Zorro, but in midlife, each day has become more stressful than the
last as he tries to make ends meet in Argentina's unstable economy.
He had incurred his mother's disapproval for refusing to go to law
school and instead choosing to take over the family's Italian
restaurant. Now that he has rescued it from the doldrums and made it
a success--at the cost of his marriage--he cannot win his mother's
blessing because she has been overcome by Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Stress has made him not only irritable but also so self-absorbed
that he becomes increasingly oblivious to the beautiful young woman,
Nati (Natalia Verbeke), who has fallen in love with him. He can talk
only of getting away from everything by running off to Mexico, though
he has no idea what he would do with his life once he got there.
Something's got to give.</LD>
<TE>   Campanella is not interested in plot as much as evoking the
everyday lives of his people and how they interact and affect each
other. The depth of his concern for them and the loving good humor
with which he views them gives his film an infectious emotional
richness. It is clear that Rafael is a good, conscientious man,
dedicated to the business his parents started, and a loving if
distracted father to his young daughter Victoria (Gimena Nobile).
What will it take to get Rafael to take a good look at those closest
to him? He then might be able to support wholeheartedly his father's
all-consuming desire to bestow upon his beloved wife the only thing
he ever denied her: a church wedding.</TE>
<TE>   As central a figure as Rafael is, Campanella is no less concerned
with the others in his life, all of whom are three-dimensional,
likable individuals. The steadfast love his courtly father holds for
his sweet, fading wife is touching to behold, and Rafael's boyhood
pal, Juan Carlos (Eduardo Blanco), a wistful, free-spirited actor of
minuscule success, re-enters his life after a 20-year absence, to
bring him both his own considerable problems but also an unexpected
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Tall, lanky and woebegone, Blanco has a fresh comic presence with
an underlying seriousness. Alterio and Aleandro, who have worked
together a number of times, are icons of Argentina's stage and
screen, and the sheer effortlessness of their work is a pleasure to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Verbeke is luminous, and Darin anchors the film with his engaging
portrayal of Rafael as he works his way through a painful and crucial
turning point in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Although a film of constant talk and little action, "Son of the
Bride" maintains a brisk, buoyant pace and keeps us involved
throughout its two-hour running time. "Son of the Bride" is also one
of the few films among numerous notable Argentine productions to
receive a theatrical release in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: Aside from a few
blunt words, the film is suitable for all ages.</TE>

<HD>FCC Official's Plea Goes Unheeded</HD>
<DH>Despite Easter deadline, call to clean up radio hasn't been
answered. Broadcasters point to their 'Statement of Principles.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusing broadcasters of trolling "the depths of decadence," Federal
Communications Commissioner Michael Copps challenged radio and
television executives in early February to better police themselves
regarding indecency and vulgarity on the airwaves and create a
voluntary code of conduct, all by Easter Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Normally, broadcasters abhor dead air. But with a week to go
before Copps' suggested deadline, their silence has been deafening.</LD>
<LD>   "How I wish the industry would take these ... pleas and warnings,"
said Robert W. Peters, president of Morality in Media, a New
York-based watchdog group founded by a Catholic priest in 1962. If
broadcasters take more responsibility, he said, "the government can
spend its tax dollars on something other than monitoring what goes
out over the airwaves. These pleas have fallen on deaf ears."</LD>
<TE>   Actually, some of the problems Copps complained about may have
been ebbing even before he spoke out. On Thursday, the Center for
Media and Public Affairs, a Washington nonpartisan group, announced
findings suggesting that sexual material on television fell by 29%
from the 1998-99 season to the 2000-01 season, and serious violence
dropped 17% in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Radio, however, has been another matter. In fact, in the six weeks
since Copps made his request, an Alaska court fined Tom Leykis'
distributor $150,000 after the talk-radio host mocked and criticized
a female listener on the air; the FCC upheld a $14,000 fine against a
DJ in Chicago who goes by the name Mancow, after he allegedly made
lewd comments during an interview with strippers; and a Florida DJ
was acquitted of animal cruelty charges after a pig was castrated on
his show.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the phenomenon of shock jocks is still out there," Peters
said.</TE>
<TE>   Copps charged that the shock-jock mentality has moved from
late-night talk shows to broadcasting's corporate boardrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Broadcasters insists that it has not been
ignoring Copps.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear him loud and clear," the group's spokesman, Dennis
Wharton, said. "We appreciate the commissioner's honest and heartfelt
concerns on the issue. When a commissioner speaks out on the issue of
broadcast programming, we take notice."</TE>
<TE>   The group has not taken a position on Copps' recommendation,
Wharton said, in part because the lobbying group already has a
"Statement of Principles" that urges broadcasters to avoid exploiting
violence, glamorizing drug use, and airing sexual material that
"panders to prurient or morbid interests."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters did have a code of conduct, in various forms, from
the 1920s until 1983. But it was the federal government that made
them get rid of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department sued the association in 1979, saying
provisions of the code violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The
government alleged that the code's restrictions on commercials were
actually a scheme by broadcasters to collude and drive up advertising
rates.</TE>
<TE>   When those narrow provisions for commercials were outlawed, Copps
said, the industry abandoned the entire code, even though it
"affirmed broadcaster responsibilities toward children, community
issues and public affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Wharton, however, contends that the new "Statement of Principles"
is "as tough or tougher than the code of conduct."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of last year, Copps and fellow commissioner Kathleen
Abernathy asked radio companies to begin taping and archiving their
broadcasts, or at least keeping voluntary transcripts, to make it
easier to investigate indecency complaints filed by the public. Some
commissioners have long complained that the FCC's rules on obscenity
and indecency place too much burden on listeners to police the
airwaves, requiring them to provide a tape or transcript of any
objectionable programming, as well as the station, date and time,
before the agency would investigate a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Only a couple of radio conglomerates agreed to begin taping or
said they were already doing so; most others ignored the suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   In Copps' challenge last month, issued in an opinion piece in USA
Today, he also warned broadcasters that the government might step in
if they continued their "race to the bottom," trying to out-duel each
other's basest offerings.</TE>
<TE>   It's certainly not the first time the FCC has threatened
broadcasters. In 1938, after Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds"
adaptation panicked listeners who didn't realize the Martian invasion
was a Halloween radio show, the FCC chairman at the time said
government intervention was likely if the industry didn't police
itself.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, members of Congress--including Sen. Joe Lieberman
(D-Conn.) and others--attacked the entertainment and video-game
industries for their violent and profane products. Attempts at
legislating conduct, however, have fizzled out. Lieberman's bill,
which would have imposed heavy fines on entertainment companies who
violated their own voluntary guidelines, went nowhere after music
companies declined to draw up guidelines and the movie industry
threatened to abandon its ratings system.</TE>
<TE>   "That's always a very fine line you walk when you deal with this,
of government getting involved in programming decisions," Wharton
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Peters, a balance needs to be struck between free
speech and artistic expression on one side and the maintenance of a
decent society and safe environment for children on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not necessary to serious communication. The impact on free
speech is minimal, when you think about it," he said, adding that
he's not saying such language should be forbidden, only restricted to
certain times and contexts.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have some appreciation for the concept of a community
standard," Peters said. Even with the tepid reception that greeted
Copps' proposal, one FCC staffer said he would continue hammering
away at the issue. Violence and profanity will certainly be addressed
in two weeks when the National Assn. of Broadcasters holds its annual
convention, which all the members of the FCC are scheduled to attend.
In fact, one seminar for broadcasters is titled "Managing the Risks
of Today's Controversial Programming," while another will feature
Copps and fellow FCC Commissioner Kevin Martin under the heading,
"The Regulatory Face-off."</TE>

<CX>   Radio penalty--A story in Friday's Calendar about indecency on the
radio incorrectly gave the impression that a financial penalty levied in
an Alaska civil suit against the distributor of the syndicated Tom Leykis
talk show was the result of comments Leykis made on the air. In fact, a
jury ordered the company, Westwood One, to pay $150,000 to the plaintiff
for having failed to turn over a broadcast tape requested as evidence.
The jury ruled against the plaintiff on charges that Leykis' comments
about her had caused her emotional distress and violated her privacy.</CX>

<DH>'Cheval,' the acrobatic equestrian circus now at the Orange
County Fairgrounds, achieves an intense unity between human and
animal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's love at first sight. He's tall and long-legged, with a long,
thick mane. Having spotted him through the crowd, you walk up to
introduce yourself--and nearly melt when he focuses those big, dark
eyes on you.</LD>
<LD>   This scenario plays out again and again as crowds pass through the
entrance tent at the equestrian spectacular "Cheval." The path leads
through stalls where the equine performers await their entrances, and
the magnificent animals--serene, majestic, drop-dead gorgeous--exert
an almost magnetic pull.</LD>
<LD>   They're still more stunning in action: One circles the performance
ring while an acrobat uses its back like a pommel horse to perform
gymnastics. Another dances the flamenco with castanets tied to its
front legs. Four of them circle the ring, shoulder to shoulder, while
standing riders form a human pyramid on their backs, like a stunt in
a water-skiing exhibition.</LD>
<TE>   Conceived by Cirque du Soleil co-founder Gilles Ste-Croix,
"Cheval" (French for "horse") is the latest French Canadian
theatrical circus to reach the Southland, in performances at the
Orange County Fair and Exposition Center in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Like a Cirque du Soleil show, it is fully costumed and
choreographed--performed to live music in a single ring under a big
top.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while Cirque has always, emphatically been humans-only,
"Cheval" depends on an intense connection between human and animal.
Remember trying to train your dog to shake hands, or your pony to
jump over a low fence? Multiply that by about 70 billion, and you
have the level achieved by these trainers and their horses. For the
acrobatic acts, in particular, horses and humans must move in perfect
partnership, in a predictable, steady rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The "Cheval" acts are showier than the traditional equestrian
arts, but they're built upon the basics of such disciplines as
dressage (carefully trained movements, born long ago of battlefield
maneuvers) and garotcha (in which the rider carries a long pole,
evolved from use in cattle sorting, to center the horse's movements).</TE>
<TE>   Steady, dependable animals such as Percheron draft horses, bred to
work in the fields, are used for the vaulting acts, in which an
acrobat may be flipping from one horseback onto another. The
equestrian ballets performed at liberty, or riderless, with the
horses responding to voice commands, are performed by friskier
breeds, such as the Andalusian.</TE>
<TE>   But you needn't know an Andalusian from an appaloosa to enjoy
"Cheval." The horses are poetry in motion, and the two-footed
performers are, basically, superhuman. Their achievement explains
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Donnert and Anita Fuzy pass three, then five juggling pins
between one another while standing atop a pair of horses that trail
one another, Donnert traveling backward so that he faces Fuzy.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Olissio and Matt Zamperla Zoppe execute breathtaking
vaults, culminating in Matt doing a back-flip off of Olissio's
shoulders and landing on the backs of a pair of trailing horses.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the center of the ring, Caroline Williams directs six
sleek Andalusians in an equine ballet, commanding pairs of them to
partner off for synchronized pirouettes. She is miked so the audience
can hear her steady patter of commands, spoken in a multilingual
patois that makes generous use of the French "allez" (let's go).</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a red coat with a long, flowing skirt, Stephane Simon, on
horseback, directs his misty gray Andalusian to perform the
flamenco-like number, to the band's sultry, Spanish-sounding
accompaniment (the original music is by Bernard Poirier).</TE>
<TE>   Clowns Voki Kalfayan and Christian Ferland cut up between acts,
trying to mimic what they've just seen, sometimes using a hobbyhorse,
sometimes a real one.</TE>
<TE>   Amusement mixes with awe as Ferland tries to mount a
Hispano-Arabian gelding named Bohemio. Ferland hikes one leg onto the
horse's back but can't climb any higher, so Bohemio helps out by
kneeling, then lying all the way down. Now Ferland can climb aboard,
but Bohemio, practical jokester that he is, decides to play dead.
Ferland tries to wrestle the horse upright, but Bohemio remains
utterly, placidly unmovable, while his eyes seem to flash with
merriment.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the audience exits back through the stalls, with many
people stopping for a last, longing look at Bohemio and his handsome
buddies.</TE>

<HD>NBC, Telemundo Making News Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As networks explore ways to get more mileage out of their news
divisions, NBC is charting ambitious plans for integrating its
operations with those of Telemundo, the U.S.' second-largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, after the anticipated completion of its
$2.7-billion acquisition next month.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides have been meeting regularly to determine where
cooperation is possible, hoping to help Telemundo take on
Spanish-language ratings leader Univision while extending NBC's
resources on the U.S.-Mexican border and in Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the language barrier and other issues, the network news
operations can find only limited ways to share.</LD>
<TE>   Viewers will see the biggest difference at many of Telemundo's TV
stations, which will add local news programming if they don't already
have it.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, where Telemundo's KVEA-TV does offer local news,
one option under consideration is pooling the station's resources
with KNBC-TV to operate from a single facility, said Ramon Escobar,
the MSNBC executive overseeing the news integration process for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly a third of Telemundo's correspondents in the Caribbean and
Latin America speak English well enough to appear on NBC, Escobar
said, providing NBC News an expanded presence in the region. The idea
of airing translated versions of each other's stories has been
largely rejected, although the two sides are talking about joint
projects with separate interviews and shared video.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't assimilate to the point where each side loses its
identity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo correspondents such as Jose Diaz-Balart, who previously
worked at CBS News, are more likely to appear on NBC than vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few NBC correspondents--including MSNBC's Rick Sanchez, who
went to the cable network from a local station in Miami--speak
Spanish well enough to file on-air reports for Telemundo, executives
say.</TE>
<TE>   Other hurdles  include dealing with different union contracts and
fear among Telemundo employees that they will be treated as
second-class citizens, and accommodating different newsroom cultures.
Even little details, such as the practice in some Telemundo newsrooms
of regularly delivering cups of espresso to employees' desks, have
come into play.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the savings NBC derives from its cable news channel MSNBC,
the financial benefits on the network side will be limited to
combining some bureaus and possibly sharing camera people or
satellite time when, say, the pope visits Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Like NBC, Telemundo provides a good deal of network news,
including three hours in the morning, a one-hour afternoon
newsmagazine, a half-hour nightly newscast and a prime-time
newsmagazine, while operating at a fraction of NBC News' annual
budget.</TE>
<TE>   When Escobar was an executive producer at Telemundo's New York
station, he said, he had to cover the community with a single truck
that could transmit live. NBC plans to make sure the Telemundo
stations have more live trucks, which he called "a huge tool to go
into communities where we need to be. If we're going to be
hyper-local, we've got to be out where things are happening.... We
really want Telemundo to be a news destination, and we will make news
a big priority.''</TE>

<HD>What Nash's 'Beautiful Mind' Really Accomplished</HD>
<DH>The subject of the best picture nominee won a Nobel Prize
for his theory explaining economic decisions as a 'game.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL A. GRECH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was a Princeton undergraduate from 1995 to 1999, professor
John Forbes Nash Jr., the subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind,"
was a shadow figure in a knit cap who haunted the Fine Hall math
department. Nash sightings--at the Dinky train station, in the Small
World coffee shop, on his slowly looping bicycle rides--were a
regular pastime.</LD>
<LD>   We called Nash the "Phantom of Fine Hall"--he had stopped teaching
by that point--and whispered in wonder that this aging man in goggle
eyeglasses and faded Jack Purcell shoes had won a Nobel Prize for
economics.</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind" is bringing deserved mainstream recognition for
Nash's long struggle to overcome schizophrenia. But moviegoers will
leave the film with little sense of Nash's mathematical genius, save
knowing that his contribution to modern economics can help pick up a
girl at a bar.</LD>
<TE>   It is axiomatic in mathematics that genius blossoms early, and so
students entering Princeton's math department, one of the world's
best, are seeking the next great insight. As rendered in "A Beautiful
Mind," when prodigy Nash arrived at Princeton, he searched for
patterns in pigeons' pecking. Nash found his stroke of genius at age
21 in a 27-page dissertation on game theory that would fundamentally
revolutionize modern economics and eventually win him a Nobel.</TE>
<TE>   Before Nash, economists studied markets using sophisticated
versions of Adam Smith's price theory--basic supply and demand. Smith
said that as buyers and sellers pursue their self-interest, the
"invisible hand" of the market distributes products efficiently. But
price theory can't explain the abundant real-world examples of market
inefficiency. Nash approached this problem by reformulating economics
as a game.</TE>
<TE>   To most people, a game is a way to while away a rainy afternoon.
But to mathematicians, a game is not simply chess or poker, but any
conflict situation that forces participants to develop a strategy to
accomplish a goal. To mathematicians, a game is a regimented world
where math is king. And a game can be a window to mathematical
insight.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a student, every afternoon, Princeton math professors
collected in the third-floor lounge for tea and a round of
backgammon. John Conway, a math professor, told us in one lecture
that he stumbled on the discovery of a lifetime while studying Go, an
ancient board game played with smooth stones.</TE>
<TE>   Nash's central insight, the one for which he won a Nobel Prize in
1994, was to prove that every economic game has an equilibrium
point--that is, an approach to play in which no player would choose
to change his strategy. If a player were to try to change his Nash
equilibrium strategy, he would end up worse off than before.</TE>
<TE>   Nash showed that even complicated games have an equilibrium point.
He proved that participants in complex economic situations tend
toward a specific, secure strategy, and he provided an elegant
mathematical framework for figuring out that strategy. That
apparently simple insight transformed game theory from an abstract
subset of mathematics to a powerful new approach to the study of
economic decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Nash built on previous insights, particularly those of John von
Neumann, another brilliant and brash mathematician who was a
professor at the Institute for Advanced Study near Princeton when
Nash was a graduate student.</TE>
<TE>   (A brief note here on eccentricity and math genius--the two seem
to go together. I recall my first class with Conway, a rumpled man in
loose jeans who brushed aside the classroom door and flung off his
sandals, which smacked against the wall. Barefoot, he turned to the
blackboard and began writing equations, pausing only to survey his
work with a mumble or wipe chalk handprints on his jeans. Fifty
minutes later, Conway put down his chalk, put on his sandals and
walked out. That was our first lecture ever as Princeton freshmen.
Half the class had dropped out by the next lecture.)</TE>
<TE>   Like the shoe-shucking Conway, Von Neumann was an eccentric
instructor. Instead of using the whole blackboard, Von Neumann would
write an equation, then immediately erase it and write another as
students frantically took notes. "Proof by erasure," his students
called it.</TE>
<TE>   The same year Nash was born, 1928, Von Neumann showed that in
simple games like checkers or football, where one player's gain is
the other's loss, rational players will tend toward a strategy that
even in a worst-case scenario, guarantees a minimum gain or caps a
potential loss. That translates to conservative play--to a brand of
football in which teams prefer the extra point to the two-point
conversion and always punt on fourth and inches.</TE>
<TE>   So how would this theory play out in the real world? Here's an
example taught in classes:</TE>
<TE>   Two gas stations are being built in a small town made up of a
single, one-mile long Main Street. Town planners agree that the gas
stations should be placed at one-quarter and three-quarter mile
marks, so that no one in town has to drive more than a quarter mile
to fill up. And since residents are distributed evenly along Main
Street, both stations would share exactly half the business in town.</TE>
<TE>   But try explaining that to the station owners. The owner who
should build at the one-quarter mile mark knows people at his end of
town will never go to the competing station because it's too far
away. So he'd want to build closer to the center of town to dip into
his competitor's mid-town market. Of course, the other owner is
equally wily and he too edges his station closer to the center of
town. Game theory tells us--and an astute business sense
dictates--that the two gas stations will both end up on the same
corner in the exact center of Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   The equilibrium solution of the gas station game is clearly not
the most efficient. While the stations still share half the town's
business, people on the edge of town have to drive farther to get gas
than under the town planners' solution. But neither owner would have
it any other way, because being in the center of town is the most
secure solution for each. This equilibrium is an example of free
market inefficiency--and a critique of Adam Smith's invisible hand.</TE>
<TE>   When Von Neumann first heard Nash's ideas, he told Nash they were
"trivial"--the math world's harshest put-down. But over the years,
even as Nash dropped math in his struggle with schizophrenia, his
ideas took hold. These days, Nash-style strategic thinking can be
found everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Consider America's nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union. Each
superpower could have disarmed or stockpiled a nuclear arsenal. To
decide, the U.S. considered what the Russians might do. If they
armed, the U.S. needed to arm as well to defend itself.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Soviet Union disarmed, the U.S. would rather arm itself
anyway to achieve a strategic advantage over its enemy. The Soviet
Union's thinking ran the same way, and both countries settled on a
policy of mutually assured destruction. Despite pacifists'
complaints, a nuclear standoff turned out to be the most stable and
secure solution--the Cold War's Nash equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Conway taught us that math is not the sawdust we learned
in grade school, but a passionate, and personal, subject. One class,
he told us that while searching for patterns in Go, he discovered
surreal numbers: an entirely new class of numbers able to express the
infinitely small and infinitely large with an unprecedented
specificity. That semester, Conway taught us that the thing in math
is the search--whether it is the pecking of pigeons or the placement
of Go stones.</TE>
<TE>   For, as Nash and Conway both prove, you never know what you might
find.</TE>

reporter at the Miami Herald.</TE>

<HD>Linda Eder's at Her Best Going Beyond Broadway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Eder is best known for her starring role in the Broadway
musical "Jekyll &amp; Hyde." But with six solo albums, it's obvious that
her skills reach well beyond the musical theater.</LD>
<LD>   Her performance at the Wiltern Theatre on Wednesday before a
fervently enthusiastic full house was the work of an artist with an
engaging manner and a witty sense of humor. Far from needing a
theatrical characterization in which to display her abilities, Eder
confidently dominated the stage with her performing persona.</LD>
<LD>   Interestingly, she was at her best with material that was far from
Broadway, including Boz Scaggs' "We're All Alone" and the Dusty
Springfield hit "Son of a Preacher Man." Her success with songs of
this sort undoubtedly relates to the fact that they do not demand
over-the-top, big-voiced, high-note belting--not always the most
appealing aspect of Eder's singing.</LD>
<TE>   Too much of her program, however, was devoted to the songs of
Frank Wildhorn, which is understandable, perhaps, given that
Wildhorn, the composer of "Jekyll &amp; Hyde" as well as "The Scarlet
Pimpernel" and "The Civil Wars," is Eder's husband.</TE>
<TE>   A showcase number from "Jekyll &amp; Hyde," for example, was sung in
effectively theatrical fashion, but it tended to serve as the
template for other Eder-Wildhorn collaborations, many of which
overemphasized the opportunity to display Eder's upper range.</TE>
<TE>   That range emerged in two distinct manners: piercing,
shatter-the-crystal intensity and sweet-toned, sotto voce tenderness.
The former was predictably crowd-pleasing, with Eder frequently
reverting to the climactic drama of her youthful appearances on "Star
Search." Her softer-voiced high notes, on the other hand, were
irresistible. She would do well to use them more often.</TE>
<TE>   Although Eder has often been called a Barbra Streisand wannabe,
her style seemed less comparable to Streisand's than to Celine Dion's
and Bernadette Peters'. But before she can unleash the full extent of
her own musicality, Eder needs to find songs and interpretations
that--like her onstage manner--offer a deeper, more diverse emotional
range.</TE>

<LD>What is in a word?</LD>
<LD>   In a coming episode of Fox's highly original new comedy "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe," our genial protagonist is having
regular euphoric sex with the kind of great-looking blond who
normally doesn't give him a tumble, only to learn that she is a
bigot.</LD>
<LD>   When she tells him she took a phone call for him while he was in
the bathroom, he asks her who it was. "I don't know," she replies.
"Some Jew."</LD>
<TE>   Sweet, likable Andy is crushed. But what to do? Does he heed his
raging libido and keep seeing her or obey his inner outrage and break
it off? Wanting to give her the benefit of the doubt for self-serving
reasons, he devises an ingenious ethnic food test that he hopes
she'll pass. But no. "Those Jews are so cheap," she says, "they don't
even give you the middle of the bagel."</TE>
<TE>   The laugh comes not from the line but from what it produces:
Andy's obvious dilemma, one stemming from the inner struggle between
his moral sense and his anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   Jew!</TE>
<TE>   "You say it a million times, it's the only word that never loses
its meaning," says Danny Balint, the self-loathing Jewish skinhead in
"The Believer," which just aired on Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Jewboy is the operative affront. Only anti-Semites like
Balint would argue that "Jew" alone is an epithet, in contrast to
"nigger," a two-syllable insult so volcanic that this and other
newspapers are skittish about printing it even as part of a
discussion, preferring the code "N-word" instead.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast networks are becoming less and less reticent when it
comes to language in prime time, mostly for the purpose of
gratuitously matching cable's raunch, but also occasionally opening
important doors to dialogue and understanding that earlier were
padlocked shut.</TE>
<TE>   The N-word, for example, is addressed in a high-minded episode of
"Boston Public" that Fox says it is repeating Monday because its Feb.
25 premiere yielded such a large, positive response from viewers.</TE>
<TE>   What is in a word? In this case, hundreds of years of aching
history.</TE>
<TE>   Slavery ... segregation ... flaming crosses ... firebombs ...
bodies swinging from trees.</TE>
<TE>   Those grotesque images are painful shards that fly from the
N-word, even when it's famously used for effect by respected U.S.
literati, from Mark Twain to Carl Sandburg. It's a word more jarring
and wounding, arguably, than slurs aimed at Jews, Asians, Latinos,
Italians, gays, women, you name it.</TE>
<TE>   At least when the source is nonblack.</TE>
<TE>   Which is the essence of Monday's "Boston Public," written by
whites (the series has no black writers) John J. Sakmar, Sean
Whitesell, Kerry Lenhart and series creator David E. Kelley. It comes
a year after the recently departed "Any Day Now" stripped down the
N-word in a notable double-length episode on Lifetime, stating it 61
times but never to shock, while affirming that TV's reputation for
timidity in taking on hot-button issues is not always deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "What other word has as much power?" asked the attorney on "Any
Day Now" when defending a black teen on trial for fatally striking a
white youth who had taunted him with the N-word after a basketball
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Boston Public" asks about the same question, but instead of
putting the word itself under a microscope, it looks mostly at the
debate over who, if anyone, has the moral right to use it. And in
what context?</TE>
<TE>   It opens with a hallway fight erupting when black Andrae (Aldlo
Hodge) objects to a white classmate, Jordan (Stuart Stone), using the
word in a friendly way to address his black pal, J.T. (DeJuan Guy),
as he would use "dude" in casual conversation. Their white teacher,
Danny Hanson (Michael Rapaport), breaks up the fight, then urges his
class to "talk ... about what just happened" in order to hack away
the word's terrible "power."</TE>
<TE>   Yet just as a Jew can say "Jewboy" facetiously without offending,
and those with physical disabilities will jokingly label themselves
"gimps," as sometimes happens, it's not uncommon for some blacks to
call one another the N-word.</TE>
<TE>   "But whites can't?" asks an incredulous Jordan in class.</TE>
<TE>   "If a white man uses the word, it puts us down," responds Hodge as
Andrae, swiping every scene he's in with his seething presence.</TE>
<TE>   There are the usual parallel plots here, one involving a homeless
girl and another focusing on that aging irritant, teacher Harvey
Lipschultz (Fyvush Finkel), who puts the kibosh on a student's
application to Amherst and later asks, "Is it time for me to quit?"
Yes, YES!!!!!! It has nothing to do with chronological age, only with
his growing confusion and urge to pass on his biases to students.</TE>
<TE>   But the N-word is this episode's emotional centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   When black teacher Marla Hendricks (Loretta Devine) learns that
Hanson has deployed the word repeatedly in a class discussion, she is
infuriated and won't be assuaged. "No teacher should use that word
anywhere, anyplace, especially a white teacher," she protests to
sympathetic principal Steven Harper (Chi McBride), who is also black.
"White people haven't earned the right to say that word," she argues.</TE>
<TE>   All of this sets up a confrontation between Harper and Hanson that
endangers the teacher's job, even though his talk-about-it strategy
seems quite sane and admirable in Monday's volatile milieu, whose
frames of reference range from black comic Chris Rock's incendiary
but funny N-word monologue to Harvard scholar Randall Kennedy's book,
"Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."</TE>
<TE>   The episode has its own troubles, ending very badly by appearing
to reinforce the batty notion that whites are, indeed, disqualified
from hashing over the N-word even in an academic setting. But it's a
noble effort that declines the protection of euphemisms and easy
answers, while pounding another nail into the coffin of a former TV
taboo.</TE>
<TE>   "Boston Public" airs Monday nights at 8 on Fox. The network has
rated next week's episode TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young
children, with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Networks Shopping Their News</HD>
<DH>Television* In an effort to defray costs, the major
broadcasters are finding new homes for their coverage on several
cable outlets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips went on a recent trip to
cover elections in Zimbabwe and other stories in Africa, the network
got its money's worth out of him, airing his reports on "The Early
Show" and "CBS Evening News" as well as an upcoming segment for
"Sunday Morning."</LD>
<LD>   Still, Phillips' work didn't stop there. He also reported for "BET
Nightly News," the newscast CBS just began co-producing with African
American-targeted cable channel BET, which was acquired last year by
CBS owner Viacom.</LD>
<LD>   Media consolidation has fueled serious concerns that television
news is becoming less of a priority in ever-larger conglomerates more
focused on profits than public service. The Walt Disney Co.'s recent
willingness to displace "Nightline" if it was able to lure comedian
David Letterman from CBS provoked a new round of worries that network
news faces an uncertain future.</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, network news divisions are also finding
hidden opportunities in consolidation, eyeing sister outlets as
potential homes for programming that can help defray costs and
support the infrastructure needed for shows such as "CBS Evening
News." For a network such as CBS--which, unlike NBC, doesn't have a
related cable news channel--such productions can be particularly
important, media analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   BET already had a newscast before Viacom acquired it, but both
sides saw benefits from a co-production. The program, anchored by
Jacque Reid, has its own correspondents and producers; still, as of
last month, it began originating from a set at CBS in New York, with
CBS News and local TV reporters appearing regularly and providing the
program a stronger national presence.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to BET, CBS is also hoping to produce news for UPN,
another Viacom network, whose management was recently consolidated
under CBS. "They know we're very interested in doing something if we
can," CBS News President Andrew Heyward said. There have also been
limited joint productions with Viacom's MTV and VH1 channels, both of
which have news units, and MTV piggybacked on CBS for production
services at the 2000 national political conventions.</TE>
<TE>   These latest outside productions represent an extension of
divisions the three elder networks put in place during the last
decade, originally to squeeze extra money out of their archives by
repackaging them for cable, which desperately needs inexpensive
programming. But with entities like the Travel Channel having only so
much money for old episodes of Charles Kuralt's "On the Road" series,
the networks soon realized there was more money to be made in more or
less original productions.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Channels Become Frequent Customers</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;E's "Biography" series, for example, has a large appetite for
episodes produced by ABC, NBC and CBS, which often use existing
footage augmented by new material. The History Channel, Court TV,
Lifetime, the Food Network, TLC and Discovery Health are also
frequent customers. The list gets longer all the time, with ABC
developing a series for movie channel AMC and talking about another
with women's network WE.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, these productions have become increasingly elaborate,
expanding on footage broadcast on the network. ABC News' six-hour
summer documentary "Hopkins 24/7," about Johns Hopkins Medical
Center, was reworked into a 10-hour series for Discovery Health.
Similarly, Steve Kroft's 13-minute report on the 1970 Tucson Pioneer
Hotel fire in early March for CBS' "60 Minutes" was accompanied by a
one-hour version for Court TV.</TE>
<TE>   With news divisions watching every penny, the jockeying for such
deals has become highly competitive--especially with other players,
such as New York Times Television, aggressively entering the
business. NBC News, for example, replaced ABC News as the producer of
a since-canceled science newscast for Discovery but won't discuss
other productions, citing competitive concerns. "In general, one is
always looking over one's shoulder,'' said Lisa Zeff, executive
producer and general manager of ABC Productions.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, arrangements with sister networks have become all the
more important. CBS News has also branched out by producing specials
for the entertainment division, including three related to the series
"Survivor'' in addition to helping two French filmmakers edit their
Sept. 11 terrorist attack footage into the high-rated two-hour
presentation "9/11." That project didn't carry a CBS News label
because it raised money for scholarships, which is against news
division policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a small business for now, but we're hoping it will become
much larger,'' NBC News President Neal Shapiro said. "I don't think
these outside productions save 'Nightly News,' which is profitable on
its own, but all news divisions are stretched covering a war they
never thought they'd have to cover and the extra millions of dollars
[these shows contribute] to the budget are of course valuable.''</TE>
<TE>   In fact, executives at ABC News' "Nightline" have viewed outside
co-production deals with places such as PBS' "Frontline" as crucial
to the show's bottom line, allowing it to produce series that it
couldn't afford otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the financial incentives, news executives also say the
benefits can extend beyond the bottom line. "Even though [the
newscast] is branded BET and not CBS, it's a way for us to reach out
to a critical part of the audience that sometimes feels underserved
by mainstream news," Heyward said.</TE>
<TE>   "And at the same time, it will allow us to tap into stories and
sources we sometimes don't have access to."</TE>

<HD>Drama in the Filmmaking, Not the Film</HD>
<DH>'Stolen Summer' is not as watchable as 'Project
Greenlight,' the HBO program that captured its bumpy production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How feeble a movie is "Stolen Summer"? So feeble they've just about
buried the title on the film's own poster. By far the biggest letters
go to "the Project Greenlight movie" and the tagline "You saw the
back-stabbing. Now see the final cut." Don't even think about it.</LD>
<LD>   Project Greenlight is the name given to an online screenwriting
competition thought up by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and their producing
partner Chris Moore. The winner would get $1 million to make a
feature, with Miramax Films agreeing to distribute the finished
project. Oh, yes, and an HBO camera crew would be on hand to record
everything that went on during the shoot.</LD>
<LD>   The resulting 12-part "Project Greenlight" series turned out to be
a compulsively watchable word-of-mouth hit for HBO, as viewers were
fascinated by the mishaps and tribulations of contest winner and
first-time director Pete Jones.</LD>
<TE>   But while the series was rife with emotion, drama and, yes,
back-stabbing, the inert and dispiriting film that resulted has none
of the above. It's enough to put you in mind of Oscar Wilde's line
about putting his genius into his life and only his talent into his
work, except that if Pete Jones has any talent, he's managed to keep
it hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, Jones comes off in the HBO series as such an earnest guy
it's difficult to say bad things about him. It feels deeply unfair to
have selected such a clueless naif, someone whose movie experience
was limited to working as a production assistant, to direct a film
from his own script, no matter how much he wanted to. In fact,
watching "Stolen Summer" makes one question the entire Project
Greenlight process, starting with the notion that anyone off the
street is fit to write and direct a motion picture if only they want
it badly enough. Clearly, this is not the case. Be careful what you
wish for; be very, very careful.</TE>
<TE>   It also strains credulity to believe that this mawkish script,
which makes the average after-school special play like vintage John
Waters, was the best of the more than 7,300 submitted. (And if it
was, way too many people have way too much spare time.) Watching
"Project Greenlight" and "Stolen Summer" raises the possibility that
Jones and his work were selected because his personal qualities would
make him the perfect lamb to be led to the slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what we have here, as capable actors like Aidan Quinn,
Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Pollak and Brian Dennehy (as a kindly old padre)
end up looking lost and listless as they struggle to overcome the
film's numbing lassitude.</TE>
<TE>   Set in Chicago in 1976, "Stolen Summer" reeks of dime-store
ecumenicism. Featuring an Irish Catholic boy determined to convert
his Jewish friend to the true faith so he can get into heaven, it has
something of the flavor of vintage Sunday morning TV shows like "Lamp
Unto My Feet."</TE>
<TE>   Cherubic 8-year-old Pete O'Malley (Adi Stein, apparently the son
of a rabbi in real life) has decided to devote the summer between the
second and third grade to a "quest" that will convince the nuns who
teach at his parochial school that he is not going to hell. If that
sounds dicey, you have no idea.</TE>
<TE>   Pete is one of eight children in a typically boisterous Irish
movie family run by father Joe (Quinn), a good-hearted if
hot-tempered lout of a fireman, and mother Margaret (Hunt), who
juggles all those kids with firm good humor and sass in her voice. At
first, the only Jew Pete manages to meet is Rabbi Jacobson (Pollak),
who is initially impressed by the boy's determination. The two
families get closer when Pete's dad rescues the rabbi's son Danny
(Mike Weinberg) from a major fire. Naturally, Pete decides to convert
the surprisingly willing Danny, but since he has no idea what
conversion actually entails, he comes up with a cockamamie athletic
decathlon as a substitute.</TE>
<TE>   As if this wasn't screwy enough, "Stolen Summer" throws in angry
family disputes (Joe doesn't want his eldest son to go to college)
and a disease of the week, in this case leukemia for poor put-upon
Danny. All this despite the fact that the film's touch with serious
material is worse than its feeling for the whimsical.</TE>
<TE>   Unconvincing and contrived from start to finish, "Stolen Summer"
would never have had a prayer of being made except for Project
Greenlight. When co-producer Affleck is quoted at the beginning of
the HBO series saying "this may be a grand catastrophe," he likely
had no idea how prophetic a statement that would be. Or did he?</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for thematic elements and language. Times
guidelines: A child's death factors into the plot.</TE>

<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm meet those of contemporary art in
the sculpture of German artist Stephan Balkenhol--and why not? All
three spent their formative teen years in the once-lovely, now gritty
town of Kassel. Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) Grimm are
local heroes. For Balkenhol, 45, Kassel meant youthful immersion in
Documenta 4, the legendary exhibition of Post-Minimal and Conceptual
art that galvanized many who saw it.</LD>
<LD>   At Regen Projects, Balkenhol's latest batch of carved wood
sculpture is dominated by "Big Man &amp; Small Man," a two-part work
abutting a wall. As with all his titles, this one is a blunt
description that slowly turns into an enigma.</LD>
<LD>   The bigger man--standing on his floor-bound pedestal, he's 8 feet
tall--looks slightly younger than the smaller man, who's diminutive
at just over 41/2 feet. The smaller figure is hung high on the wall,
which yields two disconcerting effects: His head is on about the same
level as that of the bigger man, who looks over his shoulder at him,
and, visually, the smaller man recedes in space, as if he's off in
the distance and the bigger man is up close.</LD>
<TE>   Where does that locate the viewer? You find yourself navigating
the room in search of a comfortable place to stand in relation to
these figures; the sculpture might be anchored to the wall, but it
keeps you moving. Balkenhol plays with perception of scale in ways
that physically disorient your body. Never life-size, his sculptures
of people nonetheless get under your skin.</TE>
<TE>   Six sculptures, three carved reliefs and two drawings (white
crayon on sheets of wood painted black) make up this show of new
work, Balkenhol's fourth at the gallery. As always, the sculptures
are roughly but elegantly chiseled from rectangular blocks of wood
and painted in flat, uninflected color. The method might be
folkloric, but the art certainly isn't. The men wear nondescript
uniforms of urban modernity: white shirt, black pants, brown shoes.
Sophisticated totems, they're closer in style and feeling to the
paintings of Alex Katz than to the carved and painted Expressionist
sculptures of Balkenhol's countryman, Georg Baselitz.</TE>
<TE>   Five chest-high posts feature small male figures on top. One
stands on his head. One lies on his back with his arms and feet up,
echoing the form of the post. A third appears to teeter on a thin red
line. A fourth leans back as if off-balance. None of these simple,
even slightly goofy calisthenics is of course genuine, since the
solid figures are whittled directly from the post. Balkenhol builds
subtle, quiet tension between object and space, always being
straightforward in his means. There's no trickery here.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, a male figure holds another, smaller, virtually
identical figure, as if he were a ventriloquist's dummy. You half
expect the bigger figure to make the smaller one talk--sort of the
way a viewer discovers that he actively projects himself into
Balkenhol's sculpture. Michelangelo famously said that his job as a
sculptor was just to chip away the excess from a block of stone to
let out the figure already lurking inside, and Balkenhol does that
with wood. The particular genius of his quirky work is to let you
know that you have a lot to do with making that figure live.</TE>

<TE>   Anniversary Exhibition Covers the Spectrum</TE>
<TE>   Jan Baum Gallery is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a big
show of mostly small paintings, sculptures, drawings and mixed-media
works. The 80 examples are mostly recent, but the selection of
artists ranges across the gallery's history. From Expressionism to
geometric abstraction, the diverse works don't reveal a uniform
gallery aesthetic (one possible exception: collage and assemblage are
common). Two artists at different ends of the spectrum suggest the
variety.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Saar's tin-covered totem, "Smokin' Papa Chaud" (2001), a
man piled high with buckets, tools, pots and pans, as well as her
fiery portrait of a woman painted on an iron skillet, "Cherry"
(2000), celebrate the bittersweet legacy of African American labor,
which was critical to building the nation. Saar uses a powerful
economy of means to coax maximum meaning out of ordinary materials.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, in 1977 Chris Burden took a post-Watergate page from
Richard Nixon's tattered life and performed a "Full Financial
Disclosure" at the gallery. He showed collages composed of canceled
personal checks from the prior year lined up sequentially on display
boards. April 1976, the month shown here, includes (among other
expenditures) $100 in rent for studio space, $15 in court fines for
running a yellow light in Venice and $12.61 to Home Silk Shop for
velvet to line the cases bearing relics from Burden's notorious
performances (for instance, the nails used to crucify him on top of
his Volkswagen). An economic and political self-portrait, graced with
22 signatures by the artist, the fragment of Burden's "Full Financial
Disclosure" offers an unsentimental perspective on life during
America's bicentennial year.</TE>

<TE>   Gorgeous Stoneware Is Abstract, Oddly Erotic</TE>
<TE>   At Frank Lloyd Gallery, the Amsterdam potter Wouter Dam shows 15
recent ceramic sculptures glazed in monochrome sherbet colors or rich
reds, purples, browns and black. The small, gorgeous stoneware
vessels are abstract yet oddly erotic.</TE>
<TE>   The thin-walled vessels are all ribbed, asymmetrical cylinders,
open at both ends and lying on their sides. Dam fuses machine forms
and organic shapes, like an industrial screw merged with a conch. The
fusion smartly embodies the process involved in wheel-thrown
ceramics.</TE>
<TE>   The ribs emphasize volume, the open ends accentuate airiness.
Sometimes their edges are sanded, creating razor-thin lines around
the swollen vessels and enhancing their feeling of puffed-up
inflation. The undulating cylinders and their voluptuous voids
luxuriously recline, like uncanny Minimalist odalisques.</TE>

<TE>   Is Video Projection Too Hip or Too Tired?</TE>
<TE>   "Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore," a nearly unwatchable video projection
by British artist Mark Leckey in the Project Room at the Santa Monica
Museum of Art, is said in a museum handout to be a "visual essay on
the history of dance culture in Britain" that "indulges a voyeuristic
and vicarious hunger for the hip." Actually it's a tired assemblage
of grainy (read sensitive) and out-of-focus (read authentic) clips of
kids dancing at clubs, wandering the streets in packs and apparently
high at raves, set to a mediocre pop soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, disaffected youth.</TE>
<TE>   The one interesting feature of the vacant video is its source.
Leckey is represented by the same New York gallery as the three
high-profile artists featured in "Cavepainting," the artist-organized
show in the museum's main gallery. It makes sense that those three
would be affiliated with the same commercial outlet (birds of a
feather flock together). But installing an apparent quid-pro-quo show
in the Project Room makes you wonder whose vicarious hunger for the
(supposedly) hip is actually being indulged.</TE>

<HD>A Big Legal Battle Over Garland's Mini Award</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The case of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vs.
Michael Sidney Luft may be one of the strangest, most convoluted
legal tangles the academy has encountered yet in its fierce attempts
to control the golden image of Oscar. The fracas has all the elements
of a quirky potboiler, right down to an undercover sting operation.</LD>
<LD>   And even though this isn't exactly a whodunit, you could certainly
call this story a what-is-it: In short, is Judy Garland's 1940 Oscar,
which Sid Luft, her former husband, has been peddling around town,
real or fake?</LD>
<LD>   The question is crucial because it could determine whether the
academy can stop the sale. Since 1950, the industry organization has
required Oscar winners to sign an agreement pledging, in effect, to
keep their awards off the market. If recipients or their heirs want
to sell their Oscars, they have been required to offer the academy
first right of refusal in exchange for $10. (That amount was dropped
to $1 in the 1980s, so that people would understand the money was
just a token amount and not a reflection of the Oscar's actual
worth.)</LD>
<TE>   So if the shrimp-sized Oscar honoring Garland for "The Wizard of
Oz" were deemed real--in those days the academy awarded smaller
Oscars to juvenile performers--then Luft could sell it, because the
statuette would have predated the winner's agreements giving the
academy control over its sale. But if it was a duplicate produced
after the agreements went into effect, as the academy claimed, then
the academy would have control.</TE>
<TE>   Luft's attempts to mine Oscar gold have triggered eight years of
on-and-off litigation involving three court judgments and two
statuettes. The legal fracas may have ended this month when a federal
judge ordered Luft to cough up the juvenile Oscar in his possession,
even if it's a duplicate.</TE>
<TE>   Does the academy really expect to get it? The question makes
academy executive director Bruce Davis laugh. "The answer is yes, I
think we'll get it," he says, "but I don't think it will be easy."</TE>
<TE>   From Luft's perspective, the case is far from clear. He says it
"has an aura of, mystique is one word, somebody's hiding something is
another word, which could be me. Maybe I'm not giving you all the
facts. But I haven't got them because I'm confused myself."</TE>
<TE>   It all began in December 1993, when Christie's scheduled an
auction of memorabilia that was to include Garland's pint-size Oscar.
Because the academy didn't begin requiring signed contracts until
1950, a decade after that Oscar was awarded, the organization assumed
there was nothing it could do about the sale. Until, that is, academy
officials received a tip suggesting they watch a "Today Show"
broadcast displaying items about to go on the block.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure enough, it wasn't her Oscar," Davis says. "The one she got
was quite distinctive, as seen in the picture of her with Mickey
Rooney. The one she had had a very tall base.... The one Christie's
was offering was not a tall base. We were scratching our heads, and
until that moment it didn't occur to us that a duplicate existed."</TE>
<TE>   The academy scoured its files and found a 1958 letter from the
publicity firm Rogers &amp; Cowan saying that Garland's Oscar had been
lost and asking for a replacement at Garland's expense. The academy
obliged and asked the performer to sign a first-right-of-refusal
agreement covering the duplicate Oscar and any others that might be
in her possession. (Garland was married to Luft from 1952 to 1965.)</TE>
<TE>   When the academy found the paperwork, its lawyers shot off letters
demanding the sale be stopped. Christie's dropped out because it
wasn't interested in selling a duplicate anyway, but Luft battled the
academy in court. He argued that the publicist's letter was forged by
somebody in the firm who wanted a statuette for him- or herself, and
that Garland had never signed a winner's agreement because she'd
never lost the original or received a duplicate. But Luft can't
explain why the Oscar he offered Christie's appears to be different
from the one Garland and Rooney are clutching in the famous
photograph.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first saw [Judy's] Oscar it didn't have a long base," Luft
says. "It had a short base, so that's part of the mystery. Although
the picture shows Mickey and Judy with a [tall-base] Oscar, she might
have had to send that unit back to have them inscribe the plaque."</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, the court ruled in the academy's favor in 1995,
declaring that the Oscar was a duplicate. And Luft was ordered to
return the statuette to the academy. He countered that he needed to
hold onto it because he planned to appeal. Time went by and no appeal
was filed, so the academy called Luft's lawyer and asked for the
award. His lawyer said that Luft had already given the statuette to
his daughter, Lorna.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, that's what we would have done, put it in the hands of
an heir who would have taken care of it," Davis says. "We said if we
could confirm that Miss Luft has it, that would be fine. But she was
out of the country, so we called the lawyer back and said, 'We're
going to charge him with contempt of court if he doesn't give it
back.' Then we got a call from Miss Luft's lawyer saying it was just
delivered. He'd lied not only to us but to his own lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, another Garland Oscar came on the market. This time
the statuette, described as Garland's "original" Oscar, showed up on
Nate's Autographs Web site with a price tag of $3 million and Sid
Luft named as the source. When a fresh round of litigation ensued,
Luft argued that this second statuette was a fake. (A court had
already declared the original Oscar was subject to the winner's
agreement.)</TE>
<TE>   The academy got a temporary restraining order against the sale.
But at a hearing, Luft said he didn't know whether Garland's original
Oscar even existed, so the court denied the academy's request for an
injunction. That inspired the academy to be more resourceful.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite simply, we didn't think he was telling the truth," academy
attorney David Quinto says, "and when somebody is willing to appear
for deposition and say they're telling the whole truth and nothing
but the truth and then lie to you, you've got to be creative."</TE>
<TE>   In July 2000, the academy hired investigator Ronald Foster to pose
as a memorabilia dealer hunting for Oscar statuettes. He approached
Marcia Tysseling, the owner of a Hollywood memorabilia shop called
Star Wares, who told him she'd heard that Luft was trying to sell
Garland's Oscar. Foster said he was interested, so she acted as
liaison, sending him a document that described the statuette as "the
very Oscar that was received by Judy Garland."</TE>
<TE>   Foster said he wanted an expert to appraise it, so in August, an
appraiser hired by the academy verified the Oscar's authenticity in a
meeting attended by Luft, Foster and Tysseling. With that evidence,
the academy went back to court and obtained a second temporary
restraining order against Luft.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the academy argued that the award for sale was the
original, which had somehow resurfaced. The academy said it had
rights to the sale because it was covered by the 1958 agreement
signed by Garland when she received her duplicate.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn declaration, Luft said he'd never authorized Nate
Sanders of Nate's Autographs to sell Garland's Oscar on the Web, and
that he believed the August meeting was being held so that he could
meet a "high-profile producer who was interested in viewing an Oscar
statuette and producing a film about my life with Judy Garland."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Luft said the Oscar he brought to the meeting was
a fake fashioned by a friend to cheer him up when he was in the
hospital a decade ago. That didn't sway the Superior Court, which
declared in January that this Oscar was the original, ordering Luft
to hand it to the academy. Meanwhile, the academy had filed suit in
federal court saying that even if it were true that the statuette was
a phony as Luft claimed, it still fell under the academy's control,
because the imitation infringed on the academy's copyright.</TE>
<TE>   The academy won the federal suit on March 11, and Luft was ordered
to give the academy any copies he might have. Asked whether he plans
to surrender the statuette, Luft seemed undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "This is harassment," he said. "They were groping and this all
started with them signing Judy's name to the bylaws agreement, and if
I may say so, I have all my marbles and you can't fool me. They want
to settle this thing, and I've had enough of their nonsense, as I
call it. In all probability I might [give the statuette to the
academy]. I don't know if I want to take them on some more."</TE>
<TE>   Luft's claims of harassment don't hold sway with Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to Lorna," Davis says. "Ask if she thinks we're harassing
her father. The two daughters of Judy Garland think he's behaving in
a beastly way." The daughters, Lorna Luft and Liza Minnelli, couldn't
be reached for comment, but Luft himself acknowledged that he and
Lorna have been at loggerheads over Garland's Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "Lorna wanted it," Luft says. "As a matter of fact, Lorna set me
up at a luncheon and had Bruce Davis next to her table, and he
testified at this first trial that he was privy to our conversation.
Can you imagine my own daughter setting me up? I said to Lorna I
needed the money. She said, why didn't you come to me if you needed
money?"</TE>
<TE>   Why all this sturm und drang over a little statuette? The academy
considers such litigation key to protecting its claim to Hollywood's
most valuable and marketable resource: image.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could buy a replica in stores and they didn't protect it,
it wouldn't keep the dignity it has," says Robert Osborne, Oscar
historian, Hollywood Reporter columnist and Turner Classic Movies
host. Notes Davis: "It is a kind of romantic notion that there ought
to be some small class of things, even in Hollywood, that aren't for
sale, that you have to earn rather than buy them."</TE>

<AU>DAVID MACARAY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So comedian Whoopi Goldberg will be hosting the 74th annual Academy
Awards on Sunday. Nothing against Goldberg (this will be her fourth
time) or Billy Crystal (he's done seven) or Steve Martin (last year's
host), but when was it decided that the most prestigious awards show
on the planet needed to be funny in order to sustain an audience?</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's not as if comedy so dominates the nomination and
awards process that only a professional comedian would have the
necessary "street creds" to host the affair. Rarely does a comedy
even earn a best picture nomination. Not counting the hybrid
"Shakespeare in Love" (1998), the last comedy to win best picture was
"Annie Hall," way back in 1977.</LD>
<LD>   And isn't it slightly insulting for a program paying tribute to
the movie industry (and formerly hosted by such luminaries as Frank
Capra and Joseph Mankiewicz) to be co-opted by the likes of Johnny
Carson and David Letterman, stand-up comedians associated exclusively
with television? That's sort of like baseball's Hall of Fame
inductions being handled by Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not suggesting we can't have levity. I enjoy humor as much as
the next guy. And I'm not saying that Bruce Vilanch and his fellow
writers don't do a splendid job of supplying the presenters with
bushels of funny material. It's just that scripted comedy seems a bit
superfluous to the business at hand. If the show isn't funny enough,
what? We're going to turn it off before we see who wins?</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, as the telecast becomes increasingly global (hundreds
of millions of people are expected to tune in Sunday), one wonders
whether topical or idiomatic humor will continue to play well. Last
year, even though I laughed at Martin's droll inside-Hollywood jokes,
I couldn't help wondering how those gags were being received in
Bombay, India.</TE>
<TE>   So, how did this modest trophy presentation, begun as a radio
broadcast in 1926, evolve into the present-day joke-fest?</TE>
<TE>   Two theories explain it. The first suggests that once audiences
became conditioned to professional comedians as emcees, nobody was
willing to deviate. If it worked, why monkey with it? No one wanted
to be remembered as the guy who booked Max Von Sydow when he could
have gotten Jerry Lewis (host of three shows).</TE>
<TE>   But the Academy Awards weren't always funny. Indeed, the early
programs were modest, subdued affairs (Douglas Fairbanks and Cecil B.
DeMille hosted the first one), almost parochial in tone. Arguably, it
wasn't until the 1940 debut of co-host Bob Hope that the Oscars
shifted gears. During his record 15 radio and TV appearances (the
last being in 1978), Hope single-handedly morphed the ceremony into
an evening of self-effacing humor and wicked zingers.</TE>
<TE>   Loath to tinker with proven success, subsequent producers (with
few exceptions) have not only preserved that comedic format but
sanctified it. Hence, Goldberg.</TE>
<TE>   Call the second theory the "comicization" of America, the tendency
to punctuate everything with frivolity: a clever quip, an ironic
smirk, a snappy comeback. Call it the Dennis Miller Syndrome. Fearing
that a simple sporting event was no longer sufficient to attract
viewers, the producers of "Monday Night Football" felt obliged to
place a stand-up comedian in the broadcast booth, alongside Al
Michaels and Dan Fouts.</TE>
<TE>   If the trend continues, one day we'll see professional comedians
at college commencements, portable laugh-track machines at the DMV,
Gilbert Gottfried in Stockholm to "punch up" the Nobel Prize
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   As a movie buff who attends about 60 films a year, I haven't
missed an Oscar telecast since 1983. Corny as it sounds, I've always
regarded the occasion as part competition, part infatuation, an
opportunity for us incurable movie romantics-archivists to immerse
ourselves, for one glorious evening, in Hollywood's legendary
wretched excess.</TE>
<TE>   I'm puzzled. All these movie stars, all the pageantry, suspense,
surprises, disappointments, the speeches, the wonderful musical
numbers, all this wall-to-wall industry royalty, and we still don't
have enough stimuli? We still need jokes off cue cards?</TE>
<TE>   The academy should be urged to return to a more relaxed, dignified
format. Make it a true awards presentation, and save the shtick for
the comedy clubs. No, this doesn't mean the host has to be Alan
Greenspan. But what would the objection be to Anthony Hopkins?</TE>

<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his 1997 play "Sympathetic Magic," Lanford Wilson sets out to
explore the universe. That's a pretty big topic, even for a
playwright who's been working at his craft for four decades, as
Wilson has.</LD>
<LD>   But by using some of the larger mysteries of the cosmos to frame
the intimate mysteries of personal behavior, he captures something
universal about the human condition, even as he admits that the
individual is unknowable.</LD>
<LD>   The play arrives on the West Coast in a crisp, vital production by
a fledgling troupe known as Theatre Tribe, which has moved into the
small, storefront theater at El Portal Center in North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   The stage there has been painted to resemble a large star chart
(designed by Barbara-Julie Miller), which lends an element of magical
realism to the proceedings. The action unfolds cinematically, with
scenes cross-fading into one another as the story progresses across
the San Francisco Bay area, introducing us to a diverse group of
people whose lives are intertwined. (Most roles are double cast, with
different combinations of actors appearing at each performance.)</TE>
<TE>   We begin in a university lecture hall, where Andy (Jeff Kerr
McGivney), a young astrophysicist, is giving a lecture. Soon, we're
in a churchyard, where Andy's artist girlfriend, Barbara (Corie
Vickers on opening weekend), is visiting her half-brother, Don
(Nathan Burgess), an Episcopal priest who leads a largely gay
congregation, and his former lover, Pauly (Thomas Burr), the church's
music director. Eventually joining the mix are Barbara and Don's
globetrotting anthropologist mother, Liz (Jenny O'Hara); her
assistant, Sue (Alex Fatovich); Andy's astrophysicist colleague,
Mickey (Aaron Jettleson); and Andy and Mickey's department head, Carl
(James Handy).</TE>
<TE>   Science and art cohabit--uneasily, at times--in the Andy-Barbara
relationship, while religion and art seek connection in the
Don-Barbara and Don-Pauly relationships. Liz contributes an
anthropological perspective, filtered through feminism, while the
scientists get us thinking about how the dynamics of the physical
world, such as Werner Heisenberg's subatomic uncertainty principle,
might apply to human behavior. Sexuality, intimacy and belief come
under observation along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson--whose plays include "The Hot l Baltimore," "Talley's
Folly" and "Burn This"--is not a playwright who announces where his
stories are going, and that can make "Sympathetic Magic" difficult to
follow at times. The New York critics pretty much dismissed the
script in its original production. But as staged here by Stuart
Rogers--so that the action seems epic yet almost voyeuristically true
to life--it's absolutely riveting.</TE>
<TE>   "Sympathetic Magic," El Portal Studio Theatre, 5269 Lankershim
Blvd., North Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends April 20.
$15. (323) 769-7060. Running time: 2 hours, 25 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Actor Steven Seagal</LD>
<TE>   Less than three months after being found guilty of slandering a
co-worker, action movie star Steven Seagal is being sued for $60
million by a former business partner for allegedly backing out of a
contract to perform in four motion pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed by producer Julius R. Nasso, accuses Seagal of
breaching a contract to star in the movies, which had a combined
budget of more than $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso accuses Seagal of backing out on the advice of a Buddhist
spiritual advisor known as Mukara, who persuaded Seagal to detach
himself from his associates, his children from two previous marriages
and his movie production companies.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Seagal said the actor did not owe any money to
Nasso. "To the contrary, substantial monies are owed to Steven by Mr.
Nasso," the spokesman told Reuters on Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell Wants Her Name Off Film</TE>
<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell is asking to have her name and voice removed from
an Oscar-nominated documentary after learning that the filmmakers are
involved in a group described as a homophobic cult.</TE>
<TE>   The talk show host, who recently came out as a lesbian, narrated
"Artists and Orphans: A True Drama," about a New York theater group
that travels to the former Soviet republic of Georgia to help
orphaned and abandoned children. The film is competing for an Academy
Award on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell, who has three adopted children and has been a vocal
proponent of gays adopting children, volunteered to narrate the short
film. Her spokeswoman said Wednesday that O'Donnell found out this

<HD>South Coast Repertory Will Premiere Two Productions</HD>
<DH>Season: The 2002-2003 selections include works by Shaw,
Shakespeare and others. Also starring: Expanded facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York City in the early 1900s is the setting for two world
premiere productions announced today for South Coast Repertory's
2002-2003 season. Also among the five plays announced--four others
will be chosen later--are comedies by George Bernard Shaw and William
Shakespeare and a West Coast premiere from Canadian newcomer Michael
Healey.</LD>
<LD>   Playgoers will encounter a theater complex expanded and
refurbished to the tune of $19 million.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no part of our theater center that will look like 'the
old part.' Everything will look of a piece and new," said David
Emmes, the producing artistic director who helped launch South Coast
in a Newport Beach storefront in 1964.</LD>
<TE>   Emmes said that Shaw's "Major Barbara," a large-scale play with
three settings, was chosen to showcase the improved production values
of the refurbished 507-seat main stage, which will now be known as
Segerstrom Stage. To signal South Coast's continued emphasis on new
work, the world premiere of Richard Greenberg's "The Violet Hour" was
chosen to launch the 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage.</TE>
<TE>   "The Violet Hour" concerns a recently returned veteran of World
War I who tries to start a book-publishing business. It will be the
seventh Greenberg's play South Coast has produced--more than any
other living playwright.</TE>
<TE>   The other world premiere, Lynn Nottage's "Intimate Apparel," runs
on the Segerstrom Stage and focuses on an African American seamstress
at the turn of the 20th century and her work creating fancy underwear
for wealthy socialites and prostitutes alike. A previous play by
Nottage, "Crumbs From the Table of Joy," was seen at South Coast in
1996. Theatergoers can preview "Intimate Apparel" in an April 27
staged reading that is part of South Coast's annual Pacific
Playwrights Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of Verona," will be seen on the
Segerstrom Stage. South Coast is revisiting the Shaw and Shakespeare
plays, having previously produced "Major Barbara" in 1983 and "Two
Gentlemen of Verona" in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Healey's "The Drawer Boy" concerns two aging men, best friends
since boyhood, who live together on a farm; their equilibrium is
upset when a young actor comes to research their lives for a play. It
runs on the Argyros Stage. The Argyros Stage replaces the 161-seat
Second Stage; the smaller space will now be known as the Nicholas
Studio in a new, 99-seat configuration intended mainly for in-house
play workshops and education programs. Because of the size increase,
plays will run for 24 performances on the Argyros Stage, compared to
40 performances on the existing Second Stage.</TE>
<TE>   Also planned are South Coast's two nonsubscription holiday
perennials. "A Christmas Carol" plays for the 23rd year on the
Segerstrom Stage and "La Posada Magica" returns for its ninth annual
production on the Argyros Stage.</TE>
<TE>   Subscription prices are $125-$243 for the five Segerstrom Stage
plays (an increase of $1 per show from this year's price) and
$104-$190 for the four Argyros Stage plays (no increase for the
cheapest seats, but a $2.50 per show price hike for the most
expensive ones).</TE>

<HD>From Youngsters, a Poignant Take on Mideast Conflict</HD>
<DH>In the Oscar-nominated 'Promises,' seven children on either
side of the crisis prove to be voices of both hope and pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Promises" takes a simple idea and just about breaks your heart with
it. This look at the Israeli-Palestinian crisis through the eyes of
children turns out to be a tragedy in short pants, not just because
of the apparent hopelessness of that situation, but because it
demonstrates that the possibilities for something better are both
present and squandered.</LD>
<LD>   The film to beat in the best documentary Oscar race and the winner
of numerous film festival awards (including five audience awards),
"Promises" is written, produced and directed by Justine Shapiro and
B.Z. Goldberg. They linked up after discovering that they'd both
independently considered interviewing Israeli and Palestinian
children for their take on that chaotic political situation.</LD>
<LD>   It's B.Z., as the kids all call him, who is the film's on-camera
liaison to the children. Half-Israeli, half-American, fluent in
Hebrew and able to get along in Arabic, someone who grew up in
Jerusalem but went to film school in the U.S., B.Z.'s range of
experience and empathetic presence draw the children out.</LD>
<TE>   The seven children were ages 9 to 13 when the project, which was
filmed over three years, began. Young as they are, many have tangible
connections to the fighting: Two of the boys had close friends killed
and the father of one of the girls, Sanabel, has been imprisoned by
the Israelis without a trial for the past two years. All the children
have had the conflict and its attendant rage writ large on their
consciousnesses.</TE>
<TE>   One of the ironies of "Promises" is that though all these children
have homes in Jerusalem or within 15 minutes of it, they might as
well live on different planets for how much connection they have to
each other. This is even true within the Israeli community, where
twins, secular volleyball players Yarko and Daniel, have almost as
much fear and mistrust of the Orthodox community as of the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the twins, the other two Israelis come from religious
backgrounds. Moishe lives behind well-guarded fences in a Jewish
settlement in the occupied territories on the West Bank, while
Shlomo, the son of a rabbi, lives in the Jewish quarter of
Jerusalem's Old City, dresses like a miniature adult and spends the
largest part of his day studying the Torah.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud, the livest wire of all the children, also lives in the
Old City but in the Muslim Quarter, where his father owns a coffee
and spice shop. Sanabel lives in the Deheishe refugee camp with her
mother and sister; Faraj, a young firebrand, lives there as well. In
one of the film's most moving segments, B.Z. sneaks Faraj and his
grandmother into Israel so they can visit the old woman's village and
wander around the ruins of the house the family abandoned in 1945 but
preserves the key to as a kind of holy relic of better days.</TE>
<TE>   One of the things "Promises" provides is an inside look at what
something as amorphous as "the Middle East situation" does to people
on the ground. It's painful to see these children trapped in the same
cycle of corrosive enmity that ensnared earlier generations, painful
to hear young people on both sides unconsciously mirror each other
when they pull out holy books and say, "This land is ours, they stole
it."</TE>
<TE>   These situations are particularly hard to watch because by the
time the conversations get political, we've seen enough to know these
are all basically good kids, which makes the unvarnished hostility
they express even more dispiriting. Mahmoud, perhaps the most
engaging of the seven, says, "The more Jews we kill, the fewer there
will be," while Moishe jokes approvingly about the possibility of
accidentally killing Arabs during target practice in the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   These kinds of comments are especially disturbing because most of
"Promises" was filmed from 1997 to 2000, a time of relative calm in
the area when the peace process was thought to be progressing. It's
chilling to think what sentiments a similar project might come up
with today.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, and this is one of "Promises'" great virtues, with the
mercurial changeability of young people, these kids are open to
anything. Very serious Shlomo, for instance, despite his professed
lack of interest in Palestinians, ends up in an amusing belching
contest with a young Palestinian boy.</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkable, some kids on each side of the divide, all on
their own, express an interest in getting to know their opposite
numbers. The meeting that results is both exhilarating in its sense
of genuine possibilities and painful in showing how the real world
conspires to effectively suffocate those chances.</TE>
<TE>   This quite moving film never spells out the reasons it calls
itself "Promises," but perhaps it has to do with the notion that we
implicitly promise children a better world when we bring them into
it. In that sense, with their potentially poisoned futures, these
children have had that promise betrayed. The Israeli journalist Amos
Elon once wrote that the Israeli-Palestinian situation's demands for
justice exceed the human capacity to administer it. This strong,
uncompromising film makes us fear he might be right.</TE>

<HD>'Roof' Turns Family Vacations Into Competition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For folks who look back fondly at those cross-country road trips with
cranky relatives, or the near-fistfights with other vacationers over
disputed campsites, UPN may have just the "Survivor" clone for you.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 8, five families from across the United States begin a
21-day competition while sharing a beachfront bungalow in Fiji in the
aptly titled "Under One Roof." The last family standing at the end of
the scheduled seven-episode run gets the keys to the
dwelling--assuming, of course, that it is still standing. With the
tumult that begins unfolding in the opening minutes alone, that's no
sure bet.</LD>
<LD>   "Under One Roof," with host Rob Nelson ("The Full Nelson" talk
show), has been carefully designed to generate maximum mayhem among
the contestants. The five families, including one from Huntington
Beach, are blindfolded and dropped off at five different points on
the island, each exactly 1 kilometer from the beach-house base. The
blindfolds are removed and each group is given a global-positioning
device programmed with the house's coordinates to guide them through
the exotic terrain. The first contingent to the house gets to stake
out any--or even all--of the four bedrooms.</LD>
<TE>   How greedy will the first families to the house be? How will
subsequent families react upon arrival? It's not pretty, but it is
pretty interesting, in a train-wreck sort of way.</TE>
<TE>   One hulking family member who was wilting fast in the heat and
humidity had more immediate issues on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought when the blindfold came off was ... where am I?"
he said. "And two, when can I take my leather pants off?"</TE>
<TE>   Once all the families--22 people in all--are in the house, some
loose alliances begin to form. Several of the teenage girls gather
privately to discuss the embarrassing behavior of their parents
during an earlier altercation. The parents, meanwhile, talk quietly
about how to guard the modest food provisions from midnight snacking
by the ravenous youths.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning brings the first of the "challenge" competitions
that will be used to whittle the number of families down to the
winning clan.</TE>
<TE>   As island residents line the beach to watch all the goings-on,
some can't help laughing at the crazy Americans. You'll probably be
laughing too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Under One Roof" can be seen at 8 tonight on UPN. The network has
rated it TV-PGL (may be unsuitable for young children, with an
advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Showcase's Star Is the Choreography</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody needs opportunities to workshop and showcase dance ideas more
than commercial choreographers, artists who normally spend their
careers under the thumb of recording stars, film directors and others
who control, manipulate and sometimes marginalize what those
choreographers create.</LD>
<LD>   Each month, "The Carnival," a choreographer's showcase at the Key
Club on the Sunset Strip, provides a stage, technical resources
(including overhead video projection) and a packed audience of young
standees ready to scream for dance, all kinds of dance.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, for instance, an ensemble segment credited to D.V.S.
offered onstage rappers, cleanly executed hip-hop, a flurry of
jazz-dance turns, a glimpse of tap and even some choreographed
martial arts moves. No concept unified the components unless you
consider the piece a celebration of dance. And the whole evening took
on that role.</LD>
<TE>   A depiction of the dancers' world shaped several pieces, from
Razberry Jam's irreverent update of the audition from "A Chorus Line"
to Ocean Duran's Hawaiian-flavored look at a hectic video shoot, and
Chonique and Lisette's affectionate spin on retro rock.</TE>
<TE>   Thrillingly performed, Selatin Kara's fierce abstraction of street
life proved the choreographic highlight of the night, along with
Robert Gilliam's hot inversion of the gender norms of a ballet pas de
deux. In an evening with no shortage of energy, technique and boldly
merchandised sex, these dances had something more: creative ambition
and a powerful sense of direction.</TE>
<TE>   Deftly staged group dances by Scott Hislop and Chill Factor
featured an intriguing use of props, and provocative costumes gave an
edge to promising, underdeveloped dance dramas by Cati Jean and Wes
Veldink. Celebratory works by the Others and Stacy Keathley completed
the program.</TE>
<TE>   Created by Carey Ysais and directed by Ysais and Kimo Keoke, "The
Carnival" makes choreography the star: Individual dancers aren't even
named in program credits. But someone identified from the stage as
Osgood danced with spectacular skill in two brief interludes between
segments.</TE>

<HD>The Sound of Sorrow</HD>
<DH>The Emerson quartet and the Complicite theater group
resurrect the ghosts of Shostakovich's past in 'The Noise of Time.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shostakovich's haunted, morbid 15th String Quartet, written in the
hospital a year before he died, is the opposite of a restorative. The
Russian composer, who found hundreds of ways of portraying his
personal torment along with the terror of his times in Soviet Russia,
did not go gently into the night. He went with anger and agony,
publicly displayed.</LD>
<LD>   The 35-minute quartet consists of six connected movements, five
very slow and one even slower. I have always heard it as a monstrous
nightmare. Shostakovich seems to be saying that no matter how much
you have ever suffered, however bad your life may have been, it's
nothing, nothing, compared to what he went through. And here is a
sour, sorrowful, self-centered score to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this most implacable of all string quartets is what the
Emerson String Quartet has chosen to give itself a new lease on life
and help reinvent the presentation of string quartet music in the
process. Collaborating with the British theater company Complicite,
the Emerson has turned Shostakovich's quartet into an 80-minute
theater piece, "The Noise of Time," which was produced by Lincoln
Center and arrived at UCLA's Freud Playhouse on Wednesday for five
performances through Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Consequently, the fact that "Noise of Time" accomplishes exactly
what it set out to do is startling. Simon McBurney, the director who
founded Complicite and conceived "Noise of Time," realizes that the
increasing fascination with Shostakovich in the quarter-century since
his death is biographical as well as musical. To understand his
music, we must understand him and his world. We must be transported
back into a society in which music was dangerous; in which Stalin
could act as a lethal music critic; in which Shostakovich, a neurotic
man to begin with, carried the weight of oppression on his trembling
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Complicite takes us back to that time with marvelous simplicity. A
radio liberated from "The Twilight Zone" is illuminated on a darkened
stage. The dial turns and the broadcasts become earlier and earlier
in history--Elvis dies, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is launched into
space....</TE>
<TE>   For the first 45 minutes, Shostakovich's life comes to us in
flashbacks. It is as though we enter into the dying man's delirium.
The sounds are from historic radio broadcasts and remembrances,
spoken narrative and snatches of recorded music. The sights are
projections onto a wall of quivering sheets of papers and inventive
movements for four actors, who appear as shadows of the four members
of the string quartet and of the composer himself.</TE>
<TE>   The swift illuminations of Shostakovich and his life all seem to
come as if from popping flashbulbs on a black stage. Comprehension is
always just out of grasp, and the brilliance of this production is
that each new bit of information makes us want more. Further
description here would not be useful, because surprise is the method
of this inventive company.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of the quartet is the final portion, and it is
exceptional. The Emerson is celebrating its 25th anniversary this
season (the ensemble was formed two years after Shostakovich's
death). It is one of the most impressive of American string quartets,
and Philip Setzer, Eugene Drucker, Lawrence Dutton and David Finckel
have remained its only members. But its lush, muscular, sometimes
annoying macho sound had begun to lose its freshness.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the first string quartet to look to theater for
rejuvenation. But "Noise of Time" is a stretch for the Emersons, and
stretch they do with tremendous skill and concentration. They play
Shostakovich's quartet by memory, of course, and that is liberating
all by itself. They play in striking formations, standing or sitting.
Most extraordinary of all: They don't face each other, as they do in
a concert setting, but face the audience. The communication is direct
and electrifying.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney does a remarkable job of bringing Shostakovich to life,
and the way the Emerson continues that spirit is a revelation. The
Shostakovich revealed here does not succumb to self-pity but rises to
one last act of defiance, which was always the most attractive aspect
in his music's personality. "The Noise of Time" becomes a giant fist
raised at death and at totalitarianism.</TE>
<TE>   As if more confirmation of the power of this show were necessary,
it can be found in the continuing new life it seems to have brought
to the Emerson. The ensemble now plays standing up in its
concerts--it did so last weekend for a marathon of the six Bartok
quartets at Lincoln Center. And it will be fascinating to see just
how the players handle this quartet (and other late Shostakovich and
late Beethoven strings quartets) when they appear at the Ojai
Festival in June.</TE>
<TE>   "The Noise of Time" repeats tonight at 8 and Saturday at 2 and 8
p.m., $16-$50, Freud Playhouse, UCLA, (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<HD>'Blade II' Pumps New Blood Into Comic Book Series</HD>
<DH>Wesley Snipes returns as a more mature Daywalker, taking on
a super race of vampires in a sequel that tops the original.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Blade II" brings back Wesley Snipes in the title role as the Marvel
Comics half-human, half-vampire who wears a long, flowing black coat
and who has all the strengths of vampires but none of their
weaknesses--save a craving for blood. However, Whistler (Kris
Kristofferson), who lost his own family to vampires, is a scientific
genius who took in Blade when he was a kid living on the streets and
developed a serum to keep his thirst for blood in check. Cultivating
a father-son relationship over the years, Whistler and Blade have
dedicated themselves to making war on vampires, who, they assure us,
"are everywhere."</LD>
<LD>   The first time out, they took on Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a
cocky young vampire intent on world rule. Now, in "Blade II," the
current vampire overlord, Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), has asked
his sworn enemy, Blade, to join forces with him to combat the
Reapers, a super race of vampires intent on destroying all vampires
and then all humans. Silver bullets and garlic mean nothing to them.</LD>
<TE>   While it helps to have seen the original "Blade" for a full
understanding of this so-called "Daywalker" (Snipes) and his
character and the nature of his relationship with Whistler, "Blade
II" is more enjoyable than the original. Bloodbath that it is, it is
largely free of the extreme, lingering sadism that characterized the
first film and threatened to overwhelm Snipes' iconic presence.
Interestingly, Blade has matured in the four years since we first met
him on the screen. He has accepted the ultimately inescapable duality
of his nature and the isolation that goes with it: From the outset he
accepts that the mutual attraction between him and Damaskinos'
beautiful daughter Nyssa (Leonor Varela) cannot go anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   With "Blade II," Guillermo del Toro takes over the directing
chores from Stephen Norrington, and this is frankly a plus. Del Toro,
the celebrated maker of "Cronos" and the recent "The Devil's
Backbone," brings to the film's nonstop action a mastery of moods.
This time, the film is set in Prague, and the ancient city and its
buildings provide an invaluable portentous, shadowy atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Blade has relocated his elaborate laboratory, and he
has acquired a new scientific sidekick, Scud (Norman Reedus), a
brilliant but frequently obnoxious slacker dude who immediately
clashes with Whistler, once Blade has rescued him from the clutches
of the vampires who had ostensibly killed him at the end of the first
film. In going after the Reapers, Blade and Whistler will have the
services of the Bloodpack, a crack unit of vampires. Not
surprisingly, relations between Blade and Bloodpack leader Reinhardt
(Ron Perlman) are edgy at best.</TE>
<TE>   Like the original, "Blade II" has superior production values and
visual and special effects. Snipes and Kristofferson build on the
resonance of their original portrayals. Snipes again combines a
formidable physical presence with a depth of feeling and capacity for
reflection unusual for an incarnation of a comic book hero. He's
larger than life though never lacking a human dimension. Not
surprisingly, the makers have left the doors open for yet another
sequel.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong pervasive violence, language, some drug
use and sexual content. Times guidelines: not as grisly as the
original but still fairly intense action.</TE>

<HD>'ChalkZone' Draws Attention to Brainpower</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The offbeat animation shifts between crisp outlines with solid colors
and charming, rough-textured, kid-style chalk drawings. The unforced
humor and educational tidbits are a smooth mix. The mini music videos
are wildly inventive. And the hero uses his brain, not brawn, to save
the day.</LD>
<LD>   Nickelodeon's new animated series "ChalkZone," premiering at 8:30
tonight in its regular time slot, is a lively treat.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it plays like a hyperkinetic relative of Crockett Johnson's
children's classic, "Harold and the Purple Crayon," about a little
boy who draws his own fantasy adventures. But judging by the first
two episodes, this clever show, created by Larry Huber and Bill
Burnett, follows its own path.</LD>
<TE>   With wacky songs by Burnett, and fast and funky original music by
Guy Moon, Steve Rucker and Thomas Jones Chase, 10-year-old artist
Rudy Tabootie, voiced by E.G. Daily ("Rugrats'" Tommy Pickles), gains
entry to the world where erased blackboard drawings go--all those
scrawled pictures of mean teachers, bullies, crooked vehicles and
skewed buildings, gum-chewing spiders, fluttery "buttonflies," a
cranky lady in a tub and a one-eyed, kilted giant. (Rudy draws the
giant a pair of knickers for comfort and a second eye for better
vision.)</TE>
<TE>   Using his magic chalk, imagination and smarts, Rudy resolves
various zany cliffhanger predicaments in the ChalkZone, aided by
Snap--his drawing of a pint-sized masked superhero--and brainy
classmate and kindred spirit Penny. Each episode winds up with a
comical one-minute "music video" bash, played by Rudy and his
ChalkZone band.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat shows run Saturdays at noon.</TE>

<HD>Twenty Years Later, 'E.T.' Still Brings It All Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"E.T." is back, and that has to be a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   Hugely popular with audiences and critics on its initial release,
"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" (to give it its full name) is being
reissued in a special 20th anniversary edition that features, we are
assured, "never-before-seen footage, state-of-the-art
computer-generated enhancements and a digitally remixed soundtrack."</LD>
<LD>   Impressive as all this is, it's a bit beside the point. Unlike
"Apocalypse Now Redux," which had 49 new minutes, the unseen footage
here, amusing though it is, lasts a bit more than three minutes. And
a new "E.T." is not exactly what's called for; what we want is to
have the old one back so we can take pleasure in it one more time.
Which is, thankfully, pretty much what has happened.</LD>
<TE>   For if looking at "Apocalypse Now" a second time reminds us of how
much we've changed, seeing "E.T." again reminds us of how much we've
remained the same, how gratified we still are by a film that connects
so beautifully to our sense of wonder and joy.</TE>
<TE>   Movies that become classics tend to have a confidence about them,
a sureness that they have something that will last, and this is the
case with "E.T." There's a naturalness, even an inevitability about
the film's story line, a narrative pull that draws us in again even
though we know exactly what is going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   This is due in large measure to Steven Spielberg. Not
surprisingly, the director says in his introduction to the first
printing of Melissa Mathison's marvelous screenplay in "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial: From Concept to Classic" that "E.T. was--and still
is--my most personal film."</TE>
<TE>   Connected to his great love of science fiction, his gift for
working with children and, he admits in that introduction, his
parents' divorce, "E.T." feels like one from the director's heart, a
film he had the confidence he could hit out of the park. Though the
best picture-writer-director Oscars all went to "Gandhi" that year,
it's this film that endures.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Spielberg had great help, starting with that Mathison
script, which, along with Steven Zaillian's for "Schindler's List,"
has to be one of the best he's ever had. Aside from funny lines and
situations, Mathison created a genuine, unforced warmth on the page
that is as effective on screen as it's ever been.</TE>
<TE>   A re-viewing of the film also reminds us how beautifully
constructed it is, the effortless way multiple incidents are worked
into what is basically a very simple story line, and how carefully
worked out are sequences like E.T. communicating that what he really
wants to do is phone home.</TE>
<TE>   "E.T." is also quite brilliantly cast, so much so that it's
impossible to think of anyone but Drew Barrymore as the tiny dynamo
Gertie or to even imagine the earnest, ever so serious Elliott, the
boy who wails, "He came to me," as being played by someone besides
Henry Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Barrymore and Thomas have had sizable adult careers (she was
recently in "Riding in Cars With Boys"; he will be in "Gangs of New
York"), and Erika Eleniak, the girl Elliott kisses, grew up to became
a star on "Baywatch." But because they moved from child to adult as
opposed to adult to older adult (as happened to the actors in
"Apocalypse Now"), the change in their appearances doesn't throw us
out of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, though special effects have advanced mightily in the
past two decades, E.T., like "Forbidden Planet's" Robby the Robot, is
an icon we love just the way he is. Seeing the film again reminds us
how miraculous it was that the contributions of dozens of
people--from Caprice Rothe, the mime who did the hands, to Pat Welsh,
who recorded E.T's dialogue, to the 12 animatronic operators and the
little people inside the suit--coalesced to form a creature as
individual as it was completely believable.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how much you know about how "E.T." was put together,
reason and knowledge recede in the face of still-breathtaking moments
like Elliott' s bicycle suddenly taking flight. To see "E.T." again
is to wish you could see it for the first time, or, if not that, take
somebody who can.</TE>

<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Eight years ago, British director Nicholas Hytner radically
reinvented "Carousel" on Broadway with modern insight and stunning
visual magic.</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, Christopher Renshaw--an English director living
in Australia--brought a sumptuous "King and I" that had layers of
bittersweet colonial resonance.</LD>
<LD>   Now Trevor Nunn, outgoing director of London's Royal National
Theatre, arrives at the Gershwin Theatre with his comparably
acclaimed and awarded "Oklahoma!" Like his colleagues, he is said to
be revealing a Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic through a dark new lens.
In addition, he hired the tireless Susan Stroman--before "Contact"
and "The Producers"--and asked her to toss aside the sacred Agnes de
Mille choreography that made dance inseparable from story and song.</LD>
<TE>   After several delays, that 1998 make-over finally opened Thursday
night in a country with a sudden craving for comfort foods, greatest
hits and tributes to our manifest destiny. The show--recast except
for Josefina Gabrielle's Laurey and Shuler Hensley's majestically
haunting Jud Fry--is big, lively, expensively put together,
energetically reconfigured, ecstatically and acrobatically danced.</TE>
<TE>   I want to love it. Instead, this "Oklahoma!" is just OK. There is
too much mugging, a hard-sell jollity that feels especially pushy
when exploring the darkest side of Hammerstein's shaded but
ultimately sunny book and Rodgers' subtle but essentially sunny
score. The 1943 kickoff to the golden age of the American musical
still has those wonderful songs, tumbling one after another, as
inextricable from our national chemistry as blood and marrow are from
observers who know more of the words than perhaps they realized.</TE>
<TE>   The eager actors keep punching up the sweet, cornball banter as if
it were intended to be hilarious. After such a convincing attempted
rape and the brutal murder of a monster we come to know more
intimately than we know the heroes, the return to hokey-folky
affability seems almost grotesque.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Nunn may be commenting on--even celebrating--the
country's resilient optimism in the face of ugly terrain. If these
Americans were not generally played here as goofballs with guns, the
interpretation might even be a compliment. Anthony Ward's sets,
despite the high-tech cinematic travelogue during the overture,
emphasize the rough life on the open plains. Ward mostly dresses the
characters in stock musical-comedy finery, but Aunt Eller's house
looks more like a white-trash shack than a farm. I know we're meant
to feel the dirt on the ground and the grit under the fingernails,
but the other inconsistencies of tone tend to jerk us around with
high concept.</TE>
<TE>   Where DeMille brought in dancers for Laurey's conflicted dream
ballet, Stroman's bright idea is to have the lovers
themselves--Patrick Wilson's amiable cowboy, Curly, and Gabrielle's
unusually feisty Laurey--do their own dancing. This new dream ballet
begins as Laurey sniffs smelling salts and becomes increasingly
hallucinatory with newly arranged music. As the dream changes to
nightmare, it is as Jud (who only knows dance-hall girls), might
imagine it--if, of course, Jud had seen "Cabaret" and "Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle sings with a thin, edgy voice but moves with the spiky,
confident lyricism of a dancer, which she used to be. Stroman
endearingly appreciates that Wilson's not much of a dancer nor a
Broadway baritone of the Alfred Drake school. But the actor combines
a modern diffidence with sweet, full-throated ardor. Hugh Jackman,
who created this Curly in London before going Hollywood, is said to
have been dreamy and introverted. We can only imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Dreamy and introverted are in shorter supply here than perky and
raucous. Since this Laurey is as much tomboy as ingenue, the show's
libidinal "Cain't Say No" creature, Jessica Boevers' Ado Annie, is
pushed into burlesque. Andrea Martin's Aunt Eller is an unusually
ditsy party animal. Aasif Mandvi brings some humanity to the exotic
cliche of the Persian peddler. And Justin Bohon is a real find as
Will Parker, who not only sings and dances, but can hold a woman by
her armpits and jump rope with her body.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard not to miss DeMille's lean, character-driven aesthetic,
but Stroman offers lots of space-eating, cannily transformed country
dances with big wishbone jumps and high-energy variations on standard
modern-ballet lifts. Finally, what we remember is the outcast Jud,
transformed by Hensley from a mean joke to a big, sad, scary man who
holds his beloved Laurey as Steinbeck's Lenny loved his pet mouse to
death. In contrast, the good guys seem like clowns.</TE>

<HD>GE to Reduce Reliance on Short-Term Debt</HD>
<DH>Securities: The company responds to concerns about its
finances by saying it will issue longer-term debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. tried Thursday to defuse a growing controversy
over its GE Capital financial arm, while attacks on the company
continued.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, GE's shares fell $1.35 to a one-month low of
$37.45 one day after Bill Gross, manager of the world's biggest bond
fund, said he would no longer own the conglomerate's short-term debt
because he believes the company is too heavily leveraged.</LD>
<LD>   Gross, chief bond investor at Newport Beach-based Pacific
Investment Management Co., on Wednesday also questioned whether GE
has been "totally forthcoming" in explaining how it has produced
earnings growth of at least 15% a year for decades.</LD>
<TE>   In response Thursday, GE Capital said it plans to sell about $25
billion of longer-term notes and bonds in the second quarter to
reduce its reliance on short-term debt, or commercial paper.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating firms have echoed Gross' concerns about GE Capital's
short-term debt, which recently stood at $103 billion. Short-term
debt is less expensive than long-term debt, but heavy use of
short-term debt can leave a firm vulnerable to a sudden credit
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial paper accounts for 42% of GE Capital's debt, "a higher
portion ... than we normally would like," said Keith Sherin, GE's
chief financial officer. The note and bond sales will replace a chunk
of that debt, GE said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fannie Mae, the biggest U.S. mortgage buyer, said GE is
hypocritical in lobbying for more disclosure from
government-sponsored mortgage companies.</TE>
<TE>   GE, which competes with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in buying
mortgages and packaging them into securities sold to investors, helps
fund FM Watch, a group that is pushing for more controls on
government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   The two have an unfair advantage in lending, FM Watch says,
because their government sponsorship lets them borrow at rates near
the U.S. Treasury's cost of funds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the ultimate in hypocrisy for GE to be going in there
talking about our disclosure," said Robert McCarson, Fannie Mae's
director of corporate relations. "We know less about the financial
condition of GE Capital than we do about any bank." GE declined to
comment.</TE>

<HD>ICN Raises Offering to $390 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drug maker ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. will seek to raise as much as
$390 million through an initial public offering for its Ribapharm
Inc. unit, increasing the size of the stock sale by about 30%, a
regulatory document disclosed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as last month, ICN indicated in documents that it
would seek to generate as much as $300 million by selling shares of
Ribapharm, which makes the hepatitis drug ribavirin. The IPO at that
time called for the sale of 20million Ribapharm shares at $13 to $15
each.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping the share price the same, ICN will now market 26million
Ribapharm shares, according to the latest documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. ICN, based in Costa Mesa, will
hold an 82.7% stake in Ribapharm after the offering.</LD>
<TE>   Ribavirin is marketed in the U.S., the European Union and Japan by
Schering-Plough Ltd. ICN's royalties from the sale of ribavirin by
Schering-Plough totaled $139 million last year.</TE>

<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to intense lobbying from television, movie and music
companies, an influential U.S. senator introduced a bill to require
protections against copyright infringement in many new electronic
devices and software.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings,
(D-S.C.), would give manufacturers, consumer groups and copyright
holders 12 to 18 months to devise a standard technology that would
protect against unauthorized uses of digital films, music and other
copyrighted works.</LD>
<LD>   If the groups failed to agree on such technology, the Federal
Communications Commission would have a year to come up with a
standard.</LD>
<TE>   Although strongly supported by Hollywood and the record labels,
the proposal faces stiff opposition from consumer electronics
companies and the information technology industry, as well as leaders
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the bill is far too broad and that Congress should
leave such complex technology issues to the private sector.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Morris Cos. said a federal jury in Rhode Island ruled in favor
of its U.S. tobacco unit in a lawsuit brought by the wife of a smoker
who sought damages for his death.</LD>
<LD>   Judith Hyde sought $1.9 million in compensation in the death of
her husband, Walter, claiming the company failed to warn him of
possible health hazards when he began smoking as a teenager in 1959.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Mary Lisi ruled that the jury could only
decide whether the company had a duty to warn Walter Hyde of possible
health hazards between 1959 and 1964, when the U.S. Surgeon General
issued a finding that cigarette smoking may cause lung cancer in men.</LD>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares closed up $1.28, at $53.31 on the NYSE.</TE>

<TE>   Ford Motor Co. said it had stopped shipping many of its
best-selling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to dealers
because of a defective part in their four-wheel-drive systems.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the vehicles involved were contained at the plant, Ford
spokesman Ed Lewis said. He could not say how many vehicles were
affected or when the problem was first detected.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis identified the four-wheel-drive SUVs being held at the
plants as the Ford Explorer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. The
trucks affected were the Ranger and most versions of the F-Series
pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Ford said it developed a no-emissions version of its
Focus small car and plans to start production in 2004. A Focus FCV
prototype will be shown next week at the New York International Auto
Show, Ford said. The car is powered by hydrogen fuel cells and
electric batteries that are recharged during braking.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares rose 20 cents to $16.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

$83.9 million, or $1.09 cents a share, vs. a net loss of $33.9
million, or 52 cents, a year ago, boosted by strong holiday sales
despite a soft retailing climate. Operating profit was $1.35 a share,
up from $1.21 a year ago, a penny better than analysts' average
estimate. Sales grew 13% to $1.82 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * Carnival Corp.'s fiscal first-quarter profit rose 1.3% to $129.6

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Senate committee narrowly passed legislation that would limit
employer stock in 401(k) plans, a response to hundreds of Enron Corp.
workers who lost their retirement savings last year because they
heavily invested in company stock.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrat-controlled Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee passed the bill along party lines, with
Republicans arguing that the legislation would prompt companies to
stop matching contributions or cease offering 401(k) plans
altogether.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, sponsored by committee chairman Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.), would let employers make matching contributions to
their employees' plans with company stock or let workers buy the
stock as a retirement investment option, but not both. The bill also
would require that workers and plan participants be represented on a
board overseeing retirement plans.</LD>

<LD>L90 Inc., a Marina del Rey Internet marketing company, said its chief

accounting by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   CFO Thomas Sebastian had been on administrative leave since March

<LD>   The SEC issued subpoenas to L90 and one of its directors in

L90's purchase by Los Angeles-based EUniverse had been postponed in

<HD>Andersen Units in Deals With Rivals</HD>
<DH>Merger: Talks with KPMG continue despite defection of three
foreign affiliates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm's efforts to transfer its overseas
operations to KPMG frayed Thursday when three important foreign
affiliates bolted for rival companies and a senior Ernst &amp; Young
executive launched a campaign to pick off Andersen practices
worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen partnerships in Hong Kong and China said Thursday that
they planned to merge with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Russian
practice plans to merge with Ernst &amp; Young.</LD>
<LD>   "We are interested in talking to Andersen practices all over the
world except in the United States," Bill Kimsey, the London-based
chief executive of Ernst &amp; Young Global, said in an interview. "We
have already contacted many of the offices."</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the defection of the Andersen's offices in Hong
Kong, which is an international financial center, and in China, an
important emerging market, was significant but not necessarily a deal
breaker.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has a tentative agreement to merge its overseas operation
with KPMG as it deals with the fallout of its audit of Enron Corp.
and a federal obstruction of justice indictment for destroying
documents sought in the probe of the energy trader's accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would preserve most of Andersen Worldwide, an
international confederation of 84 member accounting partnerships,
under the KPMG banner while Andersen's U.S. practice deals with the
criminal indictment, other investigations and lawsuits arising from
its Enron work.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG and Andersen executives said their plan was moving forward,
notwithstanding Thursday's defections.</TE>
<TE>   They are taking the broad outline of their agreement to the
individual firms in each country, a process that will take several
more weeks, said George Ledwith, a KPMG spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But Kimsey at Ernst &amp; Young said the other big accounting firms
remained interested in obtaining as much of Andersen's international
business that they can.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone knows how this will go," Kimsey said. "I do
think the Andersen partners need to move quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is seeing a steady erosion of its business in the United
States, losing about 50 major clients.</TE>
<TE>   The decline is less precipitous at its international offices, in
part because they are expected to merge with other firms and don't
appear to carry the staggering liability claims Andersen faces
domestically.</TE>
<TE>   "We have studied the situation, and if there is a problem we
believe it is with the U.S. practice," Kimsey said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu broke off merger
talks with the U.S. practice because they could not find a way around
the liability issue.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's practice in Spain, which has signaled it wanted to shed
the Andersen name quickly, will provide a key test for the KPMG plan,
said Jonathan Hamilton, editor of Public Accounting Report, an
industry newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "If Spain decides to go with someone other than KPMG, that would
be a clear signal that this is going to be every man for himself and
that each of the offices will seek to cut the best deal that they
can," said Hamilton, who believes a decision out of the Spanish
practice could come within the next week.</TE>
<TE>   "If any of the European firms bolt, that will be a real blow to
this deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman called the decision by the three offices to
leave the network "regrettable."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard also said that the foreign
affiliates are "not at liberty to simply opt out" without paying
remuneration.</TE>
<TE>   "They have clear contractual obligations," Leonard said, although
he did not disclose details. "We presume they will fulfill their
commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ernst &amp; Young nor PricewaterhouseCoopers provided
information on the financial details of transactions, except to
describe them as mergers or business combinations.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kimsey said the merger will double the size of Ernst &amp;
Young's Russian practice to 56 partners.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young does about $50 million of business in Russia
annually.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Andersen's Russian revenue was more than $50 million.
Andersen clients in Russia include two of the country's largest oil
producers and Aeroflot, the national airline.</TE>
<TE>   The combined practice will be the largest in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the company's decision to join Ernst &amp; Young, Hans
Jochum Horn, the general director of Arthur Andersen ZAO in Russia,
said in a statement that "Ernst &amp; Young's firm culture is much like
our own, and its international support network offers our clients the
essential support they need."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen executives in China issued a statement that said they
were upset by "the events affecting Andersen in the USA" but that
"joining PricewaterhouseCoopers offers great opportunities and
benefits for our firm, our people and, above all, our clients."</TE>
<TE>   Any of these deals may face challenges by attorneys in the
class-action and federal pension lawsuits against Andersen and senior
Enron management, as well as from a group that holds $200 million in
Andersen notes that is concerned about repayment.</TE>

<HD>Asbestos Was Not Used in Kleenex, Maker Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kimberly-Clark Corp. acknowledged Thursday that it did buy asbestos
from Union Carbide for use in a paper product decades ago, but said
the asbestos was not used in Kleenex, only in paper it made for use
as a sandpaper backing.</LD>
<LD>   Kimberly-Clark said it stopped production of the sandpaper backing
in the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   A Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman released additional information
Thursday that the company said shows it could not have been the
asbestos customer touted in a Carbide memo recently discovered in
litigation as saving money by using the carcinogenic mineral fiber as
a softening agent in tissue.</LD>
<TE>   "We can say with certainty that the company cited in the bulletin
was not Kimberly-Clark," said spokeswoman Tina Barry. "All of the
tissue machines we owned at the time were larger--produced a wider
paper than were cited in the bulletin."</TE>
<TE>   Union Carbide's Asbestos Information Bulletin, a memo believed to
be from the late 1960s, describes an effort to market asbestos for
use as a cheap softener in tissues. The memo suggests that at least
one paper maker bought asbestos from Union Carbide for use in tissue,
but it does not name the company.</TE>
<TE>   "This trial indicated that this paper company can save $174,000
per year in their facial operation alone," the memo says. "Result of
this work with this paper company: The company now uses asbestos in
all products--tissue, towels and facial tissue."</TE>
<TE>   The memo also refers to "Clark softness values," which led at
least one lawyer representing asbestos victims to suspect
Kimberly-Clark.</TE>
<TE>   But Barry said that phrase refers to J.A. Clark, a man who
developed one of several tissue softness tests but had no association
with Kimberly-Clark. Kimberly-Clark never used J.A. Clark's test,
Barry said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Golf Properties Inc.'s largest outside shareholder urged the
company to abandon a plan to merge with American Golf Corp., a
related company that operates the golf course owner's properties.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the Santa Monica-based company's board, Cliffwood
Partners offered an alternative proposal that would have National
Golf find other managers to replace American Golf.</LD>
<LD>   A decline in American Golf's business has kept it from making rent
payments and triggered a default on both companies' debt. American
Golf leases 133 of National Golf's 137 courses.</LD>
<TE>   "The proposed merger would permanently bind the company to its
problematic operator, which would only compound the issues that led
to the company's current state of disarray," Cliffwood wrote in his
letter dated March 19. Cliffwood, based in Los Angeles, holds a 9%
stake in National Golf.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Paul, National Golf's interim chief executive, said the
company is committed to the merger. Terms of the deal, announced last
month, haven't been disclosed.</TE>

<HD>McKesson Faces Suit Over Sales Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McKesson Corp. is being sued by a former chairman of HBO &amp; Co., who
says executives tricked him into buying shares in the merged
companies before accounting fraud led to a 1999 plunge in the stock
price.</LD>
<LD>   Holcombe Green was chairman of HBOC, a health-care software
company, for 10 years until San Francisco-based McKesson bought it
for $13.9 billion in January 1999. Three months later, McKesson HBOC
Inc., as it was known, said it would restate income because HBO
prematurely booked more than $40million in sales before the merger.
The stock price fell and the firm lost $9 billion in market value.</LD>
<LD>   Green's suit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta,
says McKesson and HBOC knew that other HBOC executives had inflated
the company's revenue. The suit seeks $100 million in damages.</LD>
<TE>   Shares McKesson rose 67 cents to $37.93 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Citibank Enters China's Consumer Banking Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Citibank on Thursday became the first international bank to offer
financial services to Chinese customers, a significant step to open
China's ailing financial system to more competition.</LD>
<LD>   For the time being, business with Chinese depositors is restricted
to foreign currency. But under the terms of the World Trade
Organization, which China joined in December, foreign banks will be
free to deal in the local currency in five years.</LD>
<LD>   "China's economic success over the past two decades has raised the
living standards of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens," said
Richard Stanley, Citibank China's country corporate officer. "We
expect that the market for consumer banking services here will grow
steadily in the coming years."</LD>
<TE>   With Thursday's Citibank opening and future actions by foreign
banks, China no longer can claim a monopoly over one of the world's
largest personal savings markets. Chinese citizens have nearly $1
trillion stashed away.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, non-Chinese banks could conduct business only with
non-Chinese residents or foreign companies. Citibank may be the first
to broaden its role, but it is not expected to be alone. Despite red
tape, more than 100 international banks already are in the country,
lining up for what they see as the post-WTO gold rush.</TE>
<TE>   Local banks have not been able to take advantage of their special
position. Victims of central planning, state banks lumber along,
practically insolvent. Massive loans to bankrupt state-owned
enterprises vanish down the drain. Even the best-managed
institutions, such as the Bank of China, are dogged with crippling
debts and corruption scandals that undermine their credibility.
Competitive financial services remain as foreign as profit making.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the international banks think they have an edge.</TE>
<TE>   Their target audience is the country's new rich, people such as
Tang Haisong, the Harvard-educated founder and chief executive of
Internet portal ETang.com. Citibank picked him as its first Chinese
customer Thursday to open an account at its new branch in the
historic Peace Hotel along Shanghai's fabled waterfront known as the
Bund.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of corporate parent
Citigroup Inc., played a cameo role, acting as the Shanghainese's
personal banker.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strength is service, service, service," said Linda Wong, head
of the bank's consumer banking division in China.</TE>
<TE>   But it might not be enough. Beijing imposes tough regulatory
restrictions on new operations, and officials are notorious for
dragging their feet. Without a bigger network of branches, it's hard
for foreign banks to gain domestic customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Conventional wisdom says the foreigners are here and Chinese
banks are going down," said Huang Zemin, an economics professor at
Shanghai's East Normal University. "I don't think so. Foreigners have
their strengths but so do we. Sure, my neighborhood bank has lousy
service. But I don't want to trek all the way to the Bund to make a
deposit."</TE>
<TE>   Citibank's foray into the Middle Kingdom is reminiscent of 1902,
when under the name International Banking Corp. it was the first
American bank to set up shop in colonial Shanghai's waterfront
financial center. It fled China after the Communists took power in
1949 and returned in the 1980s when market reforms reopened the
country to the outside world.</TE>

<LD>Consumer prices rose last month at the same pace as in January and

<LD>   Consumer prices rose 0.2% in February, matching the previous

Department said. The four-week moving average, considered a more
reliable measure of employment conditions because it irons out weekly
fluctuations, edged up to 379,000 from 376,500, but remained under
the key 400,000 level. A breach of that level is considered a sign of
recession.</LD>
<TE>   Two other reports Thursday pointed to further growth in the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators was
unchanged in February after four straight increases. And the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index showed manufacturing
expanded this month, but at a slower rate than in February.</TE>
<TE>   While the overall consumer price index rose as expected, the
so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy,
rose a larger-than-expected 0.3%. Consumers paid more for clothing,
medical care and tobacco in February, stoking the largest rise in
core inflation in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer prices last year showed the smallest increase since 1998
because of a fall in the cost of energy. That may change in coming
months.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing costs rose 0.5% in February, the biggest gain since March
of last year, after a 0.7% decrease in January. Prices of women's
clothing and shoes rose last month.</TE>
<TE>   Food prices, which account for almost one-fifth of the index,
increased for a second straight month in February, led by higher
prices for fruits, vegetables, chicken and beef.</TE>
<TE>   New-car prices dropped 0.9% in February.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Judge Considers Mediator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Houston told attorneys she is considering naming a
mediator to drive a potential settlement of legal claims against
Andersen, the embattled former accounting firm for Enron Corp.,
according to sources close to the case.</LD>
<LD>   The move by U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon came in
response to a request from Enron creditors during a private
conference call Thursday. The appointment could position creditors to
collect a quick settlement before Andersen's available resources
decline any further.</LD>
<LD>   But the naming of a mediator has come under fire from some Enron
shareholders who filed class-action litigation against the accounting
giant, according to one attorney close to the case.</LD>
<TE>   In essence, the creditors' push to consolidate claims against
Andersen under one mediator represents an end-run around the
shareholders' attorneys, legal analysts said. For shareholders,
mediation could lead to lower financial recoveries from Andersen and
other potential defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Luc A. Despins, an attorney for the creditors' committee, declined
to comment. Attorneys for Enron, which filed for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2, did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Andersen declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But plaintiffs have little incentive to agree to a settlement
before they have determined how much liability Andersen and other
defendants bear, or the extent of their assets, said one attorney
close to the case.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California Board of Regents, the lead plaintiff
in the class-action case, would be "happy to participate in mediation
efforts," said spokesman Trey Davis. "Without knowing the full
liability of defendants in this case or our class' options for
substantial recovery, it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of such a mediation."</TE>
<TE>   The university system lost an estimated $145 million in pension
and endowment funds in the Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The private conference call illustrated how various factions
involved in the case are jockeying for position as Andersen--seen as
the richest possible legal target for investors who lost billions of
dollars in Enron's collapse--is itself reeling. The accounting giant
has lost dozens of clients and is struggling to transfer its
international affiliates to rival KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Enron said it believes Andersen is liable in the
energy trader's downfall and said the two companies have engaged in
settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   But an attorney for Enron's bankruptcy estate said the
class-action plaintiffs have excluded him from their own negotiations
with Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Enron shareholders preferred to negotiate with Andersen
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The push for a mediator could be part of a longer-range strategy
by creditors who may face their own potential legal liability in the
case. One such creditor is J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which arranged
oil and gas purchases from Enron through an offshore company.</TE>
<TE>   If Enron shareholders obtain a large court judgment against
Andersen and other defendants, the accounting giant could become
insolvent and shift liability for the damages to the others. By
pushing an early settlement of claims against Andersen, J.P. Morgan
Chase reduces the chance of such an outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, an insurance company that had balked at paying as
much as $30 million in legal fees for Enron's current and former
directors has agreed to pay the bills resulting from lawsuits over
Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   But insurance firm Aegis said in a court filing Friday that it
would revoke the coverage if the company finds that claims were based
on misrepresentations. Aegis added that it believes some of the
information it was given to underwrite the policies was "inaccurate
and false."</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who previously declined
to force Aegis to advance money to the directors, scheduled a hearing
for April 11.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Hearing Tackles Broader Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. executives emerged relatively unscathed Thursday
from their debut on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are investigating
the telecommunication firm's bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Members of a House Financial Services subcommittee said Global
Crossing's demise, like that of energy giant Enron Corp., raised
serious questions about aggressive accounting methods, inadequate
disclosure to investors and excessive executive compensation.</LD>
<LD>   "The failure of Global Crossing, Enron, etc., is a powerful
reminder that this is not just about the foibles of one or two
companies, but it's about fundamental weaknesses that afflict our
financial reporting system," said Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.).</LD>
<TE>   But the first congressional hearing over Global Crossing was less
pointed and confrontational than the often-hostile Enron proceedings,
at which lawmakers launched blistering attacks and openly questioned
the witnesses' truthfulness.</TE>
<TE>   With a few exceptions, committee members limited themselves to
broader questions about accounting, corporate governance or
disclosure issues at Global Crossing and industrywide.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Chief Executive John J. Legere and Chief Financial
Officer Dan J. Cohrs were not pressed to defend or explain the
details of specific deals under investigation. The executives dodged
many questions by noting that an investigation into the company's
collapse is pending at the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which now operates primarily from
Madison, N.J., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Jan. 28
after spending $15 billion to create a worldwide fiber-optic network
to carry telephone, broadcast and Internet services.</TE>
<TE>   Legere characterized Global Crossing as the victim of an
industrywide slump, caused by overcapacity and falling prices.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Legere said he was happy that committee members
"were taking an approach looking at the business issues underlying
the industry ... and what policy would be [enacted] to make changes."</TE>
<TE>   He and others at Global Crossing continue to reject comparisons to
Enron. In his written testimony, Legere said flatly, "Global Crossing
is no Enron."</TE>
<TE>   But a fired Global Crossing finance vice president, Roy Olofson,
has accused Global Crossing of inflating its revenue by pursuing
questionable swap deals with other telecommunications companies to
buy and sell excess capacity on their networks. The SEC and FBI are
investigating the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that swaps are being used as a quick and easy way to
inflate earnings and make a company look more profitable than it
really is," said Rep. Sue W. Kelly (R-N.Y.), who chairs the oversight
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.) said it appeared that Global
Crossing booked revenue in a current quarter to reflect the sale of
broadband capacity for a portion of the network that was not yet
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   But such issues were not explored during the question-and-answer
session, which focused instead on the loss of an estimated 9,000
jobs. Only three questions were asked about the allegations made by
Olofson, who was unable to testify at Thursday's hearing. And most
lawmakers seemed to accept the explanations by Legere and Cohrs, who
insisted that the swaps were fully disclosed to investors and
approved by the company's auditor, Andersen. The Chicago accounting
firm also is under fire for reviewing Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing executives stopped short of repudiating Olofson's
charges as they have in the past. Previously, company executives
vehemently denied his accusations and characterized him as a
disgruntled former employee attempting to blackmail the company with
a lawsuit over his firing.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Legere said only that Global Crossing's board was
investigating Olofson's charges.</TE>
<TE>   "These forums, as difficult as they may be, are a very critical
part of us moving through this restructuring process and clearing our
name," Legere said.</TE>
<TE>   The most heated exchange of the morning hearing occurred when Rep.
Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio) took a slap at Legere's
multimillion-dollar salary package and contrasted it with the plight
of laid-off Global Crossing workers whose severance payments were cut
off by the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   After twice demanding that Legere publicly state his
compensation--$1.1 million in salary and a $3.5-million bonus--Jones
asked Legere to calculate how many laid-off workers could have been
retained by using his bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "As a rule, I don't do math in public," Legere responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you pull out a calculator and do it for me, please?" Jones
said. "I'm not looking for smart answers, sir. You're here to help
Congress come up with some decisions about how they handle this
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Legere said he didn't take the exchange personally. "All
the information about my salary is public knowledge ... and whether
or not I'm worth my salary can't be determined yet."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) compared Global Crossing's
bookkeeping to "nothing more than a much more fancy and much larger
Ponzi scheme."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he was refraining from quizzing executives about their
actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the answers I'm getting," he said. "I don't think
we're going to get the answers. I don't think this is the greatest
forum. I think the SEC and the appropriate legal jurisdictions will
be the ones who will ask tougher questions and will get the
appropriate answers. And I will have to trust them at this point in
time."</TE>
<TE>   Also testifying about their companies' accounting methods and
transactions with Global Crossing were Afshin Mohebbi, president of
Qwest Communications International Inc.; Michael Salsbury, general
counsel of WorldCom Inc.; and Andrew McGrath, president of service
providers channel at Cable &amp; Wireless Global.</TE>

<HD>KB Home's Earnings Climb 65%</HD>
<DH>Housing: Builder's fiscal first quarter results were helped
by mortgage rates near 30-year lows and a warm winter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN M. HOWLEY</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KB Home, the third-largest U.S. home builder by homes sold, said
earnings jumped 65% in its fiscal first-quarter, helped by low
mortgage rates and mild weather, and it expects 2002 profit to exceed
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the period ended Feb. 28 was $42.7 million, or 95
cents a share, up from $25.8 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, as
revenue increased 12% to $915.7million.</LD>
<LD>   KB Home, which changed its name from Kaufman &amp; Broad Corp. last
year, was expected to earn 79 cents a share for the quarter,
according to a poll by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based KB's home sales rose 10% in the quarter, to
5,081, including 734 homes in France, where its Kaufman &amp; Broad unit
is one of the largest builders. The average price of a home rose 2%
to $177,900.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic at the company's sales offices increased 7.4%, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for homes in the U.S. dropped 1% to 5,627 in the quarter,
excluding joint ventures, while orders in France surged 23% to 814,
the company said. In the U.S., KB builds in California, Arizona,
Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The backlog of homes ordered in the U.S. but not yet delivered
rose to 10,451 from 10,447 at an average price of $190,808, 6% higher
than a year earlier. In France, the backlog rose 8.5% to 2,092, and
the average price dropped 9% to $140,428.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Bruce Karatz told investors that the company will
earn $6.10 a share to $6.25 a share in fiscal 2002, compared with its
earlier forecast of $5.75 to $6.10. Analysts were expecting earnings
of $5.68 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. home builders have been helped by mortgage rates near 30-year
lows and the fifth-warmest winter in more than a century. Declining
unemployment and other signs the economy is expanding have more
economists saying the Federal Reserve may start raising interest
rates, making it more expensive to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's supercomposite home building index has
fallen 11% from a peak on March 6, as investors anticipate higher
rates.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home shares fell 95 cents to $40.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>DaimlerChrysler Settles 'Lemon' Suit</HD>
<DH>Autos: Agreement to pay $325,000 to California DMV is
decried as too lenient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler has settled a long-running lawsuit brought by the
California Department of Motor Vehicles, agreeing to pay the DMV
$325,000 in a "lemon" law case that alleged the auto maker resold
defective vehicles to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was immediately criticized by consumer advocates as
too lenient.</LD>
<LD>   The company admitted no wrongdoing and was able to put an end to a
suit filed by the DMV in 1994 alleging that the then-Chrysler Corp.
repurchased and resold 119 defective Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge and
Jeep vehicles without telling buyers of their histories of problems
and in some cases without repairing them.</LD>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler denied it concealed defects in cars it
repurchased. "We have always complied with California lemon laws in
terms of disclosing vehicles' repair history and sharing those with
customers," DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Ann Smith said Thursday.
"We're certainly pleased we finally reached an agreement to this
long-standing dispute."</TE>
<TE>   After initially denying that there was a settlement, the DMV
issued a brief statement late Thursday acknowledging the payment,
which went to attorney fees and investigation costs to settle the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, the DMV dropped the 45-day suspension
of the company's license to do business in California that it had
been seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy to have it resolved," DMV Director Steven Gourley
said. "It has gone on now through four different DMV directors, and
it was time to get it resolved. We think any manufacturer will think
twice about trying to bring lemon vehicles into California."</TE>
<TE>   Car buyers and consumer advocates expressed disappointment with
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty shocking. That's not very much money," said Terri
Skogebo, a schoolteacher in Antelope whose 1989 Plymouth Colt Vista
was one of the 119 cars involved in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "That's truly a superficial amount and really a victory for
Chrysler, if they get away without admitting guilt," said Harvey
Botwin, a professor of economics at Pitzer College in Claremont who
teaches a course called "Cars and Culture."</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Shahan, president of the Sacramento-based advocacy group
Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, agreed that Chrysler got
off easy. "I'm sorry Chrysler wasn't banned for at least one day,
because what they did was endanger people, and I don't think the
penalty fits the crime," Shahan said.</TE>
<TE>   California has one of the nation's first lemon laws,enacted in the
early 1980s. Under the law, new vehicles on which repairs have been
unsuccessfully attempted four times--or two times in the case of
life-threatening defects--or that have been out of service for 30
days during the first 18 months or 18,000 miles must be repurchased
by the manufacturer and have their titles branded as "lemon law
buyback."</TE>
<TE>   The vehicles then may be resold, sometimes in the same state, but
must be identified as lemons. That generally brings the price down
about 25%, said Clarence Ditlow, head of the consumer advocacy group
Center for Auto Safety. Financial reasons can spur people to buy cars
they know are damaged, if the price is low.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler has been hit with a number of lemon verdicts
recently. In April, a jury in Illinois awarded $81,000 to a consumer
who was sold a new Jeep Cherokee that had been damaged before
purchase. In December, an Ohio jury ordered DaimlerChrysler to pay a
woman $237,000 in damages for selling her a 1996 Chrysler Sebring
that turned out to be laundered lemon.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler has not been alone in such cases. In December,
Ford Motor Co. was ordered by a jury to pay a Fresno County couple
$10 million for reselling them a used Taurus that Ford knew was
defective, reportedly the largest award in a civil case of lemon
laundering.</TE>
<TE>   The jury said Ford had violated state law and committed fraud by
repeatedly taking back defective vehicles from customers and
reselling them while concealing their troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's endemic across the auto industry," Ditlow said. In 1995, an
estimated 100,000 lemon cars were bought back by manufacturers and

<LD>Technology stocks rose Thursday as investors picked up beaten-down
bellwethers such as Intel, but blue chips wavered on mixed economic
news and continued questions about General Electric's finances.</LD>
<LD>   "We just got a reality check with the [economic] statistics that
came out," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine
Asset Management.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average recovered from an early
147-point loss to close down 21.73 points, or 0.2%, at 10,479.84. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, also down most of the session, finished
up 1.74 points, or 0.2%, at 1,153.59. The Nasdaq composite index
advanced 35.96 points, or 2%, to 1,868.83.</LD>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 17 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
said factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region posted a third
straight month of growth in March, but that activity declined from
nearly two-year peaks seen in February.</TE>
<TE>   Other data showed U.S. consumer prices rose for a second month in
a row and fewer workers are seeking jobless aid, adding to evidence
the economy is growing. But the index of leading economic indicators
was unchanged in February, ending a four-month string of increases.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the data relieved some concerns that the Federal Reserve
might boost short-term interest rates soon. Long-term bond yields
pulled back after rising in the morning. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note fell to 5.36% from 5.41% Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   GE slid $1.35 to $37.45. The slump came a day after Bill Gross,
manager of the world's largest bond fund, said his firm, Pacific
Investment Management of Newport Beach, will not own GE's short-term
debt. He said GE is disclosing too little to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "GE has not had the most transparent accounting," said Hershel
Cohen, manager of the Smith Barney Appreciation fund. "It's a good
company, but could the stock come under pressure? Certainly."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Gateway Exec Says Microsoft Threatened Firm</HD>
<DH>Courts: Software giant's attorneys force witness in penalty
trial to back away from some testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A former executive of Gateway Inc. testified Thursday that Microsoft
Corp. threatened to stop licensing its Windows operating system to
Gateway after the company balked at renewing its licenses for other
Microsoft products.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Ashkin, who was Gateway's chief technology officer, alleged
that the software giant pressured Gateway to renew its license for
Microsoft's lucrative office productivity software by threatening to
end Gateway's license deal for Microsoft's flagship Windows operating
system.</LD>
<LD>   Ashkin, testifying during the fourth day of a federal trial to
determine penalties against Microsoft for antitrust violations, also
said Microsoft threatened to remove Gateway from a list of vendors
that Microsoft utilized to buy computers for its employees.</LD>
<TE>   He said a Microsoft representative told him that Gateway was
considered a "bad partner" because it offered the rival PC operating
system software Linux on some computers.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorneys fired back by calling Ashkin, now president of
product strategy at Microsoft rival AOL Time Warner Inc., a biased
and untruthful witness.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted with a transcript of an earlier deposition,
Ashkin, one of only two computer company executives who have
testified against the software company, conceded retribution for
selling Linux wasn't the reason Gateway was pulled off Microsoft's
list of preferred vendors. He said Microsoft told Gateway that it was
removed because it lacked a substantial international presence and
did not have a product line that catered to large businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Ashkin also backed away from his other claim under
cross-examination by Microsoft attorney Richard Pepperman. Ashkin
conceded that he wasn't aware of any document from Microsoft
threatening to terminate Gateway's license.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's proceedings were a setback for California and eight
other states seeking stiffer antitrust punishment of Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The states want presiding U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly to make Microsoft offer a modular version of its
flagship Windows software that would allow PC makers and consumers to
select their own substitutes for so-called middleware products such
as Web browsers and media players.</TE>
<TE>   But Kollar-Kotelly has put increasing pressure on the states to
rein in their case. In her latest move, Kollar-Kotelly excluded the
entire supplemental written testimony by Michael Tiemann, an
executive at Microsoft rival Red Hat Inc., a distributor of Linux.
The judge said the testimony was irrelevant and added that Microsoft
was not given enough time by the states to review the document.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV Suit Accuses Radio Host of Piracy</HD>
<DH>Courts: Sports anchor on Don Imus show said on the air that
he used a hacked security card for free satellite access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're watching satellite TV at home but not paying for it, it's
probably not a good idea to brag about it on the radio.</LD>
<LD>   Especially not if you're on the "Imus in the Morning" show, which
has a national audience of 10 million ... and the show is being
simulcast nationally on cable TV network MSNBC ... and you work for
Viacom, a major supplier of programming to satellite TV services.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Sid Rosenberg, the sports anchor on Don Imus'
morning show and a weekday host at WFAN-AM in New York, crowed on the
air March 11 that he receives DirecTV for free by using a hacked
security card. In response, DirecTV on Thursday sued Rosenberg for
theft of services.</LD>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Rosenberg told Imus that he paid "Bobby
Zaps" $40 to "zap" the security card in his DirecTV receiver. "Then
you get every sporting event and every movie and everything for the
rest of the year," the lawsuit quotes Rosenberg saying on the
program.</TE>
<TE>   The largest satellite TV service in America, DirecTV has no sense
of humor about piracy. It has sued more than 100 consumers using
hacked cards, sent warnings to more than 6,300 others, and attempted
to kill the hacked cards electronically.</TE>
<TE>   "He's breaking the law," said DirecTV spokesman Bob Marsocci. "And
he admitted it on radio, on national television....It's pretty
compelling when you listen to or when you read his ongoing bragging
and boasting about stealing our programming."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for
WFAN-AM's parent company, Viacom subsidiary Infinity Broadcasting
Corp., said, "This lawsuit is between Sid Rosenberg and DirecTV. WFAN
does not condone breaking the law under any circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   The station hasn't taken any action against Rosenberg, who joined
Imus' show last year. Rosenberg has cultivated the image of a "shock
jock."</TE>
<TE>   Radio stations often defend their hosts--and themselves--against
suits prompted by controversial commentary. But Rosenberg appears to
be on his own, and if he loses the suit, he faces penalties of up to
$10,000 per violation, plus attorney fees.</TE>

<HD>SEC Chief Pushes for Proposed Audit Panel</HD>
<DH>Reform: Chairman Harvey Pitt reiterates opposition to
excluding accounting industry members from a new oversight board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's top securities regulator Thursday sought to convince
Congress that a proposed new accounting board would have the
authority to improve industry oversight.</LD>
<LD>   But Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt,
testifying before a Senate committee, stood by his previous proposal
that the new board include members from the accounting profession.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt said the industry members would be a minority on the board,
but rival proposals call for a board with no industry ties. The
Public Oversight Board, which now helps oversee the profession but is
disbanding at the end of the month in protest of Pitt's plan, has
called for the establishment of a new watchdog panel that would be
totally independent of the industry.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it ill-advised to exclude them completely," Pitt said in
written testimony to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   He said his proposed Public Accountability Board would undertake
quality-control reviews to ensure that audits meet high professional
standards. Board members would initially be selected by the SEC, and
those added later would be subject to SEC review.</TE>
<TE>   The board would be funded by fees paid by auditing firms and by
public companies. By contrast, the current Public Oversight Board is
funded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Among other disciplinary powers, the new panel would have the
authority to force a company to change auditors, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC chairman's appearance before the Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs comes at a critical moment for the
accounting profession. Last week, federal prosecutors announced a
criminal indictment of accounting firm Andersen on a charge of
obstruction of justice connected to the shredding of Enron
Corp.-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are urging Pitt to move as fast as possible to restore
public and investor confidence in a profession that is one of the
cornerstones of the financial markets--certified public accountants.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'P' in CPA was put there for a purpose," Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd (D-Conn.) told Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd quizzed Pitt about a proposal to limit the movement of
independent auditors into jobs at client companies--a practice he
suggested could create conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm troubled about the so-called revolving door," Pitt said, but
he added it is "impossible for any of us to write a rule that will
deal with every set of circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt again urged Congress to avoid proposals to ban accounting
firms from offering consulting services to publicly held companies
they audit. "To create an 'audit-only' firm does not guarantee an
'audit failure-free' future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was both consultant and auditor for Enron at the same
time, an arrangement that critics say led to a conflict of interest
that ultimately may have delayed the timely disclosure of the energy
trader's financial weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said that a blanket ban on consulting by auditors would
backfire, but he acknowledged some limits would be useful. The
proliferation of auditor-consultants "can, and in a number of
situations clearly does, create conflicts that we ought to
eliminate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, a Senate panel said it will subpoena more records
from Enron and Andersen to document contacts the two firms had with
the White House and federal agencies. The Governmental Affairs
Committee will send the subpoenas to both companies and to 27 current
and former members of Enron's board since 1992, Leslie Phillips,
spokeswoman for Chairman Joseph Lieberman, said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>First Alliance Will Refund $60 Million</HD>
<DH>Financing: Lender, company founder to pay in settlement of
FTC suit that accused it of misleading borrowers about high fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Irvine lender's settlement of charges that it systematically
cheated 18,000 home equity borrowers will result in refunds of
$60million--the largest punishment for "predatory" home loan
practices in history, consumer protection officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement comes in the October 2000 lawsuit filed against
First Alliance Corp. by the Federal Trade Commission, a suit later
joined by California and five other states. It requires company
founder Brian Chisick to contribute $20million to a restitution fund.
Assets of First Alliance, which is being liquidated in bankruptcy
proceedings, will provide the balance of the settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Chisick, who owns 80% of First Alliance, neither admitted nor
denied wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   First Alliance shares closed unchanged Thursday at 12 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Many First Alliance borrowers were elderly people targeted for
sales pitches because they had considerable home equity and needed to
repay other debts.</TE>
<TE>   According to a barrage of private and government lawsuits,
including one by the AARP, First Alliance salespeople misled
borrowers into thinking they would pay no origination fees when in
fact those fees added 10% to 24% to the loan amount. In addition,
borrowers allegedly weren't told the initial rates on adjustable-rate
loans would quickly rise.</TE>
<TE>   "There was actually a training school set up by this company,
where they instructed personnel in how to rip people off," California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said. "They targeted the elderly with sales
promotions to find those who might be willing to risk their most
precious asset--their home--in exchange for some quick cash."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement covers 18,000 borrowers as far back as 1992. The
estimated $60-million repayment fund translates into an average of
$3,300 each--less than one-third the average origination fee
borrowers paid on a typical First Alliance loan, said Joel Winston, a
top financial-practices supervisor at the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   The borrowers potentially have another source of recovery--First
Alliance's Wall Street bankers, who funded the mortgages and bundled
them for sale as securities.</TE>
<TE>   Those roles are attacked in a racketeering lawsuit filed by
attorney Richard F. Scruggs, who helped obtain multibillion-dollar
settlements with tobacco companies, and law firm Milberg Weiss
Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, known for accusing companies and executives
of misleading investors.</TE>
<TE>   That lawsuit names as defendants Lehman Bros. Inc., Prudential
Securities Group Inc. and the securities operation of First Union
National Bank. It contends First Alliance's lenders not only knew of
its predatory practices, but encouraged them--an accusation the
lenders strongly deny.</TE>
<TE>   That litigation will be closely watched by the industry that
generates asset-backed securities--bonds backed by payments on
mortgages, credit cards, car loans and other revenue streams. It is a
booming business for Wall Street, with more than $1.28 trillion of
asset-backed securities trading.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the attention has focused on memos by a Lehman Bros.
executive who wrote of First Alliance: "It is a requirement to leave
your ethics at the door."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. spokesman William Ahearn, who has denied wrongdoing,
didn't return a phone call Thursday, and Lehman Bros. attorneys
couldn't be reached.</TE>
<TE>   First Alliance's general counsel, Jerry A. Hager, said the company
is "pleased to have reached a resolution" of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Chisick's lawyer, Ronald Rus, said his client is "relieved that
it's over" and pleased the "orderly liquidation of the company will
take place."</TE>
<TE>   Chisick and his wife, Sarah, agreed to be banned from the mortgage
origination business in the states involved in the settlement, and to
tighten limits on engaging in the activity elsewhere, FTC Chairman
Timothy J. Muris said.</TE>

<HD>Restoration Hardware Reports Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN SCHEIDNES</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Restoration Hardware Inc. fell 8.3% on Thursday after the
retailer reported a quarterly loss due to special charges and said it
will restate results for seven previous quarters.</LD>
<LD>   The Corte Madera, Calif.-based company postponed release of its
results Wednesday by one day and announced plans to restate earlier
results to reflect a change in the way it accounts for some revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Its shares dropped as much as $1.80, or 15%, in early Nasdaq
trading before recovering somewhat to close off 99 cents at $11.01.</LD>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware said it now will record revenue from
furniture and other large items shipped directly to customers when
the delivery is received, rather than when the items leave the
distribution center. Retailers have recorded revenue at shipment
rather than delivery as a normal course of doing business for years.</TE>
<TE>   The move is "not immaterial, but not a huge deal," Chief Financial
Officer Kevin Shahan said.</TE>
<TE>   The restatement will not affect cash, receivables, accounts
payable or debt, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the change in revenue from amounts previously
reported should not exceed $5 million in any quarter or $3.5million
for fiscal 2001, when the company generated sales of $367million.</TE>
<TE>   For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, Restoration Hardware
said it had a loss of $12.8 million, or 53 cents a share, after
charges of $17.8 million for depreciation, write-downs of certain
merchandise and tax allowance.</TE>

<HD>Ads Going Up in New Venues</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Video screens push products in elevators, stores
and food courts, but most advertisers have yet to be sold on the
concept.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Had enough elevator music? Make way for elevator advertising. And,
for that matter, advertising in mall food courts, offices, hotel
lobbies and at grocery store checkout counters.</LD>
<LD>   A growing number of marketers are using digital technology to push
their advertising messages on high-definition video screens in venues
where consumers gather.</LD>
<LD>   One pundit has dubbed the growing business of reaching consumers
when they're outside of the home as the "outernet." These advertising
networks typically blend commercial messages with news, sports and
weather feeds supplied by major media companies.</LD>
<TE>   The flurry of out-of-home advertising is spreading to 7-Eleven
convenience stores in Southern California, Ralphs grocery store
checkout counters and elevators in office buildings ranging from Two
California Plaza in downtown Los Angeles to the South Coast Metro
Center in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The outernet industry is pitching itself to advertisers that are
frustrated with the high cost of traditional media and the
never-ending search for advertising outlets that work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very chaotic advertising market right now, and that chaos
tends to work for us," said Charlie Nooney, chief executive of San
Francisco-based Premier Retail Networks Inc., which beams advertising
into shops operated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless technology can push advertising "anywhere you want, in
trains or in gondola cars at ski resorts," said Nancy Jackson, a vice
president with Westford, Mass.-based Captivate Network Inc., which
uses screens to reach consumers in elevators.</TE>
<TE>   The screens account for a tiny sliver of the $5.3-billion outdoor
advertising industry. But as the cost of digital technology drops,
screens that show television-like commercials are expected to make
inroads in the category.</TE>
<TE>   The still-evolving sector mirrors early attempts at
commercializing the Internet. The competitors are small, privately
held ventures that depend on private investments.</TE>
<TE>   Premier Retail Networks, with screens in 5,000 retail stores, has
accumulated $65 million in venture capital funding, and Captivate
Network, with screens in about 1,100 office buildings, has raised
about $100million.</TE>
<TE>   It's an expensive and potentially risky business because
technology continues to evolve rapidly. Revenue also is in short
supply because most advertisers have yet to be sold on the concept,
and competitors are spending heavily to create networks.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis-based Next Generation Network, for example, has raised
$60 million in venture capital, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, but also has generated about $70 million
in losses.</TE>
<TE>   The sector also faces potential regulatory hurdles. Companies that
use telephone lines to carry advertising to screens might face
federal pressure to restrict tobacco and alcohol ads. As outdoor
screens are installed, the industry probably will encounter the same
public pressure facing billboard companies.</TE>
<TE>   Big Players in Ad, Media Industries Enter the Fray</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Internet, though, the outernet's success doesn't depend
on consumers breaking away from the real world to visit far-flung Web
sites. Instead, operators hope to weave their pitch-filled screens
into the daily fabric of life. And despite the technological and
financing challenges, some important players in the advertising and
media industries have entered the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after retiring as General Motors Corp.'s top marketing and
advertising executive, Philip Guarascio surfaced as chairman of
AdSpace Networks Inc., a Burlingame, Calif.-based start-up that has
placed screens in the lobbies of Loews Cineplex movie theaters.
AdSpace also is partly owned by Kaleidoscope Sports &amp; Entertainment,
a company that's part-owned by advertising and marketing giant
Interpublic Group.</TE>
<TE>   Big media companies also are signing contracts to provide news
reports to the advertising networks. The Los Angeles Times and
KTLA-TV Channel 5, both owned by Tribune Co., are providing news
updates, as are the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-home advertising also is getting a boost from property
owners who hope to augment profit by leasing out unused space on an
elevator wall or above the pharmacy in a drugstore.</TE>
<TE>   The industry operates on a simple principle: Find out where
consumers are gathering and put a screen in their faces. Industry
players want your free time, whether it's a 20-second elevator ride
at work or a two-minute wait to pay for your groceries. Messages are
tailored to fit into the available window; some of the advertising
pitches run 10 seconds or less.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're standing in line waiting for a Big Mac and fries,
you've got nothing else to do," said Tracy Crocker, president of Next
Generation Network, which is installing advertising screens in
7-Elevens. "And you're going to remember those commercials more than
the ones you see sitting around at home watching your favorite TV
show because there are no distractions."</TE>
<TE>   Although the sector often is lumped in with billboards and other
out-of-home advertising options, industry players say their screens
are a close cousin of cable television because the systems promise to
deliver specific demographics rather than the broad audience a
well-placed billboard attracts.</TE>
<TE>   Captivate Network, for example, focuses on elevators and lobbies
of high-rise office buildings that are home to high-income
executives. BEVision is installing screens in beverage stores.</TE>
<TE>   Technology advances that continue to cut the costs of installing
screens and transmitting content and advertising are at the core of
the new advertising medium. Captivate Network uses wireless
local-area networks in elevator shafts to beam content and
advertising onto flat-panel screens mounted in elevators. In the late
1990s, the system required cumbersome wiring for each car, an
expensive and time-consuming process.</TE>
<TE>   The new technologies remove barriers that have kept advertisers
from reaching, say, commuter train passengers, said Captivate Network
executive Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Initial market research suggests that consumers are more apt to
see the electronic displays than traditional, static advertising.
Premier Retail Networks last year unveiled a Nielsen Media Research
study suggesting that customer recall for outernet advertising shown
on screens inside Wal-Mart locations surpasses rates for similar
advertising shown on television.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the technology promises to deliver a sense of
immediacy not possible with static displays. Competitors use dial-up
modems, T1 lines and satellites to deliver advertising and
content--either national or regional in nature--on a real-time basis.</TE>
<TE>   Industry Needs Data to Convince Advertisers</TE>
<TE>   Proximity to consumers is the selling point ad networks use to
market their service. Irvine-based Skytron Mall Television Network
boasts that its screens in mall food courts are "just aisles, not
miles, away from retailers' shelves." That ability to influence
shoppers moments before a purchase occurs is a potentially powerful
draw.</TE>
<TE>   Rates for the screen networks are in line with other outdoor ad
categories. It's far less expensive to use the new networks than
cable or broadcast television.</TE>
<TE>   But network operators hope to charge heftier rates as they build
their systems and convince media buyers that the screens can deliver.</TE>
<TE>   National advertisers, though, won't take the plunge until the
networks have enough screens to deliver their messages. Industry
players know they also must gather audited data proving that the
screens are a smart buy--or face the kind of pessimism many
advertisers exhibit for Internet ads.</TE>
<TE>   "If we put these screens in the right venues, deliver the audits
and surveys--and traditional media continues to splinter--we'll be in
a good spot," Crocker said.</TE>

<HD>'Wall Street Week' Will Be Without Rukeyser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis Rukeyser, host of TV's "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser,"
said Thursday that he would leave the investment show after its
producers asked him to take a smaller role on the program.</LD>
<LD>   Rukeyser said Maryland Public Television executives didn't want
him to continue as host and had asked him to become a senior
commentator. He said he intended to honor his contract, which ends in
June.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland Public Television wants to broaden the audience for "Wall
Street Week," which tends to have an older viewing base, said Jeff
Hankin, the company's vice president of marketing.</LD>
<TE>   "After talking with stations in the PBS system and viewers and
members, we were getting a clear message that the show needed to be
reinvented," Hankin said. He said the show's underwriters, including
brokerage A.G. Edwards Inc. and Oppenheimer Funds, had been told of
the change and "reaction has been positive."</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser "is obviously older, and most advertisers are looking for
a younger demographic," said Chris Geraci, director of national TV
buying at ad firm Omnicom Group's OMD unit.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland Public Television plans a new program that it will
co-produce with AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Fortune magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make this kind of change, you run the risk and high
probability of losing millions of viewers," said Frank Cappiello,
president of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello Inc. and a frequent
panelist on Rukeyser's show since its start in 1970. "I don't think
anyone combines his quick wit and devastating questions."</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser, 69, has been host of the show since it began. He also
publishes a monthly investment newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser said his phone "has been ringing off the hook with
attractive offers, and I will certainly consider all of them."</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Travelers Property Casualty Corp.'s initial public offering raised
$3.9 billion Thursday as the business insurance unit of Citigroup
sold 210 million shares at $18.50 each. The price was at the high end
of the range of $16 to $19 Travelers had projected.</TE>
<TE>   The IPO amounts to a 21% stake in Hartford, Conn.-based Travelers
and values the firm at $18.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was the fifth-biggest U.S. IPO, behind AT&amp;T Wireless
Services Inc., Kraft Foods Inc., United Parcel Service Inc. and
Conoco Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, which is jettisoning insurance to focus on banking and
other financial services, plans to distribute the remaining shares of
Travelers to Citigroup shareowners this year.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers shares will begin trading today on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol TAP/A. Citigroup shares rose 35 cents to
$49.60 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Federation of State and High School Assn. is close to
giving approval for high school baseball players to use titanium
bats.</LD>
<LD>   The organization's rules committee met Thursday in an emergency
teleconference to discuss authorizing use of titanium bats that the
National Federation has banned for more than 10 years. A decision
could be announced today.</LD>
<LD>   "The science and technology has changed," said Elliot Hopkins,
director of educational services for the Indianapolis-based National
Federation.</LD>
<TE>   High school umpires in Southern California have been preventing
players from using titanium bats this season even though the bats
were labeled as "high school approved." It led to calls of complaints
from parents who paid more than $250 for some of the bats. Bat
manufacturers have also lobbied for approval of the titanium bats.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Those NFL owners are at it again.</LD>
<LD>   They're questioning the commitment, the passion of sports fans in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   With Philip Anschutz at the head of a group that's considering
building a stadium downtown and Mayor James Hahn prepared to lobby on
the city's behalf, the right combination might be in place to lure a
football team to L.A.</LD>
<TE>   While NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue gives his usual political
appeasement to L.A. and the league office seems willing to help out,
the owners sound as if they'll respond only to the usual big deposits
in their coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Every time I start to miss pro football, I am reminded why I don't
miss having to deal with these people. I covered two games at Lambeau
Field this season and shook my head as I always do at the thought
that tiny Green Bay has an NFL team and we don't. I arrived at
Pittsburgh for the AFC championship game, saw the excitement coursing
through the town, where it seemed everyone was wearing black and gold
and waving Terrible Towels, and felt left out.</TE>
<TE>   Then at the NFL owners' meetings in Orlando, Fla., this week, they
showed their typical arrogant attitude about Los Angeles. Clearly
they haven't gotten over the fact that the groups bidding for the
32nd expansion franchise came $100 million short of Houston
billionaire Robert McNair's bid and that there wasn't any public
outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Wilson, co-owner of the Buffalo Bills, said, "There was so
much apathy the last time. It was like, 'Hey, NFL, you ought to feel
very, very lucky we let you in here.' That was the message."</TE>
<TE>   Were we supposed to parade down Wilshire Boulevard?</TE>
<TE>   It's not apathy, it's independence. We're one of the few major
cities that hasn't been suckered by the cult of the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   And if the only option is to take another city's reject, then we
face the prospect of getting stuck with the likes of the Spanos
family (San Diego Chargers) or the Irsay family (Indianapolis Colts).
Not exactly inspirational thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Are the fans here devoid of passion, as Baltimore Raven owner Art
Modell suggested?</TE>
<TE>   If the owners put down their drinks at their resort hotel long
enough to look at the box scores this week, they'd see the Clippers
sold out Staples Center for a Monday night game. Against the
going-nowhere Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, came a day after the Lakers sold out Staples to
play the Dallas Mavericks, which came the day after the Kings sold
out their game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Three teams in the
same building in three days with close to 60,000 fans among them.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson is that when competitive, entertaining teams play in
L.A., people will drop the suntan lotion and come to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Or if teams stick around long enough to establish a
tradition--instead of packing and running whenever a city waves a
sweetheart deal at them--fans will come out of sheer habit. After all
the turmoil and disappointment the Dodgers have put their fans
through in the last 10 years, the turnstiles at Chavez Ravine still
clicked 3 million times last season.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. fans weren't even deterred by the high cost of tickets and
parking at Staples. But the NFL owners notice only when the checks
have "NFL" in the payee line.</TE>
<TE>   They're still expecting you to turn over your tax dollars to them.
Then they'll want you to reach into your personal bank accounts for
them.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL already has a team in Chicago, and it's asking that city
for $400 million in bond funds to renovate Soldier Field. The league
and the Bears are chipping in $200 million toward the $600-million
project. Then the fans will have to pay $2,000 to $4,000 for personal
seat licenses for the choice locations in the new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther owner Jerry Richardson mocked L.A. for losing to
Houston when the latest--and presumably last--expansion franchise
became available.</TE>
<TE>   "The train rolled by and they didn't get on," Richardson said.
"The train keeps moving."</TE>
<TE>   This from a man who lives in a city where the NBA team is trying
to leave town for New Orleans--which itself has such shaky fan and
corporate support that the NFL's Saints were exploring leaving the
Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   We all know that as long as there are teams unhappy with their
stadium leases or feeling luxury box-deficient, there will be
potential teams for L.A.</TE>
<TE>   We've also learned that there's no need in the equation.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL doesn't need our TV sets. Tagliabue still managed to
negotiate a record $17.6-billion television rights deal in 1998
despite the absence of a team in the nation's second-largest TV
market.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles hasn't crumbled into the Pacific Ocean without an
NFL team. The population's rising and home sales are sizzling.</TE>
<TE>   But both sides can help each other.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would take a prominent place in the Super Bowl queue,
and Super Bowls would bring thousands of corporate fat cats and
expense account-loaded journalists to town.</TE>
<TE>   The league could use another site in the rotation. The Super Bowl
is heading to Jacksonville and Detroit in coming years. Have fun,
fellas. I've been to Jacksonville. The only memory I have from the
place is I can say I've seen the other end of Interstate 10. And who
wants to go to Detroit in February?</TE>
<TE>   This city played host to the first Super Bowl, and the area has
had six more since. I think we can handle it.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to see Anschutz blindly throw cash at NFL owners,
because that cost will inevitably get passed along in PSLs. The
league has been put on notice that it can't expect the same carte
blanche treatment St. Louis gave the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to see the NFL back, but on acceptable terms.</TE>
<TE>   If that's even possible.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Washburn Wants Opening-Day Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Kevin Appier has 147 victories, Aaron Sele is a two-time All-Star and
Jarrod Washburn is beginning only his third full season in the major
leagues. But Washburn is expected to start opening day against the
Cleveland Indians at Edison Field, continuing his ascent to the front
of a pitching rotation with high expectations.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to make a decision, as we move forward this weekend,
to line some things up," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Thursday
after Washburn worked six solid innings and got a no-decision in a
7-3 loss to the Colorado Rockies at Diablo Stadium. "It's not going
to be a secret."</LD>
<LD>   Washburn (1-1 with a 5.68 earned-run average) is toeing the
company line because the Angels have not named their No. 1 starter,
though bright signs are flashing the left-hander's name.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd be proud to be able to some day tell my kid I started on
opening day," he said. "I know my dad would be excited, and my family
and friends back home [in Wisconsin] would be really excited,
especially with the staff we've got.</TE>
<TE>   "But we've got five guys who are capable of going on opening day.
If I was chosen it would be an honor to represent the five guys, but
as long as I'm one of the five guys [in the rotation], I'm not going
to complain at all."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, whose turn in the exhibition rotation puts him on track
to face the Indians in the March 31 opener, had a 92-pitch outing
against the Rockies. He gave up five hits, three runs and struck out
five with two walks in his fifth start.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw 18 of 25 first-pitch strikes," pitching coach Bud Black
said. "He's right where he needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 27, also was on target last spring until strep throat
put him on the disabled list to start the season, derailing his bid
for the opening assignment.</TE>
<TE>   He recovered well, finishing 11-10 with a 3.77 earned-run average,
including an eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Wash is a guy that's shown he has the ability to be a No.-1 type
guy, as far as the way you would evaluate your staff," Scioscia said.
"He has the makeup, he has the stuff and he really gets after it out
on the mound."</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus returned with a bang, hitting a three-run
home run against Colorado starter Denny Neagle in the sixth. Glaus,
who has four homers, sat out five games because of a strained
abdominal muscle.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked good," Scioscia said. "His first couple of at-bats, I
thought he was over-swinging a little bit. Maybe he was trying to
make up for some lost time, but he settled into a good rhythm and
took some real good cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple plays in the field, he made nice plays. He'll be ready.
We'll break him in a little slower, but he'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (12-11-1) have nine exhibition games left, but Scioscia
would be comfortable opening the season today.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had to start [today], I'd feel good about where we are," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Indictment Details Payments to Players</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Michigan booster allegedly gave more than
$600,000 to Webber, three others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News Service</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Four former Michigan basketball players, including Chris Webber,
received more than $600,000 from a booster trying to hide money from
an illegal gambling operation, according to records unsealed Thursday
in U.S. District Court in Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged payments were detailed in charges brought by a federal
grand jury against Eddie Martin, 68, a retired Ford Motor Co.
electrician, and his wife, Hilda, 72. The couple is accused of
running an illegal gambling business and money laundering.</LD>
<LD>   According to the eight-count indictment, Martin loaned money to
Webber, Robert Traylor, Maurice Taylor and Louis Bullock before or
while they played at Michigan. Details of the payments and loans
could lead to an investigation of rules violations by the NCAA.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment details payments to Webber dating to 1988 when he
was a high school player in Detroit. Webber played at Michigan from
1991 to'93. He left the university after his sophomore season and was
the top overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft. He currently plays for
the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment said Martin loaned Webber and members of his family
about $280,000 between 1988 and 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Traylor, who played at Michigan from 1995-98, allegedly received
loans of about $160,000. Traylor also received loans dating to when
he was a high school player in Detroit. Traylor currently plays for
the Charlotte Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who played at Michigan from 1995 to '97, was allegedly
loaned $105,000, and Bullock a Wolverine from 1996 to '99, $71,000.
Both players received their loans during their playing careers at
Michigan. Taylor, a former Clipper, currently plays for the Houston
Rockets.</TE>

<LD>Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times says he has no sympathy for
Ruben Rivera, who was dumped by the New York Yankees after stealing
All-Star teammate Derek Jeter's glove and selling it to a collector:</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe there were teammates who liked Rivera, but even his friends
had to breathe a sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of things you can excuse in sports. Stealing from a
teammate isn't one of them.</LD>
<TE>   "Apologists can reach for excuses, talk about compassion, talk
about a lack of awareness, a breakdown in morals, the alienating
effects of the star system, kleptomania, whatever. It's simple--you
don't steal in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "And when you do--adios."</TE>
<TE>   More Telander: "Former Yankee Jim Bouton writes in this week's
Sports Illustrated that it's a shame Rivera's transgression made it
into the public arena, that clubhouses used to be bottled up,
sequestered, self-governing.</TE>
<TE>   "This from the guy who wrote 'Ball Four'?</TE>
<TE>   "And Bouton thinks if the shoes, or gloves, were reversed, and
Jeter were the culprit, this probably would have been kept hush-hush.
I hope not.</TE>
<TE>   "Scum is scum. Even if it can hit the slider."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the three coaches who have taken four
different teams to the NCAA men's basketball tournament?</TE>
<TE>   Go, Salukis! Ron Borges, writing for NBCSports.com, says he'll be
rooting for Southern Illinois to upset second-seeded Connecticut
tonight to get into Sunday's NCAA East Regional final:</TE>
<TE>   "After all, they have a coach in Bruce Weber who refused to back
down when he bumped up against the ego of Georgia Coach Jim Harrick,
who once won a national title at UCLA and never wants you to forget
it."</TE>
<TE>   Tarnished gold: Casey FitzRandolph, winner of the 500-meter
long-track speedskating event in the Salt Lake Games last month,
wants to try for another Olympic gold medal in 2006. But he's looking
for a long-term sponsor to cover expenses after being dropped by the
Dutch company TVM.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my hope that if I won a gold medal, [sponsors] would come
to me," he said. "I don't want to scrape by at 30 years old. I think
I deserve that over the next four years, based on what I've
accomplished. I'm not looking to get rich."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lefty Driesell (Davidson, Maryland, James Madison,
Georgia State), Jim Harrick (Pepperdine, UCLA, Rhode Island, Georgia)
and Eddie Sutton (Creighton, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma State).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Johnson, the former Olympic downhill champion,
plans to ski today at the spot in Whitefish, Mont., where a crash
exactly one year ago left him near death and with brain injuries that
might never heal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know where I'm going," said Johnson, 41, whose
speech is still slurred. "I have forgotten everything about that
accident. It's in Montana, and I really don't remember skiing in
Montana.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's exciting to understand those people that helped me out,
and what they went through to get me able again."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson will meet the neurosurgeon who removed a postcard-sized
piece of his skull to treat a blood clot in his brain, as well as the
doctor who spent 90 minutes stitching the pieces of Johnson's tongue
back together.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Forward gets 30 points and 16 rebounds in
116-96 victory over Golden State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The highlight-reel plays were glaringly absent Thursday.
Crowd-pleasing dunks were few and far between.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers were substance over flash during their comprehensive
116-96 victory over the overmatched Golden State Warriors before
13,568 at the Arena in Oakland, and they were OK with that in the
end.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers rebounded as if their season depended on snaring
every ball as it fell from the iron. They defended like a team bent
on making their remaining games meaningful. Plus, they shot down the
Warriors each time they drew near, which wasn't often after halftime.</LD>
<TE>   It was an unbeatable package for the Clippers, who got 30 points
and 16 rebounds from a relentless Elton Brand. Four other Clippers
scored 10 or more points, including point guard Jeff McInnis, who had
18 to go with 13 assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also outrebounded the Warriors, the league's best
rebounding team, 48-46, and they kept an opponent from scoring 100
points for the 12th consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's big for us because it says a lot about our defense," said
Brand, who also blocked four shots. "If we can keep a team under 100,
we have a great chance to win because we have the offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers began the evening only 11/2 games behind the Utah
Jazz for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
While the Clippers were thumping the Warriors, the Jazz powered by
the Washington Wizards, 94-79, at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   So the Clipper deficit remains 11/2 games with 13 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever else happens the rest of the way, it would appear the
Clippers have a stranglehold on a spot in the top nine in the West.
They lead the 10th-place Phoenix Suns by 51/2 games. The Clippers
play the Jazz and Suns twice each, however, and a great deal could
change in the season's final weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Good, bad, indifferent," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said, "at
this stage, we've just got to win games. We played tonight with a
purpose and a great effort. There were only a few moments where we
got lackadaisical. All in all, I thought we played aggressively and
we played smart."</TE>
<TE>   Although it failed to result in a basket, one play in the second
quarter epitomized the Clippers' hunger for a victory. Leading a
fastbreak, McInnis launched a lob pass and not one, not two, but
three Clippers leaped for it, hoping for a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, no one got it.</TE>
<TE>   A hustling Brand took the rebound, but a certain basket was
swatted out of his hands by an alert Warrior. The Clippers ended up
getting one of two free throws by Quentin Richardson out of the deal
and they led Golden State at that point, 42-33.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to win this game," Gentry said. "We could not afford to
lose this game and the guys played accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Scalding three-point shooting by Richardson and Eric Piatkowski
got the Clippers rolling toward a 57-50 lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was three for three and Piatkowski was four for four
from behind the three-point arc in the first half. By the end of the
half, the Clippers were eight of 11 on three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, they made nine of 16 (56.3%) as Richardson and
Piatkowski each made four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Brand, the Clippers built a 65-54 lead less than three
minutes into the third quarter. He raced ahead of the pack for a
dunk, followed with a short jump shot and scored on a drive to the
hoop moments later.</TE>
<TE>   Brand scored 13 points in the third quarter, making six of seven
shots and one free throw.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis and Brand picked-and-screened the Warriors until they
weakened and, soon enough, the Clippers led, 89-73, after three
quarters.</TE>

<LD>Somebody asked Coach Alvin Gentry if "everybody was in good shape"
before the Clippers played the Golden State Warriors on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "No," Gentry said, drawing out the "o" to emphasize the fact that
the Clippers are bruised and battered.</LD>
<LD>   Quickly, he added, "But it doesn't matter at this stage. It's a
part of the season that everybody is struggling with their health."</LD>
<TE>   Eating, sleeping and playing basketball are about all the Clippers
are doing at this point.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jeff McInnis played against the Warriors despite
feeling ill and missing Tuesday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   Reserves Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson, who have bumps and
bruises, also played in Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom, and guard
Keyon Dooling are on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are just going out and playing and trying to stay in
the race," Gentry said of the walking wounded. "All the guys are
giving me everything they have left right now."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he's responding to the heat of the playoff chase, Gentry
said, "It's fun to wonder what's going to happen in the
Washington-Utah game or the Detroit-Phoenix game.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer it to just playing out the string."</TE>

<TE>   Tremaine Fowlkes became a father at 2:34 a.m. Thursday, when his
longtime girlfriend, Naima Thomas, gave birth to a 7-pound, 14-ounce
boy named Khalil Jahmal Fowlkes. Mother and child were resting
comfortably.</TE>
<TE>   The proud father was exhausted after a round-trip drive to
Sacramento to witness the birth.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes left the team's Oakland hotel Wednesday afternoon,
returning in time for the shoot-around Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed a lengthy pregame nap, then took the late bus to the
arena.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been happening all at one time for me," said
Fowlkes, signed by the Clippers from the National Basketball
Development League last month. "I'm really thankful. I've had a baby
during the season I got called up."</TE>
<TE>   Since signing with the Clippers on Feb. 23, Fowlkes has become the
team's starting small forward and guarded, among others, Kobe Bryant
of the Lakers and Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves.</TE>

<HD>Green Not Into Swing of Things</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A thumb injury limited Shawn Green to 24 spring training at-bats last
season, and that didn't hinder him; the Dodger right fielder had his
best season, batting .297 with 49 home runs and 125 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   Green is injury-free now and getting his normal allotment of
Grapefruit League at-bats, but he has hardly found a groove. After
going hitless in three at-bats in Thursday's 12-6 exhibition loss to
the New York Mets, Green is batting .094 with 12 strikeouts.</LD>
<LD>   "The sluggers usually take longer to get going because they're
trying to do more with the baseball," Dodger hitting coach Jack Clark
said. "They're not just trying to peck away at it. They're trying to
hit it where no one can catch it."</LD>
<TE>   Clark said Green is not experimenting with his swing. Green is
trying to be patient, but he might be a little more encouraged if he
were at least hitting the ball harder with more consistency.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to find my swing and hoping it's there on April 2,"
Green said. "Obviously, it gets frustrating when you don't get hits.
I'm waiting for it to show up, but it's not a concern."</TE>
<TE>   Green's playing time has been erratic, and he was slowed earlier
this spring by some shoulder tendinitis, but after a day off today,
Manager Jim Tracy said he would play Green regularly in an effort to
get him tuned up for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still feeling his way along," Tracy said. "It's nothing more
than that."</TE>
<TE>   Dante Bichette decided to stick it out in Dodger camp, for better
or worse. The reserve outfielder, who came close to asking for his
release Wednesday, practiced Thursday and said he plans to fulfill
the obligation of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I can help this club, maybe even more than Dan [Evans,
Dodger general manager] and Jim [Tracy] believe I can," Bichette, 38,
said. "It's my job to prove that over the last 10 days."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers in hopes
he would get enough outfield action to get 300 to 400 at-bats, but
the Dodgers prefer to use Bichette as a right-handed pinch-hitting
complement to Dave Hansen.</TE>
<TE>   Could Bichette, who has not had fewer than 349 at-bats in a season
since 1990, handle a strict pinch-hitting role?</TE>
<TE>   "No way," he said. "I'll do it, but it takes a special guy. For me
to do that, I need some at-bats to go with it. But the fact I'm not
comfortable with it doesn't mean I won't be successful at it."</TE>
<TE>   If Bichette is released, there's a good chance he could sign with
the Angels, the team that originally drafted him in 1984 and has been
in search of a right-handed hitter since Shawn Wooten injured his
wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy hasn't named a starting center fielder yet, but the Dodgers
appear to be leaning toward a platoon of left-handed-hitting Dave
Roberts and right-handed-hitting Marquis Grissom.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a former UCLA standout who hasn't played a full season in
the major leagues, is batting .407 with seven walks and four stolen
bases, and the leadoff batter has a .529 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, 29, has outplayed McKay Christensen and Tom Goodwin, but
he is the only center fielder with a minor league option left, and
that could work against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've shown what I bring to the table," said Roberts, who
is battling minor quadriceps, hamstring and lower-back injuries.
"Knowing that, I can live with any decision that is made. I was told
I would have an opportunity, and I've made the most of it. It's out
of my hands."</TE>
<TE>   Omar Daal was rocked for eight runs and eight hits, including two
home runs by Edgardo Alfonzo, in five innings Thursday. The
left-hander pitched three scoreless innings before giving up three
runs in the fourth and five in the fifth. The Dodgers have been
outscored, 36-9, in the last three games....</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan was scratched because of some tightness
in his left hamstring, but he is expected to play tonight....
Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii threw in the bullpen for the
third consecutive day and probably will make his next start
Monday....</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers released minor league first baseman Glenn Davis, a
1997 first-round pick who received an $825,000 signing bonus. Davis,
who hit .243 with 20 homers and 89 RBIs for double-A Jacksonville
last season, is the brother of Seattle catcher Ben Davis.</TE>

<HD>Hit and Miss for Williams, Duke</HD>
<DH>South Regional: Unlikely three-point shot falls but tying
free throw doesn't, and Indiana stuns 2001 champs, 74-73.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>It couldn't have been more fitting.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Williams was at the line, staring down his albatross with a
gift of a chance to save Duke from Indiana's incredible comeback
after he was fouled on a made three-pointer with 4.2 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, it couldn't have been more final.</LD>
<TE>   Williams missed--yet again.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Boozer got the rebound but couldn't score and didn't get a
foul call, and defending national champion Duke is done after a 74-73
loss to the Hoosiers in a game the Blue Devils once led by 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we messed up a lot of brackets," a jubilant Indiana Coach
Mike Davis said after the Hoosiers' NCAA South Regional semifinal
victory Thursday in front of 22,338 in Rupp Arena. "A lot of
brackets, they're tearing them up and throwing them away. It's over."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (23-11) will play upstart Kent State on Saturday for a
trip to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   It was an Indiana victory so improbable that a Duke official upset
Davis by asking during a planning meeting what time the Blue Devils
would play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the only doubter.</TE>
<TE>   "My girlfriend told me, 'I'll see you Saturday in Bloomington,'"
Indiana guard Dane Fife said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it is Duke that is going home after a 31-4 season.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' career is over--he announced after last season he would
turn pro after his junior year--and the unanimous All-American and
player-of-the-year candidate ended it in tears.</TE>
<TE>   His 67% free-throw shooting has been his burden. He missed six
down the stretch in Duke's loss to Florida State this season, and a
crucial one in a loss to Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   But when Fife was called for a foul, incredibly, just as Williams
made a three-pointer to bring Duke back to within one point with four
seconds left, Duke's star was jubilant.</TE>
<TE>   Fife claimed he didn't foul Williams but admitted he shouldn't
have been close to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen some dumb plays, but in the history of Indiana
basketball, that was the most idiotic play," Fife admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Williams stepped to the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't scared," Williams said. "That situation is something I
dreamed about. I went to the line and put the shot up and it went
halfway down, in and out.</TE>
<TE>   "Carlos got it and had a shot but didn't make it. That's about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's Jared Jeffries might have been called for a foul on
Boozer, but it was the sort of late-game situation in which it's
unlikely a call will be made.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was going up, I figured, well, he's going to hit a shot
so I grabbed him and got a piece of the ball, and the ball rolled off
and we won," Jeffries said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams could only shrug. "Last year the ball bounced our way
more than ever," he said. "This year, it didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils had cooled down considerably by the time they
talked. But as the game ended, Duke's Matt Christensen, a reserve
senior forward, angrily followed official Bruce Benedict--the former
Atlanta Brave catcher--off the court and had to be pulled back, with
Coach Mike Krzyzewski going after Christensen to bring him back to
the bench area.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA issued a statement saying the incident is being
investigated, but said there was no urgency because Duke has been
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   That the game was even close was little short of amazing.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Duke runaway in the first half after Indiana turned the
ball over 11 times by the time it had 12 points. (Indiana finished
with 23 turnovers.)</TE>
<TE>   Duke's big lead was 29-12.</TE>
<TE>   The relentless rebounding of the Hoosiers kept a 13-point halftime
lead from becoming a blowout, and Indiana came back. The Hoosiers
outrebounded Duke, 47-32--highlighting another of Duke's season-long
struggles--and converted 21 second-chance points.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries had 24 points and 15 rebounds, doing yeoman's work in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana also took advantage of foul trouble that kept Duke's Mike
Dunleavy on the bench for much of the second half, hitting the boards
hard.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we'd have them blocked out and the ball would get
tipped a little to the left or the right and they seemed to come up
with it," Dunleavy said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Indiana never led until a minute remained, when Tom
Coverdale sank a baseline jumper for a 72-70 lead on a play that
began after Duke's Chris Duhon lost the ball in the lane on the other
end.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's A.J. Moye made two free throws with 11 seconds left,
setting up Duke's final desperate chance.</TE>
<TE>   Duke freshman Daniel Ewing missed a three-point attempt, but the
ball caromed to Williams, who made a huge three-pointer just before
he missed a bigger free throw. Still, Boozer almost pulled it out.</TE>
<TE>   Krzyzewski didn't complain, and said his view of the play was
blocked.</TE>
<TE>   "But you know what, it's the way it goes. Whether he was fouled or
not, it's the way it goes," Krzyzewski said. "Again, there's human
elements in all these things. I would never, ever blame a loss on one
play or an official or a player....</TE>
<TE>   "The game's too great to reduce it to excuses and making bogus
statements, 'If this would have happened or that would have
happened.' Hey, it didn't happen. Be men, congratulate the winner and
go on."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Run Into First-Time Flyer</HD>
<DH>Hockey: NHL's assist leader Oates, traded from Washington
on Tuesday, helps lead Philadelphia past Anaheim, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA --Adam Oates didn't waste any time showing his new
Philadelphia teammates why he is the leading playmaker in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   John LeClair scored on a rebound of a shot by the newly acquired
Oates at 12:26 of the third period as the Flyers snapped a five-game
winless streak with a 2-1 victory over the Mighty Ducks on Thursday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Oates, acquired from Washington for goaltender Maxime Ouellet and
three draft picks on Tuesday, picked up his NHL-leading 58th assist
on the play. After his shot from the circle was stopped by Duck
goaltender Steve Shields, LeClair crashed in and hammered the rebound
in the net.</LD>
<TE>   "We were kind of all involved in the play, which is great," Oates
explained. "Rex [Mark Recchi] had it and was fighting off a guy. We
gave him a little pick, a little bit of room. He went around the net
and threw it across. It came to me, I shoveled it at the net and
Johnny banged the rebound home."</TE>
<TE>   Oates, a 17-year NHL veteran, admitted he was nervous before the
game.</TE>
<TE>   For me, there should be a rule," he said. "You know, your first
game [after a trade] should be on the road. Getting rid of the
butterflies on the road would make it a little bit easier."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Coach Bill Barber was impressed with his new center.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam came in and did an admirable job all the way around," Barber
said. "His game was a factor in our win tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Jeff Friesen and Philadelphia's Simon Gagne traded
unassisted goals as the Flyers also snapped a five-game winless
streak at home (0-4-1).</TE>
<TE>   Shields had 21 saves for the Ducks, who had ended a nine-game
winless string in Detroit on Tuesday by beating the Red Wings, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Friesen scored unassisted on a breakaway at 11:33 of the first
period. He picked off a cross-ice pass by Philadelphia's Luke
Richardson at the Duck blue line, skated in and went forehand,
backhand, forehand to beat goaltender Brian Boucher, who stopped 15
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne tied it at 16:07 of the second period when his wrist shot
from the right circle sailed under the crossbar for his 30th goal,
the first time he has reached that milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Both Shields and Duck Coach Bryan Murray said that officials
missed an icing call before Gagne scored.</TE>
<TE>   "Gagne's goal was a tough angle goal and a scorer's goal at that,"
said Murray. "But it was an icing and it wasn't called. The linesman
said it was touched by someone but I didn't think it was."</TE>
<TE>   "There was an icing, there was a missed call," Shields said.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see the puck when he shot it. Somebody tried to step in
front to block it and I didn't even see where it went in. I just
heard it clang off the post."</TE>

<HD>Salukis Can Name Drop Now</HD>
<DH>East: Southern Illinois builds recognition with Sweet 16
run on victories over teams coached by Knight and Harrick.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The Southern Illinois Salukis' historic run to the Sweet 16 has been
part geographical, remarkable, fanciful, unpredictable and, if you
can believe it, biblical.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, getting the story out of Carbondale to the big-city
papers hasn't always been easy.</LD>
<LD>   "They forget about us," Coach Bruce Weber says. "There's too many
schools along the way. You got Northern Illinois, then you got
Bradley, then you got Illinois State and of course the U of Illinois
in Champaign. There are so many other schools. It is frustrating at
times."</LD>
<TE>   Southern Illinois, living large after its at-large selection from
the Missouri Valley Conference, now has our undivided attention.
Victories in Chicago against Texas Tech and Georgia have advanced the
Salukis and their cause.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois, a No. 11-seeded team, will face No. 2
Connecticut today in the East Regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the team has impressed observers with its tenacity,
defense and nickname.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of respect? One reason Southern Illinois gets overlooked in
the Chicago papers may be because the school is hardly in Illinois at
all. Carbondale is a five-hour drive from Lake Michigan, much closer
to St. Louis than Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with a slight tweaking of state borders and a referendum
to return to the school's old nickname, we could easily be talking
about the Northeast Missouri Maroons.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Southern Illinois has some basketball history. Led by
Walt Frazier, the Salukis won the National Invitation Tournament in
1967.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Sunday's victory over Georgia marked the first time Southern
Illinois has won a second game in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement in Carbondale, a community of 30,000, is palpable.
The declaration "Go Dawgs!" has replaced "God Bless America" on
strip-mall signs.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Williams, a Saluki junior guard, described the trip home in a
diary he is keeping for the school's Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   "All the players got to sit in first class," Williams wrote of the
plane ride home. "Once we got to Marion there was a ton of people
going nuts. We had police officers escorting us through all the
wildness. Everyone was going crazy. I couldn't hear a thing. My ears
were just ringing."</TE>
<TE>   After years of relative obscurity, Southern Illinois is a blip on
the NCAA radar screen. As much as what makes the team tick, people
want to know about the school's unusual nickname, Salukis.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly is a story with legs. In the early 1800s, the yarn
goes, northern Illinois was plagued by terrible drought. Wheat fields
and streams dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of rain fell in southern Illinois, though, and people came
from the north seeking corn and wheat "as to Egypt of old." The
region became known as "Egypt," referring to a biblical passage in
Genesis "and all countries came to Egypt to Joseph to buy corn;
because that the famine was so sore in all lands."</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, Southern Illinois sought to change the team's nickname
from Maroons. The student body of 2,000 overwhelmingly voted in favor
of "Salukis," a purebred Egyptian dog with paw prints dating back to
3600 B.C.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs are known for speed and hunting skills.</TE>
<TE>   And, now, Salukis are known for defense.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois has been led from "Egypt" to basketball's
promised land by Weber, completing his fourth year after 18 seasons
as an assistant to Gene Keady at Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   You wonder how a guy could spend almost two decades as a second
wheel in West Lafayette.</TE>
<TE>   "As an assistant, everyone said how can you stand it?" Weber said.
"I loved being an assistant coach for Coach Keady at Purdue. We had
tremendous success."</TE>
<TE>   In 18 years, Purdue went to 14 NCAA tournaments, won six Big Ten
titles, made the Sweet 16 twice and in 1994 advanced to the round of
eight.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I regret there is not helping him get to the Final
Four," Weber said of Keady. "That's the one thing he doesn't have on
his resume."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Weber is two victories from achieving that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: Southern Illinois has been built with the same
blueprint Keady used for Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't always have great talent there, but we found ways to
win and found ways to battle people," Weber said. "At Purdue, other
than Glenn Robinson, we always lived off the other players we're
living off now."</TE>
<TE>   Solid defense has allowed Southern Illinois to neutralize more
talented teams.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round, Southern Illinois trumped Bob Knight's Texas
Tech team with relentless pressure. Weber said Knight told him after
the game it was "one of the best defensive efforts against his team
that he's ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Coach Jim Harrick was skeptical Southern Illinois could
keep up the effort against his athletic Bulldogs.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick suggested Texas Tech wasn't all that talented.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Knight did an unbelievable job getting a No. 6 [seeding] out
of that team, that's all I'll say," Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, after spotting Georgia a 19-point first half lead, Southern
Illinois turned the defensive screws, rallied for a two-point victory
and sent Harrick packing.</TE>
<TE>   Like all projects, Weber's rebuilding project at Southern Illinois
took time.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's team finished 16-14 and Weber suspected Keady would
not have been proud of the defense the Salukis played.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get them tough," Weber said. "We made the switchover at
mid-January and I told the coaches and players that next year is
going to be different. And we went hard all spring, and we went hard
all summer, and none of them flinched."</TE>
<TE>   The Salukis have become solidified. They have won a school-record
28 games this year. How? Weber recruited two freshman guards, Darren
Brooks and Stetson Hairston, who are tremendous defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Weber also coaxed a last-chance senior season out of center Rolan
Roberts, a transfer from Virginia Tech. Roberts left Virginia Tech in
the aftermath of a sexual assault scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts sat out last year under NCAA transfer rules and this year
has given the Salukis a muscular defensive presence. Roberts, though
only 6 feet 6, blocked five shots in the opening-round victory
against Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   "I put him on a year probation, basically," Weber said. "I said,
'Rolan, if you screw up you're done. It's up to you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has taken advantage of his opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "This means a lot to me," Roberts said. "It's my first time in the
NCAAs, and it's going to be my last."</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois has gotten steady play at guard from Williams,
the team's leading scorer at 16 points a game, but it has been the
emergence of 6-8 junior forward Jermaine Dearman that has propelled
the Salukis into the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   Dearman, barely averaging double figures in scoring this season,
had 17 points and 11 rebounds against Texas Tech and 25 points and
eight rebounds against Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Dearman grew up in Indianapolis, but never thought for a minute he
had what it took to play for Knight at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I would want to play for him," Dearman said. "I
know he gets frustrated with his players."</TE>
<TE>   Knight might have busted several gaskets on Dearman.</TE>
<TE>   "He has talent," Weber said. "He can run, he can jump, but his
skills are a little erratic. He takes fadeaway shots that drive me
nuts. But when he gets determined he's a big-time player."</TE>
<TE>   Free spirit?</TE>
<TE>   "He's more worried about his braids," Weber said, "about how he
looks than how he plays. He's more worried about hitting a jumper
than going in and getting a dunk."</TE>
<TE>   Dearman's inspired play of late, though, has made some people
think anything is still possible for Southern Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The Salukis have already matched their preseason hope of making it
to the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We've realized all our previous team goals," Dearman said. "Our
new goal now is to beat Connecticut."</TE>

<TE>   Maryland vs. Kentucky: Top-seeded Maryland was supposed to be
here, but there were huge doubts about Kentucky, which limped into
the tournament in various states of dysfunction. Issues? The Wildcats
began the tournament having lost four of their previous nine games.
During the course of the season, two players were suspended for using
fake IDs at a bar, there was a fight on the team plane, the athletic
director resigned, a top player transferred and the shooting guard
couldn't shoot. Maryland has the momentum and the guns, but Kentucky
has seven national titles. "When you play Kentucky, their name is
still magical," Maryland Coach Gary Williams said. "But I think our
name is pretty good now. You have to get over what is on the jersey
and put your game out there. We've reached a pretty good point of
earning the respect that other schools do." Maryland needs to
transfer respect into something tangible, say a national title
banner. This might be the Terrapins' last, best shot after blowing a
22-point lead to Duke in last year's national semifinals. Look for
this game to go up and down at frenetic speeds, with both schools
trying to show off their impressive blue-chip talent. Maryland has
more inside-out ability than Kentucky, able to pound the ball in to
Lonny Baxter and Chris Wilcox and then kick out to two great guards
in Steve Blake and Juan Dixon. It'll be interesting to see who
matches up on Kentucky's hottest player, 6-foot-9 Tayshaun Prince,
who scored 41 against Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut vs. Southern Illinois: Surprise, surprise. Connecticut
sort of went unnoticed this year in terms of national title talk, yet
Jim Calhoun's Huskies are one of the tournament's hottest teams.
Connecticut is young, with only one senior, but the Huskies play
great defense and have a superstar in sophomore Caron Butler: Check
out his two-game NCAA tournament line: 56 points, 18 rebounds and 10
assists. It would be a mistake, though, for Connecticut to overlook
No. 11 Southern Illinois, an at-large selection from the Missouri
Valley Conference. The Salukis already have knocked out two
national-title coaches, Bob Knight and Jim Harrick, and are looking
to make it three in a row with a victory over Calhoun. The Salukis
play in-your-jersey defense and have two inside players, forward
Jermaine Dearman and center Rolan Roberts, who won't back down.
Dearman followed his 17-point, 11-rebound effort against Texas Tech
with 25 against Georgia. Roberts, a transfer from Virginia Tech, is
an accomplished shot-blocker.</TE>

<HD>Disney on the Power Play</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Executive Pressler trying to reinvigorate franchise
with new ideas, including slashing some ticket prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to restore the pulse to their Mighty Duck franchise, Disney
officials said Thursday that General Manager Pierre Gauthier will
lose some of his autonomy and the team may consider slashing
selective ticket prices.</LD>
<LD>   Disney executive Paul Pressler said Thursday that the Ducks--once
extremely profitable with guaranteed sellouts--would reconsider
ticket prices after discounts on group sales tickets drove up
attendance at two recent games.</LD>
<LD>   He also said that Gauthier would report to the president of
Anaheim Sports, when one is hired, instead of directly to Disney
officials. An executive vice president will also be hired to handle
the business side.</LD>
<TE>   Those are some of the changes Pressler will implement to reinvent
the Ducks, who are 14th out of 15 teams in the Western Conference and
last in the NHL in attendance. Pressler, who oversees both the Angels
and the Ducks, said it is obvious where the work needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear there is a tremendous level of enthusiasm for the
Angels clearly demonstrated in the changes made in the organization,"
Pressler said. "On the Duck side, Duck fans are frustrated. We have
to address some issues."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler indicated those issues were on the ice, specifically
finding a solution to the team's woeful power play. Although there
has been speculation that Gauthier's job was on the line, Pressler
would not comment on his future except to say that he had "confidence
in Pierre."</TE>
<TE>   However, Gauthier will lose some power when a president for
Anaheim Sports is hired. Pressler said that Gauthier and Angel
General Manager Bill Stoneman would report to the new president, who
will report to Pressler.</TE>
<TE>   "We're clearly looking for someone with experience and knowledge
to lead [Anaheim Sports]," Pressler said. "Someone to be very
involved in community, that will be a critical component. Someone
with a little good luck."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are a better team this season, but there was nowhere to
go but up after finishing last in the conference a year ago. What
hasn't improved is attendance at the Arrowhead Pond.Season ticket
holders are dwindling and team sponsors are concerned. Disney
officials won't reveal exact figures, but the season-ticket base is
believed to be around 8,000, down from the 14,000 it was during the
1995-96 season. This season, most games attracted about 5,000-6,000
fans.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a spike in attendance at two recent games,
attributed to the slashing of ticket prices for group sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks sold $75 tickets for $50, $32.50 seats for $16.25 and
$27 seats for $13.50. There are two more reduced-price games on the
schedule, including Fan Appreciation Night--a game the team has never
failed to sell out.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you start cutting ticket prices, you have devalued your
franchise," one NHL team official said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this will lead to overall price cuts is to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll got through it at the end of the year," Pressler said.
"We'll have an evaluation, given where we are today. We'll look at
the kind of group sales, which we do every year. But we have been
pretty aggressive the last couple weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler did not rule out that whoever is hired as president might
also buy Disney's two teams. Dave Checketts, who operated the New
York Knicks and New York Rangers as president of Madison Square
Garden, has surfaced as a possible candidate for president.</TE>
<TE>   Checketts has also fronted a group of wealthy investors in
attempts to buy the Boston Red Sox and Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible," Pressler said. "As we have said, if
someone was interested, our responsibility to our shareholders would
be to review it. At the same time there is no activity from us
looking. In the meantime, we will operate these teams like we are
going to own them forever."</TE>
<TE>   There are fans who may not like hearing that, andmany have made
their opinions known via e-mails, Pressler said.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney is the owner and that is ultimately where responsibility
lies," Pressler said. "I do think we have in place resources, with
Pierre and [Coach] Bryan Murray, to get the job done. Like most
owners, we rely on their judgment to go out to make the right
trades."</TE>

<HD>Players Attack a Soft Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rain at the Players Championship was not unusual, only the events
that followed--a relatively easy golf course, Scott Hoch among the
leaders and a happy and heckle-free round for Colin Montgomerie.</LD>
<LD>   "So far, I'm glad I came," Montgomerie said after a 70 at Ponte
Vedra Beach, Fla., his best start in six years. Four weeks ago, he
threatened to boycott U.S. tournaments because of what he perceived
as excessive heckling.</LD>
<LD>   When darkness fell on a bizarre Thursday on the TPC at Sawgrass,
52 players in the field were under par and two dozen players were
within three shots of the lead shared by Hoch, Phil Mickelson and
Chris DiMarco at five under par.</LD>
<TE>   "Without a whole lot of wind, any course is going to be
defenseless when you have a big rain like this and the greens are
soft," Hoch said.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders were among 74 players who had to return this morning
to finish the opening round, delayed by two hours because of morning
showers. Also in that group was Tiger Woods, who ended his day with
his first bogey of the tournament and was at one under with four
holes to play.</TE>
<TE>   That Hoch is among the leaders is strange only because he prefers
Sawgrass to be tougher. In fact, Hoch threatened to quit playing when
Greg Norman set a record score of 264 on a tame Stadium Course in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, they didn't have much rough," Hoch said. "Hit
anywhere, putting contest. You hit anywhere other than the water, and
you would be all right. That's not my game. They made the conditions
more conducive to my game."</TE>
<TE>   It was plenty tame Thursday, and Hoch didn't have any complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Neither did Montgomerie, which was equally surprising. The Scot
left the Match Play Championship in a huff after one fan cheered when
he missed a putt, and said it was not worth his time to play any more
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a tough go of it over here," Hoch said, a favorite
target in Britain because of his disdain for certain British Open
courses. "I can sympathize with him because I'm not really big in
England."</TE>
<TE>   Having won Bay Hill last week for the third consecutive time,
Woods is trying to become the first back-to-back winner in the
28-year history of the Players.</TE>
<TE>   He opened with eight pars, a mixture of good recoveries and missed
opportunities on the green.</TE>
<TE>   "It totally changed the speed of the greens," Woods said of the
rain. "You had to recalibrate and get adjusted to the feel."</TE>
<TE>   Six players from the morning starters were tied for the clubhouse
lead at three-under 69--PGA champion David Toms, Mark Calcavecchia,
Robert Allenby, Stuart Appleby, Steve Lowery and Jeff Sluman.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Faldo is at four under through 13 holes.</TE>
<TE>   The rain came down hard in the morning, taking the edge off the
opening round of a tournament regarded as the fifth major. Whipping
wind disappeared when the storm passed, leaving for easier conditions
in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Told that he was off to a fast start, Allenby raised his eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "Is three under a fast start?" he said. "I think you'll find there
will be a few scores that are better. It's only getting easier."</TE>
<TE>   Not for Ernie Els, who bogeyed his first two holes and wound up
with a 76. He is 16 over in his last four rounds at the Players
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ashli Bunch, winless in four seasons on the LPGA Tour, shot a
career-best eight-under 64 to take the first-round lead in the
Welch's/Circle K Championship at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Bunch was nearly done when the wind kicked up, causing problems
for two-time defending champion Annika Sorenstam and the other late
starters.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, the only back-to-back winner in the event's 21-year
history, was eight shots behind after a 72. On Sunday, Sorenstam shot
a 76 while blowing a four-shot lead that led to a playoff loss to
Rachel Teske in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Hurst, Mi Hyun Kim, Dorothy Delasin and Nancy Scranton opened
with 65s, and 1999 winner Juli Inkster, Mhairi McKay and Karen Weiss
shot 66.</TE>

<HD>Cry of the Wolves: Citrus, Altius, Fortius</HD>
<DH>Prep basketball: From out of the orange groves, Riverside
King soars higher and plays stronger than anyone expected.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget about the housing developments still taking shape across the
street. Basketball is the new growth industry at Riverside King High,
and business is booming.</LD>
<LD>   Led by a flashy guard who looks as if he is part of an ABA time
warp and a wiry forward who plays bigger than his 6-foot-5 frame,
King is on the verge of history in only its second year of varsity
basketball.</LD>
<LD>   The Wolves could become the first Riverside County boys'
basketball team to win a state title when they play Mountain View St.
Francis at 8 tonight at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "What a dream," Coach Tim Sweeney Jr. said. "I mean, how many
coaches get to play for a [Southern Section] championship, let alone
a state championship, with their first senior class?"</TE>
<TE>   For Marvin Lea, the senior who wears his socks to his knees and
his Afro into the stratosphere in a tribute to old-school basketball
players such as Julius Erving, tonight's game is about more than a
championship plaque. It's about putting basketball on the map in a
part of town known for producing oranges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real important to me," said Lea, who grew up in Riverside
with a finger on the pulse of the basketball community. "Everywhere I
go, people say, 'Well, you're doing all that in Riverside. But can
you come to L.A. and do it? Can you come to Orange County and do it?'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying we have just as big ballplayers out here, we just
haven't had the same recognition as everyone else. It's time we get
our due."</TE>
<TE>   Respect may take time, but Lea and his classmates are learning
that with winning come more immediate privileges. Lea got out of
class Wednesday to meet with Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal, among a
growing number of college coaches whose interest in the 6-3 guard has
increased with each of the Wolves' playoff victories. And all King
students will receive get-out-of-school-free cards this morning at 11
so they have the option of making the 450-mile trip to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward Leon Rosborough, who has played Robin to Lea's
Batman during this most unexpected season, said the Wolves (30-4) are
treating their journey north to play St. Francis (25-8) like a
business trip.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win this game," Rosborough said, "it will really tell
people that we're the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers are already convinced after watching King rally
from a five-point halftime deficit last weekend to defeat four-time
state champion Santa Ana Mater Dei in the Southern California
Regional final. Lea scored a game-high 28 points and Rosborough added
13 as the Wolves built a slim lead and then buried the Monarchs down
the stretch in an avalanche of free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Lea and Rosborough have formed quite a duo since arriving at King
two years ago, Lea from Riverside Poly and Rosborough from Moreno
Valley Canyon Springs. Lea came because his sister Markisha had
attended King since it opened a year earlier on a patch of land
surrounded on three sides by orange groves. Rosborough came at the
urging of Lea, who figured the two might be able to make their marks
on a program in its infancy.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden I looked up and found we had a pretty good
one-two punch," Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   King reached the Southern Section Division III-AA quarterfinals in
its first varsity season--a remarkable achievement by any
measure--but Sweeney noticed that his players relied too much on Lea
to carry the scoring load and take the last-second shots.</TE>
<TE>   That changed this season with the emergence of Rosborough and the
development of role players such as Garrett Hilt and Bret Goodman,
the only remaining holdover from the junior varsity team of three
years ago. Lea's scoring average has actually dipped, to 26 points,
while Rosborough's average has increased to 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Leon's my ace on the court," Lea said. "If two people are
double-teaming me, I know he's going to hit that big three or get
that big-time rebound and lay it up. I know with him on the court,
we'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, Lea and Rosborough led King to the Division II-A
final at the Arrowhead Pond, where it lost to Redondo Union on
Wendell White's off-balance three-pointer shortly before the buzzer.
But the Wolves avenged the defeat a week later by beating Redondo in
a regional semifinal after Lea poured in 11 of his 32 points in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The victories over Redondo and Mater Dei have given way to some
dizzying times on campus, where the school could unfurl a state
championship banner more than a year before its first four-year
seniors graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rosborough: "It's really like I'm in a dream now, soaking in
all this energy everybody is giving us."</TE>

<LD>Although today's seventh race at Santa Anita carries only a $70,000
purse, the one-mile turf event is like a graded stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The allowance contest, the fifth leg of a pick six that has a
carryover of $100,375.40, has attracted Shibboleth, a classy
5-year-old son of Danzig making his American debut for trainer Bobby
Frankel, and will mark the comeback of Ladies Din, a multiple-stakes
winner for owners Bernie Schiappa and Terry Lanni and trainer Julio
Canani.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by Juddmonte Farms, Shibboleth won four of seven in
England and will be running for the first time since finishing fifth
in the Group I July Cup at Newmarket on July 12, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Trained overseas by Henry Cecil, the bay horse was a Group III
winner at Newmarket and was good enough to finish fourth, beaten by
11/4 lengths by the brilliant Giant's Causeway in a Group I at Ascot
in the spring of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Shibboleth is the 3-1 favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line; Ladies
Din, a 7-year-old Din's Dancer gelding, is the 7-2 second choice.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first race for Ladies Din since he was 11th of 15
in the Dubai Duty Free a year ago. Seven others entered the race
Wednesday morning, but three scratches are possible this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Although it drew only five runners, today's
second is a better-than-average conclusion to the early daily double.
Impressive Grades, who has never been worse than third in seven races
at Santa Anita, and Radiata, who has three victories and two seconds
in five starts for Eduardo Inda, head the lineup going seven
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Paul Jones. The trainer recently moved into second
place on the all-time quarter horse wins list at Los Alamitos.
Entering Thursday evening's races, Jones had 1,092 victories. Blane
Schvaneveldt is the leader with 3,574.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  William Cox. The trainer is one for 41 at Golden Gate
Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Flying Marvyl in the
sixth, using Shibboleth, Ladies Din and Climate in the seventh and
using Nor'easter and Highland Dawn in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/175. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $20.80/$1,031.40. Total money bet: $1,062.</TE>

<HD>Indy 500 Brings About Cooperation</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: CART, IRL have mutual interest in race, but
huge philosophical differences remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Indianapolis 500 is just another race. It's lost its mystique.
It's no big deal anymore."</LD>
<LD>   So said car owner Bobby Rahal six or seven years ago, talking
about the rift between CART, the established American open-wheel
racing series, and the Indy Racing League, Tony George's breakaway
oval racing series whose centerpiece is the 500.</LD>
<LD>   Chip Ganassi, another car owner, totally agreed.</LD>
<TE>   "Who needs milk?" he quipped after CART had scheduled its U.S. 500
at Roger Penske's Michigan International Raceway on the same day as
the Indianapolis 500 in 1996, alluding to the Indy winner's customary
swigging of a bottle of milk in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   How time has changed their tune.</TE>
<TE>   Rahal, now calling the Indy 500 "an American tradition," is
planning a return to Indy with driver Jimmy Vasser.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very proud to return to Indianapolis Motor Speedway
again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ganassi has gone even farther. He still has his CART team, with
drivers Kenny Brack and Bruno Junqueiro, but he also has one in the
IRL, with Jeff Ward as his driver.</TE>
<TE>   Rahal and Ganassi--and Penske, one of CART's founders 23 years
ago--all will be at California Speedway this weekend for the IRL's
Yamaha Indy 400.</TE>
<TE>   Why this turnaround?</TE>
<TE>   It's simple: the Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   It still is the biggest and most important motor race in the world
and after six years of rancor and wrangling in Indy car racing, it
became apparent to some major CART sponsors, such as Marlboro and
Miller, that the IRL wasn't going away--as some CART team owners kept
insisting it would--and that if they wanted to showcase their names
at Indianapolis, they had better join the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Marlboro, with Penske and drivers Gil de Ferran and Helio
Castroneves, made the jump this year, even though its red and white
cars had won the last two CART championships. Miller dropped out of
CART, deciding to run one race only, the Indy 500. Team Rahal,
although still running a full CART schedule, agreed to run Vasser at
Indianapolis, with a test run at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   The defection of the Penske team, the cancellation of races in
Brazil and Texas, the announcement by Honda and Ford that they would
not provide CART engines beyond this season, and the scheduling of
nine races outside the United States led racing enthusiasts to
foresee, if not the end of CART, at least its significance as a U.S.
racing series.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the IRL was growing its all-U.S. series to 15
oval-track events, adding races in Michigan, California and Nazareth,
Pa.--all once CART tracks--and in its biggest public relations coup,
getting Penske's team on its side.</TE>
<TE>   When former promoter Chris Pook, newly named CART chief executive,
announced that he welcomed cooperation between his group and the IRL,
even leaving dates open so that CART teams could race in IRL events,
the perception was that the split might be healed and one series
emerging.</TE>
<TE>   That's hardly the case.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a more cooperative relationship, the series are far too
apart philosophically to merge.</TE>
<TE>   "The IRL has its product, it is an oval series and we are not,"
Pook said. "We are a completely different series. We are a
multi-national series comprised of different disciplines, racing on
ovals, road and street courses. The only comparative item is that
some of our guys will race on ovals and will be able to go and race
the Indianapolis 500."</TE>
<TE>   There also is reason to believe that even if open-wheel racing
were to become a single series again, the damage done is so severe
that there can be no return to Indy car racing's glory days.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Cindric, president of Marlboro Team Penske, on the other hand,
believes that a single series is a necessity to survival.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs to go to one series," said Cindric, probably echoing the
beliefs of his boss. "However that happens, whatever brand we put on
it, that's the only way it's going to survive in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger and our team are trying to get where we think open-wheel
racing needs to go. Obviously, we made the choice to be in the Indy
Racing League. The thing that we're trying to stress as much as
anything is, let's talk about the positives out there. Let's talk
about the last 20 laps [at Phoenix], what's going on between our two
guys and [Sam] Hornish, the fact that he goes to the back, up to the
front. That's what's going to build us and keep us where we need to
go.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Tony [George] has that vision, as well."</TE>
<TE>   The presence of the Penske cars, the emergence of one of racing's
brightest new lights in Hornish and some remarkably competitive
races, have not done much to attract new and larger IRL audiences,
though.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated crowd at Homestead, Fla., in the IRL's opening race,
was about 25,000, and last Sunday's race at Phoenix drew an estimated
30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales for Sunday's California Speedway race are lagging,
partly because the infield, with its 1,800 motor home sites, has been
largely taken over by the road course, which will be in use all
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be similar to our Saturday [NASCAR] shows," said
Bill Miller, speedway president. "I don't think that's bad. You're
talking about the first time a series is in a marketplace. It was
added late in the year, last October, and all of our season tickets
had already been released, so it's not part of our season-ticket
package.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you look at the entertainment dollar. You're always
competing for the entertainment dollar in Los Angeles because there's
so much to do. You have the Academy Awards, the NCAA tournament.
You're always competing for awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "I say 30,000 people at any event is a good event. Not too many
baseball games played in the Los Angeles area have more than 30,000
people. We have more people than Staples or any closed arena holds.
The demands have been positive. We know we're going to need to grow
these events as we go."</TE>
<TE>   One sore point for both the IRL and CART is that their races get
compared to NASCAR's wildly popular Winston Cup series. And NASCAR
also siphons off the racing dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't overlook the NASCAR effect on open-wheel racing," said
a California Speedway official. "People get their Winston Cup tickets
first, to be sure they don't get crowded out, and then they think
about other races. That is happening to us, and I'm sure it happened
at Phoenix too."</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup races at Fontana have been sellouts, with 115,000
attending last year's race.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Sharp, co-champion of IRL's inaugural year in 1996, doesn't
see this as a breakthrough year for the IRL, but only the
continuation of a long, steady growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, the Penske cars have raised the bar, but every year our
series has become more competitive," Sharp said. "I don't think there
is a series anywhere that has had the competition that we have had.
And the series has grown each year, more cars, more tracks, more
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep hearing about three new tracks this season, but we added
six last year with Chicago, St. Louis, Miami, Kansas City, Nashville
and Richmond. I think, with 15 races now, the IRL has elevated the
perception of its future with a good geographical mix.</TE>
<TE>   "Our car count is good. We had 27 at Homestead and 26 at Phoenix.
I think that's more than CART had for its opener."</TE>
<TE>   CART had 20 starters in Monterrey, Mexico, the same number that is
expected for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on April 14.</TE>
<TE>   There are 28 entries for this week's Yamaha Indy 400 at Fontana.
Practice is scheduled today, with qualifying Saturday at 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp, however, disagrees with the perception that IRL drivers are
not as good as CART drivers, a perception magnified by last year's
Indianapolis 500, in which CART team drivers finished in the first
six positions. The first IRL finisher was Eliseo Salazar, a
47-year-old Chilean, in seventh place.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I know, Indy was a disaster for the IRL last year," said
Sharp, who qualified on the pole at 226.037 mph but spun and crashed
on the first lap. "I'm still smarting over that, and it was just one
of those things where all the other IRL guys had unusual trouble.
That won't happen again this year, I guarantee that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Castroneves and De Ferran, the first two finishers last
May, will be on the IRL side this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not that the Kings have needed it lately, but help is on the way.</LD>
<LD>   Center Eric Belanger, sidelined since Jan. 15 because of a left
wrist injury, and veteran winger Kelly Buchberger, sidelined since
March 9 because of a sprained right ankle, are expected to return to
the lineup in a few days.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray is hoping for a Tuesday return for both players
but said Buchberger might be able to play Saturday or Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Belanger, meanwhile, has targeted a Thursday return at Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   "I need a few practices before I can jump in, especially at this
time of the year," said Belanger, who hasn't held a stick since
January but will return to full participation in practice this
morning. "It's playoff-type hockey, so I don't want to go out there
and look stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger's injury ended a streak of 243 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to be out there every night," he said, "but I was very
fortunate just to play that many games in a row. Injuries are part of
the game, but it's unfortunate that it had to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Winger Craig Johnson, who underwent surgery Tuesday to repair a
torn retina in his right eye, also could be back in the lineup next
week, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   While backup goaltender Jamie Storr and his wife, Niki, welcomed a
baby boy, Tyson, on Tuesday night, forward Ian Laperriere and his
wife, Magali, are still waiting for their first-born despite attempts
to induce labor this week.</TE>
<TE>   When his wife does deliver their son, who will be named Tristan,
Laperriere said that he plans to be there, even if it means sitting
out a game on the Kings' upcoming four-game trip, which starts Sunday
night at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Said Laperriere, the only King to play in all 70 games this
season: "Trust me, I love my teammates, I love the game, but for my
first little one, even if it was my third little one, I'll be there.
I want to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "These things happen maybe once or twice in a life. I don't want
to miss that."</TE>

<HD>Kings Have Nothing to Complain About</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Last loss to Colorado at Staples left them furious.
This time L.A. gets upper hand in 3-1 win.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No beer, soda, candy or debris of any kind rained down onto the ice
from unruly fans this time. King Coach Andy Murray was not ejected.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, angry and frustrated the last time they left home ice
after playing the Colorado Avalanche, had no complaints Thursday
night after rolling to a 3-1 victory over the Stanley Cup champions
in front of 18,231 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Neither did their fans, who sent them off with a standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings' fifth consecutive victory, coupled with the San Jose
Sharks' 4-1 dousing of the Calgary Flames, set up a showdown in the
Pacific Division between the Kings and the first-place Sharks on
Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an 8-14-4-2 start, the Kings are eight points ahead of
where they were at this point last season, when they rode a
late-season surge into the playoffs, and only two points behind the
division-leading Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   They're tied for fourth in the West with the Chicago Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   And after improving to 8-2-1-1 since the Olympic break, the Kings
felt a lot better than they did Jan. 26. That's when a series of
questionable calls in a 4-2 loss to the Avalanche unleashed the fans'
misguided fury and led to Murray's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you beat a great team like that, it's a great
confidence-booster," said Jason Allison, who scored his 17th goal.
"We've played them I think four times since I've been here and we've
played great against them and the [other] better teams. It makes you
feel good and confident going into the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher and rookie Jaroslav Bednar also scored goals for
the Kings and goaltender Felix Potvin stopped 26 shots, losing a
shutout when Radim Vrbata scored a power-play goal for the Avalanche
with 49 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Vrbata's goal enabled the Avalanche to avoid its third shutout
loss in six games. The defending champions, who have scored only 11
goals in six games, played the last half of the game without
high-scoring defenseman Rob Blake after the former King all-star was
struck across the face by an errant puck. Blake was taken to a local
hospital for precautionary X-rays of the bone above his right eye.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' 27-8-5-2 surge since Dec. 8 has carried them to within
five points of the second-place Avalanche in the Western Conference
playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   After pushing the Avalanche to the brink of elimination in a
bitterly contested seven-game Western Conference semifinal playoff
series last spring, the Kings won two of four tightly contested games
against the Avalanche this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there's a leftover rivalry from last year's playoffs,"
said Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley after his team lost for only the
second time in its last 11 road games. "It was a good, physical game,
like every other game with the Kings."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings always seem to be at their best against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the fear of getting embarrassed," Murray said before the
game of his team's recent success against the Avalanche, including a
10-3-1 record in Los Angeles since the end of the 1995-96 season.</TE>
<TE>   In this one, the Kings never trailed. They took the lead for good
shortly after the crowd observed a moment of silence for Brittanie
Cecil, a 13-year-old girl who died Monday after being struck in the
head by a deflected shot that caromed into the stands at an NHL game
Saturday at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Only 2 minutes 38 seconds into the game, Avalanche center Joe
Sakic put the Kings on the power play when he was called for hooking
Jaroslav Modry.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings needed only 32 seconds to take advantage, a shot from
the right point by Mathieu Schneider deflecting off Boucher's left
skate and sailing past Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy at 3:10 of
the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Roy could not be faulted for that goal, but he seemed to misread a
shot from just beyond the blue line by Bednar midway through the
second period. The 60-foot shot beat Roy to the near side, giving
Bednar his second goal in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a minute later, with Avalanche center Steve Moore in the
penalty box, the Kings increased their lead to 3-0. Allison pounced
on a rebound of a shot from the left point by Modry and lifted a
backhanded shot over Roy for a power-play goal with 7:43 to play in
the period.</TE>

<HD>Like West, Magic Ponders His Future in Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A story has circulated that Magic Johnson has taken too much credit
for the Lakers landing Shaquille O'Neal six years ago, and that
bothers Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry West, armed with a wide salary-cap berth that summer, led
that recruitment, and Johnson said he would not intentionally suggest
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "Jerry's the man," Johnson said on Thursday afternoon. "I learned
from Jerry how to do things. I learned from the master. Just like
Mitch [Kupchak] learned from the master.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm mad because those stories are putting Jerry in a bad position
to have to defend me, and we're so close."</TE>
<TE>   Unusually so, it would seem, because even as West recently has
pondered a return to the NBA, Johnson, who will be 43 this summer,
finds in him similar competitive urges.</TE>
<TE>   And, like West, Johnson is not certain how to sate them, or if he
will at all.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he does not want to coach. But he would consider
becoming a general manager, and he recently has mulled asking for
more responsibility with the Lakers, for whom he is part owner and
vice president, perhaps in international scouting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying I'm going to do it," he said, "because I may not.
It's a great life I have already.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I do it? Hmmm. Probably not. If it was something like the
Knicks or the Lakers, then I would listen. If it never happens, I'm
OK. I'm great.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not chasing anything. What I would do is sit down and talk."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, it appears that West continues to wrestle with
the potential of restarting his career. West reportedly telephoned
the Golden State Warriors this week to say he is not pursuing a job
or an ownership stake there, despite reports to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   The Contra Costa Times reported that West left a message for
public relations director Raymond Ridder, a former Laker employee,
saying he was probably not going to work again, and that he was
dismayed by the rampant speculation there.</TE>
<TE>   West also spoke to Garry St. Jean, the Warrior general manager,
about his intentions.</TE>

Shaquille O'Neal scored 28 points and Kobe Bryant killed the crowd
with a 360-degree dunk. They led by as many as 35 points in the
fourth quarter in the Pistons' first nationally televised game in two
years. "We weren't really there," Piston Coach Rick Carlisle said
afterward. Detroit is 24-10 since, but has lost three straight in Los
Angeles and seven in a row in the series. Jerry Stackhouse averages
22 points and Ben Wallace averages 12.4 rebounds and 3.38 blocked
shots. Corliss Williamson is an effective sixth man.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Searching for Energy</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After consecutive blowout losses in Texas,
L.A. finds an imposing schedule looming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers were built for the NBA playoffs, for series spread over
weeks, not hours. It is a convenient alibi, though earned over the
last two regular seasons, both of which led to parades and car flags
and astonishing mayoral revelry.</LD>
<LD>   How that explains a terrible trip through Texas, however, remained
a mystery Thursday, when the Lakers gathered in El Segundo to prepare
for tonight's game against the Central Division-leading Detroit
Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson concluded there would be a practice, after an
18-point loss at San Antonio followed a 16-point loss at Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "We looked like we never played before," forward Robert Horry
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers flew half the night Wednesday and the Pistons played
Thursday night at Phoenix, presenting a favorable opportunity to rest
the team that insists it is fatigued after three games in three
cities in four nights.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the starters lifted weights, took treatment on their
bruises and performed other various light exercises ("An off-the-feet
day," guard Kobe Bryant said on his way out), the reserves played
their standard game of four-on-four/rugby, and the big games keep
coming.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't come to play, bring some energy and play better
defense, this is how we're going to feel after games," reserve guard
Brian Shaw had said. "And I think guys are a little tired and a
little beat up."</TE>
<TE>   After they play the surprising Pistons, the Lakers play at
Sacramento on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   They play host to Cleveland on Tuesday night, play at Phoenix on
Wednesday night, play Portland and San Antonio over a long weekend,
then fly off for four East Coast games the week after.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, center Shaquille O'Neal is experimenting with new
sneakers and orthotic devices, Bryant's game hit a sideways spell,
and Jackson rode some front-liners--Bryant, Horry, Rick Fox and Derek
Fisher--late into the Dallas blowout, perhaps setting up the San
Antonio debacle.</TE>
<TE>   After another season spent counting odd losses to some very poor
basketball teams, Jackson had said he welcomed the attention-baiting
games at the top of the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it, but the real thing is, this all falls to the wayside
when April 19, or whenever the season ends, and we start preparing
for the playoffs," he said. "What's important to remember is it's
still that marathon race, and we're now down to just a few runners
out there in the top of the league.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember we have to keep stride with them. We don't
want to bury ourselves in the process of trying to get too far ahead
of ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "This team understands that, but also knows our placement is
important."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson did not stay around after Thursday's practice, making it a
light day for everyone. That left the post-mortem to assistant Jim
Cleamons, a defensive specialist who has seen the Lakers give up at
least 102 points in five of seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "The common thread was how fast they rushed the ball back at us,"
Cleamons said of the games in Texas. "But that's what [Dallas point
guard Steve] Nash does. And San Antonio, they've been trying to up
the tempo a little."</TE>
<TE>   It is a familiar offensive strategy against the sometimes plodding
Lakers, and rookie Tony Parker pushed the Spurs' break, a few times
after made baskets or free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to play with a little more energy," Cleamons said.</TE>
<TE>   Tied with the first-place Sacramento Kings when they landed in
Texas on Monday evening, the Lakers stand two losses back with 15
games to play. Two of those are against the Kings, and the Kings
collapsed last season just in time for the Lakers to take home-court
advantage through the conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Laker players continue to talk calmly about another
championship. If five consecutive wins and 12 in 14 games--the Laker
trends heading into Texas--won them nothing, then consecutive defeats
cost them nothing either.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if there was anything we learned from our championship
run, it's that it's not about emotion and it's not about confidence,"
Bryant said after the loss to the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "It has everything to do with execution."</TE>

<LD>Oregon vs. Texas: This game offers the country a chance to meet two
great young point guards who couldn't be more different. Texas
freshman T.J. Ford, who came from Houston, was considered by Longhorn
Coach Rick Barnes his biggest recruit in four years because everyone
wanted Ford but for a change the Texas kid stayed home. He is 5 feet
10, a true point guard, Barnes said, with extreme quickness and
unquestionable presence on the court. Ford has starred in big games.
He had 16 points and 11 assists against Kansas this year, 18 points
and 12 assists against Missouri and he already has set the Texas
season mark for assists with 268. Oregon's Luke Ridnour, a 6-2
sophomore, already has been compared to John Stockton and says his
idol is Pete Maravich. Ridnour is more of a scoring threat than Ford,
and sets a faster tempo for his team. Ford is excellent running the
Longhorns' half-court offense. Oregon is making its first NCAA
regional semifinal appearance in 42 years. Oregon's most spectacular
player, senior guard Frederick Jones, has the ability to change a
game as he did with his 24 points against Wake Forest last weekend.
His monster dunk off a rebound tied the score at 78-78 and seemed to
energize both his team and the crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Kansas vs. Illinois: This is the revenge game of the tournament.
Kansas is supposed to be on the mission after getting demolished by
Illinois, 80-64, in last year's Sweet 16. It was an ugly affair with
bad shooting and a lot of fouls. The Jayhawks, the No. 4 seed, were
physically dominated (outrebounded, 45-33) by top-seeded Illinois,
and the loss left a nasty taste. Now Kansas, as the top seed and
coming off an undefeated Big 12 regular season, is the favorite and
Illinois the No. 4 seed. Illini Coach Bill Self said he thinks the
Jayhawks are the more physical, more aggressive team this year as
well as being the quicker team. The Jayhawks use a three-guard lineup
with Kirk Hinrich, Jeff Boschee and Aaron Miles and the plan is to
make the game up-tempo. Self said that "we'd much prefer a half-court
game." The Illini are led by enigmatic guard Frank Williams. Brian
Cook, a 6-10 junior forward, will have a key job in trying to handle
Kansas' All-American forward Drew Gooden, who is a candidate for
player of the year and averages 20.2 points and 11.2 rebounds.</TE>

<HD>Ovals Just Fine for De Ferran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gil de Ferran fell in love with auto racing's road courses. These
days, though, the Brazilian driver lives in the left-turn-only
circuit, the Indy Racing League.</LD>
<LD>   Still, De Ferran is a happy man because he's driving for owner
Roger Penske, because he's having fun on ovals and because at this
stage of his career, an IRL championship would be a crowning
achievement.</LD>
<LD>   De Ferran is one of two series champions who will compete in
Sunday's 200-lap Yamaha Indy 400 at California Speedway. Sam Hornish
Jr. is the IRL champion and the current leader. De Ferran won the
title in the rival CART series the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Then Penske switched from CART to the IRL, giving his drivers, De
Ferran and Indy 500 champion Helio Castroneves, a chance to shine in
a new arena.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, an IRL championship would mean a lot," said De Ferran,
who set the world closed-course speed record at Fontana, 241.428 mph,
in qualifying before the 2000 CART race. "Oval racing is a foreign
discipline, it's like fighting in someone else's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember my first oval race, Phoenix, '94, and I thought, 'Boy,
was I wrong about this.' It looked so easy."</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran, 34, ranks third in the series with 80 points. Hornish,
the leader, has 89 points and Castroneves 85.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran has finished second to each, Hornish in the season
opener at Homestead, Fla., and Castroneves last week at Phoenix.
Penske's team did most of its testing at those tracks and Fontana.
Thus the most challenging part of the season is ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no experience in night races [three are on the IRL
schedule] or at a lot of these tracks, Richmond, Pikes Peak,
Nashville," De Ferran said.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes he hasn't seen his last road course, though. Would he
like to return to CART, the series rival of the IRL which includes
street and road courses as well as ovals?</TE>
<TE>   "Let me answer it this way," he said. "I would like to do some
road racing at some point in the future. How that's going to be, I
don't know. It's probably not going to be this year. [He's signed
with Penske through this season]. I'm very happy driving for Roger.
It's hard to explain how much, but I really like being a Penske
driver and I trust Roger's judgment."</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran spent six seasons in CART, the last two with Penske, and
says he is impressed by rules, attitude and marketing changes in that
series since the arrival of Chris Pook as president in December. CART
races through the streets of Long Beach on April 14.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pulled everyone together, made some tough decisions, some
good decisions; his addition to the ranks has been a good one," De
Ferran said.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran, though, is a staunch supporter of a unified series.</TE>
<TE>   "The flag I carry is one of my sponsors, my team and myself," he
said. "I'm pro Indy car.... They might be able to survive separately,
but they'll enjoy better prosperity together.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, what's necessary is people understand there is one Indy
championship. That's very important as far as the greater public good
is concerned. That's why the Indy 500 is so important; it brings our
cars identity."</TE>
<TE>   But it would satisfy his competitive nature too.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a racing series that had [Formula One drivers] Mika
Hakkinen, Juan Montoya, Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, [Winston
Cup drivers] Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, [IRL driver] Sam Hornish,
[and CART drivers] Dario Franchitti, Cristiano da Matta all in one
place, I would do my best to be there," De Ferran said. "I would
really want to go against those guys. Part of the reason I want this
thing unified is exactly that, so that we don't have any more
dilution of talent.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want is to race the most competitive guys on earth driving
some of the most challenging cars there are, and if we can do it at
Indianapolis, I'd be even happier."</TE>

<HD>Spurs Pull Even With Mavericks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most basketball fans are monitoring their NCAA brackets, the
San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks are watching the NBA's Western
Conference standings even closer.</LD>
<LD>   That's why their game Thursday night was so important.</LD>
<LD>   With Tim Duncan scoring 32 points, and rookie Tony Parker making a
big basket in the last half-minute, the Spurs beat the Mavericks,
105-102, at Dallas for their 11th consecutive victory and tied them
for the Midwest Division lead.</LD>
<TE>   The teams have met three times this season and each game has been
decided in the final minute. Adding to the intensity of this meeting
between the rivals was the fact that both were coming off lopsided
victories over the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is real satisfying," said David Robinson, who had 22 points
and 12 rebounds. "These last two games really gave us a chance to
shoot for our short-term goal, which is to win the division. We've
been through our bumps and bruises and now we're starting to play
like contenders."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs let a 13-point lead dissolve into a two-point deficit
with 2:34 left, then scored six points in a row, capped by a
three-point basket by Bruce Bowen. After a layup by Dirk Nowitzki,
Parker made his jumper to make it 100-96 with 26 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki, who had 29 points and 14 rebounds, made two free throws
with 20.9 seconds left to get the Mavericks within two. A free throw
by Greg Buckner with 19.8 left made it 100-99.</TE>
<TE>   But Buckner missed his second shot and wound up fouling Danny
Ferry. His two free throws with 14.5 seconds left put the Spurs up by
three.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 118, Denver 82--Hedo Turkoglu scored a career-high 31
points at Sacramento as the Kings sent the Nuggets to their seventh
consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   With Peja Stojakovic sitting out because of an injured hamstring,
Turkoglu was 12 of 15 from the field in a rare start. The Kings are
25-5 when he scores in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   In a warmup to Sunday's home game against the Lakers, Sacramento
appeared ready for the showdown. The Kings have the NBA's best record
at 49-19 and are 32-3 at home, also a league best.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings ahead, 94-66, after three quarters, Sacramento fans
began chanting "Beat L.A." before the fourth quarter began.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 95, Phoenix 82--Clifford Robinson scored 28 points in his
return to Phoenix, leading the Pistons to their fourth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse had 23 points and seven assists for Detroit,
which moved 31/2 games ahead of Milwaukee for the Central Division
lead. Detroit also moved within two games of New Jersey for the best
record in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 94, Washington 79--Karl Malone scored 23 points and John
Stockton had 19 as the Jazz won in Michael Jordan's first game at the
Delta Center since his winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had 11 points in his second game after missing 12 because
of surgery on his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 118, New York 89--Nazr Mohammed scored 24 points and
Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 20 as the Hawks routed the Knicks at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 95, Memphis 93--Kevin Garnett scored four of his 25
points in the final 1:15 as the Timberwolves held off the Grizzlies
at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver Nugget forward Antonio McDyess was put on the injured list
because of knee inflammation. McDyess, who missed the first 54 games
of the season after surgery on his left knee, had returned to the
lineup March 1.</TE>

<HD>British Skier Stripped of His Olympic Medal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The first British skier to win an Olympic medal was stripped of the
award Thursday for using a decongestant that contained a banned
stimulant, despite his claim he made an innocent mistake.</LD>
<LD>   The case was similar to that of the Romanian gymnast who lost her
gold medal at the Summer Games in Sydney for taking a cold pill.</LD>
<LD>   The International Olympic Committee's executive board said Alain
Baxter will be stripped of his bronze medal for testing positive for
methamphetamine contained in a Vicks inhaler he used at last month's
Winter Games.</LD>
<TE>   "The mere presence of the substance in the body constitutes a
doping offense," IOC Director General Francois Carrard said. "There
is no room to take into account whether it was in good faith or not.
That's a rule and we absolutely have to apply it."</TE>
<TE>   The Scotsman's medal will go to fourth-place finisher Benjamin
Raich of Austria. The IOC said the British Olympic Assn. must return
it by March 31.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC also disqualified Vasily Pankov, a hockey player from
Belarus, who tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. The team
doctor, Evgeni Lositski, was banned from the next two Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old Baxter was the third athlete to lose a medal for a
doping infraction in Salt Lake City. Five doping cases have been
confirmed from those Games, matching the total at all previous Winter
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter and the BOA said the skier was harshly punished for
unwittingly taking a banned substance in an over-the-counter
decongestant.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said he would consult with lawyers on whether to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long three weeks, going from the best couple days of
my life to the worst three weeks," he said.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Confronts Mutiny</HD>
<DH>College baseball: Twelve straight losing seasons under
Henderson grow worse as 20 of 25 players walk out and force the
cancellation of four games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Occidental College baseball team is going through a season like
many others in recent history. The Tigers are again under .500 and
figure to finish in the bottom half of the seven-team Southern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</LD>
<LD>   For every victory over Redlands, there is a lopsided loss to
Chapman or the Master's. The Tigers' coach, Jeff Henderson, has led
the team for 16 seasons, the last 12 of a losing variety. But at the
Division III level, coaches seldom lose their jobs solely because
they haven't won enough games. At academics-oriented Occidental,
Henderson hasn't had to worry about job security.</LD>
<LD>   That's the problem, say some former members of the team. After a
players-only meeting last week, 20 of the 25 players on the Tiger
roster walked out on the coach during a meeting the next day. In
essence, it was a mutiny against Henderson.</LD>
<TE>   "We have no respect for him as a coach and we feel he has no
respect for us as players," senior catcher Jason Sabolic said. "We
aren't motivated to play for him."</TE>
<TE>   The move forced Occidental to cancel four games in the California
Classic last weekend. The Tigers resumed practice Wednesday and will
play nonconference games today against Chapman and Menlo.</TE>
<TE>   Some players, mostly freshmen, have returned over the last few
days. Henderson said a few asked to return minutes after their
protest and expects to have 16 from the season-opening roster for
today's games. That leaves nine holdouts in an episode that has
brought the program unwanted publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm very disappointed with the situation," said
Henderson, who played at Occidental in the early 1980s.
"Individually, I was hurt by this. I was further disappointed that
we've had to deal with this in the paper when I think it's a team
issue that really should be kept within the team."</TE>
<TE>   Disagreements between players and coaches are not uncommon. In an
extreme case, 10 San Jose State basketball players left the team
midway through the 1989 season and demanded the dismissal of Coach
Bill Berry. Berry stayed on, coaching mostly walk-ons, but was fired
after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental Athletic Director Dixon Farmer said he has no desire to
make such a move, although he said Henderson will be evaluated at
season's end.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Jeff as a person and I like the stuff he has done for our
program," Farmer said of the coach who also oversees the school's
club teams and intramural sports program. "He's been an Oxy guy in
every sense of the word."</TE>
<TE>   Some players wonder how one of Occidental's own let the program
deteriorate from a high level set by longtime former coach Grant
Dunlap.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Simon Rodell, a first baseman and one of the team's top
pitchers, claims the coach resists opinions from players and has
taken to blaming Rodell and four others for leading the revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that it's a temporary step, but we refuse to play for
Coach Henderson," Rodell said. "We love nothing more than to play
baseball. But Coach Henderson has been vindictive and dishonest."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a difficult season for the Tigers. Two days before the
first game, freshman shortstop Greg Davis was killed in a car
accident. Junior center fielder Yamil Verde, a Marine reserve, was
called to active duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have been scarred," Farmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some players viewed the walkout as unnecessary. "I think it was
too extreme of a move," said Jared Miller, a junior outfielder now
playing catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Sabolic understands not everyone shares his view. "The guys that
[returned], they did it for personal reasons," he said. "That's their
decision and I'm fine with it."</TE>
<TE>   But some friction has developed between those who returned and
those who are holding out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard because a lot of them are your friends and now when you
see them, they're kind of [distant] with you," said freshman pitcher
Paul Beringhaus, who did not take part in the walkout. "But I've got
some of friends on the team and I really want to play."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Henderson is looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to play," he said. "We've got guys who want to play."</TE>

<HD>Barnes Is Given Pause; UCLA Is Not Refreshed</HD>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>One minute, thirty-eight seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Long enough to dry a sweat, cool a shot, lose a spark.</LD>
<LD>   At the crumpled finish of another UCLA spring joyride Thursday, it
was also long enough to end a season.</LD>
<TE>   One minute, thirty-eight seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In a West regional semifinal won by Missouri, 82-73, that was the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Sound crazy?</TE>
<TE>   What happened during that 1:38, now that was crazy.</TE>
<TE>   That was the game-clock time that Matt Barnes sat on the bench
midway through the second half after being inexplicably removed by
Coach Steve Lavin amid the best individual stretch of any player in
this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Long enough to slow the legs, distract the focus, kill the moment.</TE>
<TE>   When Barnes was pulled, he had been involved in 15 of the Bruins'
previous 17 points in a run that gave them an eight-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   He had scored 11. He had thrown two great passes that led to four
more points. He had blocked a shot. He had gotten so excited, he
bounced a ball off the leg of Missouri's Justin Gage after the
whistle and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   He was brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he was benched.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason," said Missouri's Kareem Rush, grinning and
shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   With 12:33 remaining in the game, Barnes departed, T.J. Cummings
entered, and Clarence Gilbert was immediately fouled by Cummings on a
layup that turned into a three-point play.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Barnes was rushed back in with 10:55 remaining, the
Tigers had closed the gap to four, but his absence wasn't about
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   It was about Barnes' disappearing magic.</TE>
<TE>   "After I came back, I never really got back into a rhythm," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   His first shot after he returned was an airball. He missed three
of his first four shots and committed a butter-fingered turnover. He
scored only five points the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that eight-point lead?</TE>
<TE>   From the moment Barnes left until the time when he was the last
Bruin to trudge to the locker room after the game, the Bruins were
outscored by 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   We weren't the only ones to notice.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rush, who scored 16 points in the second half: "Barnes had it
going. When they took him out of the game, a scorer like that ... it
fueled us to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rico Hines, the injured Bruin veteran watching from the
bench: "I'm sure he needed a quick rest. But, yeah, when he left, the
momentum just swung. Matt was on fire. He wasn't going to let us
lose."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' most impressive 22-year-old physical specimen needed a
rest?</TE>
<TE>   Barnes had played 36 minutes Sunday in the second-round upset of
Cincinnati. He had played at least 30 of a possible 40 minutes in
seven of his last 10 starts.</TE>
<TE>   And he's a former football star.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really need a rest," Barnes said. "But I could see where
they wanted to put in somebody fresher than me."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin said he has been substituting like this for most of his
six-year UCLA career. He said he likes to take his starters out in
the middle of the half so they can have the added rest of a
television timeout.</TE>
<TE>   He said this sort of brief substitution helped the team win the
double-overtime game against Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it was effective tonight or not, this is what I've done
my whole career," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of Sweet 16 loss, however, was the worst of that career.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lavin is now 1-4 in these games, with an average losing
margin of 18 points, this was different than losing to eventual
national champions like Kentucky or Duke.</TE>
<TE>   This was a game they should have won, against a team they had
trapped.</TE>
<TE>   This was a game that could have opened a door to a suddenly,
startlingly possible path to a national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   To blow this sort of game on the same night that the nation's No.
1 team and potential national semifinal opponent blew its game?</TE>
<TE>   The ending here wasn't as ugly as the Duke loss.</TE>
<TE>   But for Bruin fans, it was just as exasperating.</TE>
<TE>   After two postseason wins that seemed to extricate Lavin from the
clutches of his critics for at least a couple of more seasons, the
hounds will be barking again.</TE>
<TE>   To make it worse, he followed the Barnes benching with another
strange substitution with 46 seconds left in the game, Missouri's
Clarence Gilbert at the line and the Tigers still leading by a
reachable seven points.</TE>
<TE>   He took out Barnes, Jason Kapono, Dan Gadzuric and Billy Knight,
replacing them with young reserves.</TE>
<TE>   A little early for that, no? Haven't bigger margins been cut in
less time?</TE>
<TE>   "That was the passing of the baton," Lavin said. "We wanted to
allow our future to be on the floor as we passed the baton to next
year."</TE>
<TE>   As Thursday proved again, it is a future that will not be any
calmer than the past.</TE>
<TE>   It is a future that could make 1:38 seem like forever.</TE>

<HD>Jayhawks' Exit Wounds Haven't Healed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Roy Williams, Kansas' perpetually sunny basketball coach, tightened
his jaw, narrowed his eyes, clenched his teeth. The question has
become tiresome, the implications ominous.</LD>
<LD>   Is this game against Illinois tonight at the Kohl Center, a
semifinal game in the NCAA Midwest Regional, a Sweet 16 game that
could be the best of the bunch in this round ... is it a revenge
game, Roy? Is there evil intent on your mind? The way Illinois beat
your Jayhawks in the Sweet 16 a year ago, beat them physically and
mentally and thoroughly ... hasn't that been gnawing at you, Roy?
Doesn't it make you want to spit out the nasty taste? Haven't you
been growling at your players ever since the draw came out, "We must
beat the heck out of Illinois?"</LD>
<LD>   This is, Williams says, glaring, a rather silly question, isn't
it? "If I talk about last year's game," Williams says, "I've got
three of my top seven players looking at me and having no idea what
I'm talking about because we have three freshmen in our top seven and
they have no clue."</LD>
<TE>   If Kansas loses to Illinois tonight, it will be a devastating
blow, and about that all the Jayhawks have a clue. It will be a kick
in the gut. It will bring tears and searching for reasons. Kansas is
the polar opposite of UCLA. Kansas is master of the regular season,
flop of the postseason. This is the fifth time a Williams-coached
Kansas team has been seeded No. 1. Three more times it has been
seeded No. 2. But while there have been two Final Fours (no titles),
there have also been five second-round losses by Williams' Jayhawks.</TE>
<TE>   "We know about last year," rookie guard Aaron Miles says grimly.
"We've seen the film," freshman guard Keith Langford says. "It's not
a secret, what happened against Illinois," first-year forward Wayne
Simien says.</TE>
<TE>   On Midwest Regional media day here, there is so much unspoken when
Kansas comes to the microphones. It is almost as difficult as pulling
the wings off flies, pushing Williams to talk about the NCAA
tournament. Williams has taken the Jayhawks to 12 NCAAs. There are so
many sorry exits.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Kansas, seeded No. 2, lost to No. 7 UCLA in the
second round in 1990; Kansas, seeded No. 1, lost to No. 9 Texas El
Paso in 1992; Kansas, seeded No. 1, lost to No. 8 Rhode Island in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   That last one hurt. A Kansas radio announcer did his postgame show
from press row after that loss and he almost had tears in his eyes.
Who was Rhode Island? Why was that mean man, Jim Harrick, beating the
Jayhawks? Why was Lamar Odom even in school? Rhode Island was never
on television. What conference did Rhode Island come from? How, how
did it happen? This was the year Williams was going to win it all,
for sure, absolutely, if there was any justice. The players were
inconsolable. Williams was ashen.</TE>
<TE>   And the story was such a rerun. Kansas always brings big, tall,
deep teams to the NCAA tournament. The Jayhawks are always highly
ranked and well-coached. The players are polite and graduate from
college. At home, at Allen Fieldhouse, where the noise is deafening
and the officials kind, the Jayhawks are oh, so tough. They run up
and down the floor and as the season moves along they run faster and
gain momentum and score 100 points a couple of times, the word
builds, the reputation grows, the hype expands.</TE>
<TE>   This, this will be the year Roy Williams gets his national title.</TE>
<TE>   But then the Jayhawks leave Allen Fieldhouse and they find out
that running doesn't work if the other team is faster. That depth
doesn't matter if the other team is stronger. Or that height is nice
for cutting down nets at the Big 12 tournament, but if those big guys
have slow feet and slow legs, height just slows you down.</TE>
<TE>   So here the Jayhawks are again. As they swept through the Big
12--the conference with four teams still alive as the Sweet 16 began
Thursday--without losing a regular-season game, the momentum gathered
steam, the hype expanded, the hopes swelled.</TE>
<TE>   Being undefeated in the Big 12 erased from memory the way UCLA,
with its depth, its speed, its size, ran over Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   It's harder, though, to ignore how big, strong, quick Oklahoma ran
over Kansas in the final of the Big 12 tournament. Or how undersized
underdog Holy Cross caused the Jayhawks to seize up in the first
round, sticking close until the end, leading for significant parts of
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   So Jayhawk Nation is uneasy about this game against Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointing as they may have been during the regular season, the
Illini are not significantly different from the team that beat Kansas
so badly a year ago. Some muscle and steadiness left with Sergio
McClain, but mostly Illinois is still strong and athletic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is Kansas with the glamour player, multi-talented
forward Drew Gooden. Kansas has three smart guards in the starting
lineup to set the tempo, control the ups and downs and swings in
momentum. Kansas seems to have received a favorable draw, getting
unathletic Stanford in the second round and either history-hindered
Oregon or Big 12 patsy Texas in the regional final.</TE>
<TE>   Except first there is this bully, this Big Ten toughie with
hard-nosed players and a certain swagger that comes with the memories
of that 80-64 win a year ago. As the Kansas players were pounded with
Illinois questions Thursday afternoon, their shoulders seemed to sag
a bit, their smiles went away, their hands rolled into fists.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have nothing to lose," Illinois guard Frank Williams
said.</TE>

<HD>Serve's Up at Malibu for Stewart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For eight exhausting minutes, Doug Stewart hit backhand and forehand
volleys on his backyard tennis court near Zuma Beach in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   With each powerful stroke, his breathing became heavier and his
heart beat faster. His T-shirt went from dry to soaking wet.</LD>
<LD>   Few 17-year-olds in any sport could put together the sustained
bursts of energy displayed by Stewart, the No. 1-ranked high school
tennis player in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   To think he was engaged only in a short workout with his father,
Forrest, reveals plenty about Stewart's drive to succeed in a sport
in which mental toughness is as important as physical ability.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it came naturally, the competing aspect, fighting for
every point," he said. "I just like the aspect, me versus him, and
who's going to blink first. I feel confident when I'm out there. I
can out-compete anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, a senior at Malibu High, has been ranked No. 1 for his
age group in Southern California by the U.S. Tennis Assn. at 10, 12,
14, 16 and 18. Last season, he won the Southern Section individual
championship.</TE>
<TE>   He signed with Virginia last fall, turning down Stanford, UCLA,
USC, Princeton and Pepperdine. He's a straight-A student who scored
1,370 on his SAT. His older brother plays tennis at Princeton and his
younger sister is a freshman tennis player at Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   His father played tennis at UCLA and is a respected coach who
trained his children to be good players and also good citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "I've raised them to be individuals and rise up and make a
difference," Forrest said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 5 feet 10 and 160 pounds, has a 115-mph serve, an
aggressive two-hand backhand and strikes the ball so hard that
opponents trying to return volleys struggle if they don't stay alert.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Stewart would rise at 5 a.m. and head to Pepperdine
with his brother to lift weights under the direction of a private
trainer. He'd pass his friends going to the beach to surf before
school.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I'm crazy for lifting weights that early in the
morning, and I say, 'You're crazy for surfing that early in the
morning,'" Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart and his father have been adamant about not making tennis a
24-hour-a-day obsession. Rather than spend weeks away from home
traveling to international tournaments, Stewart turned down
tournaments to stay in school and maintain a sense of normality
during his teenage years.</TE>
<TE>   His academic success has enabled him to have a fallback plan if
his goal of playing professionally doesn't work out.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he did travel to Japan to represent the United States in
the Junior Davis Cup, an experience he'll never forget.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to play for your country and not just you," he said.
"It gave me the belief I could do this."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has been playing since he was 6. He used to play against
his brother, Steve, in the backyard after school in matches that both
took as seriously as if they were playing at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a death match," Stewart said. "Neither of us wanted to
lose and we'd go at it."</TE>
<TE>   Playing against Stewart requires intense mental discipline. He
attacks and never lets up, priding himself on his steady, stoic
demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a lot of highs and lows," he said. "I keep constant
pressure on my opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he disagrees with those expressing concern about the
lack of American successors to the likes of Andre Agassi and Pete
Sampras in men's tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "They were saying the same things after [Jimmy] Connors and [John]
McEnroe retired," he said. "All of a sudden, Agassi, [Jim] Courier
and [Michael] Chang came up. There are a lot of players who will
replace the Samprases and Agassis."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart could be one of those future American standouts, and he's
not afraid of the commitment needed to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of hard work," he said. "You need a good coach, but it
comes from the desire to do it. You have to get out there and play.
The winning part is fun, but the working part is fun, too. When I'm
out there, I'm not thinking about the pain in my legs. I'm thinking
if I get this shot right, I'm going to do more winning."</TE>

<HD>Rhetoric Increases on Eve of WTA Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly everyone contending for control of women's tennis stresses how
much respect everyone has for one another, how well they get along,
how there is no alphabet-soup feud.</LD>
<LD>   So why is rhetoric increasing on the eve of the WTA board of
directors' vote on whether to move its season-ending championship
from Munich to Staples Center?</LD>
<LD>   Bob Kain, president and chief operating officer of International
Management Group, which represents athletes but also runs and
promotes some tennis tournaments, fired off a letter to the board,
detailing his opposition, but said it was not about a fight between
IMG and potential championship promoters Octagon and Anschutz
Entertainment Group.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president of AEG and Staples Center, sent a message
to the board too, making his own last-minute push.</TE>
<TE>   One of Kain's objections is his belief there already are too many
women's events in Southern California--three, two with IMG ties. The
closest one to Staples Center is in Manhattan Beach, but Leiweke said
he'd offered to move that event to AEG's facility in Carson, which is
under construction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed to protect any downside risk on tickets by
providing a guarantee," Leiweke said. "It's unfounded that the WTA
Championships could have a negative impact on an event that just
received an offer with a minimum guarantee that is equal to, or
better than, any moneys they have made over the past three years on
an average."</TE>
<TE>   That offer has not been accepted by IMG. Kain said discussions are
continuing, and should the board approve the move today in Miami,
that would not be the end of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll keep fighting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear if he meant legal action against the WTA. The vote
today is expected to be close.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board ultimately votes in favor of it, any additional
fighting that occurs after that fact, the people that lose are the
fans and the players," Leiweke said. "Whoever wants to continue that
battle, I hope they can look the players in the eye and justify their
actions because it's the players that would [lose out] in this deal
if this gets into a legal battle."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kain: "Our whole issue is tournament ownership rights. The
WTA rules basically say 125 miles.... There are already three women's
tournaments in this 125-mile area between La Costa, Manhattan Beach
and Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "There's none in New York--other than the U.S. Open--but no WTA
event, none in Chicago, none in Philadelphia, none in Dallas, none in
Boston, none in Detroit."</TE>
<TE>   Octagon President Phil de Picciotto countered, saying, "A market
isn't defined by geography. It's defined by time, by distance and by
the product you are offering."</TE>
<TE>   Indian Wells officials have said they do not feel there is a
problem with another women's event in Southern California. La Costa
tournament director Raquel Giscafre said there was a potential
conflict, but her event is held outdoors at a destination resort in
early August and actually overlaps with Manhattan Beach by one day.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, touting Staples Center's appeal, said: "We've had the
Grammys, U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the NBA and NHL All-Star
games. Why wouldn't the WTA Championships want to be held in that
same light? And isn't that good? Does the NBA All-Star game take away
from ticket sales, sponsorship or media and fan interest in the
Lakers or Clippers? Of course not, it only adds to it."</TE>

<LD>Golf has its own version of March Madness. It's Tiger Woods' march to
the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't really matter that the Players Championship on NBC this
weekend is considered the fifth major. What matters is how Woods
fares.</LD>
<LD>   Woods, who won last weekend at Bay Hill for the third year in a
row and is defending champion at the Players Championship this
weekend, has tremendous drawing power.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone on the tour owes money to the Woods factor," NBC's
Johnny Miller said by phone from Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Woods means ratings, and ratings mean money.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend during the final half-hour of the Bay Hill
Invitational, where Woods was beating a faltering Phil Mickelson,
golf on NBC got a higher national rating than the NCAA tournament on
CBS, 6.9 to 6.7.</TE>
<TE>   And in Los Angeles, NBC's coverage of the final round of the Bay
Hill tournament averaged a better rating than UCLA's double-overtime
victory over Cincinnati, 6.0 to 5.6.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR Tops All</TE>
<TE>   Although Woods helped boost the golf rating Sunday, the highest
rated sports event of the weekend was Sunday's Carolina Dodge Dealers
400 on Fox, with a 5.8 national rating.</TE>
<TE>   The two days of NCAA tournament games Saturday and Sunday on CBS
averaged a 5.2, which was also the national rating for the final
round of the Bay Hill Classic.</TE>
<TE>   More on Woods</TE>
<TE>   Miller says it's a different Woods now, a more conservative Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what Tiger plays for now is to put himself in position to
win a close match down the stretch," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jack] Nicklaus used to be that way. Whenever Nicklaus and I
would have a close match he would say, 'Thanks for making it so fun.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the way Tiger is now. He enjoys winning a close
match. He has pulled back a little on the rpms. He's still got all
the horsepower, he's just not using it all."</TE>
<TE>   No question Woods likes the competition. On USA's preview show
Wednesday night, Woods was asked by Bill Macatee about his celebrity
status.</TE>
<TE>   "You can keep it," he said. "It's as simple as that. I've never
liked it. My father has always said, 'You don't have to like it, you
just have to accept it and understand it.' I don't like being
recognized, any of that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "What I like to do is get out there and battle these guys, compete
and play. That, to me, is what I love to do."</TE>
<TE>   Costas Update</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas, whose contracts with NBC and HBO expire in June, could
be headed for ABC and ESPN to work on NBA telecasts. ABC/ESPN
reportedly would still allow him to work Olympics for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   But if Costas were to re-up with HBO, that would probably nix a
move to ABC/ESPN. HBO probably would not allow Costas to work for
another cable network.</TE>
<TE>   Costas' HBO show, "On the Record," makes its season debut Thursday
at 10:30 p.m. Guests include Bob Knight and John Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   'Monday Night' Mess</TE>
<TE>   ABC and the NFL are confident they will be able to implement a
provision that will allow the best games to be moved from Sundays to
"Monday Night Football" during the last four weeks of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   But Fox and CBS are resisting. Those networks, which are losing
big money on the NFL, aren't too willing to help out a competing
network by giving away top attractions.</TE>
<TE>   NFL executives will meet with Fox brass in Los Angeles next week.
The NFL people may want to bring a checkbook.</TE>
<TE>   Who is Dan Bonner?</TE>
<TE>   L.A. viewers may not be familiar with CBS commentator Dan Bonner.</TE>
<TE>   He and Gus Johnson worked Thursday night's NCAA West Regional
semifinal games at San Jose and will work Saturday's final as well.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner mainly works Atlantic Coast Conference games for regional
syndicators. Although he did five ACC games for Fox Sports Net this
season with Bob Neal, he's usually seen in this part of the country
only during tournament time. This is the 12th year he has worked the
tournament for CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner played at Virginia from 1972 to '75. "In this era of resume
checking, I don't know if I would use the world 'played,'" he said.
"I didn't play much."</TE>
<TE>   He later became Virginia's women's coach, until then-athletic
director Gene Corrigan encouraged him to try broadcasting instead.</TE>
<TE>   He started out working Virginia radio broadcasts. Now, besides his
broadcasting work, he coaches high school girls' basketball in his
hometown of Staunton, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   ESPN begins its Indy Racing League season Sunday with coverage of
the Yamaha Indy 400 at California Speedway at 12:30 p.m. Saturday's
sports car race will be on Speed Channel at 11 a.m.... Tony Gwynn and
Jeff Brantley, who both retired after last season, have been hired as
game and studio baseball analysts by ESPN. Also, ESPN announced it is
adding a Monday night game and a Wednesday day game to its baseball
schedule. ESPN will televise 160 games this season, up from 111 last
season.... Channel 13 averaged a 2.1 rating for its first two Dodger
exhibition telecasts last weekend. Channel 5's first exhibition
telecast last year got a 1.0.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Avengers, who begin their Arena Football League
season against the New York Dragons on April 19 at Staples Center,
will have eight games televised by Fox Sports Net 2, with Bill
Macdonald and Artie Gigantino calling the action, and one game
televised by the National Network (TNN). NBC's Arena League deal
kicks in next year.</TE>
<TE>   KMPC (1540) will again broadcast Avenger games, with new
commentator Bob Golic joining play-by-play announcer Larry Kahn....
Channel 9 and the Galaxy have entered into a multifaceted three-year
agreement that calls for the station to carry 10 games this
season.... Attention horse racing fans: A new three-hour weekly show,
"Santa Anita Now," makes its debut on Channel 56 Saturday at 1 p.m.
Kurt Hoover, Jon White, Bill Seward and Millie Ball will serve as the
hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Viking owner Red McCombs, a guest of Chris Myers and
Golic on KMPC this week, said L.A. would be his No. 1 choice as a new
home for his team if he can't get a new stadium deal. He also said if
he gets the stadium deal, he would support any other team moving to
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   A different breed: Robert Smith, the former Viking who
mysteriously retired before the 2000 season, told Jim Rome this week
that his health is more important than money. When he was a freshman
at Ohio State, Smith quit the football team because spring practices
were interfering with his studies.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kapono and Matt Barnes were guests on Rome's Fox Sports Net
show this week and Rome asked Kapono, a junior, if he would be
leaving UCLA after this school year. While Kapono gave an evasive
answer, Barnes gave the thumb sign and said, "Guaranteed, he's out."</TE>

<KH>NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT SWEET 16</KH>
<HD>Misery for Bruins</HD>
<DH>West: UCLA lets a lead get away in the second half, and
12th-seeded Missouri advances to regional final with an 82-73
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>It might have been a Sweet 16 party, but for the longest stretch it
appeared the dance floor was crammed with the most awkward kids in
town.</LD>
<LD>   By night's end, though, No. 12-seeded Missouri had taken on an
attractive glow, the kind reminiscent of Cinderella this time of
year.</LD>
<LD>   And UCLA was reduced to wallflowers, the crestfallen starters
standing on the sideline, removed in the last minute of a game and
season that had slipped away suddenly and with stunning finality.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from an inspired second-half stretch by forward Matt Barnes,
the Bruins were excruciatingly inept throughout an 82-73 loss
Thursday night that paved the way for Missouri to advance to a round
of eight matchup against Oklahoma on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It will mark the first time a No. 12-seeded team plays in the
Elite Eight. No. 8-seeded UCLA (21-12), meanwhile, dropped a Sweet 16
game for the third year in a row and fourth time in Coach Steve
Lavin's six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tough to lose three times in the same round," senior
center Dan Gadzuric said. "I'm really disappointed and it will take a
little while for it to sink in. When it ended, I couldn't believe it
was over."</TE>
<TE>   To the Bruins, the final buzzer was like an obnoxious telephone
recording:</TE>
<TE>   The time allotted for you to win has been exceeded, please hang up
your high-tops and try again next season.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no next season for Barnes, Gadzuric and fellow
seniors Billy Knight and Rico Hines. Jason Kapono might be gone as
well if he decides to give up his senior year for the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Only Barnes, who led UCLA with 23 points and 11 rebounds, can say
he saved his best for last. He scored nine points in a row early in
the second half to give UCLA a seven-point lead, but Lavin took him
out of the game for more than a minute and the Bruins lost their
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono couldn't shake Missouri defenders on the perimeter and
scored only seven points, missing his only three-point attempt.
Gadzuric had 11 points and eight rebounds, about his season average.</TE>
<TE>   Knight made only six of 14 shots, the last miss coming on an open
three-point shot from the corner with 46.6 seconds left and Missouri
(24-11) ahead by nine.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin reserves scored 42 points in the double-overtime
second-round victory over Cincinnati, but contributed only eight
against Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt weird when I was out there," said freshman Dijon
Thompson, who was scoreless. "None of us could capitalize on their
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities were squandered, to be sure. Missouri had 20
turnovers, but a barrage of three-point baskets by Kareem Rush and
Clarence Gilbert in the second half triggered a 29-12 Tiger run that
turned a 49-41 UCLA lead into a 70-61 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half Rush made all four of his three-pointers and 16
of his 20 points and Gilbert made three of his four three-pointers
and 17 of his 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half they hit their shots and opened up the game,"
freshman guard Cedric Bozeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The first half was played by the UCLA and Missouri alter-egos, the
beastly Bruins and terrible Tigers, the teams that floundered around
.500 for the last two months of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert hurt his hand 17 seconds into the game but returned two
minutes later. He and his teammates never did get a handle on the
ball, committing 10 first-half turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Missouri led, 30-28, because UCLA scored only once in its last
eight possessions, on a putback by Gadzuric. Otherwise the last four
minutes were all Ricky Paulding. After Knight's two free throws gave
UCLA its largest lead, 26-18, the sophomore guard scored eight points
in a row to pull the Tigers even, then scored the last points of the
half on a jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA shot horribly, making 11 of 35 in the half. Barnes and Knight
each launched airballs from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   The tone was set for a high-powered second half when in the
opening seconds Gadzuric blocked a shot by center Arthur Johnson then
hustled downcourt to take Knight's alley-oop pass for a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   A layup by Bozeman off an inbounds play gave UCLA a 32-30 lead and
Knight made a steal and layup seconds later, prompting Missouri to
take a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes' nine-point run stretched the lead to 43-36 four minutes
into the half. The margin grew to eight on a layup by Knight, but a
revitalized Missouri battled back, forging ahead, 63-59, on two
three-pointers each by Gilbert and Rush.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson added five points in two possessions on post moves against
Gadzuric and Missouri was up comfortably, 70-61.</TE>
<TE>   So a UCLA season that began with a No. 5 ranking, expectations of
a Pacific 10 Conference championship and a Final Four appearance
ended with a sixth-place conference finish--the lowest in UCLA
history--and a solid but unspectacular NCAA run.</TE>
<TE>   "We never got to the Elite Eight or Final Four in my four years,
but I'm proud of what we did also," Gadzuric said. "We gave it our
best and now it's time to move on."</TE>

<HD>Concessionaires Get Angle on Trout Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spring has finally arrived, and bears aren't the only creatures
coming out of hibernation.</LD>
<LD>   Eastern Sierra concessionaires have awakened to the task of
preparing for the tens of thousands of anglers, most from Southern
California, who will ascend upon the region for the April 27 general
trout season opener.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like knocking ducks down: Every day we have four or five
more things we have to get done," said John Frederickson, whose
company, Sierra Recreation, runs concessions at Crowley Lake and June
Lake.</LD>
<TE>   Frederickson is busier than most. Crowley, the most popular spot
on opening day, lost some boats, all of its motors and other
equipment in a late-January fire that destroyed a storage shed. A few
days before that, shifting ice wiped out a sliver of docks.</TE>
<TE>   This week Crowley has new motors--four-strokes from 15 to 30
horsepower--arriving from Seattle and Georgia. Docks are being
trucked from Bellingham, Wash., and heavy moving equipment is coming
from Ridgecrest, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's much more than that," Frederickson said. "We're getting
all new cushions, new oars and oar locks, anchors and anchor ropes,
and seats in the boats."</TE>
<TE>   What he means is, while the fire was costly to him (and his
insurance company), those who have booked his 70 rental boats for
opening weekend will motor around in style.</TE>
<TE>   As for the sprawling reservoir, located south of Mammoth Lakes
alongside U.S. 395, it should be highly productive for
opening-weekend anglers.</TE>
<TE>   The last of the ice disappeared Sunday, and an early thaw
generally means more lively fish when the fireworks light the dawn
sky to start the new season.</TE>
<TE>   Tough Row to Hoe</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeport Reservoir is a wonderful fishery for anglers seeking
big and feisty rainbows and browns. As for its concessionaires,
they've had their hands full with the blues.</TE>
<TE>   The water level in the reservoir is governed by Nevada's Walker
River Irrigation District, which is more interested in farming than
fishing. At times, the water gets so low that the marina's ramp and
docks are high and dry.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the concessionaire defaulted on his lease. Last
year, Steve Marti, owner of nearby Twin Lake Resort, gave it a go and
said the venture cost him more than $10,000. After July 4, Marti said
he had to move his boats from the marina to the dam, where they could
be launched, and rent them from the cab of a truck.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing against farmers. In fact, a lot of my friends are
farmers," Marti said. "But the reality is, this lake is run as an
irrigation district and recreation is not a high priority."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Mike and Mary Booher are taking over and, like those
before them, they're enthusiastic. They have built docks and ordered
a fleet of boats.</TE>
<TE>   The irrigation district has been somewhat supportive--it poured
cement for a new launch ramp during the winter.</TE>
<TE>   But unless the region receives considerably more snow in the
coming weeks--the snowpack is 90% of normal for this time of
year--the ramp might be covered with more sunshine than water come
midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   The Boohers are taking on-line reservations for boats and
campsites at www.bridgeportmarina.net.</TE>
<TE>   Big Mac Attack</TE>
<TE>   Those planning on spending opening day at Bridgeport's Lower Twin
Lake might want to drive through a tackle shop and pick up a Big Mac.
A Nevada angler trolled one of those deep-diving lures in a rainbow
pattern last opening day and caught brown trout bookends at 11 pounds
13 ounces, and 11 pounds 1 ounce, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a life achievement," Marti said. "He'll probably be back
this year, but he'll be disappointed if he expects to do that again."</TE>
<TE>   Thrown for the Loop</TE>
<TE>   The region's biggest fish on opening day last year was a 12-pound
15-ounce brown caught on a Rapala at June Lake, so its allure will be
even greater this year.</TE>
<TE>   However, all of the lakes on the scenic June Lake Loop contain big
fish, and all are free of ice, which points to a productive opener.</TE>
<TE>   June still might have the edge: Frederickson will release 1,000
pen-reared rainbows weighing 2-4 pounds a week or so before the
opener and plans periodic releases throughout the season.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Exposure</TE>
<TE>   High above Bishop, atop picturesque Bishop Creek Canyon at about
10,000 feet, is South Lake. It also has a faithful following on
opening day, despite the chilly reception its anglers often receive.</TE>
<TE>   Will the road to the lake be open or will the lake be reachable
only on foot, after a one-mile hike? Will the lake be covered with
ice, or will it have open water in which to fling some bait?</TE>
<TE>   These are the questions every year. This year, concessionaire Gary
Olson is guaranteeing an open road--based on visible patches of
pavement seen this week during a scouting run on a snowmobile--and
predicting a layer of ice thick enough to stand on and drill holes
through.</TE>
<TE>   "I would bet on ice fishing if the temperatures stay low, but as
usual the weather from now until then is crucial," Olson said, adding
that the lake was stocked with Eagle Lake rainbows and browns at the
end of last season to boost prospects for opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Exposure II</TE>
<TE>   The Eastern Sierra has its annual trout opener. The Southern
Sierra, much closer to Los Angeles, has its annual Kern Valley
Bioregions Festival, held this year April 26-28 in the Kernville area
near Lake Isabella.</TE>
<TE>   The event, sponsored by Audubon-California's Kern River Preserve,
is a celebration of the region's "natural and recreational diversity
at the height of spring abundance."</TE>
<TE>   It's a big hit among bird watchers (during the last seven
festivals birders logged between 182 and 226 species) but activities
are varied--from reptile- and mammal-study field trips to whitewater
rafting.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Pointed response: Fishermen on boats aren't faring well yet, but
those plunging in with spears are doing OK. Al Schneppershoff, a
veteran spear-fisherman from Van Nuys, took a dip Thursday morning
just south of Malibu and emerged with a 19-pound white sea bass. On
Wednesday, Schneppershoff's friend, Daniel Carlberg of Redondo Beach,
speared an 18-pound halibut off Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   * The white stuff: Last weekend's storm freshened things at the
local resorts--just in time for spring break. Conditions are hardly
ideal, with base depths of about two feet, but they could be worse.
Mountain High in Wrightwood is celebrating the break with Snow Jam
2002, Sunday through March 31. On tap: pond-skimming and live music.
Mammoth Mountain received 10 inches of new snow and more is expected
this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   * South of the Border: It was reported here last week that
tourists visiting Cabo San Lucas next fall will have to contend with
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Oct. 21-27, and with
considerable preparations being made in advance of the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that planning calls for the construction of a freeway from
the airport to San Jose del Cabo, and for widening of the highway
between San Jose and Cabo San Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   * Encore performance: The Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and Boat Show,
a scaled-down version of the recent Long Beach extravaganza, is in
progress through Sunday at Del Mar Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Admission is $9 for adults, $8 for seniors and free for military
personnel and children 15 and under.</TE>
<TE>   * Paving the way: Pathways to Adventure, a free event designed to
enhance appreciation of outdoor recreation, will be Saturday at
Laguna Niguel Lake from 11 a.m.-1:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The focus is on fishing and camping. Park admission is $4.
Details: (949) 245-8698.</TE>
<TE>   * Taking aim: Turkey-hunting season begins March 31 and runs
through May 5. Hunters can take one bearded bird per day and three
per season.</TE>
<TE>   They cannot legally hunt after 4 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Sooners Smack Down Arizona</HD>
<DH>West: Oklahoma dominates the second half and reaches
regional final by routing Wildcats, 88-67.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>There were seven minutes and 32 seconds remaining in the game and,
with Oklahoma in the middle of a game-breaking scoring run, Sooner
forward Daryan Selvy followed Luke Walton through the key during a
break in play and began blowing exaggerated kisses at Arizona's
playmaking small forward.</LD>
<LD>   Selvy, a reserve who picked up Walton as a defensive assignment
midway through the second half, may as well have been kissing the
Wildcats goodnight and goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 2-seeded Sooners, propelled by a strong second half,
punished the No. 3-seeded Wildcats, 88-67, in a West Regional
semifinal before 18,040 at Compaq Center on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma (30-4) will meet 12th-seeded Missouri on Saturday in the
Sooners' first Elite Eight appearance since falling to Kansas in the
1988 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   A first half of finesse between the Sooners and Wildcats
degenerated into a second half of trash-talking.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Wildcats (24-10) were out of their element, the
Sooners were right at home.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of rough words, curse words," a smiling Selvy
said afterward. "It was just a little competition. But they came at
us. If they can't handle the big dog, stay on the porch."</TE>
<TE>   Walton and junior point guard Jason Gardner couldn't handle a
swarming Oklahoma defense. Arizona's two high scorers, who entered
the game averaging a combined 40 points in the postseason, combined
for 23.</TE>
<TE>   Walton, hounded by Selvy, finished with nine points on
three-of-nine shooting, including a pair of airballs.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he wasn't getting nothing on me," Selvy said of his
blowing kisses at Walton. "I was waiting to hold him the whole game
and Coach finally put me on him at the 13-minute mark and I just
enjoyed it."</TE>
<TE>   As did the rest of the Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   Hollis Price, Oklahoma's 6-foot-1, 165-pound wisp of a
sharpshooter, led Oklahoma with 26 points, 22 in the first half while
knocking down six three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner power forward Aaron McGhee awoke from his slumber to finish
with 21 points and eight rebounds, after getting two points and one
rebound in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's zone defense gave Oklahoma fits in the interior in the
first half, in which the Sooners shot 36.4% from the field. Arizona,
meanwhile, had shot 56.5%</TE>
<TE>   But with Selvy, who had 15 points in 28 minutes off the bench,
leading the Sooner charge, Oklahoma made 51.4% of its shots in the
second half, when the Sooners outscored the Wildcats, 55-30.</TE>
<TE>   And after being outrebounded by three in the first 20 minutes, the
Sooners finished with a five-rebound advantage, 42-37.</TE>
<TE>   "When we make shots, we're capable of blowing people out," said
Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson, whose father, John, was recovering
from surgery Wednesday in San Jose for a subdural hematoma.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we shot 51% in the second half. We shoot 51%, we're hard
to beat."</TE>
<TE>   With the win, Oklahoma won 30 games in a season for the fourth
time in school history, the first time since 1989. The Sooners have
also won 11 in a row and 15 of 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Oklahoma was just a whole lot quicker and more explosive on the
ball," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "We felt that the difference in
the game would be possessions. They outboarded us in offensive
rebounds [16-12] and we had more turnovers [12-5].</TE>
<TE>   "We got out-quicked and out-fought in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   Said Selvy: "We started out real tentative. The refs were talking
to us a lot, but the second half, we didn't worry about them. We were
just out there playing tough ball."</TE>
<TE>   And blowing kisses.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Mounts Against Kent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Giant second baseman Jeff Kent might have broken his
wrist falling off a motorcycle, not while washing his truck as he
claims, General Manager Brian Sabean said.</LD>
<LD>   "There's mounting evidence from all sorts of eyewitnesses that
says he fell off a motorcycle popping wheelies," Sabean said.</LD>
<LD>   The guarantee language in Kent's contract bans certain activities,
including motorcycle riding, meaning the Giants could try to void the
contract or fine him.</LD>
<TE>   The former National League most valuable player is in the option
year of the deal, which would pay him $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   A report in Wednesday's Arizona Republic, quoting police reports
and eyewitness accounts, said Kent might have been injured on a road
about a mile from the Giants' minor league training facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately for me and Jeff Kent, this is part of my job,"
Sabean said. "We'll weigh all the information and all the options."</TE>
<TE>   Kent originally reported the injury to the Giants on March 2, a
day after he said he was hurt washing his truck.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants began investigating last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Kent declined comment Wednesday and was not available Thursday,
when he had an off-day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona first baseman Erubiel Durazo had surgery to remove a
broken bone in his right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo, baseball's leading hitter this spring with a .535 average,
is expected to be sidelined six weeks, according to specialist Dr.
Don Sheridan.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed slugger was injured when he swung at and missed a
pitch from Dave Lundquist in the sixth inning of Wednesday night's
game against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians acquired catcher Eddie Perez in a trade with
the Atlanta Braves for a player to be named or cash.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians had been looking for an experienced backup for Einar
Diaz while Eddie Taubensee is sidelined for at least two months
because of a bad back.</TE>

<HD>Richardson's Firing Is Upheld by President</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of Arkansas' top executive upheld the dismissal of
Nolan Richardson, saying Thursday that he agreed with a campus
chancellor's decision to fire the coach.</LD>
<LD>   President B. Alan Sugg said he reviewed 80 pages of material
submitted by Richardson and interviewed a number of people while
doing his research. In the end, he agreed that Richardson should be
replaced.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on my review, I am firmly convinced that the termination of
your employment agreement by [Chancellor] John White in consultation
with [Athletic Director] Frank Broyles was legal and fair," Sugg
wrote in a letter to Richardson.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't known whether Richardson would sue. The appeal to Sugg
was seen as a prerequisite for any action through the courts or
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to move in haste," said Richardson's lawyer, John
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins has been offered the West Virginia
job and is deciding whether to remain with the Bearcats or return to
his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a personal decision for Bob to make," said Bret Adams,
Huggins' lawyer. "I think it's probably the toughest professional
decision of his career."</TE>
<TE>   Center-forward Jamal Sampson declared himself eligible for the NBA
draft after one season at California.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson, from Mater Dei High, averaged 6.4 points and 6.5 rebounds
a game in his freshman season with the Golden Bears. The 6-foot-11
member of the Pacific 10 Conference's all-freshman team also blocked
54 shots while starting 31 of Cal's 32 games.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson said he won't hire an agent, leaving open the possibility
of returning to school if his draft position is unfavorable.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision was made by Jamal and his family," Cal Coach Ben
Braun said. "I support him in the decision, but I'd personally like
to see him come back to school, as I would with all players.... I
hope his tenure at Cal was helpful to him."</TE>
<TE>   Jamel Bradley scored 17 points as South Carolina (21-14) rolled to
an 82-47 victory over Ball State (23-12) in a third-round game of the
National Invitation Tournament at Columbia, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Gamecocks will play Syracuse on Tuesday in a semifinal game at
Madison Square Garden.</TE>

<HD>At Dubai, Sakhee Is the One to Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sakhee, poised to become the first horse to win the biggest races in
France and the United Arab Emirates, will be even money or less in
Saturday's $6-million Dubai World Cup. But standing in the way is one
of his stablemates and a speed-favoring colt from California.</LD>
<LD>   Sakhee, winner of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in October, has
made one start--a nine-length victory in Dubai on Feb. 24--since his
loss by a nose to Tiznow in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont Park
in October. Frankie Dettori, who had never lost on Sakhee until the
Tiznow race, will be aboard again Saturday when the 5-year-old breaks
from the No. 7 post in an 11-horse field.</LD>
<LD>   Street Cry, like Sakhee, is owned by Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin
Stable and is 6-1 on the morning line. It was the sheik, who is the
crown prince of Dubai, who launched the Dubai World Cup as a
$4-million race in 1996. Now the 11/4-mile race is the highlight of a
six-race card with purses of $15 million, richer than the Breeders'
Cups in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Street Cry began his career in Southern California in 2000,
running second to Flame Thrower in the Del Mar Futurity and the
Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita. Third in that year's Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Churchill Downs, Street Cry was sent back to Dubai to
prepare for the 2001 Kentucky Derby. He missed the race because of an
injury and didn't run for seven months. Returning with a second-place
finish in the Discovery Handicap at Aqueduct in October, he prepped
for the World Cup with an 81/2-length victory at 11/4 miles in Dubai
on Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, who has won three of the six World Cups--with Cigar
in 1996, Singspiel in 1997 and Captain Steve last year--will ride
Street Cry.</TE>
<TE>   Western Pride, ridden by Pat Valenzuela for the first time, ran a
gritty Santa Anita Handicap on March 2, finishing second at 11/4
miles to Milwaukee Brew after leading for the first nine furlongs.
With Valenzuela riding him back, the 4-year-old colt is expected to
try winning on the front end again.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Western Pride's owners, Carolyn Chapman and
Theresa McArthur, sold their horse to a Saudi Arabian prince for an
undisclosed price, which leaves the World Cup without an
American-owned contender for the first time. No matter the price, the
horse's previous owners turned a hefty profit. They bought the colt
as a 2-year-old who had not raced for $65,000 and saw him push his
purses over the $1-million mark with the runner-up finish in the Big
'Cap.</TE>
<TE>   Western Pride is 8-1 on the morning line, which has been set by
Arlington Park, the betting hub for the race in the U.S. Betting is
banned in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Others running are Agnes Digital, Best Of The Best, Crimson Quest,
Keltos, Royal Tryst, State Shinto, Sei Mi and To The Victory.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. horses have good chances in two other races on the Dubai
card. Val Royal, winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Mile, is the 5-2
favorite in the $2 million Duty Free Stakes and Xtra Heat, last
year's Eclipse Award-winning sprinter in North America, is favored at
2-1 in the $2 million Golden Shaheen. Caller One, winner of the
Golden Shaheen last year, is shooting for a repeat.</TE>
<TE>   A Godolphin Kentucky Derby prospect, Essence Of Dubai, will run
against 13 foes--five of them also owned by Sheik Mohammed--in the
$2-million UAE Derby.</TE>
<TE>   In another overseas Kentucky Derby development, trainer Aidan
O'Brien flew Johannesburg from Ireland to Lingfield Park in England
for a six-furlong workout and announced that the colt's lone Derby
prep will be a one-mile race on dirt at Lingfield on April 6.
Johannesburg, working in company with two stablemates, was timed in
1:12. Undefeated in seven starts, he has not run since winning the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Belmont Park on Oct. 27.</TE>
<TE>   A Derby horse or two might emerge from Saturday's $500,000 Spiral
at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky. Request For Parole is the 8-5
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Ken McPeek, keeping his Derby hopefuls apart, said that
Repent will run on April 6 in the Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park
and Harlan's Holiday is scheduled to run in the Blue Grass at
Keeneland on April 13.</TE>

<HD>Kent State Is Making a Major Statement</HD>
<DH>South: Golden Flashes defeat Pittsburgh in overtime, 78-73,
to reach regional final against Indiana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Another year, another upstart.</LD>
<LD>   Kent State is in the Elite Eight after a 78-73 overtime victory
over Pittsburgh Thursday that leaves the Golden Flashes one victory
from the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to be known on a national scale just like Gonzaga and
other mid-level teams that had to earn everything they got," guard
Trevor Huffman said.</LD>
<TE>   The Golden Flashes (30-5) have won 21 games in a row. Their 22nd
would be their biggest--the NCAA South Regional final Saturday
against Indiana in Rupp Arena for the trip to Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   They have come to the point where other so-called mid-majors have
failed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Rhode Island in 1998, Gonzaga in 1999 and Tulsa in 2000 all
reached a regional final before losing.</TE>
<TE>   All Kent State has to do is beat the Hoosiers--a team it upset in
the first round of the NCAA tournament last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Indiana is a different team than when we played them last
year," Huffman said. "They have a tough player in Jared Jeffries.
It's going to be a good, tough game."</TE>
<TE>   Kent State's victory over Pitt (29-6) was hard-earned, but
deserved.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Flashes led by as many nine points, but Pitt kept
fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's Brandin Knight tied the score, 66-66, with 55 seconds left
in regulation, and Kent State had to survive Julius Page's missed
three-point attempt at the end of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, Antonio Gates scored six of Kent State's 12 points,
and the Golden Flashes made all eight free throws--six in the final
41 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Gates finished with 22 points and eight rebounds, and Huffman
added 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Page and Knight each scored 18 for Pitt, but Knight fouled out in
the final minute of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Mention of Cinderella is inevitable, but Kent State is no fluke.</TE>
<TE>   In the tournament, the 10th-seeded Golden Flashes have upset
Oklahoma State, Alabama and Pitt--three teams that spent time in the
Associated Press top 10 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't like this Cinderella tag," Coach Stan Heath said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I told the team, if you look at the true definition of
Cinderella, she was a girl no one gave anything to, who tried to find
a way to get to the dance and got the prince."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt Coach Ben Howland called Kent State a very good and very
well-coached team, but hoped his team's accomplishments wouldn't be
forgotten.</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the Bruins' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Both teams struggled in the opening minutes. The game
started ominously for Missouri when guard Clarence Gilbert suffered a
dislocated finger on his left (non-shooting) hand after only 17
seconds had elapsed, but he quickly returned after being treated on
the bench. UCLA used its height advantage to take several offensive
rebounds, but the Bruins' poor shooting and sloppy play prevented
them from capitalizing. UCLA was hurt by turnovers and made only four
of its first 15 shots before Ryan Walcott made a three-point basket
for an 11-10 lead with 12:10 left. The Bruins, playing good defense
and forcing turnovers, extended their lead to 26-18 before Missouri
guard Rickey Paulding got hot. Paulding made consecutive three-point
baskets to tie the score, 26-26, with 2:19 left, and his jump shot
with 28 seconds left gave the Tigers a 30-28 halftime lead.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Steve Lavin benched center Dan Gadzuric
early in the game after the Bruin center got off to rocky start.
Gadzuric returned to play 16 minutes and help the Bruins hold a 22-19
rebounding advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Winning numbers: UCLA forced Missouri into 10 turnovers and the
Bruins had nine offensive rebounds. UCLA also held Kareem Rush to
four points in 18 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: Take your pick. UCLA's leading scorer, Jason Kapono,
had only two points. The Bruins made only 11 of 35 shots (31.4%),
including two of 10 from three-point range, and committed six
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: UCLA: Matt Barnes 7, Gadzuric and Billy Knight 6.
Missouri: Paulding 11.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: UCLA: Barnes and Gadzuric 6. Missouri: Kareem
Rush and Arthur Johnson 6.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Wesley Stokes, the player UCLA didn't want, was hearing all about it
from Matt Barnes.</LD>
<LD>   Stokes, a Missouri guard, was about to throw the ball inbounds and
Barnes was in his face, fronting the Bruin full-court press and
talking trash to Stokes.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of replying, the Tiger sophomore smiled at Barnes and
pointed to the scoreboard: Missouri 77, UCLA 69. The clock read 1:35.</LD>
<TE>   Stokes, a guard from Long Beach, had six points and three assists
in 13 minutes off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Although he didn't prove he is somebody UCLA missed on, he did
make things sticky for the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   When UCLA was in the locker room before the game, he took gum from
his mouth and tossed it near the UCLA bench.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden was going to address the UCLA team early in the week
and attend the game Thursday, but he injured a knee in a fall and
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The 91-year-old former UCLA coach spoke to the team early in the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA senior Rico Hines, sidelined because of a knee injury, sat in
a corner of the UCLA locker room clutching a basketball, bent over
looking at the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "This feels like the lowest part of my life so far," he said. "You
never think your career is going to end like that, sitting on the
sideline, helpless. But that's life. Got to grow up and be a man now.
Life goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustrating thing is you come to UCLA to win a championship.
In my five years, we never had a chance to accomplish that."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman was surprised that his
former Mater Dei High teammate Jamal Sampson, a freshman center at
California, applied for the NBA draft Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect him to do it, but I'm behind him 100%," Bozeman
said. "Hopefully he'll have a great future."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Gadzuric got the Bruins off to a strong start,
blocking a shot and running down court to score on an alley-oop dunk
for a 30-30 tie. Barnes took over the game after that, scoring nine
points in a span of 1:36 to give UCLA a 43-36 lead. A behind-the-back
pass by Barnes on a fastbreak led to a layup by Knight and a 49-41
lead, matching the Bruins' largest advantage. But, as it had in the
first half, Missouri mounted a comeback. Gilbert and Rush each made
two three-point baskets to complete a 14-4 run, giving the Tigers a
63-59 lead with 7:05 to play. Center Johnson muscled inside for a
three-point play and a short basket on consecutive possessions to
extend the Tigers' margin to 70-61. UCLA, meanwhile, was hurt by
turnovers and cold shooting. Paulding missed a breakaway dunk that
would have given Missouri a 12-point lead, but the Bruins never got
closer than seven in the final three minutes. Lavin threw in the
towel with 46.6 seconds left when he cleared the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Reserve forward Justin Gage was a defensive
spark for Missouri, at one point diving for a loose ball. He failed
to come up with that one, but he later forced Barnes into a critical
turnover.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Missouri made seven of 13 three-point shots in the

<HD>Kapono and Bruins Had No Shot</HD>
<DH>West: When UCLA needed him most, the junior lost his touch,
finishing with seven points in what could be his college finale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Just when that master magician Steve Lavin went to pull another
rabbit out of his hat, his most-trusted assistant, Jason Kapono,
pulled a disappearing act.</LD>
<LD>   And with the UCLA junior forward's annual flirtation with the NBA
draft drawing near, who knows if Kapono will throw his headband into
the ring ... again.</LD>
<LD>   In the Bruins' 82-73 season-ending loss to Missouri in a West
Regional semifinal, Kapono, the Bruins' leading scorer and top
sharpshooter, finished with seven points on three-of-eight shooting
from the field, missing his only shot from beyond the three-point
arc.</LD>
<TE>   Not exactly the way to end a season, let alone a college career.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," said Kapono, who entered the game averaging a
team-high 16.3 points while shooting 45.5% from three-point
territory. "But hey, only one team out there is going to win their
last game. Everyone else is going to lose so we're one of those 64
teams out of the 65-team field that's going to go home with a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Only one team is going to go home with that high of going home
with a title, the NCAA championship."</TE>
<TE>   So, is it too soon to even think about where you'll be next year?</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely so. Yep," said Kapono, who also considered attending
Missouri, Utah and Nevada Las Vegas coming out of Artesia High in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri reserve Josh Kroenke, a childhood friend, said the
Tigers' goal was to neutralize the streaky-shooting Kapono.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Jason since 1995 and I've seen him struggle a lot but
that was also our defense out there tonight," Kroenke said. "That was
our mind-set--to take away his looks. We knew if we took away his
looks, he was going to have a hard time getting into the flow of the
game. He still got some shots in, but that was one of our main keys
tonight, trying to take Jason out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make somebody else beat us."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody else did.</TE>
<TE>   "Missouri did an effective job of cutting down our
catch-and-shoots from the three-point line," Lavin, the UCLA coach,
said.</TE>
<TE>   "And then there were just some looks that we just missed ... looks
that just didn't go in and that happens in basketball games. It was a
combination. Give Missouri credit for playing really aggressive solid
defense. And then we struggled to find any kind of offensive rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono, UCLA's all-time leading three-point shooter with 272, also
gave credit to the Tigers' game plan.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just tagging me," he said.</TE>

<HD>Desperation Preceded Grisly Finds</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials describe series of calls by kidnap victims
to relatives and efforts to pay ransom demands before bodies were
found in reservoir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities laid out their account Thursday of a botched
kidnap-for-ransom scheme they said stretched from Los Angeles to
Dubai to Moscow, ending in an icy green reservoir in the rugged folds
of the Sierra Nevada's gold country.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, law enforcement sources said, interest in the case
rose to the highest levels of government, with Georgian President
Eduard A. Shevardnadze--the former Soviet foreign minister and a
friend of the family of one apparent victim--reportedly appealing for
help to former President George Bush. As many as 150 FBI agents
ultimately were involved in the probe.</LD>
<LD>   With six suspects in custody and a seventh at large, U.S. Atty.
John S. Gordon in Los Angeles described a chain of desperate
telephone calls, six-figure money transfers and faxed ransom demands
that led agents to the suspected kidnappers--and then to New Melones
Lake, where four bodies were found earlier this week.</LD>
<TE>   Those bodies were identified Thursday, bringing unwelcome but not
unexpected confirmation to family members who, in some cases, had
been waiting for word of their loved ones since December. An
additional body, that of a San Fernando Valley real estate developer,
was found floating in the same reservoir in October.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the four people whose bodies were found
this week--two aspiring film producers, an electronics entrepreneur
and a bookkeeper--were kidnapped by a ring of Eastern European
criminals in the San Fernando Valley, held for ransom and ultimately
killed, their weighted bodies dumped into the reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of those in custody have been charged with murder.
The kidnapping charges refer to only two of the victims, George
Safiev and Alexander Umansky. But authorities did not rule out the
possibility of filing additional charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at all five victims who were recovered to
determine if there is a connection among them and, by extension, to
the suspects," said Special Agent Matthew McLaughlin, spokesman for
the FBI's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   All six men in custody have pleaded not guilty. They were arrested
over a five-week span from Feb. 11 to March 18.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal scheme, as described by Gordon and in an FBI
affidavit, involved ransom demands faxed from Russia, asking for
money to be transferred to bank accounts in Dubai, the capital of the
United Arab Emirates. There, authorities say, three Russian men were
allegedly involved in receiving the money and routing it to banks in
Latvia and the United States. Some money came through Moscow, a law
enforcement source there said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those men have been arrested and are in federal custody.
The third is still being sought and is believed to be overseas.</TE>
<TE>   In the chronology laid out by authorities, the FBI launched its
investigation shortly after the Dec. 13 kidnapping of Umansky, 35,
who lived in Sherman Oaks and owned an auto electronics business in
North Hollywood. The morning after his disappearance, his
father--unaware of the kidnapping--discovered three ransom messages
on Umansky's office fax machine. Over the next two days, Umansky
repeatedly called his brother, Michael, begging him to "take this
seriously" and raise the ransom money however he could, according to
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, his family wired approximately $90,000 to a bank in
New York, which sent it to a bank in Dubai, in partial payment of the
ransom demand for $234,628.</TE>
<TE>   In telephone conversations over the next 10 days--dozens of them
monitored by the FBI--the family refused to turn over any more money
unless they could speak to Umansky, authorities said. After the
kidnappers refused that request, the family wired another $145,000 to
an account in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   During that investigation, Gordon said, "FBI agents learned that
other Russian immigrants were missing and may have been kidnapped."</TE>
<TE>   Those included Rita Pekler, a 39-year-old businesswoman who had
bookkeeping and other businesses in West Hollywood. She was reported
missing Dec. 5, and her body was among those identified Thursday. The
next developments were the alleged kidnappings of Safiev and Nick
Kharabadze, a 29-year-old aspiring filmmaker whose mother is a
prominent member of the Georgian emigre community in Los Angeles and
is said by family members to be a friend of Shevardnadze.</TE>
<TE>   Kharabadze had recently established Matador Media Inc., a film
production company, with Safiev, 37, who had reportedly become
wealthy in the rough-and-tumble world of Russian banking. Both men
disappeared on Jan. 20. Kharabadze had been planning to attend a
party associated with the Golden Globe awards, which were held that
night.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent days, authorities said, Safiev's business manager
received phone calls from Safiev telling him to transfer nearly $1
million from a business account, which he did, and $4 million to the
bearer of a letter signed by Safiev. The latter amount was never
paid.</TE>
<TE>   During the next week, friends and employees of the two men
received several phone calls from them. During some of the calls,
Safiev and Kharabadze said they were in Las Vegas and "everything was
fine," but would not say how they could be reached, according to the
FBI affidavit. In one call, a friend, speaking in the Georgian
language, asked Safiev if he had been kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he said, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after the abduction, in one of a string of transactions
that led authorities to the suspects, an employee of Matador Media
received a phone call from a large New York electronics retailer,
confirming an $8,600 purchase of video equipment on Safiev's credit
card. A copy of the card had been faxed to the store. The FBI said it
was later able to trace the fax to the Encino residence of Iouri
Mikhel, one of the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   According to one source close to the investigation, Kharabadze's
family at one point prevailed upon Shevardnadze to contact former
President Bush, with the hope it would add more urgency to the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues of Safiev and Kharabadze said they believe the FBI had
been aggressive in investigating the case. However, some relatives of
the other victims have expressed frustration with what they believe
to have been a slow initial response to the kidnappings. Among the
most vocal has been the widow of Myer Muscatel, who disappeared in
October. He was found days later but was not publicly identified
until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was haunted by it on a daily basis," said Nancy Shapiro
Muscatel. "I knew my husband was harmed but I never felt this case
was being worked aggressively enough."</TE>
<TE>   More details emerged Thursday about the suspects, some of whom
displayed signs of affluence.</TE>
<TE>   One of them Petro "Peter" Krylov, 29, of West Hollywood, had
worked for Umansky but was fired several months before the latter's
disappearance. However, Krylov's attorney said late Thursday that the
two had remained on good terms, and Krylov's wife said Umansky was
planning to hire her husband back.</TE>
<TE>   Another suspect, Mikhel, 36, was described as a real estate
investor who, in late 2000, bought two adjoining condominiums in
Sherman Oaks for $429,000. A third, Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, of Encino,
bought a $714,000 home in Sherman Oaks in July 2001. He has also
lived in Encino and Hawaii. Mikhel and Kadamovas co-own an aquarium
shop in Sherman Oaks.</TE>

<HD>Massive School Bond Gains</HD>
<DH>Education: Assembly OKs $25-billion package, which must
clear the Senate and pass muster with the governor and California
voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Assembly approved the biggest bond package in state
history Thursday, a $25-billion proposal to build and modernize
school facilities, from elementary schools to community colleges to
university campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis has not taken a position on the proposal, which
would ask voters to approve two massive bond issues, a $13-billion
measure in November and another for $12.3 billion in March 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The package must clear the state Senate, where it may be amended.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, lawmakers hailed the Assembly's bipartisan passage of
the deal, which has been in the works for more than a year, as a bold
return to the kind of large-scale public investment that California
has not seen in decades.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest thing I'll ever do. It's the biggest thing
since the days of Pat Brown," said former Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), a co-author of the measure, referring to
the former California governor who presided over a massive expansion
of California's higher-education system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the largest school construction bond in state history and
perhaps the largest capital outlay bond in American history," said
Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino). "It was approved because
the Assembly is convinced the need is that great in California."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) acknowledged that
passage of the bond package was held up in part by resentment from
lawmakers who believed that urban areas, particularly Los Angeles,
would get a disproportionate share of the money.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than $4 billion in new construction money would be
earmarked for so-called critically overcrowded schools, of which the
Los Angeles Unified School District would be eligible for about $1.8
billion. The funds are a nod to the challenges that districts like
Los Angeles Unified face in trying to find new school sites within
their heavily developed boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Such districts would be able to claim bond money for as long as
four years to give them time to secure land, with the possibility of
a one-year extension.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, there were concerns from people that L.A. was going to
get more than L.A. should get," Wesson said. "But when you look at
the number of urban schools and the amount of money, this is fair.
That was a hurdle we were able to get over."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, however, not everyone was pleased with the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tremendous needs" in the Inland Empire, said Assemblyman
Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), who voted against the bond package. "Our
schoolchildren need facilities more than any other county."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the money that would head to Los Angeles, Pacheco
called the deal "a complete rip-off."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to raising billions of dollars to build and modernize
schools, the bond plan would set aside nearly $4.6 billion for
community colleges and universities. Community colleges would receive
40% of that money, a large sum for a segment of the education system
that serves a large portion of the state's working class but has
traditionally fared poorly in its fight for funding.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant precedent, that the Legislature recognizes
that community colleges serve two-thirds of the state's
higher-education students," said Scott Lay of the Community College
League of California.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also earmarks up to $400 million for the state's fewer
than 400 charter schools. That reflects the wishes of the Silicon
Valley business community, which in recent years has gotten deeply
involved in the state's public education debate.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and administrators expressed excitement over the
Assembly's action.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those moments where people can say the Assembly
earned their paper today," said Kevin Gordon, executive director of
the California Assn. of School Business Officials. "When you look at
the daunting challenge that we have as the most overcrowded school
system in the nation, this is probably the boldest effort to make a
dent."</TE>
<TE>   "California schools are in dire need of repair and maintenance,
and this will help," said Fred Glass, a spokesman for the California
Federation of Teachers. "We need to build seven new classrooms a day
to meet the current rate of growth of the student population."</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear, however, is the fate of the school bond package in
the Senate and in the hands of Davis, as well as the voting booth.
The Democratic governor previously proposed placing a $10-billion
bond on the ballot every two years starting in November, for a total
of $30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor is generally
supportive of the bond proposal in concept, but he wants to look at
the details before taking an official position.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans continue to have reservations about the school
bond plan. The Senate is expected to take up the proposal when
lawmakers return from their spring break in April. If all Democrats
sign off on the plan, only one Republican vote is needed to send it
to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Chuck Poochigian, a Fresno Republican who sat on a bipartisan
committee that hashed out the deal, cited the inclusion of $650
million in lease-revenue bonds to pay for higher-education projects
as a sticking point for some members of his caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are also concerned that the plan favors Los Angeles
over other overcrowded school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a battle against Los Angeles," Poochigian said. "The
point is to make sure there is accountability and equity in terms of
how we deal with the largest school bond in America's history."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer said his
735,000-student district is 150,000 seats short of a regular,
two-semester, summer-free school system.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a fair bond proposition because it's aimed at
those with the greatest need," Romer said. "Urban school districts
have more expense, it takes them longer to acquire property, and they
need to have consideration that helps them make up for their severe
backlog."</TE>

<LD>John Michael Hughes was sentenced to three years probation Thursday
for breaking into a home that he believed belonged to actress Meg
Ryan earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Malibu Superior Court Judge Lawrence J. Mira also ordered him to
submit to psychiatric care. Mira placed Hughes, a 30-year-old Florida
man who once falsely told a judge he was married to the star, into
the care of his parents.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes was accused of trespassing in the Malibu home of Tomas and
Andrea Ryan, who are not related to the actress. The star has said
she has never met Hughes.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $600-million bond measure designed to upgrade and expand Los
Angeles' emergency facilities may violate a state law, according to a
state legislative counsel.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition Q, approved March 5, would pay to build police
stations and bomb squad facilities.</LD>
<LD>   But The Times has learned that the measure may also violate a
recently passed state law requiring accountability and standards in
local bond measures, according to an opinion issued by a state
legislative counsel at the request of state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar), who wrote the new law.</LD>
<TE>   Alarcon gave a copy of the opinion to the Valley Industry and
Commerce Assn., whose board of directors plan to discuss it at a
meeting March 26.</TE>

<HD>Follow-Up Question: If Not Parks, Who?</HD>
<DH>LAPD: There's no clear front-runner to replace the chief if
he's let go by the Police Commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Los Angeles Police Commission follows the lead of Mayor James
K. Hahn and votes to deny Police Chief Bernard C. Parks a second
term, the decision will bring to a close one political drama and open
the curtain on another.</LD>
<LD>   Although the job of the five-member commission is to decide Parks'
fate without considering who might replace him, the question of who
would succeed the chief looms over the panel's deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   Already, some possible candidates being mentioned include
Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a longtime LAPD commander
who was beaten out by Parks for the job in 1997, and Sacramento Chief
Arturo Venegas Jr., another finalist that year. San Diego Chief David
Bejarano and former New York Police Commissioner William Bratton also
appear on the short lists of some city leaders, though Bejarano this
week said he is not interested in the job, at least for the moment.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the potential candidates declined to say whether they
would like to be formally considered.</TE>
<TE>   There is little consensus about who would be a front-runner if the
commission and the mayor stay within the LAPD to find a Parks
successor, but there is agreement that there are not many strong
internal candidates for the position.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chiefs David Gascon, David Kalish and Scott LaChasse are
the highest-ranking of the possible Parks successors from within the
department, and a number of other LAPD officials are considered
potential contenders as well.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Parks continues or someone replaces him, Los Angeles'
police chief for the next five-year term will command a troubled
department--one still recovering from the effects of the Rampart
scandal and facing a shortage of officers that has left it thin in
spots.</TE>
<TE>   "The bar has been set so high for police chiefs," said Seattle
Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske. "The politics of the city, the job of
managing and leading a big-city police department--all of that has
become very, very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The city's ethnic politics could further complicate the search for
a new chief. If the commission denies Parks' bid for a second term,
Hahn would have the final say in selecting the next chief, following
a search process led by the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Many African Americans have expressed anger at Hahn for opposing
Parks, and some political analysts suggest that will create pressure
on the mayor to find a black successor. The LAPD has had two black
chiefs--Parks and his predecessor, Willie L. Williams. Every other
one of its 52 chiefs was a white man.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an acute sense of political loss in the African American
community," said Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown
Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles. But at the
same time, "there are undoubtedly some who feel it's time for a
Latino chief," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook declined to comment on whether the
mayor's office has begun looking for a replacement for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Some Question Whether an Outsider Can Succeed</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing question about a search process would be whether
the city would hire someone from outside the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   After the city's rocky experience with Williams, who came to Los
Angeles from Philadelphia, some experts are skeptical about whether
an outsider could succeed in the post. In a recent Times poll, 61% of
respondents said they want the next chief to come from inside the
department.</TE>
<TE>   But observers both inside and outside the department concur that
there are few significant contenders for the job within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a consensus among some of the people I've heard from
that there's not much of a bench there to choose from," said former
LAPD Chief Ed Davis, who left the department decades ago but who
stays in touch with many city leaders and remains a close observer of
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Some attribute the perceived dearth of strong internal candidates
to Parks' assertive leadership style, which the chief's critics
maintain has made it difficult for his top deputies to assert
themselves and develop as leaders. In addition, several high-ranking
insiders have left the department in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to be chief somewhere like Los Angeles, you
should participate at the national and international level," said a
former LAPD command officer. "This is how you prepare yourself, and a
lot of our staff officers have chosen for personal reasons not to."</TE>
<TE>   Only three of Parks' deputy chiefs are considered possible
candidates: Gascon, Parks' chief of staff and a 31-year veteran of
the department; Kalish, commanding officer of operations in West
Bureau, who has been in the LAPD for 26 years; and LaChasse, a
32-year department veteran who heads operations in South Bureau and
who is retiring this week to become general manager of protective
services as Paramount Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Below that top tier of Parks deputies, some of those being
discussed include Cmdr. George Gascon (no relation to David Gascon),
head of the department's training group. Other names being floated
include Cmdr. Sharon Papa, the department ombudswoman and former head
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police; and Cmdr. Jim
McDonnell, who is working with the International Assn. of Chiefs of
Police to plan the group's 2004 meeting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the perceived shortage of LAPD talent as well as to
the desire for a candidate with an insider's perspective, some
officials say they would welcome the interest of former LAPD leaders
who have since left for other departments.</TE>
<TE>   One frequently mentioned possibility is Kroeker, who was a popular
deputy chief who came in second when Parks was chosen in 1997. He
went on to supervise the reconstruction of police agencies in Bosnia
as a United Nations deputy commissioner, and then took the helm of
the Portland Police Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   While there, Kroeker has had an uneven tenure, drawing criticism
for the way police clashed with protesters at a May Day event and
jeers for requiring a strict grooming standard for officers. In the
fall of 2000, videos surfaced of remarks he made to a Christian law
enforcement group a decade earlier in which he called homosexuality
"a perversion" and called for wives to be submissive.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Kroeker said his views had changed and that he
respects gays and lesbians. He said he would not tolerate any bias in
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Several LAPD insiders said another former deputy chief, William
Rathburn, would also be a strong candidate for the chief's job.
Rathburn, who was in charge of security for the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, is now a consultant working for the State Department on
security in Greece for the 2004 Olympics, among other projects.</TE>
<TE>   The name of Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, who was with the LAPD
28 years before going to the Ventura County city, was one of the
first to surface after Hahn announced his opposition to Parks. Lopez
left the LAPD in 1998 to take the top spot in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, the Oxnard Police Department has been struggling
with a series of police shootings. In one widely reported case last
summer, a distraught 23-year-old was shot by police while hiding in
his bedroom closet with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's own history of controversy--in the last decade it
weathered the beating of Rodney G. King, the failure to respond
swiftly to the riots in 1992, the ridicule directed at it for its
handling of the murder case against O.J. Simpson and the allegations
of shootings, beatings and thefts that came to be known as the
Rampart scandal--has done little to diminish its attractiveness for
possible chief candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD "has a tremendous tradition, and though it may have had
problems, it is still considered a premier job in law enforcement,"
said Bill Berger, police chief of North Miami Beach and president of
the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police.</TE>
<TE>   Mere Hint of Opening Starts Talk Nationwide</TE>
<TE>   Even the hint of an opening has already generated discussion
around the country about which prominent law enforcement officials
would be competitive for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The most frequently cited is Bratton, a former New York police
commissioner who was credited by many with slashing that city's crime
rate, but was then pushed out by then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Bratton has been working as a private security
consultant. He was considered a top candidate to take over the NYPD
again if former Public Advocate Mark Green had won the mayor's race
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Another East Coast figure who would be in the running is John
Timoney, who just left his post as commissioner of the Philadelphia
Police Department to run a high-end security firm in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, a popular chief with that department's rank and file, was
credited with effective leadership during the 2000 Republican
National Convention, which took place in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In California policing circles, San Diego's Bejarano and
Sacramento's Venegas are considered leading potential candidates.
Venegas impressed Los Angeles leaders five years ago and he made the
final cut, only to have then-Mayor Richard Riordan opt for Parks
instead.</TE>
<TE>   After being turned down in Los Angeles, Venegas continued to serve
as chief in Sacramento, where he works today. He too declined to
comment on whether he would be interested in the post, but did say
that if the mayor and the Police Commission are not going to
seriously consider outside candidates, they should say so at the
beginning to the process.</TE>
<TE>   "If you guys have already made up your minds, don't put your
community and other professionals who sometimes risk their jobs by
applying [through the process]," he said. "Just do it, and save
everybody a lot of headaches."</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano has been credited with helping nurture San Diego's
well-regarded community policing program. The LAPD has been striving
to implement various versions of that idea ever since then-Chief
Davis ran the department in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano has been in the news recently as his department leads the
investigation of the kidnapping and death of 7-year-old Danielle Van
Dam.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bejarano said he had no interest in the LAPD job, but
added: "You always have to have your options open."</TE>

<HD>Paramedic Pleads Guilty in Hit-and-Run Death</HD>

<LD>A 26-year-old paramedic pleaded guilty Thursday to charges stemming
from the hit-and-run traffic death of a Ventura woman last month.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Ryan Ramirez of Oxnard admitted he hit the woman at a busy
Ventura Avenue intersection while he was drunk. He fled in his Dodge
pickup and was arrested shortly afterward in the Wagon Wheel area of
Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   For his role in the death of Linda Mary Brandon, 51, Ramirez
pleaded guilty to two felonies--gross vehicular manslaughter while
drunk and leaving the scene of an accident. He faces a maximum prison
term of 11 years and eight months.</LD>
<TE>   The death prompted Ventura City Councilman Jim Monahan to ask the
city for a traffic light at Ventura Avenue and Warner Street, which
he called the city's most dangerous intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said he has submitted a request for the stoplight, which
could cost $60,000 to $100,000. He said the Westside Community
Council is circulating a petition supporting the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are starting to move," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of Feb. 14, Ramirez had been drinking with a
friend at a Pacific View Mall restaurant and was seen driving
recklessly in the shopping center parking lot, authorities said. The
pair later stopped at a Ventura bar, and dented a parked car when
they left.</TE>
<TE>   At about 5:20 p.m., Brandon was in a marked crosswalk on Ventura
Avenue as Ramirez approached at about 40 mph, 10 mph over the speed
limit, police said. Several cars had stopped for Brandon but Ramirez
did not. Police said he swerved into a left-turn lane and struck the
pedestrian. The impact threw Brandon 30 feet in front of the pickup,
and Ramirez then drove over her body, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors on Thursday said they would argue for the maximum
prison term at Ramirez's sentencing. "I think it is really egregious
that in light of his life-saving skills he would run over a victim
and flee the scene," Deputy Dist. Atty. Audry Rohn said.</TE>

<HD>Kerkorian's Ex-Wife Asks for Legal Fees</HD>
<DH>Courts: She is seeking more than $500,000 for expenses in
the child support case. Attorneys say the mogul is not the child's
father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former tennis pro Lisa Bonder Kerkorian took her billionaire
ex-husband to court on Thursday, seeking more than $500,000 for legal
expenses arising from her quest for a record-setting $320,000 in
monthly child support.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of the day, she left the courtroom in tears after
Superior Court Judge Lee Smalley Edmon delayed ruling on the request.
"I can't afford this," Kerkorian cried as she ran down the hallway
toward the exit, clutching a stuffed Easter bunny wrapped in
cellophane.</LD>
<LD>   The judge did rule that Kerkorian's lawyers can view Kirk
Kerkorian's tax returns to help determine how much he should pay to
support daughter, Kira, now 4. And the judge limited how much
pretrial questioning Lisa Kerkorian must face from her former
husband's lawyers, who are probing during depositions into details
such as Kira's choice of breakfast cereal.</LD>
<TE>   Although the case ostensibly is about how much money it takes to
properly raise a billionaire's daughter, much of the argument in
court and in legal filings has focused on Kirk Kerkorian's wealth and
Lisa Kerkorian's conduct. Neither has held back on the mud-slinging.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Lisa Kerkorian, 37, include fraud, deceit
and faking a DNA test. Kirk is accused of using his wealth and power
to crush her in court.</TE>
<TE>   During a contentious daylong hearing, attorneys disclosed that
Kirk Kerkorian, 84, could not be Kira's biological father. The
reason: He's sterile.</TE>
<TE>   And in court documents, one of Lisa Kerkorian's friends raised the
possibility that Kira's father is a Hollywood writer/producer who is
involved in another paternity dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a child support case. This isn't a trash-everybody case,"
Lisa Kerkorian's lawyer, Steven A. Kolodny, told the judge. Still,
the point was lost Thursday in the heat of what Kolodny called
"ultra, ultra hardball litigation tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a child support case in name only," said Kirk Kerkorian's
lawyer, Dennis M. Wasser. He accused Lisa Kerkorian of "using child
support as a vehicle to enrich herself."</TE>
<TE>   Also involved in the case is the wife of Lee Iaccoca, Darrien, who
has been dragged into the fray in a courthouse version of six degrees
of celebrity separation.</TE>
<TE>   Family friend Iaccoca said in a declaration that Lisa Kerkorian
told her in June 1997--a period when she and Kirk were on the
outs--that she was dating the writer/producer. "Later that summer,"
Iaccoca said, Lisa Kerkorian informed her that she was pregnant and
"was nervous" because she had been intimate with both the
writer/producer and Kerkorian. Lisa later told her that a "blood
test" had identified Kerkorian as the father, Iaccoca said.</TE>
<TE>   In her own declaration, Lisa Kerkorian downplayed her friendship
with Iaccoca, calling her "an opportunistic social climber" who
"would do anything to ingratiate herself to Kirk."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian, majority shareholder of MGM's film studio and
casino empire, has acknowledged paternity and taken financial
responsibility for Kira's upbringing in previous court proceedings.
He is asking the judge to maintain the monthly support payments at no
higher than the $50,000 he currently is paying.</TE>
<TE>   Wasser charged that Lisa Kerkorian's "entire case is a lie,"
adding that his client shouldn't be forced to subsidize it by footing
the legal bills. Since she's worth $12 million, she can afford to pay
her lawyer, Wasser said.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, the judge can order Kirk Kerkorian, who is
worth an estimated $6 billion, to pay Lisa Kerkorian's legal expenses
because of the disparity in their incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Wasser urged the judge to look at the inconsistencies in Lisa
Kerkorian's story before awarding the fees. He claims her story has
changed more times than MGM's stock price--116 times during a recent
two-day deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa insisted until recently that Kira was Kirk's child, and that
she had results of a DNA test to prove it. Now, she says, everybody
knew all along that he couldn't be the father. She's admitting in
court papers that she lied about Kirk's paternity, but claims it was
part of a mutual plot they hatched to give the corporate raider a
more cuddly image.</TE>
<TE>   "Kirk told me he did not want anyone other than me and his doctors
to know that he was sterile because he wanted to be known around the
world, and among his rich friends, as an 80-year-old who fathered a
beautiful young daughter," she said in a court declaration. "It
fraudulently raised his 'stock' in the male world, fraudulently
established him as a virile, sexually active octogenarian and gave
him some 'kinder, gentler' publicity."</TE>
<TE>   She has admitted faking the DNA test, attorneys said. This was
accomplished, court papers say, by collecting a swab of saliva from
Kirk Kerkorian's adult daughter, Tracy, under the ruse that it would
be used for her teenage son's science project. Lisa Kerkorian then
represented the sample as Kira's when she sent it, along with a
sample from Kirk, to a lab in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is set for May.</TE>

<HD>Write-In Candidate's Vote Tally Tops Kline's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defying the predictions of political pundits, a write-in candidate in
the March 5 primary election managed to garner more votes than an
Orange County judge accused of child molestation, even though the
jurist's name was the only one on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   With all of the county's precincts counted, Dana Point attorney
John Adams beat Judge Ronald C. Kline by a little more than 1,100
votes, according to an updated tally posted Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The result marked a surprise end to an election in which a record
260,000 voters penciled in the names of alternative candidates to
Kline.</LD>
<TE>   "It's extremely unusual. Write-ins rarely win," said Fred Smoller,
chairman of the political science department at Chapman University in
Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks before the election, Smoller and other political
experts had written off the chance of Kline failing to win
reelection. Kline, who faces charges of molestation and possessing
child pornography, was seeking another six-year term on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Adams will face Kline in a November runoff election unless
Kline is successful in his bid to withdraw from the race. Kline's
attorneys are scheduled to appear in court in Los Angeles next month
to ask a judge to remove his name from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline's name is dropped, Adams could be left alone on the
November ballot or face the next-highest vote-getter among write-ins,
depending on how the judge rules.</TE>
<TE>   Gay Sandoval, a Costa Mesa attorney, came in third.</TE>
<TE>   Adams and the other 10 write-in candidates benefited from national
and local media attention in the week before the primary, keeping
Kline to a meager 127,636 votes, or 33% of ballots. Adams won 128,785
votes, according to the registrar of voters' Web site.</TE>
<TE>   During the election campaign, Adams and other write-ins remained
publicly optimistic that they would force Kline into a runoff. But
few thought they could actually win more votes than the jurist. "I
never dreamed that he could be beaten by a write-in candidate," a
jubilant Adams said Thursday. "All the political pundits said it
couldn't happen. Hats off to Orange County voters who proved the
political pundits wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The last write-in candidate to win an election in Orange County
was Bruce W. Sumner. A retired judge, Sumner in 1986 narrowly blocked
a follower of perennial presidential candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
from winning the Democratic nomination in Orange County's 40th
congressional district.</TE>
<TE>   But Sumner's victory is dwarfed by this year's primary, which
marked the first time in Orange County that a write-in candidate got
the most votes in a countywide election.</TE>
<TE>   Adams benefited from a number of factors that helped distinguish
him in a crowded field of qualified write-in candidates. His name was
seen as easy to remember--an important factor in a write-in
campaign--and was positioned first in an alphabetical list of
write-in candidates that voters could request at polling places.</TE>
<TE>   Adams spent furiously in the final weeks before the election,
investing nearly $50,000 of his personal funds--more than any other
candidate. He bought radio and cable television ads, and hired a
mobile billboard adorned with a "Vote Adams" sign. On election day,
supporters stood near polling stations handing voters a total of
30,000 pencils emblazoned with his name.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Adams allied himself with supporters of the anti-El
Toro airport initiative, Measure W. The tactic won him crucial
support in his South County neighborhood, where voter turnout was
highest, said Chapman University's Smoller.</TE>
<TE>   With the November election approaching, Adams has publicly opposed
Kline's bid to drop out of the race, a position that has drawn
criticism as self-serving. But on Thursday, Adams said he would drop
his opposition if Kline would resign his position.</TE>

<LD>The phone rings in her Pasadena home and Joyce Ride pauses to hear
the voice on the answering machine. Maybe this will be the call from
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Nope. Not this one. Ride, 78, goes on with the story, her dog,
Cady, sprawled on the floor at her feet.</LD>
<LD>   You're not supposed to ask inmates why they're in prison, says
Ride, who's been going behind bars for 25 years. Prison volunteers
are trained to be pals, not inquisitors. So for the first year that
she traveled once every other week to the state prison in Frontera,
back in 1994, Ride didn't know that Gloria Killian was serving 32
years to life for murder.</LD>
<TE>   Then one day Ride, the mother of astronaut Sally Ride, said the
heck with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you here?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   When she heard Killian's claim of innocence, she had another
question.</TE>
<TE>   "Would it be all right with you if I hired an investigator?"</TE>
<TE>   The investigator further convinced Ride that Killian had been set
up; fingered by a casual acquaintance who had already been convicted
of the 1981 homicide/robbery in Sacramento. The murderer won a break
on his own sentence by claiming that Killian and another man were in
on it with him.</TE>
<TE>   Killian, a law student with no criminal record, was convicted in
1986 despite her claim of innocence. She had been in prison eight
years when Joyce Ride met her. As soon as Ride's investigator wrapped
up his work in 1995, Ride went to see Santa Monica attorney William
Genego.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her these cases can take a long time to resolve, they can
be incredibly expensive, and there was absolutely no way I could
assure her we would be successful," says Genego.</TE>
<TE>   Ride, a widow and former teacher, didn't flinch. Get it going, she
said, and she kept writing checks even as state courts rejected one
appeal after another.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a strong conscience, a commitment to social justice and
deep roots in progressive faith," says Ride's daughter Karen "Bear"
Ride, a Presbyterian minister at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Ride first visited female inmates in the 1970s, motivated by a nun
who spoke to her Presbyterian women's group. Of the 12 women now on
death row in California, she believes two may be innocent and that
four others deserve leniency for having murdered men who battered
them. Her blue Norwegian eyes narrow when she mentions Gov. Gray
Davis, who has said there should be no special consideration for
women who go after their tormentors.</TE>
<TE>   In Killian, Ride saw a kindred spirit. As a prison law clerk,
Killian represented battered women, went after guards for sexual
harassment and worked on a lawsuit demanding better medical coverage.
Killian kept up those fights even as her own pleas for justice were
rejected. There was no way Ride would abandon her, no matter the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed the perfectly normal thing to do," Ride said of her
check-writing, which cut deeply into her retirement fund.</TE>
<TE>   Genego says such cases can run into six figures. He became so
convinced of Killian's innocence that he began representing her for
free a couple of years ago. And then, last week, after all these
years, he called Ride with the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I yelled, 'Whoopee!' into the phone," says Ride.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed Killian's
conviction, saying it was based on a "thoroughly discredited"
perjurer trying to scam a lighter sentence. A new trial could be
ordered at some point, but Killian is expected to be released on bail
as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Joyce she was a hero," says Genego, "and she started
laughing and said she never thought of it that way."</TE>
<TE>   By chance, Ride had a scheduled visit at the prison the day
Killian got the news. "She was a couple of feet off the floor," says
Ride.</TE>
<TE>   When the call comes, she's going to pick Killian up at the prison
and bring her home to Pasadena. "She's going to stay with me until
she gets herself situated," says Ride.</TE>
<TE>   Killian, 55, may return to law school, picking up where she left
off before 16 years were taken from her.</TE>
<TE>   As we waited for the phone to ring, I asked Ride what makes her
the kind of person who couldn't let go of this case. She went to
another room and when she returned, she handed me a poem by Adrienne
Rich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My heart is moved by all</TE>
<TE>   I cannot save:</TE>
<TE>   So much has been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   I have to cast my lot with those</TE>
<TE>   who Age after age, perversely,</TE>

<HD>20 Students Tested in Poisoning Scare</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty Long Beach seventh-graders were sent to hospitals for testing
Thursday after they came into contact with a drop of mercury a
classmate had taken to school.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Long Beach Unified School District, Richard
Van Der Laan, said all the students appeared to be unharmed.</LD>
<LD>   He said the child who took the mercury to school would be
disciplined. In the meantime, he said, notes were sent home with the
1,670 students enrolled at Alexander Hamilton Middle School, where
the incident occurred, reminding parents not to allow their children
to take hazardous substances to school.</LD>
<TE>   "One difficulty with this is that we don't know exactly where the
mercury came from, whether it came from a broken thermometer, a
dentistry filling or an electric light switch," he said. "That
complicates the diagnosis of the hazard."</TE>
<TE>   Van Der Laan said that by the time school authorities became aware
of the situation, about 9:30 a.m., some children may have gotten some
mercury on their hands.</TE>
<TE>   Medical authorities said Thursday that mercury is most dangerous
in a vaporous form that can be inhaled. There was no sign that
happened in this case, and only protracted contact with the liquid
form would be alarming.</TE>
<TE>   Van Der Laan said the school later used a mercury-sniffing
electronic detector to determine where any mercury might still be
present, and a vacuum cleaning device to collect it where found. Both
firefighters and schools' hazardous materials personnel were summoned
to the school for help.</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo, a City on Move</HD>
<DH>Government: After years of renting space in a nondescript
office park, officials are moving into a $14.5-million City Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of renting, Mission Viejo has become a homeowner.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders in this quintessential master-planned community
packed up and started moving Thursday from their second-floor rental
deep in a sprawling office park to a $14.5-million City Hall in the
center of town. The front doors will open Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 52,000-square-foot contemporary mission-style structure is the
centerpiece of a civic center on the southwest corner of Marguerite
Parkway and La Paz Road--a bustling intersection that is as close to
a downtown as Mission Viejo has to offer.</LD>
<TE>   City officials say the new digs should give the city of 100,000
residents a more focused identity.</TE>
<TE>   "'City Hall' is a nebulous term," City Manager Dan Joseph said.
"But it gives people something tangible to refer to."</TE>
<TE>   It also gives people something they can actually find.</TE>
<TE>   The old City Hall was tucked behind a strip mall in a nondescript
office complex on the northwest edge of the city. If not for a few
signs that pointed the way, City Hall could have passed for a real
estate office.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even have a lobby to welcome the public," said Karen
Wiley, the city's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "The elevator wasn't big enough for a gurney," Wiley said. "A
woman was having a baby and she had to sit up while she was in
labor."</TE>
<TE>   Since incorporating in 1988--two decades after people began moving
into the subdivisions that went up on an old cattle ranch--the city
has been a renter. On Monday, 15 months after groundbreaking, the
front doors to City Hall will be tossed open and the city will become
a landlord.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall consists of two floors of office space, a 165-seat
council chambers--twice the size of the old one--a community room
that doubles as an emergency operations center and office space for
fire and Orange County sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty yards across a courtyard is the library, which is expanding
by 14,400 square feet. There is a community and senior center down
the road.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, residents of Mission Viejo overwhelming rejected a
proposal for a City Hall, which seemed extravagant for a 4-year-old
city. In 2000, voters went the other way and approved a scaled-down
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   And to date, the only grumbling about the new civic headquarters
has been whether there will be enough parking.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a bedroom community, a suburb," Mayor Susan Withrow
said. "You can walk down the sidewalk and get to a lot of city
services now I think we've done a pretty good job of creating a
downtown where there wasn't one."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, as boxes and crates were carted from the rented
offices, city employees said the move was far from being a
sentimental journey.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lived in the apartments," Joseph said. "Now it's time to
move into a house."</TE>

<HD>Direction of Nixon Library Debated</HD>
<DH>Presidents: At stake in sisters' dispute is whether focus
will be tourism or research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the entrance to the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, a sign
announcing that the building is available for "special events,
including weddings" lets visitors know this presidential library is
like no other.</LD>
<LD>   The Yorba Linda institution is the only one of America's 11
presidential libraries that does not take taxpayer money. It's also
the only one that isn't home to its president's White House papers.</LD>
<LD>   When the sandstone library opened in 1990, its curators boasted
the library was as much about tourism as scholarship--and the last 12
years have essentially proved them right.</LD>
<TE>   The battle now brewing between Nixon's two daughters over control
of an $18-million bequest to the Nixon Foundation could help
determine whether it remains largely a museum and tourist attraction
or becomes the more serious academic clearinghouse on the Nixon
presidency that scholars have longed for.</TE>
<TE>   The bequest was made four years ago by a longtime Nixon friend,
the late Charles "Bebe" Rebozo. Julie Nixon Eisenhower wants the
funds to be controlled by the foundation's board of directors, saying
it's the most professional way to manage the money. Tricia Nixon Cox
wants a three-person committee made up of the sisters and Nixon
friend Robert Abplanalp to oversee the foundation's gift, as she says
Rebozo's will instructs.</TE>
<TE>   The library is in the midst of a $10-million expansion, though its
main goal is not about boosting Nixon scholarship. The centerpiece of
the project is a replica of the White House East Room--home of Tricia
Cox's wedding reception--part of a banquet facility that would host
bar mitzvahs, weddings and special events.</TE>
<TE>   Many historians hope the Rebozo bequest will help the library to
reach for more ambitious academic goals and finally pave the way for
Nixon's White House papers to be transferred from the National
Archives outside Washington to Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's a hollow library," said Richard Reeves, author of
the recent bestseller "President Nixon: A Man Alone." "They've got to
decide whether it's going to be a presidential library or a roadside
museum."</TE>
<TE>   Officials haven't determined how they would spend the Rebozo money
once the court battle between the sisters is resolved. The library
foundation took the issue to court in California and Florida, hoping
to break what they described as a hopeless stalemate that threatened
to deprive the library of the bequest.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials--including the sisters--hope the money can help
create what has always been their long-term goal: creating the
premier research facility not just for the Nixon presidency but for
the post-World War II and Vietnam eras as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it can become the preeminent center for the study of the
Cold War," library director John Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the Nixon library already houses a "gem of a
collection" of Nixon's personal and political papers from his years
before his ascent to the presidency, and also the two decades after
he left office.</TE>
<TE>   Still, without Nixon's voluminous collection of White House papers
and material--which included everything from the infamous Oval Office
tapes exposed in the Watergate scandal to the details of his historic
visit to China--the Nixon library can never live up to the
collections in other presidential libraries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The library's difficulties in getting the presidential papers are
rooted in the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon from office.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Nixon's resignation in 1974, Congress decreed that
the General Services Administration, the parent agency of the
National Archives, should seize all his White House recordings and
papers to guarantee that Nixon would not destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon collection is now held in the National Archives annex in
College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Until he died in 1994, Nixon fought bitterly to reclaim his
presidential papers, and in 2000 the federal government agreed to pay
$18million to Nixon's estate to settle claims that those materials
were improperly seized.</TE>
<TE>   During settlement discussions, attorneys for the Nixon estate and
officials from the National Archives tried to hammer out an accord
that would have created a taxpayer-funded home for the papers in
Yorba Linda. Those talks broke down, however, and have yet to be
revived.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the collection to Yorba Linda remains a priority for the
library, Taylor said. However, both he and officials at the National
Archives doubt that will happen soon.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no discussions currently between the National Archives
and the Nixon Library, and we don't anticipate any," said Susan
Cooper, spokeswoman for the federal agency.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the collection would be expensive, because a new library
would have to be built and a staff of federal archivists would have
to be hired to maintain the papers. Traditionally, construction of
the library buildings is privately funded.</TE>
<TE>   The other presidential museums are meccas for academics and
authors who depend on the collections to examine the inner workings
of the White House and examine events that helped to shape the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   While other presidential libraries have museums honoring their
namesakes, those institutions also house federally controlled
collections in their archives that provide unvarnished evidence of a
president's time in office.</TE>
<TE>   "Our library is a library and museum. Really, the Nixon library is
just a museum," said Betty Sue Flowers, director of Lyndon Baines
Johnson Library in Austin, Texas. "It makes a difference when a
museum is housed alongside records of history, and scholars are
[roaming] around. It sort of keeps you honest."</TE>
<TE>   Without the Nixon presidential papers, some historians and
scholars say, the collection at the Yorba Linda library is of little
use to them. And even library supporters say the absence of
presidential papers is glaring. Nixon biographer Irv Gellman, whose
book "The Contender" chronicled Nixon's early years in politics, said
the Yorba Linda library is a gold mine for documents about Nixon's
pre-White House years. Still, Gellman believes the library's
never-ending effort to raise money taints what should be a
prestigious institution of scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in there one time, where they had a travel show in the main
lobby of the library," Gellman said. "It all pays to run the place,
but do you need to have a travel show? How does a travel show help
the legacy of the 37th president of the United States?"</TE>
<TE>   Private Events Help Library Raise Money</TE>
<TE>   With its terrazzo-tiled floors, sculpted rose gardens and breezy,
California-style architecture, the Nixon library hosts hundreds of
private events every year at rates that range from $500 for nonprofit
organizations to more than $3,000 for corporations, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The library hosts dozens of weddings a year, and an almost equal
number of high school proms. In all, those private events bring in
almost half a million dollars a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon Foundation's endowment is close to $13 million, which in
most years provides a steady investment income.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the foundation's bylaws allow it to use 5% of the
endowment for operating expenses, which means the library must
continually scramble to raise money.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials make no apologies for the types of exhibits at
the museum or the use of fund-raisers, saying they help draw people
who otherwise would never visit a presidential library. The facility
also hosts scores of policy lectures with big-name politicians
including former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon Foundation also runs the Nixon Center in Washington, a
premier foreign policy think tank known worldwide, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The rift created by the Rebozo bequest has revealed years of
infighting at the library, exposing deeply seated quarrels on the
foundation's 24-member board of directors, which includes Nixon's
daughters as well as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
former Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth L. Khachigian, board member and former Nixon aide, said
board members are often kept in the dark about spending and other
policy decisions, which he said are left to a "secretive" executive
committee guided by Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The full board meets just once a year to decide budget and
administrative matters, with many out-of-town members attending via
telephone conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, some notable members are no-shows, mostly because they
are scattered across the globe dealing with pressing diplomatic
matters, said Robert F. Ellsworth, a board member who served as
Nixon's ambassador to NATO.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor maintains that the board's oversight is very intense, and
that every dollar spent and investment made is reviewed by members of
the board's executive committee, as well as its separate investment
and budget, and audit and finance committees.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's treasurer comes to Yorba Linda every Friday to
sign the foundation's checks, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly how a nonprofit foundation should function," Taylor
said.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers OK $250 Million for S.F. Olympic Bid</HD>
<DH>Legislature: The state funds would be available only if
private money guaranteed for the 2012 Summer Games is spent.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Legislature hastily approved a measure Thursday to
provide up to $250 million in public money to finance what was
previously billed as an all-private bid to bring the 2012 Olympic
Games to San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis has indicated that he will sign the bill, by
Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton (D-San Francisco), to
provide "last resort" backup financing.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents said the state's economy would benefit greatly from the
Games, as it did during the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco's American competitors for the summer games--New
York, Houston and Washington--have obtained similar pledges of
assistance from state and local governments.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the other locales, which would use taxpayer money
upfront to finance the games, the public assistance for San Francisco
would come into play only after an expected $500-million reserve and
an additional $250-million insurance policy were tapped out,
according to the backers of the San Francisco bid.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think it's going to require any public money," said
Davis spokesman Russ Lopez. "We think this is something that will
benefit not only San Francisco, but the whole state."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which received little public scrutiny before Thursday's
votes, cleared both the Senate and Assembly in minutes with
bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the kind of investment that will come back to California
many times," said Assemblyman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae).</TE>
<TE>   But some Republican lawmakers criticized the fast-moving measure,
arguing that the state, which is facing a $17.5-billion budget
shortfall, should not tie the hands of future legislatures with a
quarter-billion-dollar commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a loan guaranty. That's exactly what this is," said Sen.
Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.,
criticized the measure, saying that it fits a larger trend by state
officials to increase debt obligations with little thought of the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that given the budgetary crunch that this is not a
top of the totem pole type of issue," Coupal said. "Building
infrastructure and taking care of the deficit should be higher
priorities."</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee, the group behind the San
Francisco bid, had touted its effort as 100% privately funded. In
fact, it promised the San Francisco Board of Supervisors last year
that no taxpayer money would be used.</TE>
<TE>   The group maintains that it still plans to orchestrate the Games
without a dime of public money, but said that the U.S. Olympic
Committee has said it will need some state backing as security.</TE>
<TE>   "We really do stand behind our pledge" not to use taxpayer money,
said the group's president, Anne Cribbs, a former Olympic swimmer.
"These are not going to be the Olympic Games on the backs of
taxpayers. This is a privately funded bid based on the L.A. model."</TE>
<TE>   The four finalist cities are vying to become the country's choice
for the 2012 Olympics, a decision the U.S. Olympic Committee will
make in November. The International Olympic Committee will choose the
winning host city in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   In what it calls a conservative estimate, the Bay Area group said
that a 2012 San Francisco Olympics would generate $2.5 billion in
revenues and cost only $2 billion, leaving $500 million to cover
unanticipated costs. With UC Berkeley and Stanford in the vicinity,
it said the Bay Area already has 80% of the facilities it needs to
host the games, and could concentrate on improving existing stadiums
and transportation systems.</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation is a huge boost for our bid, and positions us as
a front-runner for the U.S. candidacy, without changing the private
nature of our bid," said Tony Winnicker, the spokesman for the Bay
Area group.</TE>
<TE>   "It provides a tangible expression of government support that we
intend to never use."</TE>
<TE>   Because the cities have to submit legal papers to the U.S. Olympic
Committee on March 26 detailing their financial guarantees, state
lawmakers said, they needed to move more quickly than usual.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do this, we'll get knocked out" of the running,
Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga) said during the lower house's
brief floor debate. The Assembly passed the measure on a 61-7 vote.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, which like the Assembly was preparing to leave
Thursday for its annual spring recess, Burton ran into some
opposition from Republicans and briefly found himself a vote short of
the 27 he needed for passage.</TE>
<TE>   His colleagues were hardly shuddering with visions of former
Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, who once locked his fellow colleagues
on the floor of the lower house for hours until they voted for a bill
he wanted, but Burton then threatened, half-jokingly, to shutter the
Senate and make lawmakers miss their planes out of town. He also
spoke of dragging absentee Sen. Maurice K. Johannessen (R-Redding),
who lives at least three hours north of Sacramento, back to the
chamber to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, Sen. Bob Margett (R-Arcadia) stepped forward and
offered his vote. The final tally was 28 to 5.</TE>

<HD>OK, This Bud's for All You Elton John Opera Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Further proof that everyone's a critic: The Seal Beach Sun's police
blotter recorded a complaint about a woman on a public street "who
was seen carrying a 40-ounce Budweiser and singing Elton John songs."</LD>
<LD>   This incident is not believed to be related to a recent complaint
in Laguna Niguel about a person "who was sitting in a parked vehicle
listening to very loud Italian opera."</LD>
<LD>   On another sour note...: In his post-election wrap-up, columnist
Dan Bernstein of the Riverside Press Enterprise wrote that one losing
candidate's cause wasn't helped by the fact that she was a former USC
song girl. That, he explained, meant she had been "accompanied by the
wretched USC marching band."</LD>
<TE>   It is true that fans of rival schools have long bemoaned the fact
that the USC band plays "Tribute to Troy" dozens of times per game.
In fact, they play it so often that Pete Carroll, after becoming USC
football coach, was moved to ask reporters: "How many times do they
play that song? Goll-ee. They just keep playing it."</TE>
<TE>   But I wondered if perhaps Bernstein himself had a musical link to
one of those rival schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have you know," he replied, "I was a proud, pants-dropping
member of the Leland Stanford Jr. University Marching Band (trombone)
... Highlight: Marched in the '71 Rose Bowl versus Ohio State. Wore
an orange wig."</TE>
<TE>   I'm keeping that confession on file in case Bernstein ever runs
for office.</TE>
<TE>   Salute to the Oscars: Here's another in a series of memorable
marquees snapped by column readers, in this case, by Mary Lou Canaday
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Today's unusual offers (see accompanying) include a
sale that doesn't seem like a sale (contributed by Sue Siani of
Torrance), as well as a wheelbarrow that has some strange
capabilities (spotted by Fred Sakumi of Montrose). The wheelbarrow
text may have been intended for a product one column over in the
advertisement for some "premium planting mix."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. moves to the left: Did you read where Mayor Hahn said he has
smoothed out 25 of the city's most gridlocked intersections? He added
that he ignored those who kidded him "when I said I wanted to put in
more left-turn lanes and left-turn signals."</TE>
<TE>   No defense needed. As one character says in the movie "Grand
Canyon": "Making a left turn in L.A. is one of the harder things
you'll learn in life."</TE>
<TE>   Traffic congestion (cont.): Police were called to Seal Beach
"after a dispute broke out between two surfers," the Long Beach
Press-Telegram said, and one surfer accused "the other of kicking him
while they rode waves." Amazing if true--I mean the idea that a
surfer could kick someone in the next lane and still maintain balance
on his board.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Dick Harmon noticed that San Juan Capistrano has
dueling signs at its city limits along the San Diego Freeway. The
sign at the south end says the city's population is 25,000. The sign
at the north end says it's 31,071. Maybe the latter figure includes
the swallows.</TE>

<HD>Courtroom Artists as Eyes of the Public</HD>
<DH>In between journalism and art, sketches capture the
proceedings when cameras are banned from high-profile trials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a high-profile trial takes place in Los Angeles, sketch artist
Bill Robles wheels his black canvas briefcase into the crowded
courthouse, navigating past the familiar faces of security guards and
news reporters.</LD>
<LD>   He always grabs a seat in the front row, at the far end of the
courtroom, then flips open his drawing pad and a box of colored
markers. "It's good to get on the end," Robles says, "because you get
an overall view. The middle is not good because you get the backs of
people."</LD>
<LD>   Even reporters who usually vie for the best seats in the house
defer to Robles' needs.</LD>
<TE>   He and another artist, Mona Shafer Edwards, serve as the eyes of
the public when cameras are banned from court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' career began more than three decades ago with the Charles
Manson trial, during which he captured with markers Manson lunging at
the judge with a pencil. Since then, Robles has sketched some of the
most high-profile defendants in recent history, from O.J. Simpson to
the Unabomber.</TE>
<TE>   "The scariest guy I ever saw in my 31 years was the Night
Stalker," Robles recalls in his small, brightly lighted Santa Monica
art studio, referring to the mid-1980s serial killer Richard Ramirez.
"Manson looked like a saint compared to him."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, a fashion artist who turned to court sketching 24 years
ago, says the trial that haunts her most is that of Charles Rathbun,
a photographer convicted of brutalizing and killing a model during a
photo shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gruesomeness of some of the trials they cover, Robles
and Edwards say their work is mostly pleasant. Straddling the worlds
of journalism and art, they seem immune from the suspicion and ill
will that reporters sometimes face from the families of victims or
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really interested in what we do," Edwards says. She
recalls an accused drug lord's family asking to buy one of her
sketches, but she refused out of fear of having too much personal
contact with them.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike print journalists, sketch artists have a certain amount of
artistic license. If a lawyer obstructs their view of the judge, they
move the lawyer out of the way in the drawing. Edwards says she took
even greater liberties during the lengthy Simpson trials, filling
"down time" by placing red socks or socks with tiny daisies on them
in her sketches of the lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The two are also sometimes approached by attorneys with special
requests. "They ask, 'Can you make me thinner?' or 'Can you put more
hair on me?'" Edwards says.</TE>
<TE>   The flexible nature of drawings makes them more useful than
cameras in some cases. When a judge bars the depiction of jurors or a
child witness, a cameraman is prohibited from aiming in their
direction. But an artist can draw the outline of the forbidden
subject, obscuring the face, and thus provide a lawful visual
representation.</TE>
<TE>   The artists say sketches show courtroom drama in a way that a
camera cannot. "I think people are still entranced by it," Edwards
says. "It captures the essence of somebody, and the soul."</TE>
<TE>   But the demand for court sketching has waned since the mid-1980s,
when the State Judicial Council gave judges discretion to televise
trials. TV stations also have an array of other visual tools,
including graphics and old footage. "We have become so used to seeing
the real thing that getting an artist rendition often pales in
comparison," says Jennifer Siebens, CBS' Los Angeles bureau chief.</TE>
<TE>   One place sketch artists continue to be needed, Siebens says, is
in federal court, where there is an absolute ban on cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Robles misses the days when the media hired artists for day-to-day
coverage of big trials. "They make do with less today," Robles says,
using the example of coverage of the San Francisco dog mauling case
that ended Thursday in Los Angeles. "They just keep milking images
[from opening statements] over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   The artists, who describe themselves as friendly competitors,
charge major clients, such as networks and national wire services,
$400 per court appearance, and smaller stations and newspapers $350.
But they are usually not bound to the client that called them for the
job.</TE>
<TE>   If other news crews are present at the courthouse and want to film
the sketches, they can do it for the same fee. Robles says that on a
good day, as many as 14 TV stations have used his work.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards recalls an incident in which a Los Angeles-based Korean TV
crew asked how much it cost to film one of her drawings.
"Three-fifty," she told them. After the crew shot the sketch, the
reporter pulled out his wallet and gave her $3.50. "I was like, 'What
do you think I'm selling? Oranges?'" she says. Edwards demanded that
they erase the footage.</TE>
<TE>   Because they can sometimes go for months without an assignment,
the artists supplement their incomes with other art jobs. Robles has
drawn wine labels, dog portraits and rocket launches. Edwards has
designed a line of underwear and done fashion sketches for newspapers
and textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   A large chunk of the artists' earnings comes from the work they
sell to attorneys, who pay hundreds of dollars for sketches of their
noteworthy cases. It's also commonplace in legal circles to buy a
sketch as a gift for a fellow lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles pooled together to buy a $500
sketch as a going-away present for their boss, U.S. Atty. Alejandro
Mayorkas, who stepped down last year. It depicted Mayorkas, an
assistant U.S. attorney at the time, prosecuting Hollywood madam
Heidi Fleiss, with actor Charlie Sheen on a TV monitor during a taped
deposition.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a good case, you can put it on your ego wall," says
Los Angeles attorney Mark Geragos, who has bought several sketches.
Geragos is defending actress Winona Ryder in her shoplifting case and
has asked Robles to sell a sketch.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights attorney Stephen Yagman walks into his Venice office
every morning to the sight of a blow-up of a sketch Robles did during
a police brutality trial in which San Bernardino County sheriff's
deputies were sued for beating a group of Mexican laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "That case really symbolized the best kind of freedoms that we
have in America: access to our courts by people who are not from
here, who have been hurt by the government and can come to our courts
to complain about it," Yagman says. "It also shows me what I looked
like when I was a young guy, and I like looking at that."</TE>
<TE>   Although Robles says he is trying to find more work in the fine
arts field, he talks about his courtroom gigs with the feeling of a
natural journalist. "The beauty of doing it is the adrenaline," he
says, recalling moments of panic when unfinished drawings were
snatched out of his hands by reporters on deadline. "Before you know
it, it's on a satellite and being seen all around the world."</TE>

<LD>It's been said that God watches over drunks and little children.</LD>
<LD>   If it's true--as police say--that the man who allegedly ran a red
light late Tuesday night in Huntington Beach was under the influence
of alcohol, then God had a choice to make at the intersection of
Beach Boulevard and Edinger Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   With all due respect, I must question his decision.</LD>
<TE>   Three young women, described as best friends, were fatally injured
when their westbound car was broadsided by the northbound car, which
police say didn't stop at the red light. The driver in question, who
remains hospitalized in critical condition, was arrested on suspicion
of felony drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   This is my cue to dredge up as much fulminating language as I can,
to summon the outrage and condemn this kind of carnage. Believe me,
after seeing the family photos of the three dead young women in the
paper, I want to.</TE>
<TE>   I can't. It just seems like such a hollow exercise. Not because
outrage isn't warranted; just because we've seen this senseless
scenario so many times before. And we know, for a fact, the same
sickening drama will unfold again.</TE>
<TE>   All I've really got in me is deep-seated contempt for red-light
runners. That this particular suspect was allegedly under the
influence makes it worse, but only a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   I know that Huntington Beach intersection well. The three victims
were locals and perhaps had driven through it, as I have, countless
times. Now, for their families and everyone who knew them, a street
becomes a memorial site--a permanent reminder of the inhumanity
people show to others by cavalierly turning their cars into deadly
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   I used to take solace in thinking red-light runners were rarities.
In recent months, however, I've asked friends whether they've noticed
that these traffic villains seem to be proliferating, like germs.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago in Anaheim, I had the left-turn traffic signal and
was about to make my move when not one, but two cars from the other
direction took off. Luckily, I had time to hit the brakes and avoid
being crunched. A few years ago, someone in a van ran a red light a
block from my house and we collided. I walked away, but a millisecond
or a quirk of physics relating to the angle of impact could easily
have left me dead.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't angry that I might have died. What infuriated me was the
effect it would have had on family and friends left to cope with an
accident caused solely because someone was daydreaming instead of
driving responsibly.</TE>
<TE>   Now, this latest accident. Two 19-year-olds and an 18-year-old
woman--just grown-up little girls--will leave behind hundreds of
grieving friends and relatives. The challenge of coping will last a
lifetime for many of them.</TE>
<TE>   I could have tried to talk to some of them, but didn't want to. I
remember too well sitting in a Westminster home four years ago and
talking to the parents of another 19-year-old woman killed by someone
who blew a stop sign. The pain and emptiness they conveyed was
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   People shouldn't have to sit in their homes and discuss things
like that.</TE>
<TE>   I did make one call. It was to Reidel Post, executive director of
the local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She, too, can't
think of new things to say about the outrage of drunk drivers and the
damage they do to society.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent five-year period studied for Orange County,
Post says, 266 people died in DUI-related incidents. Nearly 7,100
other people were injured, she says.</TE>
<TE>   So, what's left to say? Post says she and her staff, too, have to
fight becoming immune to the endless string of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "I never pick up a phone and hear a family member talk to me about
the devastation that driving under the influence causes without me
just wanting to scream and cry and rant and rave," she says. "It
never feels less than that."</TE>
<TE>   So it was again this week when she learned of the Huntington Beach
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't I say goodbye to my kids and trust that I'm going to
see them again?" says Post, who became active after seeing friends
devastated by the crime. "Every time I say goodbye and give them a
hug and kiss, I know it may be the last time I may be able to do
that. In one way, I wish I were more ignorant of the facts, but in
another way it keeps me appreciating every single moment I have with
my family."</TE>

<HD>Sellers Protest State Bid to Void Energy Pacts</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Some long-term power providers say the
contracts were proposed by the state itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Some of the long-term power contract provisions California formally
challenged as unfair last month were proposed by the state itself,
say electricity sellers in protests to be filed today with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<LD>   California "spins a fiction of the highest order" in claiming that
power firms had such a stranglehold on the electricity market last
year that they could force the state to agree to contract terms,
according to documents that energy industry groups are submitting.</LD>
<LD>   In protesting California's challenge of its energy contracts, at
least one company says the state agreed to its prices and terms, and
even asked for more such pacts.</LD>
<TE>   Calpine Corp. Executive Vice President James Macias tells federal
regulators in written remarks that the state's chief negotiator, S.
David Freeman, proposed doubling the length of a 10-year contract
with Calpine. That deal, criticized by consumer advocates as too
expensive, commits the state to pay at least $80 million a year
whether or not the state buys electricity from 11 small Calpine
"peaker" power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point during the final stages of drafting Contract 3,"
Macias writes, "Mr. Freeman telephoned me and indicated that he felt
that this capacity would be valuable in the future and proposed that
all of the terms and conditions be extended to 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he stretched out the contract to cut the annual price
by roughly a third. But, according to Macias' statement, the annual
payments in the last 10 years of the deal are still $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really hurting, and they had some of the only peakers
they could bring in for next summer," Freeman said. "It's proof
positive of how much they had us over the barrel."</TE>
<TE>   The energy company protests come in response to the California
Public Utilities Commission's Feb. 25 request that federal regulators
void or modify more than half of the 54 long-term contracts the state
signed last spring.</TE>
<TE>   In a petition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the PUC
argued that the agreements were negotiated in the midst of widespread
market manipulation and that the state had no choice but to accept
the power generators' terms or risk blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts, with an estimated value of $43 billion, were
negotiated by Freeman and other energy advisors last spring to help
California avoid exorbitant spot-market purchases of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   For several months, Davis and his advisors praised the contracts
for guaranteeing California reasonable, reliable energy supplies.</TE>
<TE>   But spot-market prices have since plunged, making the multiyear
contracts expensive by comparison. Consumer advocates and other
critics pressured Davis to amend or void the contracts, and they have
become fodder in the race for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "It is bitterly ironic that the same contracts that were heralded
a year ago for taming the spot market and providing needed supplies
... are now targeted by arms of the state," says a joint protest to
be lodged by the Independent Energy Producers Assn., the Electric
Power Supply Assn. and the Western Power Trading Forum.</TE>

<HD>More Sex Charges Filed Against Teacher</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Camarillo High School instructor is now facing
39 counts of misconduct relating to 11 minors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors have added six felony counts to the growing case against
a Camarillo High School teacher accused of sexual misconduct with
male students, bringing the total number of alleged victims to 11.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley is also pushing to increase bail
for Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, alleging the 30-year-old science teacher
and coach violated the conditions of his release on $250,000 bail
last month.</LD>
<LD>   Ridley would not detail the alleged violations, but an order
issued March 8 by Superior Court Judge Kevin McGee stipulated that
Pridgen not have contact with any minors without their parents'
direct supervision.</LD>
<TE>   An additional order prohibits Pridgen from leaving the state.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by a few supporters, Pridgen appeared in court Thursday
but did not enter a plea on the new charges. An arraignment and bail
hearing were set for April 5.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the outcome of that hearing, Pridgen's bail could go
up or he could be ordered back to jail with no bail, Ridley said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll let the court decide how serious the violations are," he
said outside court on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen now faces 39 felony and misdemeanor counts of sex acts
with 11 minors, nine of them current or former Camarillo High School
students. Ridley said the latest two alleged victims are also teenage
boys but they do not attend Camarillo High.</TE>
<TE>   Charges against the teacher include supplying minors with alcohol,
showing them pornography and either forcing or coercing them into
having oral sex. Pridgen pleaded not guilty to 33 counts last month
and will be arraigned on the new charges April 5.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher is on unpaid leave from the Oxnard Union High School
District, where he has taught upper-level science courses for the
last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorney, Paul Takakjian, declined to
comment on the developments in the case.</TE>
<TE>   But friends who sat with Pridgen in court Thursday said they don't
believe any of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing's a bunch of hooey," said Christine Tobias, a
mother of twin daughters who are former students of Pridgen.</TE>
<TE>   She and others have been trying to help Pridgen find a job while
he awaits the outcome of the case, she said. "He's lost weight and
he's terribly stressed out," Tobias said. "He's a great guy. My heart
goes out to him."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen was arrested Feb. 5 after a Ventura County Sheriff's
Department investigation prompted by one student, now 18.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, the investigation found that Pridgen had
Camarillo High School students at his house on weekends for parties
that often involved alcohol and pornography, which would lead to
other sexual behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The behavior ranged from masturbating to oral sex, according to
court records.</TE>
<TE>   Since Pridgen's arrest, the case has grown from one alleged victim
to 11, and Ridley said in court Thursday that investigators still
have 100 more people to contact.</TE>
<TE>   At a court hearing last month, Ridley said authorities have
recorded admissions by Pridgen that he engaged in sexual behavior
with minors and used his position as a teacher to get students to
perform sexual favors for him.</TE>
<TE>   The statements were obtained using a concealed microphone and
transmitter worn by a student during a meeting with Pridgen the night
before he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all charges, the teacher could face up to 34 years
in state prison, prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Caruso's Firing Over Alleged Slur Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping up their criticism of Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and
his administration, about 100 people called Thursday for him to fire
Police Commission President Rick Caruso because the commissioner
allegedly used a slur to refer to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles).</LD>
<LD>   Brotherhood Crusade President Danny Bakewell and City Councilman
Nate Holden said at a rally outside City Hall that they will continue
protesting until Caruso leaves his post. They also demanded the
resignation of Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook, who they said has
dismissed the incident without investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, the mayor said he did
not see any reason to ask Caruso to step down. Hahn, who appoints the
Police Commission, said Caruso has demonstrated "extraordinary
leadership."</LD>
<TE>   Middlebrook declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The calls for Caruso to be fired come as the five-member Police
Commission deliberates whether to reappoint Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks to a second term. Bakewell, Waters and Holden are among those
who favor Parks' reappointment, which Hahn opposes.</TE>
<TE>   The anger over the mayor's stance has been exacerbated by a
statement Caruso allegedly made during a private meeting with several
top police officials Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   According to an anonymous letter distributed to city officials by
someone who claimed to be a participant at the meeting, Caruso
referred to the congresswoman as "the bitch Waters."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso has declined to comment on the matter, and the police
officials who attended the meeting would not confirm or deny that he
made the remark.</TE>
<TE>   At the noontime protest Thursday on the steps of City Hall, about
100 people chanted "One, two, three, four--Rick Caruso has got to
go!" One sign asked: "Rick Caruso: Is this how you refer to your
wife?"</TE>
<TE>   Holden said Caruso set a bad example.</TE>
<TE>   "If a police officer made a statement like that to any citizen ...
they would be dismissed," Holden said. "Why should we have a double
standard?"</TE>
<TE>   Waters released two letters Thursday, one to Hahn urging him to
ask for Caruso's resignation and another to Parks requesting that he
investigate the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement his office released after the protest, Hahn
expressed concern about the recent spike in violent crime and the
management of the Police Department. He did not address the
complaints about Caruso or the calls for the resignations of the
Police Commission president and Middlebrook.</TE>

<HD>Largest Energy Users Can Still Bypass Utilities</HD>
<DH>PUC vote: 'Direct-access' contracts are kept for big
customers, but they must pay a surcharge. Foes fear a burden for
others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With billions of dollars in the balance, state regulators on Thursday
ruled that California's largest energy consumers can continue to
bypass utilities and buy less costly electricity directly from
alternative providers.</LD>
<LD>   A sharply divided Public Utilities Commission voted 3-2 to
preserve so-called direct-access contracts that were signed before
Sept. 20. But the commission ruled that those customers will be
required to pay a surcharge or exit fee to cover their fair share of
the state's power purchase costs and perhaps other expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Jeff Brown, who sponsored the measure, said the
amount of the fees would be determined later, but would fully protect
homeowners and other small and medium-sized ratepayers.</LD>
<TE>   But consumer groups expressed fear that other utility customers
would end up bearing the cost of the exodus of big customers last
year. And PUC President Loretta M. Lynch, who was on the losing side
of the vote, said she is skeptical that fair exit fees ever will be
established.</TE>
<TE>   "We are holding out a hope and prayer of exit fees," she said
after the meeting. "I am concerned that the direct-access customers
won't pay what they should."</TE>
<TE>   Decision Called Crucial to Public Institutions</TE>
<TE>   The vote capped months of debate and lobbying by powerful special
interests that entered into alternative power contracts in droves to
insulate themselves from record utility rate increases. The customers
range from industrial and commercial users to the state's university
systems and the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "This [PUC decision] was critical to the public institutions,"
said Dian Grueneich, who represents the University of California and
the California State University, which save an estimated $10 million
a year through direct access. "Those millions mean more with the
budget crunch they are undergoing."</TE>
<TE>   Direct access was a cornerstone of the state's controversial
deregulation of wholesale energy markets. The number of direct-access
customers rocketed last year--from about 2% to 12% of the state's
power load--in anticipation of the PUC's vote to suspend the program.
But that also heightened fears that a shrinking pool of utility
customers would be left to pay for billions of dollars in power
purchased by the state Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC voted on Sept. 20 to immediately suspend direct
access--one of several steps state officials sought to facilitate the
sale of bonds to pay for power costs.</TE>
<TE>   A proposed decision by Commissioner Carl Wood would have made that
suspension retroactive to July 1. But the measure set off protests
from direct-access customers, who said that voiding contracts would
cost them millions of dollars, cause litigation and harm the state's
business climate.</TE>
<TE>   Brown proposed an alternate decision that would not roll back the
direct-access contracts but would provide for exit fees. It was
backed by not only the direct-access lobby, but also the PUC's
consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources,
said the agency supported it as "a fair and equitable way to repay
debt we absorbed in 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Fight Shaping Up Over Amount of 'Exit Fees'</TE>
<TE>   Lynch tried to block the vote, noting that three Democratic state
senators-- President Pro Tempore John Burton, Energy Committee
Chairwoman Debra Bowen and Environmental Committee Chairman Byron
Sher--had requested a delay. But she and Wood lost their bid for a
delay, which usually is granted as professional courtesy.</TE>
<TE>   Brown teamed up with the only Republican on the panel, Henry
Duque, and with Michael Peevey, Gov. Gray Davis' most recent PUC
appointee and a former head of utility and energy companies. The trio
defeated Wood's measure and approved Brown's.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that Davis is creating a commission to do the bidding
of big business," said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility
Reform Network consumer group. "The same fat cats who were lobbying
for direct access now will be lobbying for exit fees. The question
is: Is this commission willing to stand up to their lobbying?"</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ackerman, director of Western Power Trading Forum, which
represents power providers, said a fight already is shaping up over
the size of the exit fees and what costs to include in the
calculation. "Obviously those who don't want direct access will make
them as high as possible," Ackerman said.</TE>
<TE>   PUC officials acknowledged that they do not yet know exactly how
much of a burden was shifted from the direct-access customers to
other utility ratepayers. "It will be a hard task to discern those
costs," said Brown, who noted that the cost shift would be $340
million a year for state-purchased power alone.</TE>
<TE>   Wood estimated that the cost shift amounted to nearly $3 billion
last year, about two-thirds for electricity purchases by the Water
Resources Department.</TE>
<TE>   The decision allows direct-access customers to renew contracts or
switch providers, and that is particularly important to the state
university systems as well as to other customers of Enron, which is
in bankruptcy. Contracts for the state universities expire March 31.</TE>
<TE>   David Huard--who represents Los Angeles Unified School District,
Del Taco, Lowes Warehouse and the city of Corona--said, "If the exit
fee is so large that it does not make direct-access contracts
economic, they could be forced back onto bundled utility service."
Lynch said that if direct-access customers come flocking back, it
will make the power demand at utilities unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision will make it more difficult to get the utilities
back in the power-buying business and the state out of it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said that if fair fees cannot be established, he would
support suspension of all contracts signed after July 1.</TE>

<LD>In two separate stories, a young street racer who wants to soup up
his import but can't afford the parts allegedly is led into a world
of crime by a parts dealer.</LD>
<LD>   One story was the plot of last year's movie "The Fast and the
Furious." The other is the outline of a case in which prosecutors
allege an auto parts store owner in Canoga Park lured young street
racers into credit card theft.</LD>
<LD>   The case brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and
scheduled to go before a federal grand jury next week alleges that
Maneli Pourkhani, 28, co-owner of Dynamic Design, enlisted young
customers to use stolen card numbers to help him buy computer
equipment.</LD>
<TE>   Pourkhani, charged last week with credit card theft, was released
on $75,000 bond and placed under a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged, but not arrested, were Gilberto Carrillo, 21, of
Reseda, and Jimmy Pezzulo, 22, and Scott Needham, 22, both of
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   An affidavit from a Secret Service special agent, which provides
the basis for the federal charges, states that Carrillo, a waiter at
the Market Broiler restaurant in Tarzana, stole numbers from 18
customer credit cards between November and last month.</TE>
<TE>   The cards were later used, the affidavit states, to buy laptop
computers and other electronics from Best Buy stores in Thousand Oaks
and Woodland Hills, where Pezzulo and Needham worked.</TE>
<TE>   The three men allegedly told Secret Service investigators that
they were recruited by Pourkhani--known on the street as "Money
Levin," according to the affidavit--when they bought pricey wheels
and other equipment from him.</TE>
<TE>   Stolen credit card numbers in a notebook seized at Dynamic Design
were used to buy $250,000 in goods, the affidavit states.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the amount of money involved but the similarity to "The
Fast and the Furious" plot that struck the prosecutor, Assistant U.S.
Atty. Chris Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "That movie looked at the underground street-racing cult," said
Johnson, who normally prosecutes computer hackers but chose this
case. "Racing takes high-value items not easily within the means of
most of the younger generation of 18- to 25-year-olds. The movie
involved the owner of this high-performance auto store, just like
Pourkhani."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said others in the San Fernando Valley's street-racing
scene may be involved, but he would not say how widespread credit
card theft in the street-racing community might be.</TE>
<TE>   A study of computers seized from Dynamic Design could lead
investigators to other racers, he said. A search of the store and
Pourkhani's car yielded more than 500 stolen card numbers and a
.45-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Pourkhani refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemarie Kitchin, spokeswoman for the Specialty Equipment Market
Assn., said retailers know their products are a bit expensive for
their customers, 72% of whom are between 16 and 25 years old. But
most customers live with their parents and use their earnings for
amping up their cars.</TE>
<TE>   That one person is charged with preying "on gullible young
people's desire to have the best car on the block or in the school
parking lot does not make it typical of the industry," Kitchin said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first case like this that I have ever heard other
than 'The Fast and the Furious,' but that's just a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Since the movie's release, the $1.5-billion industry has
experienced a record-high product demand, Kitchin said.</TE>

<HD>Mall Gunmen Take $250,000 in Jewelry</HD>
<DH>Crime: Detectives search for three suspects who stole
$250,000 in jewelry from a store in The Oaks.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Detectives searched Thursday for three gunmen who stormed into a
Thousand Oaks jewelry store, smashed a display case with hammers and
escaped with $250,000 worth of jewelry as shoppers throughout The
Oaks mall ran for cover.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover-style robbery occurred about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at
Ben Bridge Jeweler as dozens of shoppers strolled or ate dinner at a
restaurant across from the store.</LD>
<LD>   The robbers burst into the jewelry store brandishing guns and
ordering two employees to lie on the floor, authorities said. They
then shattered a glass case near the mall's main entrance.</LD>
<TE>   The sound of the breaking glass echoed throughout the large
two-story mall, panicking merchants and shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to get a pair of shoes from the back, and then suddenly I
heard what I thought were shots, and then someone screamed 'Get
down!'" said Danielle Beebe, manager of the Easy Spirit shoe store.</TE>
<TE>   Beebe said a customer screamed and the two of them ran into the
back storage room. The shoe store is across the pedestrian walkway
from the jewelry store.</TE>
<TE>   No shots were fired, and no one was injured.</TE>
<TE>   The robbers fled in a stolen car, which they abandoned in a ditch
less than a quarter of a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen sheriff's deputies surrounded the mall, using dogs and a
helicopter. California Highway Patrol officers briefly shut down a
portion of the adjacent Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are investigating whether the gunmen are part of an
organized group targeting jewelry stores across the Southland,
according to an alert given to merchants by mall security officials.</TE>
<TE>   The robbery is believed to be the first at the Hillcrest Drive
shopping center in at least a decade, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to people at the scene who were absolutely amazed," said
Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Keith Parks. "You don't usually see
something like this here." Authorities believe the robbers probably
fled in a second vehicle parked elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unfortunate," Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry said. "We
are considered one of the safest cities in the United States."</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Plan to File New Charges in Slaying of Student</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors intend to file a new criminal complaint
today charging 31-year-old Vincent Sanchez with murder, kidnapping
and related charges in the July slaying of Moorpark College student
Megan Barroso.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, a Simi Valley handyman, has admitted raping seven women
and assaulting three others during a five-year span. But he has
denied killing Barroso during a kidnapping and rape attempt, as
prosecutors allege.</LD>
<LD>   A grand jury indicted Sanchez last fall on those charges, as well
as attempted rape and assault counts involving four other women. But
the indictment was dismissed earlier this month after a Santa Barbara
judge, Frank Ochoa, ruled that the grand jury included too many men.</LD>
<TE>   After reviewing the ruling in the Sanchez case, prosecutors
announced Thursday they will file a criminal complaint charging
Sanchez with the same counts and allegations set aside by Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   The case is expected to proceed to a preliminary hearing. An
arraignment is set for this afternoon in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also announced they will continue to seek the death
penalty. They contend Sanchez shot at Barroso's car as she drove home
from a Fourth of July party, dragged her from the vehicle and at some
point tried to rape her. Barroso's body was found Aug. 4 at the
bottom of a steep ravine near Simi Valley.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Downtown's ''Welcome to River Street'' sign is back on EBay.</LD>
<LD>   The sign was erected as part of a beautification project designed
to draw attention to River Street, along with a widened road, and
yellow street lights to match the sign. But the council got hundreds
of e-mails, phone messages and letters ridiculing the sign.</LD>
<LD>   The giant blue and yellow sign, erected and built by the city for
$83,000, was on EBay before, but by the time the auction closed it
had a top bid of $6,669.</LD>
<TE>   The minimum bid was set at $5,000 with bidding set in $100
increments.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ed Porter said he expected much more, so the sign
reappeared Friday on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The starting bid is now $7,000 with bidding set to end Monday.</TE>

<LD>A cattle ranch and its owner were ordered to pay $1 million for water
pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Masami Ishida, 70, is accused of discharging manure waste water
from feedlots and retaining ponds at Masami Cattle Ranch into local
creeks. The creeks feed into the Sacramento River.</LD>
<LD>   Ishida was also sentenced to six months' home detention as part of
one year's probation for violating the federal Clean Water Act,
attorney John Vincent said.</LD>
<TE>   Ranch foreman Manuel Madera Noriega, 46, received two years'
probation and was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Masami Cattle Ranch, west of Corning, is part of an enterprise
that includes MCR; Masami Foods, a slaughterhouse and meatpacking
plant; and Marusho Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, a wholesaler and

<LD>The county grand jury has recommended that a sobering center be
placed near UC Santa Barbara for drunk young adults as an alternative
to sending them to County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-member panel said a sobering center in the Isla Vista

have to take offenders to jail.</LD>

<HD>3 Firms May Face Fines for Postings</HD>

<LD>Three advertising firms could face up to $1,000 in fines after Los
Angeles prosecutors charged them with illegally posting signs and
fliers on lamp and utility posts in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   While a prosecutor said the action will force ad firms to take
notice, one of the defendants ridiculed the crackdown.</LD>
<LD>   "These guys filing the charges should get a life," said Kirk
Briggs, whose ad company was charged.</LD>
<TE>   "Do you know how many signs go up for a political campaign?" he
asked. "One in a million signs may accidentally go on a city
lamppost."</TE>
<TE>   The charges were filed in response to complaints by community
groups, which are often associated with nonprofit graffiti-removal
and neighborhood-watch organizations, said Frank Mateljan, spokesman
for the Los Angeles city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Ad hoc patrol groups are seeking out the signs, tearing them down
and reporting them to authorities, Mateljan said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Rick Schmidt said illegal signs are more
often dealt with by billing companies or individuals for the city's
cost of removing the signs.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt said he took legal action because "criminal charges are a
better deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Marketplace Productions Inc., Kirk Briggs Signs Inc. and Kirk
David Briggs of Oakdale, Calif., were each charged with seven counts
of illegally posting signs on city property and three counts of
failing to comply with orders to remove the signs, which are civil
charges.</TE>
<TE>   They are also charged with seven counts of illegally posting signs
on public property, a criminal charge.</TE>
<TE>   Several individuals also face charges.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Anthony Parisi of Dana Point was charged with 14 counts of
illegally posting signs on city property. Richard Steven Natelson of
Moorpark was charged with two counts of illegally posting signs on
city property and one count of failing to comply with removal orders.
Paul Sigler and his company, Siggy Signs Inc., were charged with
eight counts of illegally posting signs on city property</TE>

<HD>New Kidnapping May Help Solve Old One</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A composite sketch of a man who kidnapped two girls in Denver is so
similar to one rendered in the case of a boy abducted and killed five
years ago in Riverside County that investigators are looking for any
connections in the cases.</LD>
<LD>   The naked body of 10-year-old Anthony Martinez was found in a
ravine April 19, 1997, two weeks after a man kidnapped him at
knifepoint near his home in Beaumont, which is 80 miles east of Los
Angeles. Anthony's abduction and death launched a massive search,
drew a grieving Beaumont closer, sparked thousands of tips and led to
a widely circulated sketch of a suspected sexual predator.</LD>
<LD>   However, over time, detectives had exhausted their leads, said
Riverside Sheriff's Sgt. Shelley Kennedy-Smith.</LD>
<TE>   The abduction Feb. 26 of two Denver girls, a 5-year-old and her
8-year-old sister, may yield new clues to Anthony's killing, said
Riverside authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The girls were kidnapped as they walked home from an elementary
school. They were given alcohol and driven to a motel or apartment in
northeast Denver and released later that day, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not say whether the two girls were sexually
assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County and Denver authorities said both their suspects
bear striking similarities.</TE>
<TE>   They are described as white men with blue eyes, brown hair,
mustaches and baseball caps, said Denver Police Det. John White.
Authorities in both locations also said the kidnappers used similar
tactics to lure their victims: In the Denver case, the kidnapper
asked for help finding his lost puppy; in Beaumont, he asked for help
finding a cat.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Denver and Riverside County cautioned that the two
incidents could be unrelated, noting some differences in the
descriptions. For instance, the Denver kidnapper is reported to be
several inches taller.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of leads, we're excited. This is definitely a very good
lead that the case has not received in a long time," Kennedy-Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony's parents, who now live in Banning, said they are
heartened by the possibility that the Denver case will solve their
son's murder.</TE>
<TE>   "When we saw the composites, we were shocked by the similarities,"
said Ernesto Medina, 33, Anthony's stepfather. "We thought, 'Maybe
this is the break we've been looking for.' ... We think someone out
there knows something. We need that person to come forward to get
this guy off the street so that he doesn't hurt another child, or
hurt another family the way he hurt ours."</TE>

<HD>A Lesson in Freedom</HD>
<DH>Education: Students at a Jewish high school raise money to
free 100 Sudanese slaves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Students at Milken Community High School in the Santa Monica
Mountains say they are applying lessons from ancient history to ease
the suffering of modern-day slaves.</LD>
<LD>   The seventh- and eighth-graders have raised more than $5,000,
surpassing their goal of raising enough to buy the freedom of 100
Sudanese people enslaved as a result of war.</LD>
<LD>   All 260 middle-schoolers read stories in their Jewish Studies
class about the plight of 27 million Sudanese because of fighting
between northern and southern tribes. They also learned about the
Torah's directives on redemption of captives. Speakers, including a
former Sudanese slave, shared their experiences.</LD>
<TE>   Today, five days before Passover, which commemorates the Jews'
exodus from slavery in Egypt, the school is holding a rally and
teach-in. Sonia Levitin, the author of "Dream Freedom," a novel about
the plight of Sudanese slaves, will speak. Other workshops will
discuss personal freedom and slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The students said the experience has put a living face on a story
they have heard for years.</TE>
<TE>   "As Jews we're supposed to know what it means to be slaves, more
than other religions," said Allison, a seventh-grader. (School
authorities allowed students to be interviewed on the condition their
last names not be published because of privacy concerns.) But after
hearing these accounts, "you get chills down your spine because you
don't want to believe it."</TE>
<TE>   And many people don't.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Washington Post and the Irish Times published
articles saying that the practice of buying the freedom of Sudanese
slaves was corrupt and that slave redemption had become a lucrative
business.</TE>
<TE>   The Post article said mothers of stolen children could no longer
afford to buy them back because reclamation efforts fueled by
contributions from sympathetic Westerners had driven up prices.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim groups also have challenged anti-slavery organizations.
They believe that American and European Christian groups that support
the rebel southern Sudan tribes are using the slavery claims to cast
Sudan's Muslim government in a negative light. Hassam Ayloush,
executive director of the Center for Islamic-American Relations'
Southern California chapter, said taking prisoners of war is part of
the culture and that captives are forced to work until their
relatives can pay a ransom for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Tribes of all religious backgrounds are guilty of this inhumane
practice," Ayloush said.</TE>
<TE>   Milken school rabbi and Jewish studies department head Leah Kroll,
who developed the project, said, "I think there needs to be a
political solution to the problem," but "that doesn't mean in the
meantime we can't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   To raise money, brightly painted 5-gallon water jugs were placed
in every classroom at the middle school campus--even next to the soda
machine, so students could deposit their change, Kroll said. A
dance-a-thon was held Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Some students canvassed their neighborhoods and donated blank
checks to charity that were given to them at bar or bat mitzvahs,
Kroll said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we might not make the whole difference, we're
contributing," said Loren, a seventh-grader, as he dyed a leather
bracelet red in his Jewish studies class.</TE>
<TE>   The bracelets will be stamped with the name, gender and country of
a slave, similar to POW-MIA bracelets people wore during and after
the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're thinking of [slaves] as individuals it's easier to
understand," Kroll said.</TE>
<TE>   If 100 people were freed, "that could be half this school," Loren
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dream Freedom project is part of the school's commitment to a
"desert experience" during the Passover season.</TE>
<TE>   Every other year the Jewish studies department tries to make the
celebration meaningful by tying it to children's lives. Kroll once
brought students to the desert to reenact the Israelites' 40 years of
wandering.</TE>
<TE>   The Dream Freedom project is a particularly good fit because the
Passover meal recalls the suffering of the enslaved Israelites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really important because we were enslaved and we had our
Exodus, so we should give them their exodus," said Ezra, an
eighth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   The students also saw parallels between this situation and more
recent Jewish history.</TE>
<TE>   "During the Holocaust, for all those years, no one was trying to
help," Loren said.</TE>

<HD>Cyber Stalker Sentenced to Jail, Probation</HD>
<DH>Court: Simi Valley woman pleaded guilty to using Internet
to distribute explicit photos of ex-lover. Prosecutor calls it 'an
old crime committed in a new way.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Las Vegas topless dancer who admitted stalking her ex-lover
by posting sexually explicit photos of the married man on the
Internet was placed on five years' probation Thursday and ordered to
serve 210 days in the Ventura County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   Robin Kelly, a 43-year-old Simi Valley resident who performed
under the name "Ruby Tuesday," has served most of the jail sentence
and is expected to be released in about two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly pleaded guilty last month to felony stalking, attempted
extortion and a misdemeanor count of witness intimidation for
harassing her former lover after he ended their seven-year affair in
April 2000.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to the sentencing judge, Kelly described herself as a
single mother struggling to make ends meet. She apologized for her
conduct but added, "I did not know my actions would be deemed
criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Her cyber-stalking case is believed to be the first of its kind in
Ventura County because electronic communications have only recently
been added to California stalking laws.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is really sort of an example of an old crime committed
in a new way," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Temple of the district
attorney's computer crime unit.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly met Jim Day, a 52-year-old editorial cartoonist for the Las
Vegas Review-Journal, at a nightclub where she worked, and the two
began a sexual relationship.</TE>
<TE>   When Day attempted to break off the affair, Kelly began to harass
the man and his family, according to police. For months, she made
annoying phone calls and sent threatening letters and e-mail to his
home and office.</TE>
<TE>   She allegedly left white envelopes containing sexually explicit
photos of him scattered around his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, she later set up a Web site that
featured photographs of their sexual trysts as well as a map with
directions to Day's Las Vegas home. Postcards advertising the site
were mailed to Day's family, neighbors and co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was arrested in November and the Web site was taken down by
court order.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly told authorities that her actions came out of heartbreak and
confusion. She repeatedly stated that she only wanted an apology from
Day and never intended to harm him or his family.</TE>
<TE>   But in a letter to the judge, Day recounted the harassment and
humiliation he and his family endured for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Harm was intended. Harm was planned. Harm was done," he wrote.
"The thing I seek, the thing I believe must be done, is that I and my
family be left alone."</TE>
<TE>   Day went on to describe his fear of Kelly. "I too will pay a
penalty beyond the consequences of my infidelity. I have been
sentenced to a term of looking over my shoulder, watching my back,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who once performed as a professional wrestler, sat
passively during most of her sentencing hearing Thursday but became
animated when the prosecutor requested that she be prohibited from
using a computer or the Internet while on probation.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Bruce Clark ordered the computer and Internet
ban, though he said he might reconsider at a later date. Kelly is
also prohibited from contacting Day or his family.</TE>

<HD>Cypress High Teacher Accused of Sex With Teen</HD>
<DH>Crime: The former soccer coach is arrested after a
16-year-old girl alleges a yearlong relationship. He is released on
$50,000 bail.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cypress High School teacher has been arrested on suspicion of
having sex with a student, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested David King, 30, at his Huntington Beach home
Wednesday night after a 16-year-old girl whom King once coached in
soccer told police that she and the teacher had had a yearlong
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   "She said she felt so bad that she just had to tell us about what
happened," said Lt. Mike Idom, a spokesman for the Cypress Police
Department. "She was feeling so guilty that she came in with her
mother."</LD>
<TE>   Officers searched King's home and found evidence to support the
girl's allegation, Idom said. "The victim was here at 5 p.m., and we
had the guy in custody at 10 p.m.," he said. "You can tell that this
is important to us."</TE>
<TE>   King, who teaches special education at the school, was booked at
Cypress City Jail on suspicion of unlawful sexual intercourse with a
minor. He was released after posting $50,000 bail. Arraignment was
set for May 1.</TE>
<TE>   The student told investigators that the relationship began when
she was on the high school soccer team, which King coached until last
year when he was appointed head coach for the women's soccer team at
Cypress College. He continued to teach full time at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   According to the girl's account, the two met weekly at King's home
and in his car. Idom said it is unclear when their alleged
relationship ended. She has since transferred to another school, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress High Principal Norman Fried, who learned of the
allegations Thursday morning, said King was immediately suspended
with pay pending the outcome of the case.</TE>
<TE>   King has worked at the high school for four years, Fried said.
"He's an excellent teacher and an excellent coach," he said.</TE>

<HD>Police Take Calls With Possible Tips in Crash Killing 3</HD>
<DH>Investigation: With accused drunk driver of other car
still in critical condition, young victims are remembered as close,
fun-loving friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA and MATTHEW EBNET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three teenagers were killed by an allegedly drunk driver at a
Huntington Beach intersection, police are taking extraordinary steps
to piece together what happened.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night they sent officers to the scene of the accident,
at Beach Boulevard and Edinger Avenue, to pass out fliers in the hope
of finding witnesses. All day Thursday they fielded calls from people
who thought they might have seen something significant.</LD>
<LD>   "This accident killed three people," said Lt. Lloyd Edwards, a
spokesman for the Huntington Beach Police Department. "The more
witnesses you have, the better the case."</LD>
<TE>   Investigators also examined the vehicles involved to determine the
speed and dynamics of the crash, which happened at 11:59 p.m.
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   James Paul Bell, 27, of Rowland Heights is suspected of running a
red light and broadsiding the car with three young women coming home
from a coffee shop. Jillian Baedeker, 19, and Nancy Le, 18, died at
the scene. Chelsea Toma, 19, died hours later at UCI Medical Center
in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Bell's car struck a second car in the intersection,
slightly injuring its two occupants.</TE>
<TE>   Bell, who was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving, was in
critical condition Thursday at UCI Medical Center. Police will try to
determine why he was driving fast and erratically.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if he was chasing somebody," said Officer Robert
Barr, a lead investigator in the case. "We don't know if he was at a
friend's house. We're trying to find all of this out."</TE>
<TE>   Bell could face other felony counts, including murder, if
investigators find that he was not only drunk but deliberately
driving recklessly, Barr said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles and
Huntington Beach Police, Bell had two recent traffic citations,
neither involving alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Barr said the case is wrenching for investigators. "When it
happens like this, when they are so young, it really affects you."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said the three young women, all from Huntington Beach,
were best friends who graduated last year from Marina High School.
The three were inseparable--they shopped, went to the beach, drank
coffee together. Each brought special qualities to the group, friends
said.</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker was described as the happy one--upbeat, always smiling,
kind to everyone. Her dream was to work with children. She was taking
courses at Golden West and Orange Coast colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Toma, who also went to OCC, was the witty one, quick with
one-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "She could make you laugh for hours," said Meredith Flores, 18, a
friend of the three since high school.</TE>
<TE>   And Le had the style--she loved shopping for clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd just had extensions done in her hair, and she was really
excited about it," said Flores, who had spent Tuesday afternoon with
Le and Baedeker. "They looked really good."</TE>
<TE>   On their last day, the three friends spent the day sipping coffee,
sunning at the beach and making plans for spring break--they loved
taking trips.</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker had just returned from Las Vegas, said her sister, Emily,
23. "We only had about another day with her, and then this."</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Baedeker is set for 7 p.m. Sunday at St.
Bonaventure Catholic Church, 16400 Springdale Ave., Huntington Beach,
with funeral services at 11 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Le will be memorialized Sunday from 12 to 4 p.m. at Heritage
Memorial Services funeral home at 17712 Beach Blvd., Huntington
Beach. Funeral services will be at 10:30 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Family friends said funeral arrangements for Toma are pending.</TE>

<HD>5 Southland Victims, 1 Northern Watery Grave</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three came from Russia and had ties to Hollywood.
Another, a devout Jew, was a developer; the fifth ran a thriving
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND and RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The five victims whose bodies were pulled from a distant lake came
from different worlds. Three Russian immigrants with ties to
Hollywood. A Sherman Oaks developer with deep religious beliefs. A
North Hollywood business owner.</LD>
<LD>   George Safiev had made his money in banking in Russia, family
associates said. He was 38, and a partner in a new film company
called Matador Media.</LD>
<LD>   One of his partners and best friends was Nick Kharabadze. He was
29 and a charmer who had cultivated important Hollywood friendships.</LD>
<TE>   Rita Pekler, 39, kept the books for Matador. She was known as
somebody with connections in the Russian community. And somebody who
wanted to make it big.</TE>
<TE>   Pekler disappeared Dec. 5. Safiev and Kharabadze vanished six
weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Months earlier, Sherman Oaks real estate developer Myer Muscatel,
58, had disappeared. The father of two children, Muscatel was a
devout Jew who worked closely with disadvantaged children. His body
was pulled from the Calaveras County lake Oct. 18, the first of the
victims to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Alexander Umansky, 35, a North Hollywood
businessman who disappeared Dec. 13. Later there would be ransom
demands, and they would be met. But his body also was added to the
lake.</TE>
<TE>   Missing a Script Meeting</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of dwindling hope, Mat Shatz got a call from the FBI
on Wednesday night informing him that one of the bodies found in New
Melones Lake was that of his stepson Nick Kharabadze.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, Shatz, a native of St. Petersburg, sat at a
backyard table at his Woodland Hills home as he told the story of
Nick's disappearance. Inside the house, there were cries from his
grieving wife, Rusiko Kiknadze, 56, Kharabadze's mother and a famous
model and actress in her native Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The day he vanished, Shatz said, Kharabadze missed a script
meeting with him and an appointment with a film executive at 20th
Century Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Shatz became worried the next morning when he saw that Nick's BMW
740 was not in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   For four days after that, he and others received strange phone
calls from Nick, who said he was in Las Vegas and needed money.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the serial kidnap-slayings reverberated through the
Hollywood community Thursday, where Safiev and Kharabadze already had
made an impression as would-be producers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been aware of the kidnapping for some time and think it's
an abomination," said director Ronald Shelton, a friend of both men.
He said Kharabadze was like a younger brother to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick had a very bright future."</TE>
<TE>   Kharabadze had taken John Malkovich and Dolph Lungren on a trip to
Moscow to introduce them to the Russian film industry.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev and Kharabadze also were planning a lavish, weeklong
birthday party in Jamaica for a Russian friend, featuring rock bands
KISS and the Scorpions.</TE>
<TE>   After they disappeared, Olga Preiss and Victoria Pevan of Matador
Media made sure the party took place. "We wanted to be able to say we
kept things going," Preiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "They loved the life they were leading," said another friend.</TE>
<TE>   Living for His Family</TE>
<TE>   George Safiev had passports from Russia, the United Kingdom and
Greece, said Preiss, who works at his production office.</TE>
<TE>   She and others described him as a self-made man who traveled the
world on business and lived for his family--a wife, a teenage
daughter and a 4-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   When he decided to make a run at Hollywood--with Nick Kharabadze
as his guide--Safiev bought a $2.5-million house in Beverly Hills and
began taking meetings with Nick's Tinseltown contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev spoke very little English. Nick did the translating.</TE>
<TE>   They were supposed to go into pre-production for a love story film
in March, co-workers said.</TE>
<TE>   Making Money Helping Immigrants</TE>
<TE>   Safiev hired Rita Pekler about a year ago. She had moved to the
United States from St. Petersburg in 1979 and was well-known in
Russian L.A. Her bookkeeping business was called the Pekler Group.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Pekler was smart, attractive and a shrewd
businesswoman. She was married and had a 5-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   One law enforcement source said she also had a reputation of
always looking for ways to make money, including by helping
immigrants with visa problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The kidnappers could have grabbed her first, thinking it would be
a way to get to Safiev," the source speculated.</TE>
<TE>   "But if that was the case, it didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Catching Attention of Kidnappers</TE>
<TE>   Alex Umansky started his Hard Wired Auto Accessories business in
1989, incorporating it in 1998 as Advanced Mobile Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The small North Hollywood company grew by 200% in the last three
years and reported annual sales of $1.2 million in 2001, according to
Dun and Bradstreet.</TE>
<TE>   Umansky installed televisions and entertainment systems in
high-end cars, vans and sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   One of the alleged kidnappers, Petro Krylov, had worked for him
and was fired. Umansky's shop manager, Todd Provencio, said he
worries that the business' perceived success caught the kidnappers'
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so scary to me that something like this could happen to such
a good person," Provencio said. "I know he wasn't involved in
anything bad."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the Authorities</TE>
<TE>   Myer Muscatel hitchhiked from New York City to Los Angeles as a
teenager and worked numerous sales jobs to support himself as a young
man before launching his own real estate development business, his
daughter Rachel Muscatel said.</TE>
<TE>   Muscatel married and moved to the San Fernando Valley shortly
after his first wife gave birth to Rachel and her twin brother, Eric.</TE>
<TE>   He remarried recently and is also survived by his widow, Nancy
Shapiro Muscatel, and her two children.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service was held for him Sunday, his daughter said. He
prayed daily and observed the Sabbath and sacred holidays.</TE>
<TE>   His widow stressed her family's frustration with the response by
authorities to his disappearance, criticizing the time it took for
authorities to identify his remains.</TE>
<TE>   "I was haunted by it on a daily basis," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my husband was harmed, but I never felt this case was
being worked aggressively enough."</TE>

<HD>Authorities Say Robbery Suspect Impersonated a Police
Officer</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks deputies are seeking an arrest warrant for a man they
say impersonated a police officer and robbed at least two people of
their wallets.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect is an Italian national identified as Salvatore
Russarollo, 26. He is in custody in Sacramento for alleged
immigration violations. Thousand Oaks authorities hope to arrest him
on suspicion of grand theft and impersonating a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies said a man drove up to Efrain Gonzalezz and Gabriel
Hernandez, both of Thousand Oaks, at the Janss Market Place last
month and flashed a credential identifying him as a police officer.
Deputies said he demanded to see identification. When the men opened
their wallets, he took them and drove off.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies said he got away with $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Detective Pete O'Sullivan said the suspect may be part of an
Italian ring that has robbed people around the state. Police in San
Jose and San Mateo want to talk to Russarollo about similar crimes.</TE>

<HD>Youths Discover a Taste for Art</HD>
<DH>Education: Project teaches students about Los Angeles. 'The
reality is different from what you see on the news,' one says.</DH>

<LD>Proving to teenagers that there is more to Los Angeles than meets the
eye is as simple as connecting the dots, an art group showed
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of continuation high school students teamed up with
professional artists to depict the city in a series of exhibits
unveiled at a downtown landmark--Grand Central Market.</LD>
<LD>   One group of San Fernando Valley youngsters used pointillism and
picnic plates to map a community that they are learning extends well
beyond their own neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   "Our city looks good. The reality is different from what you see
on the news," said Fernando Ponce, 17, of Van Nuys. "On TV, the city
looks like a very sad place. But it really isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Ponce and pupils from continuation schools in Panorama City and
Van Nuys created a 10-foot map of Los Angeles using thousands of dots
to outline the city, its mountains and coastal areas and its network
of connecting roadways and transit routes. The small, colored dots
were made by rubber stamps carved from gum erasers.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapped around the map was a web of plastic picnic plates strung
together and draped over a vacant Grand Central Market food stand
commandeered for the students' exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The 85-year-old market was picked for the weeklong exhibition
because of its historic role as Los Angeles' oldest open-air shopping
spot, said Cynthia Campoy Brophy, director of the HeArt Project.</TE>
<TE>   It is a nonprofit program that for 10 years has conducted free
arts workshops at Los Angeles continuation schools.</TE>
<TE>   Those campuses offer classroom instruction for teenagers who might
otherwise drop out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   Brophy's program operates on a $300,000-a-year budget financed by
grants and fund-raisers. Settings for students' previous work have
included art galleries, museums and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Continuation students from Echo Park, Atwater Village, downtown
Los Angeles and North Hollywood produced exhibits Wednesday on the
Ambassador Hotel, the historic downtown district and youngsters'
vision of a futuristic Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the shoppers who filled the market's sawdust-covered
floors paused to study the work.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry and school district Board
of Education member Jose Huizar praised the teenagers. "Your view of
the community gives us all strength," Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica contemporary painter Carla Danes was one of the
professionals recruited by Brophy to help with the project.</TE>
<TE>   It was Danes who had the Valley students pile onto the Red Line
subway to explore the city before creating their dot map.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time most of us had ever been on a train," said
Jose Gomez, 17, of Van Nuys. "L.A.'s bigger than I thought it was."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Truong, 16, also of Van Nuys, said the exercise was an
eye-opener on a smaller scale too, thanks to Danes and the
dot-making.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what this was going to look like. But she kept
telling us that we're not making a map, we're making art. She was
right."</TE>

<AU>BRADLEY BURSTON</AU>
<BD>Bradley Burston is the news editor of the
English-language Internet site of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.</BD>
<DL>NATAF, Israel</DL>
<LD>We buried the neighbor boy last week.</LD>
<LD>   He went away to war to keep the war from coming home to his
family. He went to war barely a month ago, and now his family, which
made it a practice to be humane and loving, is shattered.</LD>
<LD>   The cemetery in this village faces a handsome ridge of hills, the
invisible, inescapable border of the West Bank. The villagers,
Israelis, were in favor of that ridge being part of an independent
Palestine. They believed that the villagers on the other side
deserved respect, friendship, a state of their own. They believed in
peace.</LD>
<TE>   Now they do not know what to believe.</TE>
<TE>   The war was just days old, on Yom Kippur 2000, when a Palestinian
arsonist came over to this side to try to burn the people out. Later,
a Palestinian gunman came over to the only road to this village to
ambush unarmed drivers of unarmored cars.</TE>
<TE>   Now this. He was only 21. A life, his entire future, lowered by
ropes to the floor of a new grave. There have been hundreds and
hundreds of these on both sides. All of it for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians could have had their independence without a
fight. Israelis could have had security without a war. But there
wasn't enough time, or trust, to make peace work.</TE>
<TE>   Now a war is being fought because no one on either side can fathom
how to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   The war seems already to have gone on forever. The Holy Land is an
altogether different place now. Before, a critical mass of
Palestinians and Israelis agreed that the peace process, though
troubled, was irreversible. The demons of extremism and resistance to
accommodation seemed to have been finally laid to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Then the war broke out, and every last demon was let loose.
Militants on both sides fostered the notion that the other side could
be eliminated. Each side soon declared that the only language the
other understood was the language of force. But the war has achieved
none of the goals of either side, in part because the language of
force is a language of lies.</TE>
<TE>   The language of force tells well-meaning people that acts of
vengeance are actually self-defense. That the killing of innocents is
the price of a war that both sides insist was forced on them. That
the bone-deep humiliation felt by Palestinians and the bone-deep fear
felt by Israelis can be redressed by more force. That either side can
be bludgeoned into giving up its dreams.</TE>
<TE>   But as more and more villagers take the walk to bury the neighbor
boy or the old man killed crossing a street or the infant killed in
his mother's arms, the language of force begins to ring hollow.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing in this war for anyone. Still, there's a steep
price in ending it. Peace means the abandonment not only of the
language of force but of cherished pipe dreams that fuel war.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is this: Neither side will allow itself to disappear.
Neither will gain sole dominion over the land and its sacred sites.
Ultimately, many settlers will be forced to leave their homes, and
many refugees will be unable to return to theirs.</TE>
<TE>   It will not be a simple matter to leave behind a century-old,
religiously sanctioned belief in force. But if the events of the last
few weeks are any measure, it is better to mourn for the death of
pipe dreams than for the victims of a war that the language of force
has succeeded only in prolonging.</TE>

<HD>Price of Free Trade: Famine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC EDELMAN</AU>
<BD>Marc Edelman, a professor of anthropology at Hunter
College and the CUNY Graduate Center, is author of "Peasants Against
Globalization" (Stanford University Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Central America is in the grip of famine, and if President Bush
mentions it when he visits El Salvador on Sunday, he will likely
suggest that free trade is the solution.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Bush's proposed Central American Free Trade Agreement is
hardly going to remedy the worsening disaster in rural Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Unregulated markets are a large
part of the reason why 700,000 Central Americans face starvation and
nearly 1million more suffer serious food shortages.</LD>
<LD>   Hardest hit are coffee plantation workers and maize farmers.
Coffee prices have spiraled downward since the 1989 collapse of the
International Coffee Agreement, which assigned countries production
quotas. In the past few years, prices plummeted further with a surge
in exports from Vietnam and Indonesia, where the World Bank
encouraged expansion of coffee acreage.</LD>
<TE>   With the market glutted, many coffee farmers did not bother to
harvest this year. The result has been evictions from plantation
housing, increased migration to teeming slums and severe hunger among
unemployed coffee workers.</TE>
<TE>   Maize farmers too have been feeling the free-market squeeze. Since
1992, Central America has had intra-regional free trade in grains and
almost no tariff protection against low-cost imports. Forced to
compete with highly subsidized U.S. farmers, many Central American
farmers have abandoned food production, gone bankrupt and lost their
land.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Central America's most conservative figures--Guatemalan
President Alfonso Portillo and Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo--acknowledge that the intensity and suddenness of the food
emergency make it a famine, worse than the hunger characteristic of
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Famine is always rooted in economic policies and political
decisions, as Amartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel Prize winner in economics,
has long maintained. Sen also points out that famines do not occur in
democracies, where contested elections and vigorous journalistic
oversight force policymakers to try to prevent occurrences that might
threaten constituents or allow opponents to make political hay.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policymakers should ask, then, what the widening famine says
about Central American democracy, for which Washington spent billions
of dollars and waged three proxy wars during the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the gap between rulers and ruled in the four affected
countries is so large that policymakers feel little pressure to
address the crisis. No wonder polls show that a mere 35% of
Hondurans, 24% of Nicaraguans, 21% of Salvadorans and 16% of
Guatemalans say they are "satisfied" with how democracy functions in
their countries.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, tens of thousands of Central Americans are heading
north. In contrast to the 1980s and early 1990s, most are not
escaping war and repression. Many are abandoning farms that failed
because of globalized trade and the dumping of U.S. grain. Others are
fleeing liberalized interest rates so high that they have no hope of
ever starting a small business. Still others are trying to escape
life in the free trade zones, where factory owners enjoy huge public
subsidies and workers face immense obstacles in organizing for a
living wage.</TE>
<TE>   Central American land could produce decent living standards for
small farmers if they could obtain small-scale irrigation systems,
better access to land, secure title to property, low-cost credit and
shelter from unfair competition and the ravages of global market
forces.</TE>
<TE>   These measures would give even the poorest of the poor a stake in
their societies, but they would require elites to take popular needs
seriously. Public sectors eviscerated by privatization and budget
cuts can't address the inequalities that globalization generates.</TE>
<TE>   Rural Central Americans are already reeling after a decade or more
of free-market reforms. President Bush's trade proposals could be the
knockout blow.</TE>

<HD>It's the Owners as Much as the Dogs That Need Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW MARGOLIS</AU>
<BD>Matthew Margolis is the co-author of "GRRR! The
Complete Guide to Understanding and Preventing Aggressive Behavior in
Dogs" (Little Brown &amp; Company, 2000). E-mail:
unclematty@unclematty.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So the jury found Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel responsible for
the dog-mauling death of Diane Whipple by the couple's Presa Canario
dogs. Do you think this verdict is going to make other owners of
aggressive dogs more responsible? Do you think that convicting these
dog owners will help cut down on the number of injuries and deaths
caused by aggressive dogs in the future?</LD>
<LD>   Not likely.</LD>
<LD>   For a few weeks, the trial and the outcome will receive the usual
commentary and public interest, but eventually we will stop
listening. Our minds will archive this murder trial and conviction,
just as we have almost forgotten the story about the baby who was
killed by the Pomeranian in Los Angeles a couple of years ago. And
dog owners will slip back into denial.</LD>
<TE>   Like their aggressive dogs, owners come in all shapes and sizes.
Some are caring and responsible. Others either don't think
realistically about their dogs or don't care about the safety and
well- being of other people, animals or even members of their own
families.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence during the trial suggested that Knoller and Noel were
uncaring. Testimony indicated that they did not pay attention to the
warning signs of their aggressive dogs. Records presented during the
trial indicated that at least 30 incidents of aggressive behavior
were attributed to the two large dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the owners did nothing about it.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel tried to deny the fact that the dogs were
dangerous. They tried to blame the victim. The jury didn't buy that.
Now the couple face the prospect of prison sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's death and the couple's punishment could have been
avoided if Knoller and Noel had taken simple steps. If, for example,
the two dogs had been wearing muzzles.</TE>
<TE>   Liability issues alone should make dog owners do something if
their dogs exhibit aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, that is not
the case. Look at the 5 million reported dog bites every year or the
800,000 emergency room visits caused by aggressive dogs. Consider
that one-fifth of the home insurance payoffs in the U.S. are dog
bite-related.</TE>
<TE>   I've been working with dogs for more than 30 years. They are my
life. Unfortunately I see way too many owners either in denial or
uncaring.</TE>
<TE>   If a dog growls, that's a warning sign. But owners will make
excuses. "He doesn't growl all the time," they will say. Or, "It
didn't break the skin." Or, "It's never happened before." Many of
these owners have infants or small children living in the same houses
as these four-legged time bombs. Yet an owner will say, "My dog is
protecting us."</TE>
<TE>   Aggression is not protection. Aggressive dogs are indiscriminate
and unpredictable. Owners of such dogs are as dangerous as the
animals themselves, perhaps more so. They fail to protect other
people from their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   So we put Knoller and Noel on trial. We found them guilty. We're
locking them up. We put to sleep their four-legged weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But will that solve the problem of death or injury by dog in the
future?</TE>
<TE>   Not likely.</TE>

<AU>BETTY ROLLIN</AU>
<BD>Betty Rollin is a contributing correspondent for NBC
News and the author, most recently, of "Last Wish" (Public Affairs,
1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am the wife of a mathematician--information that used to be a
conversation-stopper. But not lately, because of the Oscar-nominated
film "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, people are interested in my husband's species. What are
they really like? Of course they don't all have paranoid delusions
like the guy in the movie, but aren't they--a bit weird?</LD>
<LD>   I had met a few of my husband's colleagues early in our
relationship, but my first exposure en masse happened in Helsinki, at
a congress of mathematicians. At the opening party, my first
impression was of hairy, unkempt men--and a few women--with terrible
posture, some of whom talked to themselves and bumped into things.
That was 20 years ago. Today, I think of them as hairy, unkempt men
with terrible posture, some of whom talk to themselves and bump into
things. But that's not all.</LD>
<TE>   Here's my favorite story about Norbert Wiener, the brilliant
mathematician who had just moved to a new house in Belmont, Mass., in
the early 1950s. He was returning home from MIT, deep into a
mathematical problem. It was dark and he found himself on a street
with houses and lawns that he didn't recognize. A small girl pedaled
up on her bicycle and Wiener said, "Excuse me, I seem to be lost. Do
you know where Prof. Wiener lives?" The girl looked at him and
sighed. "You're home, Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   I once tagged along at another congress, in Albuquerque. (I
stopped going to these things when I realized that even at dinner,
they spoke of nothing but mathematics. Some even brought their
laptops, which they parked to the right of their dinner plates.) My
husband had just given a paper on Kummer's theory of ideal prime
factors (don't ask) and the department head took us and a few other
leading lights in the math department to dinner. I remember a
so-called Italian restaurant with unspeakable food. As usual, the
conversation was mathematics. I played with my spaghetti and stared
absently at the professor sitting opposite me. Suddenly, he jumped
up. "Michael!" he said, grabbing his jacket and running out. We found
out later he had forgotten to pick up his kid, who was being
discharged from the hospital that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Another time we were in Los Angeles, for my work this time. I had
an appointment with my agent. As we sat in the waiting room, several
gorgeous creatures sashayed by. One of them placed herself in one of
the leather chairs. She crossed her legs as if it were a dance step.
One leg shot out very straight very slowly. Very slowly. Then, toe
pointed, leg one moved onto leg two. I looked over at my husband. His
nose was in his notebook, his pen moving furiously on the page. He
was doing what he always does when he sits down (sometimes he does it
standing up): a formula.</TE>
<TE>   Now here's the truth: I'm jealous. I love what I do, but I'm not
obsessed. Especially if I'm writing, my favorite thing is an
interruption. To say mathematicians love their work doesn't begin to
cover it. They inhale their work. They exhale it. They drink it. They
swallow it. They do not sweat life because life doesn't count.
Numbers count. Getting from here to there with numbers. Journeys of
love. Into infinity.</TE>

<HD>A Nonsensical Nonverdict on a $70-Million Nonissue</HD>

<AU>STEVE YOUNG</AU>
<BD>Steve Young, a contributing editor for the Writers
Guild of America journal, Written By, is author of the forthcoming
"Great Failures of the Extremely Successful" (Tallfellow Press).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After federal investigators spent more than $70 million, examined 10
million pages of documents and interviewed under oath more than 3,000
witnesses, independent prosecutor Robert Ray officially closed the
Whitewater investigation, saying there was no proof tying the
Clintons to criminal activities. But Ray added that the government
also found no conclusive proof untying them to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not really sure what all this means," Harvard professor of
legal jargon Thom Thinthith said, "but that isn't necessarily a bad
thing. Then again, it could be."</LD>
<LD>   This nonconclusive proof of not committing crimes, while breathing
a much-needed breath of muddled air into the already confusing legal
community, has also sent a bewildering message throughout the courts.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not like the legal community doesn't have a problem with
Ray's lack of a comprehensible conclusion," judicial observer
Clarence Darrow XI said. "Not finding the Clintons not responsible
for not committing crimes is the stuff of tremendous fee
proliferation, just trying to explain what these decisions mean."</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing pundits, who cling to the thinnest of Clinton-bashing
threads, believe they've been vindicated. "We've never not claimed
that the Clintons weren't not guilty," a nonanonymous source at Rush
Limbaugh's Excellence in Broadcasting offices said. "We've only said
that their not being guilty is no excuse for not being responsible
for the negative results of their administration ... or not."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton pal James Carville continued to profess the
investigation's inadequacy and partisanship. "It's not the
inconclusivity of the investigation as much as not disclosing how
much the Clintons didn't know. This was just another one of those
Republican lies meant to hide the facts under a partisan fabrication
of the nontruth. As far as I'm concerned, it's a nonissue."</TE>
<TE>   Ray said that while no charges will be filed, the allegations were
"credible," and there was never even the slimmest hint of
partisanship in his investigation. He then headed down to New Jersey
to begin his run for the Republican Party's Senate nomination.</TE>

<LD>A car bomb that killed nine in Lima, Peru, Wednesday was not a warm
advance welcome for President Bush. Wisely, though, the president
sees his mission to that South American nation, Mexico and El
Salvador this weekend as too important to be thwarted by terrorists.
Too bad Congress has yet to grasp the importance of Latin American
relations.</LD>
<LD>   "You bet I'm going," Bush told reporters before leaving on a trip
to reaffirm the United States' commitment to such matters as free
trade and the fight against drug trafficking, a whirlwind tour that
begins in Mexico. There he is expected to sign an agreement to
tighten security along the southern border while preventing delays
for people trying to move legal products between the nations.</LD>
<LD>   The pact was not easily agreed upon, but Mexico's leaders went out
of their way to make it happen. It would have been nice if, to
reciprocate, Bush had brought with him the news that thousands of
Mexicans who entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas
could remain in this country while they completed paperwork to gain
legal residency. Although the House did its part to give the
president what he had hoped would be a gift to his Mexican hosts,
Sen. Robert C. Byrd. (D- W. Va.) delayed the bill in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's second stop will come Saturday when he becomes the first
incumbent American president to set foot in Peru. Speaking from the
heart of the country, in Lima, the capital, the president will
recognize the Peruvian people's courageous struggle to restore
democratic rule after years of authoritarian rule and rigged
elections. While grateful for the American nod, what Peruvians really
want is more U.S. help to battle increasingly violent drug
traffickers who have moved into the northern part of the country,
where they are planting opium poppies that will eventually reach the
U.S. as heroin.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on Sunday, Bush will meet in San Salvador with the heads
of five Central American nations. The administration says this will
be the start of talks that could lead to a free trade accord with the
nations of the Central American isthmus. But to extend the North
American Free Trade Agreement to that region, Bush needs
congressional approval of "fast-track" authority. That would allow
him to make deals with foreign nations, while limiting Congress' role
to approving or rejecting--but not modifying--the agreements.</TE>

<LD>Bane and Hera. They are symbols of everything fearsome about large,
mean dogs. The animals are dead now, and their owners, Robert Noel
and Marjorie Knoller, were convicted Thursday of manslaughter and
murder in the grisly mauling death of Diane Whipple outside her San
Francisco apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Testimony at the trial included tale after tale of people
threatened, chased or bitten by one or both of the dogs. But the
defense pointed to the fact that no one filed a complaint: not to
animal control, not to the building's landlord, not to police. The
defense tried to argue, obviously unsuccessfully, that such incidents
are part of the normal run of dog- human interaction. The fear and
dread that neighbors felt upon seeing those dogs weren't normal. But
there were, and continue to be, social pressures against lodging
official complaints about vicious pets.</LD>
<LD>   That's because, rightly or wrongly, people see dogs as extensions
of their owners. Why would one own an aggressive, 100-pound dog
unless the owner was happy to see other people intimidated? And the
intimidation often works. Those bothered by threatening dogs often
grumble privately but do nothing more, thinking there is nothing more
they can do.</LD>
<TE>   Animal control agencies exist to help with problem pets and
strays. But anyone who has tried to make a report knows the story:
Animal control in major cities is typically underfunded and unable to
handle more than a fraction of the demand for its services. Only a
serious dog bite brings a fast response. Fear barely registers with
authorities; if a would-be complainant fears the dog's owner and
hesitates to file a complaint, animal control can't do much because
dogs are private property and can't be seized without just cause.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has six shelters citywide and perhaps two officers on
duty at each at any one time. There is one special enforcement unit
for rounding up strays, down from two because of budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The truth about dog bites is that most of them--there are about
70,000 reported in Los Angeles alone each year--are inflicted by
family pets and most of the victims are children under 12.
Nationwide, 10 to 20 people a year are killed by dogs, and again most
are children attacked by family pets. But it is the unknown dog that
inflicts the most concern.</TE>
<TE>   It's satisfying that Noel, convicted of manslaughter, and Knoller,
convicted of second-degree murder, may end up in prison. Owners of
vicious or unpredictable dogs who fail to muzzle or contain them
deserve both jail time and lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhoods are safer when people help police their own streets.
Report any dog bite, no matter how minor. Report packs of strays. If
the threat seems immediate, call 911; a request from police often
gets a faster response from animal control. And never, ever leave a
small child unattended around dogs, even if you are sure that Fido
would never hurt even his own fleas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's first plans for the trials of captured
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters threatened to make the U.S. justice
system a casualty of the war on terrorism. Even when memories of
Sept. 11 were rawest, the idea of holding secret military
proceedings, denying defendants a choice of lawyers and making the
president the sole court of appeal struck many as un-American.</LD>
<LD>   A much-needed review by outside experts prompted the Defense
Department Thursday to change some rules and moved the adjudication
of the cases closer to this nation's ideals, including the rule of
law.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld now says trials will be
public, not secret, unless secrecy is necessary to protect classified
information or safeguard those involved. Panels will consist of three
to seven military judges. Two-thirds agreement will be sufficient to
convict of lesser crimes, but seven judges will need to agree to
convict in death penalty cases.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, defendants will be presumed innocent, will not be
forced to testify, will not be tried twice for the same crime and
must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The government will
provide military lawyers for the accused, who will also be allowed to
hire civilian attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to say that the tribunals will be the same as a
trial in Los Angeles Superior Court. Hearsay evidence, for instance,
would not be excluded. But Rumsfeld has raised the possibility of
further modification of rules. One such change should be allowing
appeals to federal courts, not limiting them to a military panel
(which could consider appeals under the changed rules)  and
ultimately the president. This need not mean a lengthy, complex
process for most crimes. A special civilian panel could be
established to handle the reviews with dispatch. Death penalty
appeals would deserve additional time and scrutiny. Federal court
appeals would end the executive branch's stranglehold on the cases
and give the whole process more credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorism defendants best know at this point will not be
subject to military panels. Federal grand juries have brought charges
against Richard C. Reid, who allegedly tried to blow up a
Paris-to-Miami flight with a shoe bomb, Zacarias Moussaoui, accused
of conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks, and John Walker Lindh, the
American who fought in the Taliban. They will be tried in civilian
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld insisted Thursday that so far there are no candidates for
trial among the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters held at Guantanamo Bay.
It is possible that the military commissions will never be used, that
the prisoners are so low-level they will eventually be sent back to
their home countries. At some point the government must either bring
charges or release the detainees. The assault on this country cannot
be allowed to erode its bedrock values.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Drug Tests at Schools Argued at High Court," March 20:</LD>
<LD>   Justice Antonin Scalia said Tuesday that school officials make the
rules at school, and he derided the notion that students have privacy
rights. "You are dealing with minors here. You can keep them in
prison in effect, and say, 'You have to stay after school because you
haven't done your homework,' " he said. "There's a world of
difference between minors and adults."</LD>
<LD>   Hey, why not strip-search them for drugs and weapons, too? After
all, they are just prisoners with no rights. Geeze. Is it any wonder
that we have a massive drug problem?</LD>
<TE>   Terrence T. Downes</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court clearly agreed to hear a case against mandatory
drug testing of high school students not to objectively judge the
merits of the case but so that its conservative members could make
their own opinions heard.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing drug tests to metal detectors is incorrect. Millions of
adults happily submit to metal detector searches every day on their
way into airports and courthouses. Should they have no objection to
being drug-tested?</TE>
<TE>   I will have a hard time explaining to my daughter when she becomes
a teenager that she's not born with her constitutional rights but is
given them when she turns 18. I also find the condescending tone of
Justices William Rehnquist, Scalia and Anthony Kennedy unacceptable.
The justices have been known to be combative when discussing the
legal merits of a case, especially when the case presented has failed
to rise to certain legal standards. But some of the comments to the
attorney and his client in this case, especially those of Kennedy,
reveal a personal tone that has nothing to do with law. We must
expect more from someone sitting in the highest court of our country,
discussing a case that is far from open and shut.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>R. Kent Weaver ("Note to Congress: Compromise," Opinion, March 17)
fails to address the simple and nearly instantaneous solution to the
Social Security "crisis." Right now, something like 12% of a low-wage
worker's salary--every penny of which is needed for his family to
survive--goes into Social Security, while CEOs, whose salaries range
in the millions of dollars, pay some tiny fraction of 1% of their
incomes into Social Security.</LD>
<LD>   If we were to abolish the artificial ceiling on the payroll tax so
that every single person anywhere, in any industry, in any tax
bracket, paid the same percentage of every dollar earned as salary,
stock options, dividends or bonuses, the Social Security system would
be awash in money.</LD>
<LD>   It does not matter that the very rich would never be able to
recoup their payments into the system with the benefits they would
receive. The taxes we are all faced with are the dues we pay in order
to live in the greatest country on Earth.</LD>
<TE>   We must stop the free ride enjoyed by those with too much money
for the sake of the community and country and for the survival of
democracy itself.</TE>

<LD>Re "Should Teacher Legislation Go to the Head of the Class?"
Commentary, March 19: So the teachers unions are so powerful, are
they?</LD>
<LD>   This state ranks in the bottom half in the nation in per-pupil
funding for education. Given the fact that teachers unions have the
only true lobbyists for school improvements, it is obvious that the
California teachers unions are already essentially impotent and
subservient to the demands of the state Legislature. Powerful? The
union has to fight to get school funding to increase by
cost-of-living allowances.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers unions are already as inconsequential as they could
possibly be in California.</LD>

<LD>In Wednesday's Times, reference is made to the fact that President
Bush is pushing a congressional bill allowing illegal residents to
stay. Once again Bush, in his compassionate glory, is supporting
something that law-abiding citizens reject wholeheartedly as unfair,
among other things. His only concerns in supporting this bill are for
future votes and for political purposes, for his meeting with the
president of Mexico shortly.</LD>
<LD>   I can best sum it up in the words of Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-Va.),
who, in a floor speech this week, denounced the immigration proviso
as amounting to "amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens,
many of whom have not undergone any, any, background or security
check, and who pose a dangerous risk to our border security." The
Senate must not allow this to happen.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Wedge Out Immigrant-Bashing," Commentary, March 20: So,
Richard Bond laments the fact that "immigrant bashers" have had a
field day since Sept. 11? We "bashers" lament the fact that so many
had to die due to unregulated borders. Also, this basher--xenophobe,
extremist, hater or whatever the "tolerant" left calls me--vents his
anger at illegal immigrants. "Remember California's Proposition 187?"
Bond asks. Yes, I do. It passed overwhelmingly. It specified illegal
immigrants. Oh, and why is wanting to follow the law so "divisive"?
It is the illegal-alien supporters who are divisive.</TE>
<TE>   And just what is a "law-abiding" illegal immigrant, as Bond calls
them, anyway? Is it those who merely illegally cross our borders,
illegally work here, illegally use false documents but otherwise
follow the law? The Republican Party is going to disappear if it
makes illegals into legals. The immigrants will vote Democrat and
many Republicans will flee the party and vote independent. All
immigrants must be screened for character, health and job prospects
before being allowed in. If not, we will become a Third World nation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I just finished reading "'She Was Terrified of Him'" (March 19), on
Jose Delacruz, who was released to "get his financial business in
order." Now a woman and her small children are missing. I don't
understand how a Superior Court judge can look at the history of
Delacruz and not take the family into consideration. He had just been
convicted of spousal abuse!</LD>
<LD>   What about that poor woman who was brave enough to leave him and
go to a shelter to save herself and her children? I wonder if she had
time to get her business in order? How could Judge Melvin Sandvig
give this man such an opportunity to go out and do this? I'm just
baffled and saddened to think that Delacruz was convicted--and
allowed to go free, even if it was supposed to be for a couple of
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't take a genius to know that his wife was at great risk.
I hope other convicted spousal abusers do not get to Sandvig's court,
or this may happen again.</LD>

<LD>The debate on whether Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge should
testify before Congress has been unnecessary and taken too far into
the realm of partisan political games ("Ridge's Refusal to Testify
Irks Lawmakers," March 16).</LD>
<LD>   Ridge's refusal to testify, with the support of President Bush
under the assertion of an executive "prerogative," has no foundation
in our democracy. The bottom line of this debate is that our
government works for the people, not for Bush and Ridge. Congress not
only has the right to question all government officials, it has a
duty to the American people to question them--especially a
Cabinet-level official who will be in charge of a $38-billion budget.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Condemnation of the MTA board of directors for its consistent
demonstration of defiance of court-ordered rulings and its ongoing
lack of good faith in honest attempts to improve the present inferior
bus service should be forthcoming from the civic and business
leadership of Los Angeles, including The Times ("Final MTA Appeal of
Bus Accord Fails," March 19).</LD>
<LD>   It is criminal that $1 million of taxpayer funds were wasted on
continuous appeals that most legal experts agreed had no merit.
Although Roger Snoble, the recently hired CEO of the MTA, was not on
board when the original decree to purchase additional new buses was
ordered, by continuing the costly legal appeals he quickly
demonstrated no intention of altering the concrete mind-set of his
predecessor.</LD>
<LD>   Snoble's statement that the public transportation needs of the
people will not be met by relying on "40-foot buses to do the job" is
a cynical excuse for not providing for the present lack of buses,
which causes many long waits and overcrowding. However, as the
highest-paid department chief in L.A. County, it's not likely that
Snoble, or the other members of the MTA board, are dependent on buses
for their regular transportation.</LD>
<TE>   Sid Skolnik</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the Bus Riders Union wants the MTA to provide more buses and
delay new light rail projects? All this because people have to stand
up during rush hours? This sounds quite ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   So what if people have to stand up? Don't they realize that the
new rail lines will benefit everyone? I'm all for the NAACP and most
of its actions, but it seems way off base here. These groups' actions
will delay (or even squash) long-awaited rail lines for Angelenos
because they want buses that are a waste of our tax money.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your March 19 editorial criticized LAPD officers for initiating a
"high-speed" pursuit for a traffic violation. The pursuing officers
lost the suspect's car, probably because they were sensible enough to
not drive recklessly, and were not following the car when its driver
drove into the victims. It was the suspect driver's reckless actions
that caused the Holocaust survivors' injuries, not the cops.</LD>
<LD>   Not one word of criticism of the suspect's actions by the victims'
daughter was reported by The Times. Man, what a thankless job to be a
cop in L.A. The Police Department should issue those suction-cup,
bobbing, waving-hand devices to its officers to put in their windows.
Only then will The Times and the ACLU be assured that officers keep
their blinders on, minding their own business, all the while giving
the appearance of really giving a damn about what's going on outside
their police cruisers. To answer your editorial's question: Yes, this
chase followed a common-sense pursuit policy.</LD>

<LD>All over the media, President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell and
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice are justifying an invasion
of Iraq because Iraq has "weapons of mass destruction," but our brave
and loyal soldiers shouldn't risk having their blood spilled over
four little words.</LD>
<LD>   The phrase has been repeated so many times--with no explanation of
what those weapons are and how they pose a threat to U.S.
citizens--it seems that the Bush administration believes if it simply
repeats something enough (like the word "evil"), sooner or later the
people will simply believe it to be true. Iraq has yet to be tied in
any way to Sept. 11. Would Bush have invaded Iraq, unprovoked, before
Sept. 11? Of course not. I don't care what the polls say, hollow
rhetoric meant to scare and anger the population does not a leader
make.</LD>

<HD>G. Winbergh, 58; Lyrical, Dramatic Swedish Tenor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goesta Winbergh, the Swedish tenor who sang the title role in
Wagner's "Lohengrin" for the Los Angeles Opera in September, has
died. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Winbergh sang the role of Florestan in Beethoven's "Fidelio" on
Sunday for the Vienna State Opera. He returned to his apartment after
the performance and apparently suffered a heart attack during the
night. His body was found in his bed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Opera "Lohengrin"--a milestone for the company because it
was the first work by Wagner produced during Placido Domingo's tenure
as artistic director of the company and the first led by the
company's new principal conductor, Kent Nagano--was called a
resounding success by Times critic Mark Swed, who described Winbergh
as a "satisfyingly ardent singer with [a] generously lyrical
[voice]."</LD>
<TE>   "I have lost a dear friend whom I have admired deeply," Domingo
said Wednesday. "The world has lost an irreplaceable artist, a true
heldentenor in the grand tradition. We had discussed his return to
Los Angeles Opera with a number of possible future projects, and I'm
extremely saddened by this tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Stockholm, Winbergh studied at the opera school there and
made his stage debut in 1973 in Goteborg in southwestern Sweden as
Rodolfo in Puccini's "La Boheme." He was a member of the Royal Opera
in Stockholm from 1973 to 1981, singing mostly lyrical roles such as
Tamino in Mozart's "The Magic Flute" and Nemorino in Donizetti's "The
Elixir of Love."</TE>
<TE>   Winbergh made his U.S. debut in 1974 at the San Francisco Opera,
singing Don Ottavio in Mozart's "Don Giovanni." It was in this role
that he made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1983, soon becoming a
regular singer in that house.</TE>
<TE>   He was a permanent guest artist at the Zurich Opera, where he made
his debut in 1981 and where he sang his first Lohengrin in 1991, as
well all the major Mozart roles. Winbergh performed in important
opera houses around the world, and recorded for Decca, EMI, Erato and
Sony Classical.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Elena, and three children.</TE>

<HD>Herman Talmadge, 88; Georgia Senator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Herman O. Eugene Talmadge, a former governor and U.S. senator from
Georgia who once predicted that "blood will run in the streets of
Atlanta" if the schools were desegregated, died Thursday at 88.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health for several years, fighting throat cancer, heart
ailments, pneumonia and ulcers, Talmadge died at home in Hampton, Ga.
The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Part of a powerful Southern political family, Talmadge was a
politician who abetted segregation and encouraged resistance to
federal integration efforts. After the 1954 Brown vs. Board of
Education ruling by the Supreme Court that called for desegregation
of the schools, Talmadge offered his prediction of violent unrest
over the decision.</LD>
<TE>   "He pleased the people but he did not lead them," said Eugene
Patterson, former editor of the Atlanta Constitution, who often
editorialized against Talmadge during the tumultuous civil rights
era.</TE>
<TE>   "When they faced the difficult task of respecting the law as
interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1954, he was of little help.
Rather, he kept the favor of people who resisted the inevitable,"
Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of his career, after blacks had won the right to vote
(over his objections), he had dropped race-baiting from his
vocabulary, eventually winning majority black support and a man of
the year honor from a black college for his financial support.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were "Ol Gene" Talmadge, a flamboyant politician
elected governor of Georgia three times, and Mattie Thurmond
Talmadge, known as Miss Mitt and a second cousin of South Carolina's
Sen. Strom Thurmond.</TE>
<TE>   So powerful was the family and its political machine from the
1920s to the 1980s, that it was said in Georgia that you were not so
much a Democrat or a Republican, but a pro-Talmadge voter or a
communist.</TE>
<TE>   With a lock of hair loose on his forehead and a cigar his constant
companion, Talmadge rose in Washington to chair the Senate
Agriculture Committee, where he championed food stamps and the school
lunch program. He served on the Watergate Committee that found
evidence of a cover-up in Richard Nixon's White House.</TE>
<TE>   And though a reluctant participant in the proceedings--he often
said he did not know why Nixon did not hold a huge bonfire on the
White House lawn and burn the audio tapes that incriminated him--he
was involved in one of the more interesting moments in the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   While questioning John Ehrlichman about the break-in at the office
of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, he asked Nixon's aide if he
recalled the idea that "no matter how humble a man's cottage is, that
even the king of England cannot enter without his consent."</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid that has been considerably eroded over the years, has
it not?" Ehrlichman responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Down in my country," Talmadge replied, "we still think it is a
pretty legitimate principle of law."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his longevity in the Senate, Talmadge had few friends in
Washington, and often saw life through the prism of his past--a
Populist, machine-driven kind of politics where loyalty was more
important than ideology and street smarts trumped a formal education.
Famously, he once said of a colleague, "He was educated beyond his
intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Talmadge grew up in rural central Georgia and studied to be a
lawyer. He got his start in the statehouse at the center of one of
the most remarkable chapters in Georgia history, sometimes called the
Three Governor Era.</TE>
<TE>   His father, having been elected, died before he could assume
office. The Georgia Legislature, controlled by the Talmadge machine,
chose 33-year-old Herman to replace him. The incumbent, Ellis Arnall,
resisted, but Talmadge loyalists changed the locks on Arnall's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Arnall responded by swearing in his lieutenant governor, M.E.
Thompson. For months, the state had three men claiming to be
governor, until the Georgia Supreme Court embraced Thompson as
interim governor. The following year, Herman Talmadge won election to
fill out his father's term.</TE>
<TE>   "Many [who voted for him] were dead and voted in alphabetical
order," quipped Bill Shipp, a longtime observer of Georgia politics
who runs an online political newsletter called billshipp.com..</TE>
<TE>   Talmadge himself, in an interview with the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution years later, put it this way: "People enjoyed
politics then. It was a form of entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Within 10 years, he decided he was ready for Washington, and told
Sen. Walter F. George that his time was up.</TE>
<TE>   "Sen. George was not ready to retire, but he had majored in
international affairs, not always popular down here," recalled Shipp.
"Talmadge frightened him out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Talmadge served in Washington for more than 20 years and, despite
having little national impact, he left a deep impression on his
staff.</TE>
<TE>   He once caught legislative aide Dan Tate Sr. dawdling over
answering some constituent mail. Talmadge told him to stay the night
until he answered all of it. Tate said the remaining letters were
written in crayon, clearly from nut cases. "Dan," drawled Talmadge,
"nuts vote."</TE>
<TE>   Talmadge's political career was shattered by a divorce from his
second wife, Leila Elizabeth "Betty" Shingler. They had married at
the governor's mansion in 1941, but in a bitter 1977 divorce she
disclosed his drinking and corruption. In 1978, she told the Senate
Ethics Committee that Talmadge kept $100 bills stuffed in his coat,
gifts from voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate denounced Talmadge. He later said he wished he had
"burned that damn overcoat" and, admitting that he was an alcoholic,
went to Long Beach, Calif., for rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   He mourned the death of his son, who had died in a drowning
accident. Then he ran for reelection, as Talmadges always did.</TE>
<TE>   He had a closer-than-usual race in the Democratic primary, from a
man who now serves in the Senate, Zell Miller. In a statement
released Thursday, Miller said, "The tallest tree in the Georgia
forest has fallen."</TE>
<TE>   Having survived the toughest battle that year, Talmadge assumed
that he would skate toward a general election victory. His opponent,
Mack Mattingly, was a Republican, and no Republican had ever beaten a
Talmadge.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1980, the Old South had changed. Suburban conservatives
were no longer Democrats, and blacks were no longer mostly
Republicans. Mattingly won, narrowly. Talmadge went home, married a
third time and wrote his memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Six years after he left Washington, he said in an interview, "I
call up people these days and tell them my name is Talmadge, and they
say, 'Will you please spell that for me?'"</TE>
<TE>   Talmadge said he always replied, "Where the hell have you been?"</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ratchets Up Pressure on Arafat to Stem Violence</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Militia claiming responsibility for latest deadly bombing
is put on Washington's terror list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The second Palestinian suicide bombing in two days drew new U.S.
demands Thursday for forceful action by Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, as the State Department put the organization that claimed
responsibility for the blast on its official list of terrorist groups.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Arafat must do more to stop the violence," President Bush
declared in El Paso as he began a trip to Latin America, just hours after
a 21-year-old bomber killed three Israelis in downtown Jerusalem. The
bombing, by a member of a militia linked to Arafat, brought an abrupt
halt to U.S.-sponsored talks in the region that had been making some
progress toward a cease-fire there.</LD>
<LD>   In an Oval Office appearance before the attack, Bush said he was
"disappointed" in Arafat's efforts to stop the violence, which has killed
a total of more than 1,500 people on both sides during the last 18
months.</LD>
<TE>   The State Department announced Thursday that it had designated the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the militia that took responsibility for the latest
attack, as a "foreign terrorist organization." The action, which was
taken Tuesday and reported to Congress on Wednesday, makes it illegal for
Americans to provide funds or other forms of support to the group and
requires U.S. banks to freeze any assets on deposit.</TE>
<TE>   The brigade is an offshoot of the Tanzim, the armed wing of Arafat's
Fatah movement, although "it remains unclear to what extent they act out
of knowledge and approval of senior leadership of the Fatah," State
Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Aqsa is the first Palestinian organization to be added to the
official terrorist list since the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian
fighting began in September 2000. Some members of Congress had been
pushing for the militia to be placed on the list.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Bill Moyers for a PBS telecast tonight, Marwan
Zaloum, an Al Aqsa commander, pledged: "We will continue until we
vanquish the occupation and until the creation of the Palestinian state.
This is the message that the whole world has to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's position as the leader of the Palestinian cause has been
impaired by the continuing violence. Some analysts said that the
inclusion of Al Aqsa on the list of terrorist organizations will probably
further weaken Arafat's authority because of the group's ties to his
Fatah faction.</TE>
<TE>   "It will tend to undermine him," said Philip C. Wilcox Jr., a former
director of Israeli affairs for the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Wilcox said it remains important for the United States to
deal with Arafat, because "he is the only Palestinian leader of any
legitimacy."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's suicide bombing came only two days after the Bush
administration sharply stepped up its involvement in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict by offering the possibility of a meeting
between Arafat and Vice President Dick Cheney. The vice president would
be the most senior member of the Bush administration to meet with the
Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   But the meeting depends on Arafat taking a series of steps, set out
last year by CIA Director George J. Tenet, to move the Palestinians
toward a cease-fire, such as giving the Israelis advance warning of
possible violence, collecting illegal arms, halting weapons smuggling and
closing bomb factories.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. officials remained vague on prospects for the
Cheney-Arafat meeting, they notably didn't call it off after Thursday's
attack, which came just a day after another suicide bomber killed seven
people on a bus in northern Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting could be held as early as next week if Anthony C. Zinni,
the Bush administration's point man in the Middle East, determines that
Arafat has met conditions laid out by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, however, canceled a meeting with the Palestinians that had
been scheduled for Thursday night to discuss a truce. Instead, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon convened an emergency session of his security
advisors to weigh reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   Alleviating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become increasingly
important to the Bush administration in recent days as it has become
clear that the United States will need to achieve progress in that arena
if it is to win broader Arab support for its campaign against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. As Cheney toured the Middle East during the
last week and a half, he was told again and again that the United States
needed to step up its involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who accompanied Bush on his trip
to Latin America, called Arafat from Air Force One to deliver a blunt
message that the Palestinian leader must restrain his followers,
spokesman Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell called on Arafat "to condemn today's acts publicly and
personally in the strongest manner, in English and in Arabic," Reeker
said. "The secretary told Chairman Arafat he must punish the leaders of
organizations responsible for recent attacks, making sure those
responsible are brought to justice."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of State also insisted that Arafat give the Palestinian
security services "unambiguous orders" to enforce a cease-fire and that
he make a serious effort to stop the violence, Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell later had a 15-minute conversation with Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat publicly condemned
Thursday's suicide attack.</TE>

<HD>Pontiff Speaks on Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Church: 'Grievous' acts by priests are decried; critics say remarks
fall short. Mahony confirms some accused local clerics have been removed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, stung by the escalating sexual-abuse crisis
rocking the Roman Catholic Church, declared Thursday that guilty priests
have succumbed to "the most grievous forms" of evil and brought "grave
scandal" to the church.</LD>
<LD>   The pope's remarks marked the first time he has spoken publicly on the
issue since the furor erupted anew this year in the United States.
Catholics, including bishops, had urged the pope to speak out.</LD>
<LD>   But his fiercely righteous words, while welcomed, did not break any
new ground and were unlikely to satisfy demands for new safeguards to
protect minors.</LD>
<TE>   The pope confined his remarks on abuse to one passage in a 22-page
annual pre-Easter letter to clergy. He refrained from using the phrase
"sexual abuse."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul's message reflected a philosophical linchpin of Catholic
theology: the power of evil to corrupt. The errant priests, he wrote, had
succumbed "to the most grievous forms of the mysterium iniquitatis
[mystery of evil] at work in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The pope offered no suggestions on practical ways to address the
problem, nor did he comment directly on how bishops have handled the
controversy. He limited his words to those of a chief pastor speaking to
subordinate fellow priests.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us, conscious of human weakness but trusting in the healing
power of divine grace, are called to embrace the mysterium crucis
[mystery of the cross] and to commit ourselves more fully to the search
for holiness," he wrote.</TE>

<TE>   * Cardinal Roger M. Mahony for the first time publicly confirmed that
a "few local priests" in the three-county Los Angeles Archdiocese have
been removed from all  ministries following accusations of sexually
abusing minors. Mahony did not divulge how many clerics had been fired.
Sources within the church have placed the number at six to 12. Mahony
said "virtually all" of those involved "old cases, many going back
decades."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the archdiocese said Thursday that he could not be
more specific.</TE>
<TE>   * One of the nation's leading Catholic magazines said the church
hierarchy was incapable of investigating itself and said bishops had lost
credibility. "No professional group--lawyers, police, accountants,
doctors--is good at policing itself," the editorial in the Jesuit
magazine America said.</TE>
<TE>   * A new poll said 75% of American Catholics believe that U.S. bishops
are doing a "poor" or "fair" job in addressing the crisis.</TE>
<TE>Addressing Effect on Priesthood</TE>
<TE>   While the pope said that the church "shows her concern for the victims
and strives to respond in truth and justice to each of these painful
situations," he stressed the scandal's impact on the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Grave scandal is caused, with the result that a dark shadow of
suspicion is cast over all the other fine priests who perform their
ministry with honesty and integrity and often with heroic
self-sacrifice," the pope wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He used virtually the same words in 1993 while in Denver for World
Youth Day, declaring that the sexual abuse of minors had caused
"suffering and scandal."</TE>
<TE>   Several experts on the Vatican regarded Thursday's statement as
evidence that the Vatican has failed to recognize the incendiary nature
of a financial and moral crisis confronting the church. However, one
prominent American Catholic praised the pope for a "historic" reform
message.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosures of reputed sex crimes by priests have rippled across the
country following reports in Boston early this year that a priest who
allegedly molested more than 130 boys had been transferred by superiors
from parish to parish. New reports followed in Los Angeles, New York,
Philadelphia, and Bridgeport, Conn., among other places.</TE>
<TE>   A Florida bishop resigned after admitting that he had sexually abused
a teenager at a seminary more than 20 years ago. There have been calls
for the resignation of two of America's leading prelates, Cardinals
Bernard Law of Boston and John Egan of New York.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other resignations and scandals in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In Ireland, the church recently agreed to a record $110-million
payment to children abused by clergy over decades. Sexual abuse cases
involving cover-ups have also been reported in England, France and
Australia, among other countries. Other accusations have been lodged
against a Polish archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   Although sexual abuse settlements have cost the church hundreds of
millions of dollars in the United States, critics have warned that the
church's moral currency is also being debased.</TE>
<TE>   Father Richard P. McBrien, professor of theology at the University of
Notre Dame, said Thursday that the pope's remarks were "a totally
inadequate response. It's some acknowledgment of the crisis. At least
it's a fresh start. But if it were to be the only step, it would be
totally inadequate. This crisis is far more serious than the pope's
advisors in the Vatican think.</TE>
<TE>'Terrible Harm Done to Children'</TE>
<TE>   "What's reprehensible is the terrible harm done to children over so
many years, and that it's been covered up by bishops," McBrien said. He
said American Catholics--priests as well as members of the laity--are
angry at bishops who run the 195 dioceses in the U.S. "They're not angry
at priests at the parish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Flynn, a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and one-time mayor
of Boston, said the pope's letter sent an unmistakable signal that abuse
will not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   "This historic message for reform in the way church leaders deal with
allegations of sexual abuse by priests against children is not a
suggestion but an ultimatum," he said. "Changes and reforms will take
place, and they will be universal," added Flynn, who is now president of
the Catholic Alliance, a nonpartisan advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony's newest remarks on the scandal appeared in today's
issue of the archdiocesan newspaper, The Tidings. They closely resembled
the tack taken Thursday by John Paul II.</TE>
<TE>   Both the pope and Mahony spoke of the scandal's toll on the vast
majority of priests who have never been involved in sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The unconscionable actions of a few priests locally and across the
country have lowered a cloud of suspicion over all priests and over the
entire church," Mahony wrote. "It is a difficult time for all of us. But
somehow, God's grace is always able to bring good from any human failure,
even shameful, sinful behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the church was "passing through a time of purification."</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests, said Thursday that the pope's remarks were
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems fixated on the 'bad apples' and the notion of moral lapses,
when in fact the real issue is the bishops' inaction and insensitivity,"
Clohessy said. "The first concern he expressed is expressed for his
priests, and secondly for the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony placed equal emphasis on protecting children and healing
victims of abuse. But he acknowledge that the church's credibility has
been "seriously challenged and in many ways eroded."</TE>
<TE>   The editorial in the Jesuit magazine said the scandal is "even more
difficult" for the clergy "not only because they are investigating their
brothers, but also because their whole training urges them toward
forgiveness rather than punishment."</TE>
<TE>   The editorial called for investigating committees in each diocese made
up entirely of laypeople. It said that if a bishop failed to follow a
committee's disciplinary recommendations, the committee should be free to
publicize its findings.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's poll of Catholics by Le Moyne College, a Jesuit institution
in Syracuse, N.Y., and Zogby International of Utica, N.Y., said 85% of
Catholics believe that sexual abuse in the church should be handled by
police and the criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The poll surveyed 1,507 U.S. Catholics from March 12-16 and has a
reported margin of error of plus or minus 2.8%.</TE>
<TE>   "The survey underscores and reinforces what we already suspected: that
Catholics are disillusioned with certain elements of church leadership,"
the Rev. Charles J. Beirne, Le Moyne College president, said in a
prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   Another poll released earlier this week by the Pew Forum on Religion
and Public Life found that 62% of adult Americans believe that church
leaders have "mostly tried to cover up the problem" of clergy sexual
abuse. The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 2,002 adults
between Feb. 25 and March 10.</TE>

<TE>Papal Letter Excerpts</TE>
<TE>   The following are excerpts from Pope John Paul II's annual letter to
priests, released Thursday by the Vatican, regarding the sex abuse
scandal in the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican's official English
version of the letter includes some Latin phrases, which have been
translated by Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, too, as priests we are personally and profoundly
afflicted by the sins of some of our brothers, who have betrayed the
grace of ordination in succumbing even to the most grievous forms of the
mysterium iniquitatis [mystery of evil] at work in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Grave scandal is caused, with the result that a dark shadow of
suspicion is cast over all the other fine priests who perform their
ministry with honesty and integrity and often with heroic self-sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "As the church shows her concern for the victims and strives to
respond in truth and justice to each of these painful situations, all of
us--conscious of human weakness, but trusting in the healing power of
divine grace--are called to embrace the mysterium Crucis [mystery of the
Cross] and to commit ourselves more fully to the search for holiness. . .
.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the human heart has always been attracted to evil, and
that man will be able to radiate peace and love to those around him only
if he meets Christ and allows himself to be 'overtaken' by him. As
ministers of the Eucharist and of sacramental reconciliation, we in
particular have the task of communicating hope, goodness and peace to the
world. . . ."</TE>

<HD>Bush Touts 'Smart' Border for the U.S. and Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EL PASO
</DL>
<LD>President Bush vowed Thursday to create a "smart border" with
Mexico, saying he wants to speed the flow of people and goods across the
frontier but target would-be terrorists and those who smuggle drugs and
immigrants into the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The joint initiative with Mexico seeks to develop a "biometric" ID
system--using such identifying characteristics as fingerprints or retina
scans--for frequent travelers from both countries that would let them use
commuter lanes at high-volume border crossings.</LD>
<LD>   Another goal is to develop methods of inspecting and then sealing
trucks at their points of origin in Mexico so they can get clearance
before they reach the border, and perhaps use the fast lanes.</LD>
<TE>   "I want this border to be modern," Bush said in this Texas border city
en route to an international aid conference in Mexico. "I want it to have
the very best technology. I don't want it to be a neglected part of our
country."</TE>
<TE>   In a spirited speech to an adoring home-state crowd of several
thousand civilians and soldiers from nearby Ft. Bliss, Bush said his
commitment to modernize the United States' southern border demonstrates
that his interest in Mexico hasn't waned despite a post-Sept. 11
preoccupation with the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico is an incredibly important part of the futuro de los Estados
Unidos. And the border is a very important part of our relationship,"
Bush said, using a mixture of Spanish and English that delighted the
cheering, flag-waving audience jammed into a hangar at the El Paso
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Bush left for Monterrey, Mexico, to attend the
United Nations conference and confer with Mexican President Vicente Fox.
On his four-day Latin American trip, Bush also plans to visit Lima, the
Peruvian capital, and San Salvador, capital of El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   As he began his trip, Bush told reporters in Washington that he had no
intention of altering his itinerary despite a fatal car-bomb attack
Wednesday night near the U.S. Embassy in Lima.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-bit terrorists aren't going to prevent me from doing what we need
to do," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving El Paso, Bush further highlighted his commitment to
border security by touring the customs inspection station for commercial
cargo at the Bridge of the Americas, which links this city with Ciudad
Juarez, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a blue customs cap, Bush viewed a state-of-the-art detection
device that agents now use to randomly check commercial vehicles. He also
examined a tour bus that was seized after agents discovered 1,500 pounds
of cocaine hidden inside.</TE>
<TE>   A more efficient border-crossing system has become an important goal
for the administration in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Last
month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that more stringent border
inspections since September have led to long and often unpredictable
delays in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Such delays, which also have been reported along the U.S.-Canadian
border, have hurt business and slowed tourism, chamber officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, more than 300 million people, about 90 million cars and 4.3
million trucks cross the Mexican border into the United States. Commerce
between the two nations has tripled since 1993, with more than $245
billion of goods flowing between them last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is the United States' second-largest trading partner. Canada
remains the top U.S. trading partner, accounting for more than $365
billion in goods annually.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing his goal for the border, Bush said: "On the one hand, we
want the legal commerce, the people who travel back and forth on a daily
basis. . . . On the other hand, we want to use our technology to make
sure that we weed out those who we don't want in our country--the
terrorists . . . the smugglers, those who prey on innocent life."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's director of homeland security, Thomas J. Ridge, signed an
agreement with Canada in December to bolster the two nations' border
security while improving efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   In his fiscal year 2003 budget, the president is proposing to spend
about $11 billion for border security, including $380 million for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to construct a modern "entry-exit"
system. The $11 billion represents a $2.2-billion increase from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Washington on Thursday morning, the president and First
Lady Laura Bush met with Milton Green, whose wife, Barbara, and her
17-year-old daughter, Kristen Wormsley, were killed Sunday in a grenade
attack while attending church in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.</TE>
<TE>   They met at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland, where the two
victims' bodies were to arrive later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the White House sent Congress a request for an
additional $27.1 billion for needs related to the war on terrorism. More
than half the funds--$14 billion--would go to the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   Of the remainder, the administration is seeking $5.3 billion for
homeland security, $5.5 billion to help New York recover from the Sept.
11 devastation of the World Trade Center, $1.6 billion in economic aid
and to train and equip other countries to fight terrorism, and $750
million to help workers displaced by the recent economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., has
sent a memo to all federal agencies directing them to make sure that
their Web sites don't contain information that may be useful to
terrorists, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as February, Fleischer said, four government Web sites
still posted information on how to make powerful explosives, build a germ
factory, poison water supplies and spread contaminants.</TE>

<HD>Couple Guilty in Fatal Dog Mauling</HD>
<DH>Courts: Knoller faces 15 years to life for second-degree murder.
Her husband could get four years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Francisco lawyer was found guilty of second-degree murder
Thursday for the gruesome dog attack on a neighbor who was left bleeding
to death in a hallway of their upscale apartment building.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict is the first in which a California dog owner has been
convicted of murder in a mauling case.</LD>
<LD>   Marjorie Knoller and her husband, Robert Noel, were also found guilty
of involuntary manslaughter and of keeping the dog that killed
33-year-old lacrosse coach Diane Whipple last year.</LD>
<TE>   As the murder verdict against Knoller was read in a downtown Los
Angeles courtroom, she opened her eyes widely, sighed heavily and started
to cry. She turned toward her parents sitting in the audience and seemed
to mouth the word "help." Noel stared ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, placed her head in her hands and
wiped tears from her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no real joy in this, but certainly some measure of justice
was done for Diane today," Smith said later. "I was glad to see the jury
didn't buy some of the smoke screens that were put in front of them."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, could serve 15 years to life in state prison on the
murder conviction. Noel, 60, faces a sentence of four years in state
prison. Sentencing is scheduled for May 10 in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdicts, jurors said Knoller and Noel were clearly
responsible for allowing their two large Presa Canario dogs to attack
Whipple. They also said they did not trust Knoller, who testified on her
own behalf that she tried to stop the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "In our point of view, her testimony was not believable," said jury
foreman Don Newton, 64. "That was crucial to our decision in coming to
second-degree murder."</TE>
<TE>   Newton said the jurors disliked Noel, but that they based their
verdict on his carelessness with the dogs. "Robert Noel does not seem to
be a very nice person."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they were repulsed when they were shown a taped interview
the defendants gave on "Good Morning America" shortly after the attack.
In contrast to Knoller's tearful testimony in the trial, she spoke calmly
about the mauling during the interview and appeared to blame Whipple for
her own death.</TE>
<TE>   "It showed no remorse," said juror Shawn Antonio, 27. "And it was two
[weeks] after it happened . . . and there was no kind of sympathy, no
kind of apologies."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors also gave mixed reviews to the courtroom theatrics of Knoller's
lawyer Nedra Ruiz. During her opening statement, Ruiz crawled around the
courtroom to act out her client's behavior in the hallway the day of the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an amazingly dramatic person," Newton said. "She's an
incredible actress and I think to some extent she was counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   The case appears to break legal ground in assigning responsibility for
the actions of dangerous pets. Animal advocates praised the verdict
against Knoller as an important signal to those who do not control their
pets.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the behavior of the defendants made this an unusual
case.</TE>
<TE>   "One lesson from this case may be that if a tragedy happens, taking
responsibility is better than attacking the victim," said Laurie
Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>Victim's Mother Praises Jury's Verdicts</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, friends and the family of the victim praised the jury's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's mother, Penny Whipple-Kelly, said she was glad Knoller and
Noel would have to take responsibility for her daughter's death. "I'm
just glad the verdicts came out the way they did," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Atty. James Hammer said: "This jury did justice. . . .
This was the right thing to do, but it was a tough fight."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer also said he hopes "Diane Whipple's death will prevent other
people from dying, and that will be one small part of her legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's parents left the courthouse shortly after the verdict was
announced and did not comment. Knoller's defense attorney Ruiz, who
escorted them away, also refused to speak to reporters. Ruiz spoke to
Knoller's mother, repeatedly reassuring her that the conviction would be
appealed. Noel's lawyer, Bruce Hotchkiss, also did not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Keane, dean of the Golden State University law school, said he
was very surprised at the second-degree murder verdict. He said an
appellate court may question whether the evidence was sufficient to
warrant a murder verdict.</TE>
<TE>   To convict on second-degree murder, jurors had to find that Knoller
acted with conscious disregard for human life.</TE>
<TE>   But Keane added that Knoller's lawyer presented a poor case.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense attorney never gave the jury a reason for why the
incident was not a second-degree murder," he said. "Her closing argument
as a whole was rambling and incoherent, theatrical and emotional."</TE>
<TE>   As for the lesser counts of involuntary manslaughter and keeping a
mischievous dog that killed, Keane said he agreed with the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an easy one," he said. "The prosecutors could have phoned
that in."</TE>
<TE>   Levenson said several prosecution witnesses who testified about other
incidents involving the dogs bolstered the case against the two
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutors had much stronger facts than in most dog mauling
cases. Normally you don't have owners with 30 prior incidents warning
them," Levenson said. "Step after step, Knoller made the wrong move,
going on 'GMA,' having her lawyer attack the victim, having her lawyer
attack the judge."</TE>
<TE>   Whipple died Jan. 26, 2001, after being attacked outside her Pacific
Heights apartment by the two dogs.</TE>
<TE>   She was returning from a trip to the grocery store and was trying to
enter her apartment when the dogs, each weighing more than 100 pounds,
charged her.</TE>
<TE>   Bane, the larger of the two, knocked Whipple down and bit and
scratched her from head to toe. Bane tore at Whipple's throat while the
second dog, Hera, ripped her clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller testified that she tried to save Whipple by yanking Bane's
leash, yelling at the dog and placing herself in harm's way by lying on
top of the victim. There were no witnesses, but a woman from across the
hall testified that she heard growling, barking and pleas for help.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrived, they found Whipple naked, covered in blood and
trying to crawl toward her door. She died at San Francisco General
Hospital from blood loss and asphyxiation.</TE>
<TE>   The brutal attack stunned and angered San Franciscans and prompted
hundreds of complaints about other dogs to the district attorney's office
and animal control officials.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's death also initiated a national debate on the responsibility
of dog owners and landlords. Wrongful-death civil cases are pending
against Knoller and Noel and the building owners.</TE>
<TE>Grand Jury Returned Murder Indictment</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco grand jury indicted the couple in March 2001. Even
though prosecutors sought only involuntary manslaughter charges, the
grand jury also returned the second-degree murder indictment against
Knoller.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators linked the dogs to an illegal dog-breeding operation run
by two members of a white supremacist prison gang serving time at Pelican
Bay State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel had represented the inmates, Paul Schneider, and Dale
Bretches.</TE>
<TE>   After the attack, the lawyers adopted Schneider, who is serving a life
sentence without the possibility of parole for attempted murder and
aggravated assault while in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The case was moved to Los Angeles because of intense publicity in the
Bay Area. The couple have been in jail since they were indicted. The two
dogs were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   During the five-week trial, the courtroom was packed with Whipple's
friends, Knoller's parents and a crowd of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors presented 40 witnesses, arguing that Whipple died because
the defendants arrogantly ignored warnings about their dogs' dangerous
nature.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors, dog walkers and postal workers testified about terrifying
encounters with the dogs. Smith told jurors that Whipple was bitten by
one of the dogs a month before the fatal attack.</TE>
<TE>   In their closing arguments, prosecutors held up a cast of Bane's teeth
and insisted that the defendants should be convicted because they knew
their dogs were more dangerous than loaded guns and that it was only a
matter of time until they killed.</TE>
<TE>   They called the defendants arrogant liars, and discredited Knoller's
account of the mauling, saying that she would have been injured more
severely had she been on top of Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys presented 28 witnesses and argued that the attack
was a tragic accident and that their clients could never have anticipated
that their dogs would kill. Their witnesses included restaurant owners
and veterinarians who said the dogs were normally well-behaved and
friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys urged jurors to acquit in their closing arguments,
saying that their clients had not been warned about the dangers of the
dogs because nobody had complained to police or animal control officers.</TE>
<TE>   The defense case hung on the credibility of Knoller, who sobbed as she
told jurors that she tried to shield Whipple from the dogs. Her attorney
showed jurors Knoller's ripped clothing and enlarged photographs of her
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller denied that her dogs were dangerous and said the couple walked
their pets all around San Francisco and had never had a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Noel, who arrived home after the attack, did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors were partially sequestered. They began deliberating Tuesday
morning and asked to rehear statements Noel had made to the grand jury
about the dogs' aggression before reaching verdicts on four of the five
counts Wednesday afternoon. They reached a decision on the final
count--second-degree murder for Knoller--just after 10 a.m. Thursday. The
verdicts were read at 1:45 p.m.</TE>
<TE>A Warning to Owners of Vicious Animals</TE>
<TE>   The case had a major impact on the city of San Francisco. Mayor Willie
Brown issued a statement praising the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Ms. Smith, the family and the friends of Ms. Whipple find some
comfort in this outcome," Brown said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Friedman, director of San Francisco Animal Care and Control,
called the trial "a wake-up call for people who own aggressive animals."</TE>
<TE>   "It means people will have to do everything they can to work with
their animals to control their aggression," he said. "There is no upside
to this case. Ms. Whipple is dead. The family is devastated, the dogs
have been killed and the defendants are going to be in jail."</TE>

<HD>Army and Rebel Clashes Intensify in Philippines</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.S. presence--and aid--gives Manila an edge over the
diminishing guerrilla force.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISABELA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>The voice, tense and urgent, crackled over Capt. Harold Cabunoc's
radio with the news that fighting had begun.</LD>
<LD>   "It's ongoing! It's ongoing!" came the raw-edged words from the battle
zone Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   As the Philippine army officer called for an estimate of enemy
strength, four U.S. Special Forces soldiers and three Philippine
servicemen scrambled aboard a jeep and headed off hurriedly.</LD>
<TE>   The latest battle with Islamic rebels was underway along this remote
front of America's global war against terrorism--the southern Philippine
island of Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules of the mission, U.S. forces can advise, assist and
train Philippine units but are not supposed to engage in direct combat.
They may shoot in self-defense, but there was no indication that
Americans came under fire while helping rescue Philippine forces in
Thursday's clash.</TE>
<TE>   The encounter with members of the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf
began about five miles west of Isabela, the provincial capital, around
midmorning and continued until well after dark. Philippine military
authorities described it as one of the most intense battles in recent
months with the rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   One Philippine officer involved in the fighting claimed that the
troops had encountered parts of the Abu Sayyaf's main group of fighters,
including those holding U.S. hostages Martin and Gracia Burnham. The Abu
Sayyaf is also holding a Philippine nurse, Deborah Yap. There were also
reports that garments, apparently belonging to Gracia Burnham, were
recovered from the scene of the initial fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine military sources said late Thursday that their forces
killed at least three rebels in the firefight but that more bodies might
be found today. Seven Philippine soldiers were reportedly wounded in the
fighting and were evacuated with U.S. help to a hospital in the city of
Zamboanga on the nearby large island of Mindanao.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's fighting marked the latest in a series of deadly skirmishes
between Philippine forces and the Abu Sayyaf. With four rebels dead in
fighting earlier this week and an unknown number killed in heavy fighting
last Friday, the results of Thursday's encounter make it an especially
costly week for the extremist guerrilla group.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine military officials estimated that the total Abu Sayyaf
strength on Basilan--700 fighters at its peak slightly more than a year
ago--was down to between 80 and 100 rebels before the recent spate of
fighting began. A far larger group of several hundred Abu Sayyaf fighters
is believed to be on the nearby island of Jolo.</TE>
<TE>   Many here view the fighting of the last week as a clear sign that
momentum in the decade-old struggle to crush the Abu Sayyaf is clearly
beginning to swing in the government's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not allowing them to rest," declared army Col. Alexander Aleo,
commander of the estimated 3,500 Philippine armed forces deployed on
Basilan. "I'm expecting a series of new encounters in the days ahead."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces Lt. Col. David Maxwell said, "Things are going
well."</TE>
<TE>   Both officers were interviewed at a military headquarters complex in a
jungle clearing on the outer fringes of Isabela just before the outbreak
of Thursday's fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The extremists, whose political demands include the expulsion of all
Christians and the creation of an Islamic state in the southern region of
the country, have more recently become notorious for resorting to
kidnappings as a way to finance their struggle. Yap and the two American
missionaries are only the latest in a series of victims seized by the
rebels in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government claims that the group has links with the Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine authorities have failed to crush the Abu Sayyaf since it
first launched its campaign of terror in the southern region a decade
ago, but the arrival of 660 U.S. Special Forces in the country last month
has visibly changed the balance of the fight, according to military and
civilian sources in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Such an assessment is surprising considering that only 160 Americans
are deployed on Basilan itself and the rules governing their deployment
limit their movement in combat situations. Still, the technology that
U.S. forces have brought with them, including high-tech aerial
surveillance equipment that can track enemy movements beneath the
island's thick jungle canopy even at night, has been pivotal in locating
rebel groups.</TE>
<TE>   "The numerous encounters of recent days is the result of American
intelligence," said Maj. Noel Detoyato, a Philippine armed forces
spokesman based in Zamboanga. "We can track where these guys go now,
where they retreat."</TE>
<TE>   Detoyato and other Philippine officers said the U.S. ability to
evacuate wounded soldiers by helicopter even at night had boosted troop
morale enormously.</TE>
<TE>   "They know that even if they are wounded at night, their chances of
survival is great," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That capability was demonstrated in the early hours Saturday, when a
seriously wounded Philippine soldier was evacuated from a battle zone on
Basilan to a hospital in Zamboanga in only 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, we would have had to evacuate him by boat, and that would
have taken so long the soldier probably would have died," said Aleo, the
Philippine army colonel.</TE>
<TE>   There are also signs that the rebels are weakening.</TE>
<TE>   Aleo noted that most encounters are now with relatively small groups
of rebels, an indication that the Abu Sayyaf's leaders have decided to
divide their followers into more mobile bands to evade the increasingly
intense pursuit. Aleo also said there is evidence that the guerrillas,
who once received supplies by boat from neighboring islands, are now
sending relatives to buy supplies in local markets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're blockading them," Aleo said. "Their supply lines have been cut
off."</TE>
<TE>   An additional indicator of the group's predicament came in the body
count that followed Monday's encounter: One of those killed in the
fighting was said to be 13.</TE>

<HD>A Cold War on Embryo Adoptions</HD>
<DH>Transfers that help infertile couples have kids likely are the next
flash point in the abortion debate. Rights advocates are in a tough
position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just before Lucinda Borden became pregnant, doctors gave her a
photograph of the embryos they were about to place in her womb. They
looked delicate and vulnerable, like bubbles that might suddenly pop. "I
could not take my eyes off the photo," Borden said. "They looked so
fragile to me."</LD>
<LD>   And yet, the embryos already had survived 18 months in frozen storage
and a trip across the country to California. A couple at a Delaware
fertility clinic had made more embryos than they needed to build a
family. Unwilling to destroy the extras, they donated them to Borden and
her husband, John, who were unable to conceive a child on their own.</LD>
<LD>   Today, 17-month-old Luke and Mark Borden are part of a brewing debate
over the human embryo. But not for the way they were born. Doctors have
been quietly transferring embryos between willing couples for years, and
experts say the number of resulting children could be in the hundreds.</LD>
<TE>   The provocative part of their arrival came well before Lucinda Borden
became pregnant. She and John submitted to criminal background checks,
allowed social workers to inspect their home and asked friends to vouch
for their fitness as parents--steps that would have been necessary if
they had adopted not embryos but children.</TE>
<TE>   The screening was not required by law, and it cost the Bordens $4,500.
But by encouraging couples such as the Bordens to go through steps
similar to adoption, conservative and antiabortion groups are trying to
elevate the legal and moral status of the embryo in society.</TE>
<TE>   Embryo transfers, in fact, are poised to become the next big
battlefield in the abortion debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that I adopted children--babies--and not some dot on
the page," said Lucinda Borden, an accountant and seminary student from
Fontana who describes herself as a devout Christian. "At the moment they
were created, they received a soul from God. I just adopted them at a
very young stage." Her embryo transfer and background screening were
arranged by a traditional adoption agency that has begun working with
embryos.</TE>
<TE>   The issue raises some particularly thorny questions for abortion
rights advocates. Some are open to laws that protect the children that
result from embryo transfers. But they worry that those laws might
undermine abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   In most states, a lack of laws regarding embryos has led doctors and
lawyers to treat them like blood and body organs, which can be freely
donated, or like cars and real estate, with ownership transferred by
contract. Most fertility doctors talk of "embryo donations," reflecting
the view that embryos are property, not people. One prominent exception
is Louisiana, where state law says a human embryo outside the womb has
some of the same legal rights as a person.</TE>
<TE>   Now, to the chagrin of abortion rights groups and some advocates for
fertility patients, a growing number of antiabortion activists are
calling for state adoption laws to cover embryos, a change that might
give embryos the same legal status as children.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that we buy and sell and donate property, but we adopt
people," said Samuel B. Casey, chief executive of the Christian Legal
Society, a legal assistance network of Christian lawyers. Promoting
adoption for embryos, he said, is part of his group's effort "to win for
the human embryo, step by step, a recognition of its humanity."</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, antiabortion groups are backing legislation to authorize
a study of embryo adoptions, with an eye toward putting adoption
requirements into state law. In Washington, Kenneth Connor, president of
the conservative Family Research Council, said requiring embryo transfers
to be conducted as adoptions soon might become a legislative priority for
his group.</TE>
<TE>   Casey said the Christian Legal Society had tapped its network of
lawyers to examine adoption laws in all 50 states. "We want to see if
reforms are necessary so that in every state human embryos may be adopted
in the same fashion that born children are adopted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some abortion rights advocates believe that children born from
embryo transfers deserve certain protections offered to those in
traditional adoptions. In adoption, for example, the state makes an
effort to ensure that children do not go to abusive homes.</TE>
<TE>   And yet that same protection, if assigned to embryos, could help
antiabortion groups one day build a case that embryos and fetuses have
rights that supersede a woman's right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>Advocates Fear Erosion of Abortion Rights</TE>
<TE>   Similar concerns have surrounded "fetal homicide" laws, which allow
prosecutors in many states to treat an unborn child as a victim in
violent crime. "We're worried that . . . a Supreme Court justice
surveying the landscape will say there's a new social consensus that
recognizes that embryos are people and will use that to deny the right to
abortion," said Betsy Cavendish, legal director at the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the attention to embryo transfers, the procedure remains
uncommon. Doctors say few fertility patients like the idea of allowing
their embryos to become children in other families, and many fertility
clinics report doing no more than one or two transfers a year. But that
could change. With fertility services booming, thousands of patients each
year are left with more embryos than they intend to use to build their
own families.</TE>
<TE>   The embryos are created as part of in-vitro fertilization, in which
sperm and eggs are mixed in a laboratory dish in an attempt to create
"test-tube babies." Most often, the spare embryos are frozen in case the
patients need them for another attempt at pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   But many embryos are frozen and never used. Patients sometimes have
the extras destroyed. A small number donate them to research on embryonic
stem cells, which may one day lead to new treatments for disease. Others
make no decision at all, leaving their embryos in a frozen limbo. No one
has solid numbers, but tens of thousands of embryos are thought to be
sitting in cold storage at fertility clinics.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides of the abortion debate, there is wide support for
helping patients give their spare embryos to other infertile couples.</TE>
<TE>   Congress this year set aside $1 million to publicize the option. And
in several states, lawmakers have eased the way for transfers by
clarifying who has parental rights when a child is the genetic creation
of one couple but is born to another.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is not adoption," said Pamela Madsen, director of the
American Infertility Assn., a New York-based patient advocacy group. "No
one is giving up a bouncing baby boy or girl. That's not saying that
these cells aren't important and sacred. But they're not babies."</TE>
<TE>   She cautioned that if embryos gain greater legal standing, patients
one day could lose the right to control the fate of their own embryos.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the most prominent force in the adoption movement is an
Orange County agency that believes every embryo has an inherent right to
a chance at becoming a child.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, Nightlight Christian Adoptions of Fullerton has been
matching people who have embryos with people who want them, an extension
of its 40-year experience with traditional adoptions. Its work is
controversial, partly because it requires a process similar to adoption
for embryos and partly because of its conservative Christian philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   To Nightlight, the thousands of fertility clinic embryos are like
children locked in frozen orphanages. "Our No. 1 goal is to help the
embryos, to put the question of whether the embryo lives or dies back in
the hands of God," said Ron Stoddard, the former corporate lawyer who
leads the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Nightlight also argues that by bringing frozen embryos to term it is
showing why they should never be destroyed, even for stem cell or cloning
research that may one day yield treatments for disease.</TE>
<TE>   To Lori Maze, who supervises embryo adoptions at Nightlight, the proof
of that argument is laid out on her office floor. Arranged in rows are
the framed photographs of 11 children, including the Borden twins, all
born from embryo transfers supervised by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put a face on the human embryo," Maze said recently, gesturing
at the photos of infants and toddlers. "Our work proves that these
embryos are in fact children waiting to be born. They deserve protection
because they are human beings."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 52 genetic parents have been matched with 37 adopting
families. Not every transfer to the womb results in a pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>Adoption Agency Deals Mainly With Christians</TE>
<TE>   The Nightlight program, called Snowflakes, became known in the
conservative Christian community after its first client appeared on the
"Focus on the Family" radio program, which claims more than 7 million
American listeners weekly, and in Christianity Today magazine. Today,
about 80% of families who receive embryos through Nightlight are
Christian, as are many who offer them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to us that whoever adopted our embryos were
Christians," said Amy Weippert of Hutchinson, Kan., whose embryos,
created with her husband, Dallas, were recently placed with a Georgia
couple. "If you have a relationship with Jesus, it guarantees you a peace
and happiness. I want my children--whether I raise them or someone else
raises them--to gain peace and to have that relationship with the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   Nightlight also believes in "open" adoptions, in which the genetic and
adopting parents exchange health and other information. The agency
strongly encourages ongoing contact between the families, in case medical
or emotional issues ever arise.</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely encourage that children know they're adopted and know
their history," said JoAnn Davidson, a Nightlight staff member. "It's who
they are. It's the core of their being."</TE>
<TE>   Lucinda Borden knows that feeling. She was adopted as an infant, and
the identity of her birth parents was kept from her.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up with a mom who was terrified of me finding my birth parents
and worried that I would choose them over her," Borden said recently, as
Luke and Mark wrestled in the living room for control of a stuffed
animal. "That's why I thought I would never adopt a child. I didn't want
to have the same scenario with my own kids."</TE>
<TE>   Even after struggling for years with infertility, she ruled out
adoption. She tried to convince herself that John's children and
grandchildren from a first marriage were fulfilling enough.</TE>
<TE>In Touch, With Some Measure of Separation</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1997 she made contact with her birth mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I found her, I knew the fears of my adopted mom were unfounded
and that I didn't have to choose," Borden said. Realizing that she could
love both sets of parents helped open her to the idea of adopting a child
herself.</TE>
<TE>   The Bordens looked into several adoption agencies before choosing
Nightlight, the agency that had placed Lucinda with her adoptive parents
nearly 35 years earlier. Nightlight told them about the option of
adopting an embryo instead of a child.</TE>
<TE>   Lucinda saw it as a chance to become a birth mother, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Nightlight matched the Bordens with Donna and Timothy Zane, a Maryland
couple whose own journey through the maze of reproductive techniques had
given them triplets--Amanda, TJ and Parker--and left them with six frozen
embryos.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, a Delaware clinic sent the six embryos by overnight
carrier to a clinic near the Bordens. Three did not survive the thawing
process. The remaining three were transferred to Lucinda Borden, who
still mourns the fact that one failed to implant and grow.</TE>
<TE>   The Bordens and Zanes opted to stay in contact during the pregnancy
and beyond. When Luke and Mark were born, it was an emotional experience
for the Zanes. They now had genetic children growing up on the other side
of the country, and their triplets had a new pair of genetic siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially with the very first photographs, I was looking to see if
these little boys looked like our own children," Donna Zane said. "And
they didn't, and that was a relief."</TE>
<TE>   The Bordens and their twins have visited the Zanes and the families
get on well. But Donna Zane is happy that they live on opposite coasts.
"They're raising their children, we're raising our children, and there is
a separation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Both families plan to tell their children, once they're grown, that
they share a genetic history. If they choose to meet, that will be fine.</TE>
<TE>   But while the Zanes and Bordens easily agreed on how to conduct the
adoption, they have different views of the embryo.</TE>
<TE>   The Bordens oppose the use of embryos in stem cell research and even
argued against it before Congress last year, presenting Luke and Mark as
part of their testimony. The Zanes, however, support research using
embryonic stem cells, even though it ends the life of the embryo.</TE>
<TE>   "We donated six embryos. We didn't view it as six babies," Donna Zane
said. "We didn't want to donate our embryos for research. But if some
couples want to, then that's OK."</TE>

<HD>Peru to Tighten Security for Bush</HD>
<DH>South America: Authorities vow crackdown on terrorist groups after
blast kills 9 near U.S. Embassy days before president's visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo promised a crackdown on
terrorist groups Thursday and officials closed off parts of central Lima
in the wake of a bomb blast that killed nine people near the U.S. Embassy
in Peru. The attack came three days before a visit by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   No Americans were killed in the blast late Wednesday, which injured
dozens and left debris scattered in the street outside the embassy. The
White House said Bush's visit would proceed Saturday as scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure the president there did everything he can to make Lima safe
for our trip," Bush said from the Oval Office. "Two-bit terrorists aren't
going to prevent me from doing what we need to do, and that is to promote
our friendship in the hemisphere."</LD>
<TE>   The car bomb exploded in front of a bank about 100 yards from the
embassy, a fortress-like concrete structure in an upscale neighborhood in
Lima, the Peruvian capital. The bank and a shopping center took the brunt
of the blast, which left shattered corpses strewn across a parking lot
and street.</TE>
<TE>   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing. Thirty minutes before
the explosion, an anonymous caller phoned in a tip to Peruvian security
officials, according to press reports. Three officers of a unit assigned
to protect diplomats were inspecting the car--smoke was drifting from its
interior, apparently from a burning fuse--when it exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the officers were killed, and the third was seriously injured.
The dead included a young man who was skating past the exploding car and
three people inside the Banco de Credito bank.</TE>
<TE>   The embassy, protected by a high wall and set back far from the
street, suffered no damage.</TE>
<TE>   Peruvian investigators said the bombing was similar to attacks by
leftist guerrilla groups such as Sendero Luminoso in the 1980s and 1990s.
A smaller bomb blast shook a Spanish-owned telephone company outside Lima
on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The courageous Peruvian people will not allow terrorism to return in
Peru," Toledo said Thursday at a U.N. development conference in
Monterrey, Mexico. "My government will use an iron fist [against the
perpetrators], and with the other it will apply the law."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said he would return to Lima from the conference a day early.
Early Thursday, Toledo's Cabinet met in emergency session in Lima and
First Vice President Raul Diez Canseco toured the scene of the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "We will use all resources to find those responsible," Diez Canseco
said.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Fernando Rospigliosi told Peruvian radio that any of
a number of groups or individuals may have carried out the attack. "The
international terrorism situation is so complex right now that we can't
rule anything out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The last major Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, bombing in Lima was
in 1997. In the years since, the Maoist guerrilla group has been largely
defeated, its once formidable forces reduced to a few hundred troops
active in Peru's remote Amazon jungle.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Peruvian officials said they had thwarted an attempt by
Sendero Luminoso to bomb the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators estimated that Wednesday night's bomb was made with up
to 110 pounds of explosives. The force of the blast carved a hole into
the asphalt and blew one body more than 150 feet across a four-lane
avenue.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, authorities in Lima closed off the streets around the
presidential palace, where Bush is scheduled to meet with Toledo, the
presidents of Colombia and Bolivia, and the vice president of Ecuador to
discuss regional trade and the campaigns against leftist rebels and the
drug trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Peruvian government has said it will also ban air traffic over
Lima during Bush's 17-hour visit and take other extraordinary security
measures. About 7,000 police will guard the area around the presidential
palace.</TE>

<HD>China Cracking Down in Muslim Region, Group Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FENGLOU, China
</DL>
<LD>Under cover of the war on terrorism, the Chinese government has
significantly stepped up its crackdown against alleged separatists in the
western region of Xinjiang since Sept. 11, a human rights group charges.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have shut down mosques, detained thousands of people
deemed suspected separatists and clamped tighter controls on the local
media to discourage unrest among the indigenous Uighur population,
according to a report released today by Amnesty International.</LD>
<LD>   The Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim people, many of whom
chafe under Chinese rule and some of whom advocate independence. For
years, the Beijing regime has tried to crush separatist sentiment in the
region, a vast, sparsely populated area rich in natural resources and
closer in culture and heritage to Central Asian nations such as
Uzbekistan.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Chinese government has
sought to link its campaign in Xinjiang to the worldwide war on
terrorism. Two months ago, Beijing issued a report purporting to show
direct ties between Uighur separatists and Osama bin Laden, who it says
promised the separatists a "fabulous sum" of money for their operations.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department report on human rights this month criticized
China's campaign to smash separatism in Xinjiang. The Bush administration
has refused to recognize a connection between the crackdown and the
global war on terrorism, prompting accusations of a double standard from
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government's report said that authorities were targeting
only "a few core members and criminals," Muslim militants accused of
plotting bombing, arson and poisoning incidents responsible for the
deaths of 162 people between 1990 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But Amnesty International alleges that a much broader crackdown is
being carried out.</TE>
<TE>   Armed police have been mobilized across Xinjiang to beef up patrols of
cities and surveillance of entry points into the region, resulting in the
detention of several thousand people, the report says. In the regional
capital, Urumqi, alone, at least 166 "violent terrorists" and "other
criminals" were arrested between Sept. 20 and Nov. 30, the report says,
citing accounts in the official Chinese media.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown has also extended into the religious sphere, despite
China's nominal guarantee of freedom of religion in its constitution,
Amnesty International says.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Muslim clerics and students have been detained, and mosques
accused of being hives of separatist thought and activity have been
closed down, the report alleges. Fasting was disallowed in some schools
and government offices during the holy month of Ramadan, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Censors have stepped up monitoring of the Internet, and officials are
cracking down on literature and media, Amnesty International says.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern, the report says, are the summary trials of
detainees that have led to scores of people being sentenced to prison and
in some cases executed, often on the basis of expanded but vague
anti-terrorist laws.</TE>
<TE>   Just two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, 48 Uighurs were charged
with political offenses and sentenced at a public rally in the western
city of Kashgar, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Beijing regime has said it will root out die-hard
militants but show leniency toward those who it says are duped into
supporting them.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference this month during the annual session of China's
largely powerless parliament, the National People's Congress, the
governor of Xinjiang told reporters that the Chinese government was
engaged in an extensive education campaign to increase patriotism among
his constituents.</TE>

army said retreating rebels took refuge in the neighboring South American
country.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, guerrillas have occupied a pumping station at a reservoir
in Colombia's southern Andes, cutting the water supply to more than
500,000 people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen army soldiers and 21 rebels from the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, have been killed in the fighting, which
erupted Wednesday near the town of Tibu and was continuing Thursday.
Twelve soldiers were injured.</LD>
<TE>   It was the heaviest combat since peace talks with the FARC collapsed
last month when the rebels stepped up their attacks on Colombia's
civilian infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Martin Orlando Carreno said the rebels fled into Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   The move on the water reservoir late last week, reported only
Thursday, was a sharp escalation in a month-old rebel campaign to
paralyze Colombia's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Bush administration asked Congress on Thursday for
an additional $29 million to help Colombia combat terrorist kidnappings
and expand the reach of its police in a former FARC haven.</TE>
<TE>   The request also seeks to end curbs that limit U.S. military
assistance to counter-narcotics activities.</TE>

<HD>Poverty Conference Chastises Rich</HD>
<DH>Summit: Despite proposed aid increases, leaders meeting in Mexico
say wealthy nations are not doing enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTERREY, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>Led by host President Vicente Fox, leaders meeting here Thursday at
a U.N. conference on poverty condemned the world's richest countries for
not doing enough to ease the plight of the poor.</LD>
<LD>   The world's efforts to confront the problem of development and poverty
have been "poor, late and disheartening," Fox said, setting the tone for
a round of morning speeches at the United Nations Conference on Financing
for Development.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean said the legacy of 15 years of open markets in the hemisphere
has been "large-scale frustration" instead of the jobs and higher living
standards that were promised.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole issue of development has to be put on the table again,"
economist Jose Antonio Ocampo, the commission's executive secretary, said
in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   So strong is the consensus that aid programs must be increased, World
Bank President James D. Wolfensohn said, the issue is no longer one of
vision but one of implementation--how to deliver any expanded assistance
to the countries that need them.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has proposed adding $5 billion to its annual
aid to poor nations by 2006, and the European Union hopes to increase its
pledges by $7 billion annually over that period.</TE>
<TE>   Aid has become a popular cause as countries have realized that freer
trade and greater foreign investment alone are not improving the lot of
impoverished nations, Ocampo said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a flood of direct foreign investment over the last decade
totaling $400 billion, economic growth in Latin America since 1998 has
averaged only 1.5% a year, far short of the 4% that economists say is the
minimum necessary to fight poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Although applauded for its proposed aid increase, the Bush
administration has been stung by criticism that it still is not doing
enough. The EU's aid commitment represents 0.39% of its economic output,
about three times the U.S. commitment when measured as a fraction of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush arrived in Monterrey on Thursday afternoon and huddled
with Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in a meeting of North
American Free Trade Agreement partners. Bush is to address the full forum
today.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech here Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said an
additional $50 billion in annual aid is needed to address problems of
health care and education, or double the amount now given to poor
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Before cutting short his visit and returning home Thursday, creating a
minor stir among his Mexican hosts, Cuban President Fidel Castro
condemned the world economy as a "giant casino" in which the losers are
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It has reached such extremes that the combined wealth of the world's
three richest people equal the economic output of the 48 poorest
countries," Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Life expectancy in wealthy nations is 30 years longer than in
sub-Saharan Africa, Castro added.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to account for the growing consensus among rich nations that
their aid to poor countries should increase, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul
H. O'Neill said: "This is a process that was begun two years ago. . . .
There is a consensus that the world needs to do more about raising living
standards of poor people everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The United States will apply benchmarks to measure the effectiveness
of its aid, O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about setting [conditions] that most countries are going to
want to meet," O'Neill said. "Who wants to sign up to be in the
left-behinds?"</TE>

<HD>In France, Police Morale Sinks Amid Sea Change</HD>
<DH>Europe: Reforms in law enforcement have left officers feeling
vulnerable as attacks increase. Many say criminals are getting away with
murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARGENTEUIL, France
</DL>
<LD>These days, France is a tough place to be a cop.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 miles from L'Etoile (The Star), the Parisian plaza where the
Arc de Triomphe crowns a magnificent cityscape, three police officers
venture warily into a high-rise housing project known as La Dalle--the
Slab.</LD>
<LD>   The 25 towers on a concrete esplanade here in Argenteuil, a
working-class suburb of 140,000, are part of a gloomy wall of 1970s-era
projects around Paris that are outposts of gangs and drugs. Leaving their
cars out of range of balconies and rooftops from which youths bombard
police with rocks and bricks, the officers descend into a grotto of
abandoned garages. Their flashlights illuminate a subterranean cemetery
of torched vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   The officers plod through garbage and puddles and talk shop: There
were three arson attacks on police substations last year. Threatening
graffiti announce officers' home addresses to the world. A suspect told a
plainclothesman that he knew where the officer's wife worked and that she
would pay for his arrest. Mobs surround squad cars in melees that echo of
May 1999, when two weeks of riots shook the Slab.</TE>
<TE>   "For these kids, the only authorities are their parents and their big
brothers,' said Maj. Jacques Richard, a spry and bespectacled 27-year
veteran. "They don't want to listen to any other authority, not a
policeman, not a teacher. The police are not respected. That's why we've
had a lot of injured cops."</TE>
<TE>   It is a time of discontent for French police. Crime was up 7.6% in
2001, continuing a trend marked by what police union officials say was a
fourfold increase in physical and verbal assaults on officers in the last
five years. Last year, more than 600 officers were attacked while on
duty.</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious attempts to reform hidebound laws and policing strategies
have left officers feeling vulnerable and convinced that criminals are
getting away with murder. Politicians seem out of touch with the street,
officers say. Though crime is the top issue in a nascent presidential
campaign, the Paris City Council in December named Mumia Abu-Jamal, a
convicted U.S. cop-killer and a death penalty cause celebre, as an
honorary citizen of Paris--a distinction last bestowed on Picasso.</TE>
<TE>   Resentment in the ranks boiled over in November. National police
officers held demonstrations across the country. Then came the turn of
the gendarmerie, the force that patrols rural areas. The size of the
protests by the disciplined gendarmes, who belong to the military and are
barred from demonstrating, was startling. The gendarmes ended up in a
tense but nonviolent face-off with riot police near the Arc de Triomphe.</TE>
<TE>   Many demonstrators wore jackets adorned with targets and the slogan
"We are not rabbits," a sardonic reference to the killings of officers,
which eventually numbered eight for the year, and the idea that cops have
become easy prey.</TE>
<TE>2 Officers Slain</TE>
<TE>   The most outrageous case was the ambush slaying in October of two
officers responding to a home invasion. Suspect Jean-Claude Bonnal, an
ex-convict accused of killing four civilians two weeks earlier in a
holdup, had been released on bail the previous December--even though he
was awaiting trial for a department store robbery that left nine wounded.
Adding insult to injury, when a police union leader criticized the
release and called Bonnal "dangerous," the suspect sued him for
defamation.</TE>
<TE>   "This case was aberrant, and it's what really set off the protests,"
said Jean-Paul Nury, a leader of Synergie Officiers, a police union.
"What we are saying is: Stop. Fear has crossed the street. Instead of the
crooks being scared, the cops are scared."</TE>
<TE>   The most worrisome trends are a spreading drug-and-thug culture,
especially among young men of North African descent, and the increased
presence of assault rifles and other heavy weapons smuggled from the
Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   Recent cases display a high-caliber gangsterism that seems out of
place in genteel Western Europe. Drug traffickers stormed a police
station in Les Sables d'Olonne, on the Atlantic Coast, on March 2 and
held a female gendarme hostage in a failed attempt to recover more than
700 pounds of cocaine. And 13 gunmen using explosives stole more than 1
million euros from an armored car depot in Paris two days later, injuring
a policeman in a shootout.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the specter of Islamic terrorism hovers over high-crime
neighborhoods with large Muslim populations. Extremists in mosques and
prisons have recruited thousands of undercover warriors who have been
trained by Al Qaeda and other networks, according to anti-terrorism
officials.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Sept. 11 attacks do not appear to have sparked street
tension the way the Palestinian uprising has in the past. And violence
transcends ethnicity and income. Rage against police flares in rural
towns as well as cities, during routine traffic stops as well as felony
interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 55-year-olds who insult us and assault us," said Emmanuel
Roux, a 34-year-old commander in Argenteuil. "It's as if nobody wanted to
respect social rules. In all areas of social behavior, the respect for
rules is disintegrating bit by bit, like old cement."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, France remains less violent than the United States. In
2000, this nation of 60 million recorded 1,051 homicides compared with
1,000 in Los Angeles County. Rising crime in France results partly,
according to experts, from increased reporting by victims and from a
surge in street rip-offs of cellular phones--a frightening but usually
not fatal experience.</TE>
<TE>   So why the malaise among flics, as French police are called?</TE>
<TE>   In a nation where conservative and revolutionary currents long have
coexisted uneasily and people generally resist change, the police are
caught in a cross-fire generated by recent and profound reforms in law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the center-left government unveiled a neighborhood policing
program similar to those in the U.S. and elsewhere, promising to send
police into communities and work closely with mayors and the poor alike
to solve problems on the street.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, says Dominique Monjardet, a sociologist at the National
Center for Scientific Research, France has tried to tackle in four years
the reforms that have taken decades to carry out in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the mission is harder in France. Since 1941, the police have
been a paramilitary national force with a more aloof relationship to
municipalities and citizens than in Anglo-Saxon countries. Monjardet said
French police have always performed best in two areas: "public order,"
which refers to controlling street protests and political unrest; and
detective work against organized crime and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, basic patrol and crime prevention have been neglected, he
said. The officers abruptly ordered to walk beats and win hearts and
minds in long-neglected housing projects--many full of youths seething
with hatred of authority--tend to be rookies from small towns who find
Paris menacing, alien and harsh. They are strangers on strange turf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good reform, but they are trying to do it too fast," Monjardet
said. "For the police officers, the message is that you have been doing a
bad job. . . . They have been destabilized by rapid change. They went out
into the neighborhoods, and they were received with rocks."</TE>
<TE>   The new show of force also has collided with a flourishing drug trade,
with predictable results. Arrests and shootings in "sensitive zones"--the
elegant sociological label for bad neighborhoods--often ignite
mini-uprisings.</TE>
<TE>   "There were neighborhoods where the police did not spend enough time,"
said the cerebral Roux, who accompanies his espresso with Italian cookies
and presided over a 4% decrease in crime in Argenteuil last year. "Money
from drugs, vice and robberies is present, and the criminals don't want
the police there. So there was no violence. On the surface, everything
seemed fine. When you have this kind of [unofficial] peace, the return of
[official] order can cause trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Whether commanders or rookies, police say they are buffeted by
contradictory social demands as well. French citizens generally want and
expect government to play a central role in everyday life. People call
the police for every imaginable problem, Roux said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the media and the political left are often critical of the police.
Police union leader Nury calls it a "do-gooding soixante-huitard"
mentality, a reference to leftists who came of age during the protests of
1968. Members of that generation are in power, he said, and expressed
their ideology with a "presumption of innocence" law that has brought
bitter debate since taking effect last year.</TE>
<TE>   The law was designed to strengthen individual rights against an
inquisitorial justice culture that had created one of Europe's largest
populations of suspects jailed while awaiting trial or indictment. The
reform guarantees immediate access to a lawyer and other Miranda-type
safeguards.</TE>
<TE>Effect on System Decried</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, critics say the architects did not anticipate the
disruptive effect on a creaky justice system. Detectives have less time
to do the same amount of work needed to justify holding a suspect.
Procedural breakdowns sometimes cause the release of dangerous offenders
who in the past would have remained in jail, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Police also see aspects of the reform as insulting. They are required
to summon doctors to ensure that suspects were not abused. And the
government came up with sophisticated Web-cams to record questioning of
juveniles while officers struggle with outmoded computers and rattletrap
cars.</TE>
<TE>   "The police have the impression that the other links in the justice
chain are weak," Roux said. "There's a dire lack of resources, the
stations are shabby, the weapons are outmoded. And if that's not enough,
instead of helping the police, money and energy are spent to aid bandits.
That was very badly received."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of presidential elections in April, the government has pledged
to review the new law and to improve funding and salaries for officers.
On the street, though, police insist that they are concerned less about
money than about the onslaught of disrespect and aggression.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are supposed to be the final bulwark of the democracy,"
said Richard, a 53-year-old grandfather who worries about the future
facing his son, also a policeman. "What does this attitude, this increase
in violence, say about the democracy?"</TE>

<DL>GENEVA
</DL>
<LD>The World Health Organization has produced a list of companies
making safe AIDS drugs, a move that could bring down the price of
treatment in poor countries.</LD>
<LD>   But the organization representing major drug companies said Thursday
that the move could reduce the quality of treatment and lead to
widespread drug resistance.</LD>
<LD>   The WHO list, released Wednesday, named 41 drugs by eight
manufacturers that met its criteria for quality. It included products by
the Indian generic manufacturer Cipla as well as by major drug makers
such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Laboratories
and Roche Holding.</LD>
<TE>   "This U.N. initiative marks an important step in . . . improving the
procurement of these drugs for people living with HIV/AIDS in developing
countries," said Peter Piot, executive director of the United Nations'
AIDS agency.</TE>
<TE>   The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assns.,
however, said it did not think that some generic suppliers met acceptable
standards.</TE>
<TE>   But the WHO's Jonathan Quick said, "The process we used was according

<HD>Political Slaying Blamed on Basque Separatists</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain
</DL>
<LD>A Socialist town councilor was shot dead in a bar in northern Spain
on Thursday in an attack that politicians blamed on armed Basque
separatists, the first killing of the year attributed to the outlawed ETA
group.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Juan Priede Perez was shot at close range by two gunmen as
he stood in a bar a few yards from his home in the Basque coastal town of
Orio.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the Basque regional government, Juan Jose Ibarretxe,
described the killing as another "ETA barbarity."</LD>
<TE>   Priede, 69, was a widower with children. Police said that his two
bodyguards dropped him at his house for lunch but that he later left
alone to visit a neighborhood bar.</TE>
<TE>   "He was someone who had appeared on ETA's hit list," Rosa Diez, a
Socialist deputy in the European Parliament, told reporters. "He has been
murdered by these fascist cowards.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have killed him have to know they are going to pay for it,
that we are going to catch them. We are going to put a stop to ETA," she
added.</TE>
<TE>   The ETA, or Basque Homeland and Freedom, was recently listed by the
European Union as a terrorist organization. The ETA has killed more than
800 people since 1968 in its drive for an independent state in Basque
areas of northern Spain and southwestern France.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, speaking at a United Nations
development conference in Mexico, said terrorism was a "crime against
humanity." Referring to the attack in Spain as well as to those in other
countries, he said terrorism was destined to be defeated.</TE>
<TE>   The ETA was blamed for a March 2 explosion that also targeted a
Socialist party councilor, who lost a leg in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "ETA is trying to condition the political agenda, not just that of the
Socialists, but that of the Basque region in general," said Patxi Lopez,
another Socialist who is a candidate for secretary-general in regional
party elections.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Japan's prime minister began a three-day visit to South Korea on
Thursday that Seoul officials said was expected to focus on trade,
investment and the upcoming World Cup soccer tournament.</LD>

<HD>Group Says It Killed Italian Economist</HD>

<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>An offshoot of the Red Brigades terror group said Thursday that it
killed an Italian economist working on bitterly contested changes in
Italy's labor laws. The group also said the Sept. 11 attacks on the
United States were a model of effective terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   A 26-page communique portrayed the slaying of economist Marco Biagi as
part of a global struggle against what the group called "imperialism."
The document drew no links between the Italian group and the Al Qaeda
terrorists held responsible for the attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Biagi was gunned down Tuesday night outside his home in Bologna by two
men on a motorbike.</LD>
<TE>   A 52-year-old university professor, Biagi advocated loosening Italy's
labor market, one of the most rigid in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The original Red Brigades were responsible for a slew of killings of
politicians, businessmen and policemen in the 1970s and early 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Denver Police Spied on Activists, ACLU Says</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: An illegal search of a protest group's offices is alleged.
Officials call so-called spy files a necessity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>The American Civil Liberties Union charged Thursday that Denver
police illegally searched a local activist group's office and confiscated
membership lists to include them in the department's secret files.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which was amended Thursday in federal court here, is
connected to recent disclosures that an intelligence unit of the Denver
police has maintained files for years on protest groups. The so-called
spy files have been kept on individuals and organizations since 1999 and
include information gleaned from public rallies and meetings.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Department admitted it has files on about 3,200 individuals
and 208 organizations. It defends the practice, calling it a necessary
aspect of criminal intelligence.</LD>
<TE>Group Labeled 'Criminal Extremists'</TE>
<TE>   "The Denver police have no legitimate interest in keeping permanent
files on peaceful protest activities of law-abiding citizens," said Mark
Silverstein, legal director of the Colorado ACLU. Silverstein filed
Thursday's amendment to include allegations that his clients' group was
included in the files and labeled "criminal extremists."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU revealed the existence of the spy files last week. That
brought angry protests from a broad range of civic groups. This week
Denver Mayor Wellington Webb joined with the City Council in issuing a
nonbinding resolution that called for a curb on police power to gather
information on residents based on ethnicity, religion or politics.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, who claimed the FBI kept a file on him in the mid-1970s as he
became politically active in Colorado, said the police had overstepped
their bounds by maintaining intelligence files on law-abiding groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Have we done an exemplary job at tempering legitimate
intelligence-gathering versus collecting information on groups or
organizations that do not pose a threat? I think the answer is clearly
no," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's complaint states that on Dec. 14, 2000, officers from the
Denver and Golden police departments raided the offices of the Denver
Justice and Peace Committee, an organization that works for social
justice in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the raid, according to police, was to obtain evidence
in a case involving vandalism of a department store. Among the items
taken from the offices were membership phone and e-mail lists, phone-tree
lists and other rosters that included the names of 984 people.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU complaint states that police used the lists to call more than
100 people and question them about the vandalism case. None of those
called had any information about the case, the complaint said.
Silverstein said the police selected those they called based on their
political activities and associations.</TE>
<TE>   A Denver police spokesman did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>Quaker Group Was Targeted</TE>
<TE>   To many here, the issue is not just police surveillance of private
citizens but also that many appear to be targeted merely for associating
with groups or individuals that have a political agenda.</TE>
<TE>   According to city policy, the Police Department may only collect and
maintain a file on an individual if there is a "reasonable suspicion"
that that person is involved in criminal activity. The same standard
applies to religious and political groups.</TE>
<TE>   Among the organizations that Denver police labeled as "criminal
extremists" is the American Friends Service Committee, a nonviolent
Quaker organization that has won the Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, police kept files on citizens who attended events
sponsored by Amnesty International, and a demonstration organized by
Native American and Latino groups protesting the celebration of Columbus
Day.</TE>
<TE>   One group the police has kept tabs on is the Chiapas Coalition, which
supports the rights of indigenous people in southern Mexico. According to
the police file, the group is "dedicated to the overthrow of the Mexican
government."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Appel, co-founder of the group, called that characterization
"flat-out wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "I had an idea they were keeping tabs on us," Appel said. "Sometimes
the government surveillance teams and police would outnumber the
protesters at these events. You can always see them with their video and
still cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "But we didn't have any idea how they describe us and who they share
the information with. I'm shocked and angered to be labeled as a criminal
extremist. None of us have any criminal record. I don't think it makes a
person an extremist to be vigorous in the defense of human rights, peace
and justice," Appel said.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of secret files has shocked civil libertarians and
activists, who also have raised the question of which other police or
governmental agencies have access to the files.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Webb, who had been unaware that the files existed, said an
independent review of them is likely. Webb said the spy files could be
audited and purged on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the spy files have been made part of the ACLU's suit, it is
highly unlikely they will be destroyed, Silverstein said.</TE>

<HD>Starr Will Help Fight Finance Reform</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former independent counsel will help lead a senator's
suit against the expected law. The move signals the next phase in a long
battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Kenneth W. Starr, whose investigation of President Clinton led to
his impeachment, will help manage the legal team named Thursday to
challenge the campaign finance bill that President Bush has pledged to
sign into law.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has said he will be the lead
plaintiff in a lawsuit against the measure, also announced that several
other prominent lawyers have signed up for the fight.</LD>
<LD>   Joining Starr as lead co-counsel will be Floyd Abrams, who as an
expert on the 1st Amendment has represented many media companies before
the Supreme Court, including the New York Times in the 1971 Pentagon
Papers case. Another top lawyer signing on with McConnell was Kathleen M.
Sullivan, dean of the Stanford University Law School.</LD>
<TE>   All are offering their services pro bono, McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   His unveiling of the legal team, even before the campaign finance
measure has become law, signals the next phase in a long-running battle
over whether limiting political contributions and expenditures amounts to
limiting political speech.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which cleared Congress on Wednesday, would abolish the
unlimited donations to national political parties known as soft money. It
also would restrict political advertisements funded by unions,
corporations and interest groups, and take several other steps to
overhaul the fund-raising system for the first time in nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>Other Challenges to Bill Expected</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the reforms would help restore public confidence in a
government tarred by association with mega-contributors. But foes such as
McConnell say the bill makes a mockery of the Constitution's guarantees
of free speech and equal protection.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell's lawsuit will probably not be the only challenge to the
coming law. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said it will sue to block
the bill. Labor groups are weighing their options. The American Civil
Liberties Union announced Thursday that it would be "compelled to go to
court to defend the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Starr could face off with a strong supporter of his case
against Clinton, Theodore B. Olson, in expected arguments over the bill
before the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Olson left his private law practice to join the Bush administration as
U.S. solicitor, the executive branch's main representative before the
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the campaign finance bill said they will be paying close
attention to how Olson handles the case, in part because Bush himself has
voiced ambivalence about the measure. The president declared it "flawed"
and said parts of it raise constitutional questions, even as he announced
he would sign it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's best-known sponsor, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he
trusts Olson would do his job. "That's his constitutional
responsibility," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others said Seth Waxman, a solicitor general during the Clinton
administration, would also be defending the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Starr became nationally known as the independent counsel heading what
began as an investigation into the involvement of Clinton and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, into the failed Whitewater land development deal.
The probe escalated, eventually leading to Clinton's impeachment by the
House on charges stemming from his affair with White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky. The Senate acquitted Clinton of the charges in February
1999.</TE>
<TE>   As the case against Clinton grew, Starr became a hero among
conservatives and an object of scorn and ridicule to many Clinton allies.</TE>
<TE>   A former federal appellate judge and U.S. solicitor general, Starr now
is in private law practice in Washington with the firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>Starr Criticizes Bill as 'at Times Bizarre'</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference with McConnell on Thursday, Starr said the
campaign finance bill raises "grave" constitutional questions. These
questions "have tended to be dismissed in the popular media, but it is
now time for the courts to speak authoritatively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He criticized the bill as a "90-page-plus" compendium of "complicated
and at times bizarre regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Starr served as a clerk to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger when the
high court issued a landmark opinion on campaign finance in 1976 that
struck down limits on campaign spending but upheld limits on
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell and his attorneys said the bill's most vulnerable provision
was a ban on certain forms of broadcast advertising by unions,
corporations and interest groups one month before a primary election or
two months before a general election.</TE>
<TE>   But they argued that several other sections of the bill are open to
challenge, including its centerpiece, the ban on soft money
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Abrams derided the "speech-destructive, speech-suppressive tone of the
whole" bill.</TE>
<TE>   "From start to finish, the new law seems rooted in the notion that
speech about elections is so dangerous that it must be rationed or
quarantined," he said. "No election law reform--none--is worth violating
the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents maintain that the bill will withstand constitutional
scrutiny. But as a safety valve, they wrote a "severability" clause into
the bill. That provision allows the courts to strike down a portion of
the law but leave others intact.</TE>
<TE>   The case would be filed in federal District Court in Washington, and
the legislation calls for appeals to be expedited to the Supreme Court.
That means, assuming a rapid trial in the lower court, the high court
could hear the case as early as its next term, which begins in October.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the prominent members of McConnell's legal team, McCain
said: "They're going to need them, because we are very confident of the
constitutionality of this legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Of Starr, McCain said: "I'm not worried about him or anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Wertheimer, a longtime Washington lobbyist for campaign finance
reform, said simply: "We'll see them in court."</TE>

<LD>A hunter who failed to find any deer shot penned-in domestic

a dog, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Donald Ray Bussey, 20, who was hunting deer in October with friends in
rural North Florida, was arrested Thursday, the state Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services said.</LD>
<LD>   As he drove in a hunting area last fall, an agriculture department
official said, Bussey allegedly fired a shotgun out the window of his
truck. He then climbed into the back of the truck and shot an Arabian

two counts of animal cruelty, two counts of criminal trespassing and one
count of killing a registered breed--a charge that carries a maximum

<HD>Rumsfeld Vows 'Fair and Impartial' Anti-Terrorism Trials</HD>
<DH>Law: Rules are unveiled amid criticism about the lack of
protections for defendants. It was not known whether or when the policy
would be used.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld promised Thursday a "fair
and impartial" system of military tribunals for those detained in the war
against terrorism, but critics said the process is gravely flawed because
it does not provide adequate steps for defendants to appeal convictions.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld formally unveiled the groundbreaking rules for tribunals,
which the Pentagon calls "commissions," but added that the plan is, for
now, just a blueprint. He noted that no one has been charged and no
tribunals have been formed to hear any cases.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, although 300 prisoners are being held at the U.S. naval base
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and hundreds more are in Central Asia, Rumsfeld
could not say when--or even whether--the new policy, known as Military
Commission Order No. 1, will ever be used.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not have any candidates yet to be tried before commissions," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But numerous civil rights groups and other monitors said the rules
fall short of protecting defendants, particularly if they cannot appeal
their cases to the federal courts but must instead rely solely on the
U.S. military for fairness.</TE>
<TE>   "The tradition of the United States is a system of checks and
balances," said Mike Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "An independent court system with judges provides a meaningful
counterweight. It's served us well. It's one of the most fundamental
cornerstones of our system, and they seem to have abandoned it."</TE>
<TE>Commissions Won't Be Similar to Court Trials</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld, however, said the tribunals should not be compared to
military courts-martial or U.S. court trials because so much has changed
since the Sept. 11 air attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "The commissions are intended to be different," he said. "The
president recognized that there had to be differences to deal with the
unusual situation."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Let there be no doubt. Commissions will conduct trials that
are fair and impartial."</TE>
<TE>   William J. Haynes, general counsel to the Department of Defense,
brushed aside criticism that the rules provide only one level of appeal:
a three-member military review panel.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody that is tried will have vigorous, competent representation,
and we expect that they will seek every avenue they can to protect the
interests of their client," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we are confident that the rules will withstand any scrutiny and
that we will produce a full and fair trial and a just result."</TE>
<TE>Critics of Rules Ask for More Safeguards</TE>
<TE>   But detractors pointed out that military courts-martial and the U.S.
courts provide many layers of appeals. They added that, because the
tribunals are a new venture, more safeguards such as appeals should be
permitted.</TE>
<TE>   "They raise serious separation-of-powers problems because the
appellate panels are named by the president and are not judicial bodies,"
said Marjorie Cohn, an associate professor at the Thomas Jefferson School
of Law in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene R. Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military
Justice, said, "It will trouble people who were looking for an
independent appellate tier. The special review panel doesn't have
independent authority."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, the announcement drew a generally favorable response.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, applauded Rumsfeld for dropping some of the early proposals
for conducting the tribunals, such as holding them in secret.</TE>
<TE>   And Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said the rules "reflect the best traditions of the
American criminal justice system."</TE>
<TE>   The commissions will consist of from three to seven members of the
U.S. military, and defendants will be presumed innocent.</TE>
<TE>   The accused will be provided a military lawyer and also can hire a
civilian attorney. They cannot be tried twice by a military commission
for the same offense, they may refuse to testify and they can enter a
plea agreement to the charges.</TE>
<TE>A Two-Thirds Vote Needed for Conviction</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners need only reach a two-thirds vote for conviction, but a
unanimous verdict is required in death penalty cases. All findings and
sentences are final once approved by the president or the secretary of
Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials have suggested for some time that most
of the detainees will never be tried and instead will be sent home or
held until the war is over.</TE>
<TE>   "We are within our rights, and I don't think anyone disputes it, that
we may hold enemy combatants for the duration of the conflict," Haynes
said. "And the conflict is still going, and we don't see an end in sight
right now."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>They donated their tax refunds and Boy Scout dues. They held bake
sales and sold T-shirts.</LD>
<LD>   After six months of fund-raising, residents of east Tennessee on
Thursday officially presented a new $1-million ladder truck to New York
City in memory of the 343 firefighters who died in the World Trade Center
attack Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "This campaign really touched the hearts of east Tennesseans,"
Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe said at a ceremony at Ladder 14 in East
Harlem, which received the rig.</LD>
<TE>   Capt. Steve Damato said he was moved beyond words.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something in the heart," he said. "I thought, 'Knoxville is at
the end of the world. Who cares?' Well, they care. And it means so much
to us."</TE>
<TE>   Ladder 14 did not lose a truck in the attacks. The station received
the new rig because its 11-year-old truck needed to be replaced.
Government funds have already been earmarked to replace trucks destroyed
at the trade center.</TE>
<TE>   Communities across east Tennessee began raising the money two days
after the attacks, which killed about 3,000 people. They intended to buy
a $400,000 engine truck for the New York Fire Department but exceeded
their goal.</TE>
<TE>   The state-of-the-art truck, bearing a plaque calling it the Freedom
Engine, was delivered last week and has already been out on several
fires.</TE>

<HD>Judge Refuses to Throw Out Traficant Case</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused Thursday to throw out corruption charges
against Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., saying there is enough evidence that
he accepted bribes and kickbacks to allow the case to proceed.</LD>
<LD>   With no jury present, Traficant (D-Ohio) shouted himself hoarse in
making his motion to have the charges dismissed. Afterward, Traficant
began presenting his case. He is defending himself in the federal trial,
although he is not a lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, 60, is charged with accepting gifts and free labor from
businessmen in exchange for his political help and with taking cash
kickbacks and free labor from staff members.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells ruled that "the evidence clearly is
sufficient" to continue with the trial. Traficant even objected to
prosecutors' resting their case, but Wells said the objection was
improper.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant has accused the government of having a vendetta against him
because he beat bribery charges in 1983.</TE>

<HD>New Rules on Propane Seek Safer BBQ Grills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>This spring may be safer for outdoor chefs because of new rules
aimed at keeping gas barbecues from exploding, the government said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   There are about 600 fires and explosions involving gas grills each
year that injure about 30 people, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
said.</LD>
<LD>   But beginning April 1, a change to the national fire code requires
propane gas tanks sold to consumers for grills to have "overfill
prevention" devices, the agency said.</LD>
<TE>   The devices help prevent gas leaks by stopping the flow of gas to
tanks when they are 80% full.</TE>
<TE>   The fire code was published by the National Fire Protection Assn. and
adopted by most local governments and agencies.</TE>
<TE>   It also requires older tanks being brought in for refills to be
replaced with tanks that have the devices, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   "As people trade in their old propane tanks for newer ones, we will
see fewer fires," said Thomas Moore, the agency's acting chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Propane cylinders manufactured after Sept. 30, 1998, already have the
safety devices, according to the fire protection association.</TE>
<TE>   The improved propane tanks have valve handles with three prongs while
handles on older tanks are round or star-shaped with five prongs.</TE>
<TE>   While some dealers are trading in old tanks free, others may charge up
to $20, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   The safety commission also offered these tips to prevent gas grill
accidents:</TE>
<TE>   * Check grill hoses for cracking, brittleness, holes and leaks.</TE>
<TE>   * Always keep propane gas containers upright.</TE>
<TE>   * Never store spare gas containers under or near the grill, indoors or
in a hot car.</TE>
<TE>   * Move gas hoses as far as possible from hot surfaces and dripping hot
grease.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure the spark ignition device is working to create a flame,
otherwise escaping gas could explode.</TE>

<HD>Bush Team Drops Privacy Rule for Patients' Records</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Written consent for file sharing won't be required. An
advocacy group says the move will would sap protections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Thursday eliminated a privacy rule that
would have required written consent before patients' medical records are
sent to other medical facilities, pharmacies or insurance companies.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, health-care providers will only have to notify patients of
their privacy rights, federal health officials said. They will also have
to make a "good-faith effort" to have patients sign a form acknowledging
that they had reviewed the provider's policies on medical privacy.</LD>
<LD>   The change was disclosed Thursday as the Department of Health and
Human Services unveiled several revisions to a set of comprehensive
medical privacy regulations that will limit how doctors, insurers and
other health-care providers may disclose and distribute patient health
records. The rules were ordered by Congress in 1996 and written by the
Clinton administration. They are scheduled to take effect in April 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Medical privacy has been a thorny political problem for Bush
administration officials who have said they want strong privacy
protections but faced a major lobbying campaign from the potent
health-care industry, which felt that the Clinton administration rules
were too extreme.</TE>
<TE>   A patient advocacy group said the new rules would significantly weaken
important privacy protections. Health industry groups, which tried last
year to kill or delay the rule, cheered the revisions.</TE>
<TE>Health Official Calls Proposals Unworkable</TE>
<TE>   Bill Pierce, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human
Services, said that some of the Clinton-era proposals were unworkable and
would have prevented patients from receiving timely care.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to put ourselves in the place of the patient . . . sitting
in the doctor's office and feeling lousy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The original regulation, requiring written consent to share patient
information, might have prevented pharmacists from taking orders for
medication by phone, federal health officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors also might have faced problems in referring patients to
specialists. The regulation might have also complicated the work of
paramedics and other emergency workers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new proposal, health-care providers still will have to
notify patients as to who might see their medical records. But there is
no requirement that this occur before treatment or services begin. And
instead of consent to share information, patients would sign an
acknowledgment that they had seen the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased," said Mary Grealy, president of the Healthcare
Leadership Council, an association of chief executives from health-care
companies. "We think they've come a long way in striking the right
balance between protecting privacy and still making sure people can
access the system."</TE>
<TE>   But the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University in Washington
called the change a "devastating blow to patient privacy."</TE>
<TE>   "It will seriously undermine privacy, and I believe the consumer and
disability rights groups are going to be up in arms," said JanLori
Goldman, director of the project. "If people aren't given a consent form
and are required to sign it, chances are likely that they won't know what
their right to privacy is and how their personal information is being
used."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said he was "very concerned that
they've eliminated the consent form. It was a core part of the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Separate rules apply when a doctor or other health-care provider wants
to share patient information with marketing companies or for other
purposes unrelated to treatment, billing or quality improvement.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases, health-care providers must seek prior approval to
share the information. A separate approval is needed each time the
provider wants to release patient information.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services officials said they had strengthened patient
protections by broadening the types of activity that are considered
marketing and which need specific record-release authorization from
patients. The Health Privacy Project applauded the new marketing rule.</TE>
<TE>Health Agency May Make More Revisions</TE>
<TE>   The public has 30 days to comment on the regulations, after which the
agency might make more revisions. The rules do not require congressional
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials also said they had changed provisions that may have
unintentionally limited parents' access to their children's medical
records.</TE>
<TE>   The issue applies to states that allow children to obtain mental
health, abortion or other services without parental consent yet are
silent on whether parents can have access to the records.</TE>
<TE>   Where the Clinton rules would have given some children in those states
the right to privacy from their parents, the new regulation would allow
doctors and other health professionals discretion on whether to provide
or deny a parent access to the records.</TE>
<TE>   The health officials said they did not know how many children or
states would be affected.</TE>

<HD>Cameras Planned for Monuments on Mall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The National Park Service will begin round-the-clock video
surveillance at all major monuments on the national Mall by October,
moving aggressively in the wake of last year's terrorist attacks to
tighten security around national symbols visited by millions of tourists
each year.</LD>
<LD>   Closed-circuit television cameras will be installed for the first time
to monitor public areas in and around the Washington Monument and the
Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vietnam Veterans and Korean
War memorials, according to John Parsons, associate regional director for
the service's National Capital Region.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, disclosed in testimony Parsons submitted for delivery to
a congressional panel today, drew sharp questioning from members even
before his appearance.</LD>
<TE>   "I know they need to protect the monumental core, but this is a
surprise to us," said Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.), chairwoman of
the House Government Reform Subcommittee on the District, which called a
hearing on the expanding use of electronic surveillance in the nation's
capital. "How long are they going to capture on these cameras every face
of every person who is there? How long do they hold this material? Who
will have access to it?"</TE>
<TE>   Parsons' statement said the U.S. Park Police would use cameras "only
in public areas where there is no expectation of privacy" and "only for
valid law enforcement purposes."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Parsons said Thursday that no one was available to
comment beyond the statement. A spokesman for the U.S. Park Police
referred questions to the Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarian groups expressed concern that video monitoring may
discourage demonstrators, who for decades have gathered at the Reflecting
Pool and elsewhere on the Mall to protest government policy on issues
ranging from veterans benefits to abortion rights, civil rights and the
Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to ask the question, 'Is there any real benefit to this?'
Evidence from the rest of the country and the rest of the world is the
answer is no," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American
Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service announcement marks a dramatic step in the growth of
U.S. law enforcement agencies' use of video surveillance, a trend that
has become increasingly controversial since the Sept. 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Newspaper Says Editorial Misinterpreted</HD>
<DH>Religion: Publication of the Boston Archdiocese denies any intent
to challenge church policy in raising key questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>The Boston Archdiocese's newspaper said Thursday that a week-old
editorial raising questions about priest celibacy, ordination of women
and homosexuality had been widely misinterpreted.</LD>
<LD>   A new editorial published in the Pilot, the nation's oldest Catholic
newspaper, denied that it intended to challenge church policy when it
published "Questions that must be faced." Last week's editorial said
Boston's child molestation cases involving the church raised questions
about whether there would be fewer scandals if celibacy were optional for
priests, and whether the priesthood attracts an unusually high number of
homosexual men.</LD>
<LD>   It offered no answers, but stated: "These scandals have raised serious
questions in the minds of the laity that simply will not disappear."</LD>
<TE>   The editorial was written by Msgr. Peter V. Conley, the paper's
executive editor, who is said to be a close confidant of Cardinal Bernard
Law, Boston's archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   Many commentators called it a noteworthy statement of independence
from the Vatican, which considered such issues closed.</TE>
<TE>   The editorial took on "a life of its own" and sparked inquiries from
around the globe, the Pilot said Thursday. "But even on a second reading,
it takes a great stretch of the imagination to conclude that this local
journal of religious conviction was distancing itself from the discipline
of the Church."</TE>
<TE>   Last week's editorial was intended to "take notice" of questions
raised during a convocation held in Boston earlier this month, the Pilot
said, even though that editorial made no mention of the convocation.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Lawler, editor of the Pilot from 1986 to 1988 and now editor of
Catholic World Report, called the latest editorial an attempt to undo
last week's damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's baloney," Lawler said, adding that last week's editorial was
"certainly putting the ball in play, and it is just awfully hard for me
to imagine you could do that without realizing what you're doing."</TE>
<TE>   "This speaks to the whole reason we're in this trouble," Lawler said.
"People blaming the media instead of telling the truth."</TE>

<HD>Down Syndrome Patients Live Much Longer Now, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Disease: Data shows that the median age at death went from 25 in
1983 to 49 in 1997. Also, inexplicably, sufferers had lower cancer rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The life expectancy for people born with Down syndrome has doubled
over the last two decades, according to an analysis of U.S. death
certificates.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, for unknown reasons, rates of most cancers are far lower
for people with this genetic condition than they are for the population
at large, the data reveal.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta and the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, suggest that the health of people with Down syndrome, a
genetic abnormality causing an array of traits including mental
retardation, has improved markedly over the years. The results are
published in today's edition of the medical journal The Lancet.</LD>
<TE>   Several causes probably contribute to the change, including the demise
of institutionalization, access to better care and advances in surgery to
treat the congenital heart defects that accompany the syndrome in many
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery for life-threatening heart defects, for example, is performed
more often these days for people with Down syndrome--and earlier, before
dangerous complications can develop, said Dr. Kevin M. Shannon, associate
professor of pediatric cardiology at Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   There also is greater recognition that Down syndrome babies are
entitled to aggressive medical interventions, doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   The low rates of cancers, meanwhile, could teach scientists something
about the very biology of malignancy. People with Down syndrome have an
extra copy of chromosome 21 in all their cells--and thus extra copies of
several hundred genes. Researchers think one or more of those genes, when
present in an extra dose, may render cells more resistant to cancer.</TE>
<TE>Finding May Be Key to Lessening Tumor Risk</TE>
<TE>   The finding is "extremely important," said Dr. Julie R. Korenberg,
vice chairwoman of pediatrics at Cedars Sinai Medical Center and a
professor at UCLA. "The implications are that if we could understand the
gene or genes responsible for the decrease, we would have a way of
decreasing this tumor risk in the rest of us who don't have three copies
of chromosome 21."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Charles Epstein, chief of the division of medical genetics at UC
San Francisco, said the result could indicate that chromosome 21 houses
so-called tumor suppressor genes, which put the brakes on abnormal,
out-of-control cell division. If a cell had three copies of a tumor
suppressor gene instead of just two, it would be harder for a cell to
mutate to form cancer, Epstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Chromosome 21 is known to carry some genes that might theoretically
help lower cancer rates. One, called superoxide dismutase, helps destroy
tissue-damaging chemicals known as free radicals. Korenberg, meanwhile,
said her lab has discovered that a gene responsible for the production of
another potential tumor-fighting chemical, known as endostatin, resides
on chromosome 21.</TE>
<TE>   The study, although large, has its limitations, the authors and other
experts noted. It relies upon death certificate data to reach its
conclusions--and such data often are incomplete and may be more likely to
report some diseases than others. But it is unlikely that those
shortcomings in the data could account for the new findings, the authors
said.</TE>
<TE>Racial Disparities Also Found</TE>
<TE>   The findings also highlight strong racial disparities in the life
spans of people with Down syndrome. Although the disparities have
narrowed in recent years, African Americans in particular had shorter
life spans than did whites. The cause for this difference is unclear, the
authors said.</TE>
<TE>   Down syndrome is a genetic condition that usually stems from a mistake
made during the creation of eggs or sperm. As a result, a child ends up
with three copies of one of the human chromosomes instead of the normal
two. The resulting imbalance in gene activity causes developmental
abnormalities, including mental retardation, heart defects and unusual
facial features.</TE>
<TE>   In former decades, Down syndrome children often were
institutionalized. Today, most live with their families or in smaller,
group homes.</TE>
<TE>   To track the changing welfare of people with Down syndrome,
epidemiologist Quanhe Yang at the CDC and colleagues analyzed U.S. death
certificate data for 1983 through 1997. They compared the age of death of
nearly 18,000 people who were identified on those certificates as having
Down syndrome to about 32 million who were not so identified.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, the authors found, the median age of death for people with
the syndrome was 25. Over the 15 years, that increased to 49 years old in
1997. The median age of death for the general population was 73 in 1983,
increasing to 76 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists also examined the death certificate data for an array
of major medical conditions. (Such conditions often are recorded on death
certificates, even if they are not the actual cause of death.)</TE>
<TE>   They found that some diseases were noted much more frequently on the
death certificates of people with Down syndrome. These included heart
defects, dementia, thyroid disorders and diseases and infections of the
lungs. All are known to be particular problems for people with Down
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists also found that many cancers were strikingly less
common in people with Down syndrome, cropping up on their death
certificates at less than one-tenth the rate of that for the general
population. The exceptions were leukemias and testicular cancers, both of
which are elevated in people with Down syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "Breast, lung, colon, etc.--all of the common adult cancers that you
hear of people you know dying from--all were much lower," said Dr. Sonja
A. Rasmussen, a coauthor of the study and a clinical geneticist at the
CDC.</TE>
<TE>   This disparity can't be explained by the earlier age of death for
people with Down syndrome, Rasmussen said, as age was statistically
controlled for in the study. Moreover, she said, the low cancer finding
fits with two earlier, smaller studies--as well as doctors' general
impression from their clinical experience with Down syndrome patients.
"We think," Rasmussen said, "the finding is real."</TE>

<HD>NTSB Releases Report Blaming Jet's Copilot</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Agency doesn't try to explain motives behind the '99
EgyptAir crash. Egyptians insist the plane was at fault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1999 crash of an EgyptAir jumbo jet off Nantucket Island was
caused by the deliberate acts of a veteran copilot, the National
Transportation Safety Board said in its final report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the report did not attempt to explain the reasons behind
the actions of Gamil El Batouty. However, as reported last week, The
Times has learned that those motivations may have included revenge,
murder and suicide.</LD>
<LD>   The NTSB report officially concludes the investigation into the Oct.
31, 1999, crash of the Boeing 767 jet that killed all 217 people on
board. The probe strained relations between the United States and Egypt,
an important ally in the fight against terrorism. In documents released
Thursday, the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority rejected the NTSB report,
saying it reflects "a limited and incomplete investigation and a
corresponding inadequate analysis."</LD>
<TE>   The Egyptians have argued for months, despite a lack of supporting
evidence, that something must have been wrong with the plane. They say
Batouty, a Muslim, would never have crashed the jet in a deliberate act
of suicide.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB Chairwoman Marion Blakey defended the report Thursday, saying its
analysis and conclusions "are firmly supported by the physical evidence
and recorded data."</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB--citing radar data, air traffic control reports, cockpit
voice recordings and information from the plane's flight data
recorder--said that the plane apparently functioned perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   The recordings show that Batouty, alone in the cockpit, deliberately
nosed the jetliner over in a steep dive, repeatedly intoning in Arabic,
"I rely on God."</TE>
<TE>   When the command pilot, Capt. Mahmoud El Habashi, returned to the
cockpit, Batouty resisted the captain's efforts to pull the plane out of
the dive.</TE>
<TE>   Honofy Taha Mahmoud Hamdy, a former EgyptAir captain, told The Times
that the crash was a vengeful act against an EgyptAir executive. Taha
said Hatem Rushdy, chief of the airline's 767 pilot group and a passenger
on Flight 990, had reprimanded Batouty several hours earlier for sexual
misconduct that embarrassed the company.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said that the chief pilot told Batouty that he no longer would be
allowed to fly on U.S. routes, which carry added prestige and extra pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Rushdy had said [to him]: 'This is your last flight,' " Taha said.
"And Batouty's attitude was, 'This is the last flight for all of you
too.' "</TE>

<HD>Israelis in Demand for U.S. Security</HD>
<DH>Strategy: Experience, reputation are big selling points as private
firms and the government look to beef up on the homeland defense front.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Israelis with military or security experience seem to have the
inside track with U.S. corporations and government agencies looking for
anti-terrorism expertise.</LD>
<LD>   Boston's Logan International Airport--which came under heavy criticism
because it was the departure point for the jetliners that brought down
the World Trade Center on Sept. 11--hired a former security director for
Israel's El Al Airlines in October.</LD>
<LD>   In New Jersey, where authorities were faulted for poor intelligence
operations after it was learned that several suspected terrorists lived
and worked in the state, Gov. James E. McGreevey recently appointed an
Israeli as his special counsel for homeland security.</LD>
<TE>   Golan Cipel, a 33-year-old former campaign aide, had five years in
Israel's navy and in its reserve. He resigned after weeks of complaints
that his experience was inadequate and that his foreign citizenship
prevented him from getting U.S. security clearances.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his hiring underscored just how highly prized Israeli military
experience is to companies in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, security consulting companies formed by Israelis are
aggressively marketing their anti-terrorism services to corporations and
other U.S. clients. And the Israeli consulate in New York held a trade
show last month to promote Israeli security businesses to U.S. customers.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Israelis with military or security backgrounds provide an
attractive combination of experience and mystique.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Israelis faced more than 30 years ago the various security
problems, they started to build up an infrastructure to respond to such
threats," said Israel Boim, who founded a consulting company, Air
Security International, in Houston in 1989 after a career with Shin Bet.
"From every terror attack they improved their system. What makes Israelis
so attractive is now everyone can use their experience."</TE>
<TE>   Isaac Levy, former director of security for El Al, said: "We know
their habits. We know their trends. We know how they attack and we
understand the way of thinking of the radicals and the extremists."</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks on New York City and the Pentagon, Levy
joined a security consulting business founded by a former commissioner of
the Israeli police. The company said it has been hired to provide
training for building managers and security officers at scores of office
buildings and apartment houses in New York and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Military officers in Israel perform a combination of duties that in
the United States get done in pieces by the FBI, the Secret Service and
local police agencies, said Harvey Kushner, chairman of the criminal
justice and security administration department at Long Island University
in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Boim warned that what is successful in the Middle East is not
guaranteed to work in the states. He noted that Israeli security agents
are trained in practices such as profiling that are problematic under
U.S. law.</TE>

<HD>'Dire' Fiscal Outlook for Post Office</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. congressional report warned Thursday of even more postage
rate increases down the road on the eve of a decision expected to back
raising the cost of a regular stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office said the financial outlook for the U.S.
Postal Service was "increasingly dire," with mail volumes declining and
costs increasing.</LD>
<LD>   "USPS' basic business model is not sustainable," the GAO said in a
report to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The postal service
could no longer count on rising mail volumes to cover rising costs and
mitigate rate increases, it said.</LD>
<TE>   The GAO said slashing costs and raising rates might work in the short
term, but this strategy risked seeing customers turn increasingly to
e-mail and commercial delivery companies as service levels declined and
prices increased.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service lost $1.7 billion in fiscal 2001 ended Sept. 30, as
a slumping economy, the Sept. 11 attacks and anthrax-contaminated mail
saw volumes fall for the first time in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service is set to raise the price of a regular first-class
stamp to 37 cents this year, with approval for the increase expected as
early as Friday at a meeting of the independent Postal Rate Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO report comes days before the postal service releases its
transformation plan to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The service has previously lobbied Congress for a more flexible
pricing system that would give it more flexibility to raise prices during
peak volume periods.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO, which last April placed the postal service on its "high-risk"
list of government agencies, agreed that lawmakers should enact reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Without speedy approval of its pending stamp price increase, annual
losses "could be over $3 billion, maybe $4 billion," Postmaster General
John Potter said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service has frozen capital spending and said it will cut up
to 20,000 jobs this year.</TE>

<HD>Bipartisan House Plan Would Make INS 2 Units</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee reached a bipartisan
agreement Thursday on a proposal to split the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in two, a bid by Congress to assert its role in
overhauling the agency.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has proposed a similar change to the INS that
it sought to accomplish without congressional action. The proposal
announced Thursday by Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr. (R-Wis.) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), the committee's ranking
Democrat, would create a clearer split between the INS' enforcement and
administrative functions by giving the two separate budgets.</LD>
<LD>   The House negotiators reached the compromise after the embarrassing
disclosure last week that the INS had approved visas for two of the Sept.
11 hijackers six months after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement would keep the two INS divisions within the Justice
Department and create the position of associate attorney general for
immigration affairs, who would be the department's third-ranking
official. The plan also calls for a "children's office" to deal with
minors' immigration problems.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, because it is a bipartisan compromise, has a strong
chance of passing in the House, congressional aides said. But it will
have to vie with an alternative that will be introduced in the Senate by
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who is looking for GOP sponsors. The Kennedy
measure, which is closer to the administration's proposal, would give
more power to the Justice Department official overseeing the two INS
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "In reforming the agency, we need to maintain strong overall
leadership to ensure uniformity, efficiency and decisive action in a
crisis," Kennedy said. "Now is not the time to diminish the power of the
person running the nation's immigration agency."</TE>
<TE>   Conyers acknowledged that much negotiation remains. "This legislation
is an important first step in tearing down the INS and replacing it with
an agency that works," he said. Sensenbrenner said the plan would allow
lawmakers to work "in concert with the Bush administration" to split the
INS.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, scheduled for a Judiciary Committee hearing and vote on
April 9 and 10, was also negotiated by Reps. George Gekas (R-Pa.),
chairman of the immigration subcommittee, and Sheila Jackson Lee
(D-Texas), the subcommittee's ranking Democrat. The legislation is
unrelated to an administration proposal to merge the INS with the Customs
Service.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Kelley, deputy director of the National Immigration Forum, an
immigration rights group, said the bipartisan bill is headed in the right
direction.</TE>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>A school principal and a teacher were ordered to stay home from
school Thursday after a class of third-graders were strip-searched when
$5 in lunch money went missing.</LD>
<LD>   The money did not turn up in Monday's search of the 26 students, who
are between 8 and 9 years old.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a strip-search. The kids were asked to take off their
clothes. The female teacher searched the girls and the male teacher the
boys," Kansas City School District spokesman Edwin Birch said.</LD>
<TE>   Pitcher Elementary School Principal Jana Schwimmer and an unnamed
teacher were ordered to stay away from work, though not officially
suspended, pending an investigation of the incident, Birch said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear why both teachers involved in the search were not
kept home.</TE>
<TE>   Under Missouri regulations, schoolchildren can be ordered to empty
their pockets but there is no provision for them to be strip-searched.</TE>

<HD>Kansas Court May Rule on When Life Begins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOPEKA, Kan.
</DL>
<LD>In a broad attack on abortion law, Kansas lawmakers voted Thursday
to ask the state Supreme Court to declare that life begins at conception.</LD>
<LD>   Abortion opponents hope the court will rule that a fetus is entitled
to protections provided by the Kansas Constitution, including the rights
of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a direct attack on Roe vs. Wade," said Rep. Rick Rehorn, an
attorney and Democrat who supports abortion rights.</LD>
<TE>   The Kansas House voted, 70 to 50, to direct the attorney general to
file a lawsuit asking the state Supreme Court to make the declaration
that life begins at conception.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, the attorney general must raise questions of
constitutional law with the court when ordered to do so by either chamber
of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best method the House of Representatives has to show the
importance of life," Republican Rep. Dan Williams said. "That issue is
vital to the issue of abortion, as well as many of the issues we deal
with."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the issue of when life begins is ripe for review by the
courts because of advances in medical science since the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalized abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Critics question whether lawmakers are wasting their time.</TE>
<TE>   "What's determined in a Kansas court is not going to be the law of the
land," Rehorn said. "Ultimately, to change that decision, it's going to
take the U.S. Supreme Court or a federal constitutional amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion opponents have pushed lawmakers to make the request for
several years without success. One reason lawmakers have refused is that
Atty. Gen. Carla Stovall is a staunch supporter of abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Stovall is preparing to leave office to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit would not be filed until after Feb. 1, when a new attorney
general has taken office.</TE>
<TE>   Stovall's spokesman Mark Ohlemeyer said she had no comment on the
resolution because she needs to review it.</TE>

<HD>Popular Idaho Petroglyphs Concealed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEWISTON, Idaho
</DL>
<LD>Visitors who travel on one of the numerous tour boats on the Snake
River no longer will be able to see the famous petroglyphs on Valerie
Earl's property.</LD>
<LD>   Earl said she covered the rocks with a blanket about a month ago
because too many tour boats were coming up the river during the winter.
She said the constant roar of tour boats was endangering wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   "They used to come in the summertime and now they come all year long,"
Earl said. "They just have to understand the impact on the wind and water
and the very spirit of the place."</LD>
<TE>   Earl's family has owned the property for three generations. The Native
American figures chipped into rocks are thought to be more than 4,000
years old.</TE>
<TE>   Tour boat operators whose advertisements had promised a stop at the
site said they were disappointed the popular petroglyphs have been
covered.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are some of the best petroglyphs you can see from the river
without getting off the boat," said Bill Bonson, a jet boat captain for
Snake Dancer Excursions. "They are probably the most photographed set of
petroglyphs in the canyon. We haven't decided how we're going to deal
with not being able to pull in and look at those,"</TE>
<TE>   The site is one of the most popular stops along the river.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a highlight of a Hells Canyon tour to see the ancient
petroglyphs," said Michelle Peters, executive director of the Hells
Canyon Visitor Assn. "The jet boat captains stop at the site, and let the
passengers take pictures from the boat. They tell the different
interpretations of the petroglyphs and it truly fascinates the tourists."</TE>
<TE>   About 37,000 visitors explore the river on commercial jet boats each
year, Peters said. An additional 3,000 or so charter private trips.</TE>

<HD>Astronauts' Return Date Extended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The astronauts aboard the international space station will spend an
extra month in orbit because of robot arm trouble, pushing their mission
to a U.S. record-setting 189 days.</LD>
<LD>   NASA decided Thursday to bump the crew's ride home from May to June so
the visiting astronauts can replace a balky wrist joint in the space
station's mechanical arm. The additional 3 1/2 weeks are needed to train
the shuttle astronauts for the repair work and add the spare joint to the
mission payload.</LD>
<LD>   American astronauts Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch and their Russian
commander, Yuri Onufrienko, moved into the space station in early
December and logged their 106th day in orbit Thursday. Space shuttle
Endeavour was supposed to lift off with their replacements on May 6; that
launch is now scheduled for May 31.</LD>
<TE>   That will keep the three men in orbit until June 12, beating NASA's
current space endurance record by a single day. Shannon Lucid's 1996 Mir
mission lasted 188 days; she still will hold the world's space endurance
record for women.</TE>
<TE>   Even at 189 days, Onufrienko won't come close to surpassing his
country's space endurance record: an incredible 438 days set by Russian
cosmonaut-physician Valery Polyakov aboard Mir in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The space station residents were notified of the shuttle delay shortly
after the decision was made, but had had a hunch they would be staying up
longer than planned because of the robot arm problem.</TE>
<TE>   NASA can work around the problem with computer software for the
upcoming space station construction mission by Atlantis, due to lift off
April 4 with a 44-foot girder to be installed on the orbiting outpost.</TE>
<TE>   But managers want to fix the station's robot arm as soon as possible
after Atlantis' flight, by having shuttle astronauts replace one of three

<HD>Senate Strikes a Blow in the Energy Battle</HD>
<DH>Policy: Forcing utilities to move toward renewable sources, such as
wind and sun, sends 'a strong message,' scientists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate moved Thursday to require utilities to generate a larger
share of their electricity from sources such as solar and wind power, a
potentially significant shift in national energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   The requirement for investor-owned utilities to produce at least 10%
of their power from renewable sources by 2020 handed environmentalists
their first important victory in the debate about comprehensive energy
legislation. An effort to strip the bill of the requirement was defeated
by a 58-40 vote.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a strong message from the Senate that the country needs a
minimum renewable energy standard," said Alan Nogee, director of the
clean energy program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Gary Skulnik,
a spokesman for the environmental group Greenpeace, called the Senate
vote a "step that has never been taken before" but said he is
disappointed that lawmakers did not go further.</LD>
<TE>   A Sierra Club representative was unenthusiastic about the Senate
action. "It's a pretty hollow victory," said Debbie Boger, senior
Washington representative for the environmental organization. Because of
exemptions and other provisions, she asserted that the measure would
result in "only 4% to 5% of new renewables" by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "We might be able to do that without any federal legislation," Boger
said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Congress has provided billions of dollars for tax subsidies
and research to promote alternative energy sources, but it has never set
such an aggressive goal for generating electricity from renewable
sources, which include agricultural waste and geothermal energy.</TE>
<TE>   Government-owned utilities and electric cooperatives, which produce
about one-fifth of the nation's electricity, would be exempt from the
requirement. The bill would allow investor-owned utilities to count their
existing use of non-hydropower renewable sources toward the standard.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, who include the utility industry, warned that the
requirement would drive up electricity costs and threaten power supplies
in states that are not blessed with strong wind and bright sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison Co. said in a statement that the company
has the largest portfolio of renewable energy sources, excluding
hydropower, of any California utility and "is committed to doing more."
But the company said the legislation should include a price cap "to
ensure that the large mandated demand for renewables in the face of
supply constraints does not cause price spikes."</TE>
<TE>   Investor-owned utilities also objected that municipal-owned utilities,
such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, would be exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Many environmentalists disputed the dire warnings and predicted that
the requirement would reduce power plant emissions, including the
"greenhouse gases"--primarily carbon dioxide--blamed for global warming.
And, they said, it would diversify the nation's energy mix, preventing
the kind of price spikes that occurred last year in states that rely on a
single source of fuel to generate electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the nation's electricity is generated using coal, nuclear
power or natural gas. About 2% comes from renewable sources, excluding
hydropower.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the provision ultimately becomes law remains in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Any energy bill passed by the Democrat-controlled Senate will face
difficult negotiations with the Republican-dominated House, which last
summer approved a version that did not require the use of alternative
sources.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain whether the Senate will even be able to pass an energy
bill. A week ago, it soundly rejected tougher vehicle fuel economy
standards, a priority of most Democrats. And GOP efforts to open Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, a goal of
President Bush, appear doomed.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Senate continued to work on the legislation at a
snail's pace, putting off any further action until after lawmakers return
next month from their Easter recess.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen states require a percentage of their electricity to be
produced from renewable sources.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gov. Gray Davis this week endorsed legislation that
would require the state's investor-owned utilities to produce 20% of
their power from renewable sources by 2010, up from the 12% currently
produced.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to gain broader support for the measure, Sen. Jeff
Bingaman (D-N.M.) modeled it after a Texas law signed by Bush when he was
governor.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House joined the majority of Senate Republicans in
opposing the requirement, contending that the decision should be up to
individual states.</TE>
<TE>   During the three days of debate, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) branded the
requirement a case of "Soviet-style command economy."</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation is costly . . . [and] imposes a massive new
regulation of what we can buy in this country. It is anti-American," he
said. "Let the free market work."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) responded: "The free market has
allowed us to import 57% of our oil supply from overseas."</TE>
<TE>   Without the increased use of alternative sources, Dorgan said, the
United States is destined to live with an energy policy of "yesterday
forever . . . just dig and drill."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gray, deputy executive director of the American Wind Energy Assn.,
said he is optimistic that a renewable portfolio standard--the official
name for the requirement--can survive a House-Senate conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely that a major energy bill will win approval without
some significant provision that is beneficial to the environment," he
said. "And the [standard] is the main candidate at this point."</TE>

<HD>Senators Aghast at Losing Dining Room</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OLYMPIA, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>A $100-million Capitol renovation means Washington state senators
will temporarily lose their private dining room and French chefs, and
have to eat the same food served to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The response was swift.</LD>
<LD>   "THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE," wrote Sen. Don Benton (R-Vancouver) in a
letter signed by 36 of the 49 state senators. "We as members of the
Senate, have come to look forward to the quality food prepared by
Jean-Pierre and Kerri, as well as the quiet camradery [sic] of our fellow
Senators in a private setting."</LD>
<TE>   Restaurant owners Jean-Pierre and Kerri Simon cook for the Senate part
time. While writing a budget that cut $685 million in services and laid
off hundreds of state workers, the Senate honored its favorite chefs with
a standing ovation last week.</TE>
<TE>   Benton and co-signers defended their food fight.</TE>
<TE>   "My lunch breaks are typically 15 minutes to half an hour, then I have
appointments," said Sen. James Hargrove (D-Hoquiam). "The point for me is
to have some peace and quiet. It seems like much ado about nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Senators pay for meals, covering most of the operating cost of their
dining room, said Tom Cook, the Senate secretary. The temporary
legislative lunchroom will be cramped, with room for about 40 people.
Plus, lawmakers will be forced to eat the same food served to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh! The humanity!" mocked TV commentator Ken Schram, who suggested
voters kick complaining lawmakers out of office so "the only private
dining those senators will have to fret over will be a booth at Denny's."</TE>
<TE>   "Education just got clobbered in the state budget," said schools
advocate Lisa Macfarlane of Seattle after stifling a laugh. "If it took a
private dining room for them to come up with a long-term solution, we'd
cook."</TE>

<HD>Democrats' $7-Million Superhero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>An entertainment industry tycoon from Los Angeles gave the
Democratic National Committee $7 million last month to help build a new
headquarters, a record-breaking gift for the party, a Democratic
spokeswoman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The gift from Haim Saban, who made his fortune from the "Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers" and other children's television shows, may be the
largest that either major national party has received in modern times.
And it could turn out to be among the last of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure from the Democrats came one day after Congress cleared
a landmark bill to overhaul campaign finance law for the first time in
nearly 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   Under the legislation, which President Bush says he will sign,
national political parties would be prohibited after this fall's
elections from raising such huge sums from a single source. Instead, a
national party committee would be able to collect only $25,000 per year
from an individual donor.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic officials disclosed the existence of the gift earlier this
week in an interview with The Times, saying it was the cornerstone of a
$32-million fund drive to help build a new headquarters by the end of
next year. But they had declined until Thursday to name the source or
specify the amount.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic. It's a record-breaking contribution," said party
spokeswoman Maria Cardona. DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe, she said, "is
very grateful and appreciative of Mr. Saban's generosity and leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Cardona said the previous largest donation to the national Democratic
Party was a $1.5-million gift in 1985 from a Maryland woman.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single political donation to either Republicans or
Democrats reported in the last 11 years was $1.7 million in 1994 to a GOP
committee from the Amway Corp., according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington, which tracks political giving. Political pros
said this week they could not recall any gift larger than that to either
party.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking financial records of the two parties is difficult. Many
electronic databases of donations to federal parties or candidates cover
only donations made from the 1990s onward. And larger gifts could have
been made before the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s ushered in the
modern practice of disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, by any measure, Saban's gift is huge. During the 2000 campaign,
for instance, the American Federation of State County and Municipal
Employees--a labor union that is a major political player--was the
largest donor of the unlimited funds to political parties known as soft
money. The union gave $5.9 million, and that was a cumulative total of
contributions spaced over two years.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans criticize the Democratic fund drive for the headquarters,
saying it is at odds with the position of most congressional Democrats
who voted to ban soft money. A GOP spokesman, Kevin Sheridan, called the
Democratic big-money raising "hypocritical" this week.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, the 57-year-old Saban said there was no secret motive
behind his gift. "I don't have anything to hide. I don't have anything to
worry about. The most someone can say is, 'Look at this guy, he's a
staunch Democrat.' I have no agenda outside of I think the Democratic
Party is better for America than the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   Saban took a long road from Israeli music promoter to Hollywood mogul
to Democratic mega-donor.</TE>
<TE>   He was a music promoter in Israel until the 1973 Yom Kippur War dashed
profits. He and a partner moved to Paris and invited a child to perform a
theme song for a Japanese cartoon. The cartoon became a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Saban took the profits from his musical ventures, moved to Los Angeles
and began buying obscure Japanese cartoons. When he repackaged one of
them as the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," he had a hit on his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Saban banked nearly $1.5 billion as his share of the
sale of Fox Family Worldwide Inc.</TE>
<TE>   On the social front, Saban began hosting political fund-raisers that
were soon among the most well-attended in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Saban is also a major donor to California Democratic causes, giving
nearly $400,000 to Gov. Gray Davis since 1998 and other non-cash aid
through fund-raisers he has hosted. Davis recently named him to the UC
Board of Regents.</TE>
<TE>   He also has cultivated relationships with national Democratic Party
figures like McAuliffe.</TE>
<TE>   Months after McAuliffe became chairman in 2001, he approached Saban
about the party's need to build a new headquarters. The current one on
South Capitol Street, party officials say, is cramped and outdated.
Democrats wanted a new building outfitted with the latest radio and
television gear and high-tech equipment to help the party compete with
Republicans. So was born a $32-million campaign, a fund drive that Saban
is chairing.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Saban hosted a luncheon in Los Angeles attended by former
President Clinton and other major Democratic figures. It generated
substantial support for the fund drive. Party officials say they have
raised or obtained commitments for most of the money they need.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the Republicans' infrastructure, from television
studios to direct mail to their ability to connect with their
constituencies in a very, very efficient and rapid way and compare that
to the Democrats, the Democrats are like in the Stone Ages," Saban said.
"Unless the Democrats put together an infrastructure for the 21st
century, they will be forever a minority party."</TE>
<TE>   To accomplish that goal, Saban said he would be pursuing donations
from other prominent, wealthy Democrats. "We will be following up with
these people over the next few weeks," he said. "You pick a Democratic
donor in L.A. of significance, and we will be talking to them."</TE>

<HD>A Happy New Year for Afghans</HD>
<DH>Asia: Millions celebrate traditional holiday that was eliminated by
the Taliban for being too festive. It's a day of fun, games and food.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>It was the kind of festival the Taliban would never allow:
All-night parties. Spontaneous drumming, singing and dancing in
restaurants. Picnics, high jinks, gambling and merrymaking that had
little to do with religion.</LD>
<LD>   Afghans on Thursday celebrated Nowruz, the first day of spring and the
traditional start of the Persian new year, by discarding the puritanical
and indulging in their new life of freedom, music, movies, games and
laughter.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of Afghans took part in the revelry. In Kabul, the capital,
and other large cities, they flooded parks and stadiums to see shows and
concerts, climbed hillsides to visit medieval shrines, paid visits to
family and friends, and planted trees. They sampled holiday fare such as
haft miwa, a cocktail made from seven dried fruits, and samanu, a sweet
wheat-sprout pudding that takes up to 12 hours to cook. (Women
traditionally stay up all night singing and telling stories while it
boils and simmers away.)</LD>
<TE>   "This is the best of my life so far," a Kabul vendor called Rahimuddin
shouted over his shoulder about the holiday. He struggled to keep up with
the customers crowding on all sides, stretching out their hands for his
cherry juice, ladled into glasses already dusted with fine sugar, or
eager to buy one of his plates of honeyed nuts and seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Near Kabul's stadium, which until last year was the scene of public
stonings and executions by the Taliban authorities, children flew kites
or rode on cheerily jangling donkey carts and some women drew aside their
robin's-egg-blue burkas to expose their faces to the warming sun.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy on this New Year's Day," said Fazlei Khuda, a
27-year-old university student in literature. "Our people have been freed
from the dark period of the Taliban. It was a black reign that did not
want Afghans to be happy and free."</TE>
<TE>   An ancient holiday--believed to date back more than 2,000
years--Nowruz came to Afghanistan and several other countries in Central
Asia by way of Persia, today's Iran. It coincides with the vernal equinox
and is associated with new life, the cultivation of trees and flowers and
the sowing of crops.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most festive time of the year until the Taliban came to
power in most of Afghanistan between 1994 and 1996. Disliking Nowruz's
un-Islamic origins and its emphasis on joyful indulgence rather than
piety and prayer, the radical regime lost no time removing it from the
roster of official holidays.</TE>
<TE>   But telling Afghans to ignore Nowruz was a bit like asking Americans
to treat Thanksgiving as just another Thursday. People celebrated
anyway--just keeping it discreet and within the family circle, said
Izumarai, a 49-year-old accounting manager.</TE>
<TE>   "The things we could do at home, we did," he said with a
conspiratorial smile. "Now that we are free, we are very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Nowruz again was an official day off work, part of a
festive three-day weekend. The new school year begins Saturday--the first
day that girls will be allowed back into classrooms. And on Tuesday, the
country's former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, is to make a triumphal
return, the first since his exile in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   A government helicopter circled over Kabul on Thursday, dropping
leaflets with a poetic New Year's greeting to inhabitants: "A thousand
thanks that the spring has come and the fall is gone. As with the grace
of a flower, may young and old prosper."</TE>
<TE>   In the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, residents had been splashing
blue paint on buildings, fixing windows and planting almond trees for
weeks before the holiday, sprucing up the town for the first visit by
interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Cannons boomed, children belted out songs, and tens of thousands of
pilgrims swarmed the bright blue mosque in the center of town, hurling
clouds of nearly worthless money into the air--confetti, Afghan-style.</TE>
<TE>   As Karzai watched with an amused smile, a crowd of young men acted
like an Afghan mosh pit, rushing toward the podium, getting beaten back
by baton-wielding police and then throwing themselves into the sweaty
crush again.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy New Year!" Karzai shouted. "Our future, though not without
sacrifice, is going to be bright!"</TE>
<TE>   For hundreds of years, it was the custom for Afghanistan's head of
state to come to Mazar-i-Sharif for Nowruz and visit the mosque and its
Tomb of Ali, said to be the burial site of the fourth Caliph of Islam,
the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in his signature silk cape and fur hat, Karzai stood at the
mosque's entrance shoulder to shoulder with Northern Alliance commanders
who haven't always seen eye to eye with him or one another. On Thursday,
however, they pledged cooperation, and forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed to release war prisoners soon," Karzai said, referring
to the thousands of captured Taliban fighters who have been held prisoner
in the north since November. "I'm sure they won't repeat their mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   When the speeches ended, a near riot broke out while a huge
pink-and-green flag was hoisted to the top of the mosque. Ali is beloved
by Shiite Muslims, and hundreds of blind and disabled people squeezed
inside the mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, convinced that God would heal them
while the flag was being raised.</TE>
<TE>   "I am cured!" a few cried out. Gangs of men then jumped on them,
ripping away their shirts and turbans, saying the clothing itself now
carried divine blessings.</TE>

<HD>Jerusalem Bombing Kills 4; Cease-Fire Talks Sidelined</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel cancels truce meeting and weighs reprisals. Arafat
condemns suicide attack by Palestinian man on a busy downtown street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian wearing a hooded jacket and a belt of nail-studded
explosives waded into the crowds shopping on busy King George V Street in
the heart of Jerusalem on Thursday. At the height of rush hour, he paused
along a strip of stores and falafel stands and detonated his bomb,
killing himself, three Israelis--and any chance of an imminent cease-fire
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The thunderous explosion rocked downtown Jerusalem, shattered glass
storefronts and sent people screaming in panic. Scores were wounded,
several seriously.</LD>
<LD>   A militia linked to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
Fatah movement claimed responsibility--dooming, at least for now,
U.S.-sponsored talks that were making tentative progress toward a
cease-fire in nearly 18 months of spiraling violence. The Bush
administration announced that it was placing the militia--the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade--on its list of terrorist organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Israel canceled a meeting with the Palestinians that had been
scheduled for Thursday night to discuss a truce. Instead, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon convened an emergency session of his security advisors to
weigh reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second suicide bombing in Israel in 36 hours. At the urging
of U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni, Israel refrained from retaliation after
the earlier bombing, an attack Wednesday on a packed passenger bus in
northern Israel in which seven people were killed. Domestic pressure on
Sharon to act now will be intense. Zinni joined Sharon and his advisors
late Thursday, presumably to attempt to salvage his mission.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Sharon's office issued a statement indicating that there
would be no new military action for now but warning that any restraint
will be short-lived. It blamed Arafat directly and exclusively for
continued attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said the bomber in Thursday's attack, identified as
Mohammed Hashaikeh, 21, was a former police officer arrested last month
by the Palestinian Authority because he was planning a suicide mission at
a shopping mall. Palestinian authorities then released him from a jail in
Ramallah when Israeli forces invaded the West Bank city last week.
Israeli officials said this sequence of events underscores Arafat's
refusal to rein in militants and prevent attacks even when they are
predictable.</TE>
<TE>Arafat Expresses Hope for a Cease-Fire</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, clearly worried about Israeli retaliation and under stiff U.S.
pressure, took the unusual step of publicly condemning Thursday's attack.
He brought journalists to his headquarters in Ramallah and read a
statement in Arabic pledging to take "immediate measures" to end attacks
on Israeli civilians. He said he hoped to see a cease-fire enacted soon.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he convened the leaders of various Palestinian factions and
reportedly demanded that they stop hitting Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Hashaikeh was standing amid a large group of pedestrians when he blew
himself up about 4:15 p.m. He chose a sidewalk of King George V Street
along a strip of candy, shoe and clothing stores and small restaurants.
This downtown commercial district is always busy but was especially so on
a Thursday afternoon before the coming week's Passover holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was smiling the whole time, and he kept looking back over his
shoulder," Adi Iluz, who was waiting at a bus stop about a block away,
told Israeli television.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see he looked suspicious," said another witness, who gave his
name as Yisrael. "I wanted to call the police but didn't have enough
time. He just exploded, and arms and legs flew all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Bloodied passersby were thrown to the ground. A child lay "like a
piece of wood," in the words of one witness. Limbs, pieces of flesh and
one head, apparently of the bomber, were scattered about. Windows on both
sides of the four-lane avenue were shattered.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulances and police cars, sirens wailing, converged on the scene.
Some of the wounded were loaded on gurneys that medics then ferried by
foot several blocks to the nearest hospital.</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports from witnesses about whether the bomber
had just stepped off a bus or had been delivered to King George V Street
by car. A number of Palestinians in the area were arrested for
questioning, police spokesman Gil Kleiman said, and some of them had to
be rescued from the angry crowds.</TE>
<TE>Revenge, Not Peace, on Most Minds</TE>
<TE>   Later, as the cold, damp afternoon turned to dusk, volunteers from
Israel's religious burial society scoured the streets for victims'
remains. Blood even spattered a third-story balcony, where an
ultra-Orthodox man could be seen rocking back and forth in prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Stretched across the front of one of the buildings, just above where
the bomber blew up, was a political banner from a leftist party. "The
occupation kills. We want to live in peace."</TE>
<TE>   But revenge, not peace, was on the minds of most people.</TE>
<TE>   As with every other suicide bombing, right-wing and ultra-Orthodox
demonstrators gathered quickly at the site, chanting, "Death to Arabs!"
and challenging Sharon: "Hey, hey, how many Jews did you abandon today?"</TE>
<TE>   And the refrain of merchants, shoppers and ordinary Israelis was, "How
long can this go on?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's either us or them," said Nuriel Yadegaran, an Iranian Jew whose
gift shop stood about half a block from the bombing site. "How can the
Americans ask us to make peace with Arafat? They are all terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Yaakov Hakimi ran from his pizzeria into the street when he heard the
massive blast, finding himself in a smoky, messy tableau of debris and
body parts. "This cannot continue this way," he said later at his
restaurant, where he sat slumped, his head in both hands.</TE>
<TE>   "What, do you think we can trust them?" said Yisrael Levy, 40, a
history teacher who lives a block off King George V Street. "They are
trying to kill us all the time. To live here now is like a miracle. It is
like Russian roulette."</TE>
<TE>   The three Israelis killed in Thursday's bombing were identified early
today as Yitzhak Cohen, 48; Gad Shemesh, an army officer; and Shemesh's
pregnant wife, Tzipi.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's bombing took place near the Sbarro pizza parlor, where
another Palestinian suicide bomber killed himself and 15 others in
August. Sbarro has rebuilt and reopened. Thursday, minutes after the
explosion, workers inside Sbarro could be seen placing chairs on tables
and closing up shop. "We don't even have a day or two to get over one
attack and return to normal life, before another takes place already,"
said manager Ronen Hirbawi.</TE>
<TE>   Despite wide gaps of disagreement between Israel and the Palestinians
on the U.S.-sponsored truce plan, there had been hope that the
differences could be bridged in further negotiation. It was unclear late
Thursday where the talks would go.</TE>
<TE>   While Arafat condemned Thursday's bombing, his top lieutenant, Fatah
leader Marwan Barghouti, justified the attack as a legitimate "response
to Israeli massacres and incursions into our villages, towns and refugee
camps."</TE>

<HD>Foreign Films Speaking the Same Language</HD>
<DH>All five of the nominees share similar themes of hope with
a strong sense of humor--uplifting qualities that have proved timely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, the Oscar nominees for best foreign-language film
appear to have nothing in common.</LD>
<LD>   What could a kitschy Indian musical, a Bosnian war farce, a
Norwegian story about two mentally disabled men, an Argentine drama
about a man's midlife crisis and a whimsical French fantasy have in
common?</LD>
<LD>   Plenty, if you look closer. They are all films about hope, with a
strong sense of humor that makes their topics--mental illness,
colonization, war and emotional crises--palpable. These films are, in
the words of industry insiders, audience pleasers.</LD>
<TE>   "All four of them are love stories ... with a fair sprinkling of
humor--with the exception of 'No Man's Land,' which is a real farce,"
said Mark Johnson, chairman of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences' foreign-language film selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   The five finalists are Bosnia-Herzegovina's "No Man's Land,"
France's "Amelie," Argentina's "Son of the Bride," India's "Lagaan:
Once Upon a Time in India" and Norway's "Elling."</TE>
<TE>   In their sensibility, the films this year are uncommon. Often, the
foreign-language films acquired and distributed in the U.S. as
"art-house" fare are intense dramas. Whether it was a post-Sept. 11
need for levity or just coincidence, all the films selected this year
are less heavy and more life-affirming.</TE>
<TE>   "It could just be that people are ready for these kinds of films,"
said Bob Berney, senior vice president of marketing and distribution
for IFC Films. "In the past that has not been the case--the
[nominated] movies tend to be more heavy or serious."</TE>
<TE>   That these films were selected for entry by their native countries
(in some cases, over more dramatic movies) could also be an
indication of how foreign academies are becoming more savvy about the
kinds of movies that appeal to American audiences, some observers
say. All five nominees have been acquired by U.S. distributors, and
either will be released soon or have been in theaters for several
months.</TE>
<TE>   With 51 countries submitting films for consideration, 2001 was a
record-breaking year. In terms of quality, "it's been the best year
in 10 years," said Mark Gill, head of Miramax L.A. who also handles
many foreign-film purchases for the company. "You definitely have
less of the 'won't travel five steps across the border' syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   More than ever, an Oscar nomination means big business for
foreign-language films. An Oscar raises the stature of a film almost
immediately, and so many foreign filmmakers are learning to play the
Academy Awards game. The biggest hurdle is getting members to see the
film in a theater, which is an academy requirement for the
foreign-language nominating committee.</TE>
<TE>   Aamir Khan, star and producer of India's entry, a 31/2-hour
musical about a 19th century peasant town fighting unjust taxes
imposed by their English colonizers, said he was disheartened when
his film was not nominated for a Golden Globe.</TE>
<TE>   "Lagaan," directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, was a box-office smash
in India, making about $14 million. Khan discovered that many U.S.
industry people had never heard of his film, let alone seen it. So he
took the initiative and flew to Hollywood in December--one month
before academy voters decided on finalists.</TE>
<TE>   With hardly any contacts, he started holding screenings. He
invited people working at his hotel. He invited Indian friends who
lived in L.A. Most important, he invited director Roland Joffe ("The
Killing Fields") and producer Peter Rawley, both of whom had seen the
film in India.</TE>
<TE>   "We told [Khan and Gowariker] in Bombay what they had to do,"
Rawley said. "You have to get a buzz and a must-see feeling for the
film. That is done through a series of networks."</TE>
<TE>   Three people showed up at the first screening, six at the second,
20 at the third and so on, continuing to grow. Khan also bought ads
in the trade publications to publicize his screenings. Before long,
he generated positive awareness of his film, which before the
nominations didn't have a U.S. distributor. Afterward, Sony Pictures
Classics quickly acquired it, and "Lagaan" will be released May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Khan was not sure the Bollywood musical (a contraction of Bombay
and Hollywood that also refers to an exuberant style) about Indian
oppression during British colonization would appeal to such a broad
audience. But in Toronto last September, when his movie was screened
five days after the terrorist attacks, he realized that the film's
cheerful musical numbers (reminiscent of Hollywood classics) and its
message of tolerance had universal appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood [at the festival] was really bad," he recalled. "After
the screening, people said, 'Thank God we saw this film. It's a film
that uplifted my spirits and gave me hope.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Pierre Jeunet, director of "Amelie," said he never thought of
movie-making as something important. But after Sept. 11, he said,
people would approach him and say, "Your film is exactly what we need
right now."</TE>
<TE>   "Amelie" has led an upsurge in the popularity of French films in
their home country. It grossed more than $35 million there and, with
the marketing muscle of Miramax behind it, almost $30 million in the
U.S. since its release in November.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Jose Campanella, director of "Son of the Bride," surmised via
phone from New York that his film too has struck a chord with people
hungry for hope in the midst of tragedy--or in the case of
Argentina--economic chaos. His movie outperformed all others in
Argentina last year. In Spain, it became one of the biggest-grossing
Latin American films. The movie, also picked up by Sony Pictures
Classics, opens today.</TE>
<TE>   Petter Naess, director of the Norwegian entry, "Elling," says he
wanted to make a cheerful film about a serious topic--mental illness.
"Elling" was picked up by First Look Pictures and will be released in
late May or early June.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't very important to make a film about psychiatry or about
how awful it is to feel awful," said Naess, who also directed the
stage version of "Elling," which he explained is "about being able to
overcome. Humor is a way to open people's hearts and lower people's
guard."</TE>
<TE>   Elling, the main character, suffers from intense anxiety and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Yet he confronts his illness with a
wry sense of humor. When his best friend and mental-hospital roommate
tells him, "Remember Elling, you only live once," he responds, "Yes,
I really hope so."</TE>
<TE>   As Naess says, "We all have dreams and goals we are heading for,
but we also have fears and anxieties and barriers, which keep us from
going where we want to go."</TE>
<TE>   The main character in Campanella's "Son of the Bride" confesses to
his girlfriend that when he was a boy, he had 40 dreams. But now, at
the age of 40, he realizes he likely won't accomplish them: "Even if
I fulfill a dream a year, it wouldn't add up." So he settles on one:
"to drop out." He does not drop out but refocuses his life on what
matters: his daughter, his girlfriend and his mother, who suffers
from Alzheimer's disease, which also afflicts Campanella's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Although the subject matter is serious, Campanella says humor
makes the film--and life--bearable. "Laughter gives a character
immediate empathy. Also, Argentine humor is heavily influenced by the
Italian and Jewish sense of humor--you laugh in the face of tragedy.
Life can be dramatic, but it should never be solemn."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes humor is the only thing keeping you from total despair,
said Danis Tanovic, director of "No Man's Land," which was picked up
by MGM/UA, released in December and is still showing in selected
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Humor is a way to present a heavy subject and leave a little door
open--like a way out. Humor gives you distance," said Tanovic, who
was a cameraman for the Bosnian army during the Bosnian war in 1993.
"Humor was our secret weapon during the war because that was the only
weapon we had.... To make an antiwar film you need two human beings
stuck in an absurd situation."</TE>
<TE>   In "No Man's Land," two soldiers from opposing sides--one Bosnian,
one Serb--find themselves literally stuck in no-man's land, an
abandoned ditch smack between the two armies' outposts. They are
unable to return to their posts without getting shot at by their own
armies and thus find themselves at the mercy of inept U.N. observer
forces and the vulturous media.</TE>
<TE>   Tanovic, 33, admits that humor also helps bring in younger
audiences who don't seem to have the inclination or attention span to
sit through a long message movie about the horrors of war. Sadly,
young people today may not have the patience to sit through an
antiwar masterpiece like Jean Renoir's "The Grand Illusion," said
Tanovic, who lives in Paris. "We are the instant generation and
filmmakers have to understand that. Nobody has time to see heavy
films today. Even in [post-Sept. 11] America, everything is back to
normal.</TE>
<TE>   If humor informed most of the nominees this year, escapism was at
the heart of France's "Amelie." The film, which stars Audrey Tautou
as a waitress whose mission in life is to spread happiness, has
become a sort of cultural phenomenon for the French. It depicts a
Paris that perhaps never existed--except in director Jeunet's mind.
In his film, Paris is truly a city of light--beautiful, clean and
happy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the film has been criticized for its nostalgically
homogenous depiction of the city that is now aggressively
multiethnic, Jeunet stands by his work.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's rare to see positive stories," Jeunet said. "When
Hollywood makes positive stories, they are sugary.... In France, we
are so cynical, and for once, we were all happy watching this movie."</TE>
