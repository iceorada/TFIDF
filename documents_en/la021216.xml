<LD>Imagine going to the doctor's office once a year for treatment of a
chronic medical condition. No daily pills. No weekly therapies. Just
30 minutes or so in a clinic.</LD>
<LD>   It could happen. A new osteoporosis drug called zoledronic acid
has been shown to increase bone mineral density in rates similar to
those achieved with medications taken daily or weekly. Now, a large
study involving thousands of people will establish whether annual
intravenous infusions can help prevent spine and hip fractures in
people with osteoporosis.</LD>
<LD>   If eventually approved by the Food and Drug Administration,
zoledronic acid would be only one of several ways to treat bone loss.
But doctors are exuberant at the prospect of having a long-lasting
therapy in their bag of tricks.</LD>
<TE>   "It will change the way we treat osteoporosis," said Dr. Stuart
Silverman, a clinical professor of medicine at UCLA and an
investigator in the phase-three clinical trial. "Right now,
osteoporosis is under-recognized, under-diagnosed and under-treated."</TE>
<TE>   About 55% of people over age 50 have low bone mass, and 10 million
Americans have osteoporosis, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. The disease can lead to an increased risk of fractures
and, sometimes, eventual death for elderly people who break a hip.</TE>
<TE>   However, many elderly people with fractures are treated for the
injury but don't receive medications or therapy to prevent additional
fractures, Silverman said. That might change if zoledronic acid
infusions could be given as part of a comprehensive treatment for a
fracture. About 20% of people with one fracture will have another
break.</TE>
<TE>   With zoledronic acid on hand, he said: "We would fix [the
fracture] and then give them their osteoporosis treatment before they
leave the hospital. We'd know they were protected for the next year."</TE>
<TE>   A once-a-year treatment would also benefit people who can't
tolerate daily osteoporosis medications such as Fosamax and Actonel.
Like zoledronic acid, these drugs are from a class of compounds
called bisphosphonates. And though they're powerful protectors of
bone, they're hard on the stomach, says Silverman.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, many people have trouble sticking to a daily-pill
regimen; studies have shown that the average person stops taking
long-term medications after six months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zoledronic acid infusions appear to be well-tolerated. The major
side effects are low-grade fever, musculoskeletal pain or nausea
following the infusion. Zoledronic acid, made by Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., is not a new drug. It's already being used,
under the name Zometa, to treat complications of cancer that has
spread to the bone.</TE>
<TE>   "Bisphosphonates are a class of compounds that are soaps," said
Silverman, medical director of the Osteoporosis Medical Center, a
nonprofit research center in Los Angeles. "They bind directly to the
bone. They create a slippery surface and make it very difficult for
the cells that remove bone to attach."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers don't yet understand how a single, yearly dose of
bisphosphonates can protect bone as well as a daily therapy. But a
greater understanding of the drug is expected to emerge during the
three-year study launched last month.</TE>
<TE>   The study will test zoledronic acid in several groups:
post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, people with recent hip
fractures and people with Paget's disease, the most serious
degenerative bone disorder. Researchers will enroll 11,000 patients
in 400 centers around the world in one of the largest drug-evaluation
programs undertaken in the area of metabolic bone diseases. More
information on enrollment is available at www.horizon.novartis.com or
by calling (877) YHORIZON.</TE>
<TE>   If the medication proves successful at preventing fractures, it
would probably be used in conjunction with other osteoporosis
treatments, such as the newly approved medication Forteo, which can
help build new bone.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of exciting things happening with osteoporosis,"
said Silverman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a disorder of aging. It's treatable."</TE>

<TE>   Out with old bone, in with the new</TE>
<TE>   Bones are not the solid, fixed structures we often assume them to
be. They're actually in a state of flux known as the remodeling
cycle. This cycle has two parts:</TE>
<TE>   Bone resorption: Special cells called osteoclasts dissolve old
bone by removing calcium and other minerals from the bone and
depositing them back in the bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   Bone formation: Cells called osteoblasts create new bone by
removing calcium and other minerals from the blood and depositing
them in the cavities where bone is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Bone diseases like osteoporosis, which means "porous bones,"
develop when old bone is lost faster than regrowth can occur. Small
holes develop that can eventually weaken the bone so much that a
fracture or break occurs.</TE>

<HD>A hidden danger in skin care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's skin-care products do more than just clean and moisturize:
They promise smoother, clearer, more radiant skin with fewer fine
lines and wrinkles. But there's a downside to some of the
ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   A seemingly endless array of creams, lotions and cleansers use
alpha hydroxy acids to improve skin texture and make it firmer by
thickening the collagen beneath the surface. But these acids also can
make the skin more sensitive to the ravages of the sun. It becomes
more apt to burn, which not only contributes to aging but also can
lead to skin cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The product packaging, however, doesn't specify how the acids work
or that they can make the skin irritated and sun-sensitive.</LD>
<TE>   Now federal regulators are recommending that consumers be warned
about the risks of alpha hydroxy acids. The Food and Drug
Administration is collecting public comments until the end of January
and will review them before making a final decision on the wording.</TE>
<TE>   With manufacturers "putting more and more active ingredients in
products, such as AHAs, they should be warning the public that there
may be side effects such as sun sensitivity," said Dr. Elisabeth
Shim, a skin cancer specialist in Santa Monica and Pasadena. Such
sensitivity can be a hidden risk, she said, because it's not as
apparent as the redness and irritation the products also can cause.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha hydroxy acids, which come from fruit and milk sugars,
exfoliate the skin, which means they strip dead cells from the skin's
top layers. But in thinning that outermost shield against the
elements, they can increase the possibility of sunburn and
sensitivity for up to a week after they've been applied.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers can be avoided with careful use of sunscreens, but
that message apparently isn't getting through.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has proposed that labels state: "Sunburn Alert: This
product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which may increase your
skin's sensitivity to sunburn. Use a sunscreen and limit sun exposure
while using this product and for a week afterward." However, because
the recommendation doesn't have the force of law, the manufacturers
must decide whether to warn customers.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Glogau, a dermatologist at UC San Francisco, said
patients who regularly use these products often complain that their
skin is irritated and getting redder, even if they get only
intermittent exposure to sunlight. He advises that they use
sunscreens with a high SPF, such as 30 or 40. "Most of the people I
see get the stern skin cancer lecture and go out the door with a much
better sunscreen than they were using when they came in."</TE>
<TE>   Most cosmetic products containing alpha hydroxy acids have
concentrations of 6% to 10% of the acid. Stronger versions are used
by cosmetologists, facialists and dermatologists for various facial
peels. The category includes glycolic acid, lactic acid, citric acid
and malic acid.</TE>
<TE>   But Shim said alpha hydroxys shouldn't be singled out; other
active ingredients cause similar irritation and sensitivity. They
include some vitamin A-derived chemicals, such as retinol (which
helps fade age spots and plump up tiny lines) and salicylic acid
(which is used to exfoliate). Both can be found alongside the AHAs on
store shelves.</TE>

<HD>A pregnant pause for the body and soul</HD>
<DH>For expectant women, prenatal yoga classes offer exercise,
camaraderie and emotional support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with my regular fitness regimen of walking, swimming, hiking,
dancing or whatever other exercise I could coax my pregnant,
ballooning body to do in recent months, I have been coming once a
week to a Tuesday night yoga class that attracts hundreds of women
weekly from all over the city.</LD>
<LD>   This night, in a lily-scented room decorated with portraits of
yogis, there are 20 of us in various stages of pregnancy, from the
flat-bellied, newly pregnant to women so big with child they look
like they might give birth before class ends.</LD>
<LD>   Yoga can be a purely physical pursuit, but we come to this class
for reasons as varied as our body shapes: for exercise, for
camaraderie and for spiritual support. Most of all we come to be
around other pregnant women. Here, parked on our yoga mats, we can
bare our bellies for 90 glorious minutes and feel like goddesses.</LD>
<TE>   My instructor is Seva Simran Siri Kaur Khalsa, a certified
prenatal yoga instructor at Golden Bridge Yoga. She is dressed in
flowing white cotton, a turban and a scarf. She sits on a raised
wooden platform covered with a woven rug and emanates nurturing,
maternal energy.</TE>
<TE>   Khalsa says the goal of her class is to keep women's spines
flexible, strengthen their immune systems and keep their auras (by
her definition, the energy field that surrounds people) strong. She
also wants to help women keep their minds calm and conscious. She
recommends any pregnant woman walk four to five miles a day, in
addition to prenatal yoga classes.</TE>
<TE>   The class begins with chanting, meditating and deep breathing.</TE>
<TE>   Then we begin to do slow and gentle stretches. These stretches are
designed to open up our shoulders, our lower backs, our chests. We
sit with the soles of our feet pressed together and raise our arms
slowly over our heads. We remain in this modified Indian-style
position and begin to circle, slowly, loosening our lower backs. We
stretch down to the left, to the right.</TE>
<TE>   "Feel yourself opening up space for the baby to grow in," Khalsa
says, as we lift one arm, then the other. "You become very vulnerable
as your third chakra opens up," she says. "That's what makes you want
to cry at the drop of a hat."</TE>
<TE>   After stretching, we begin strengthening exercises. We get on all
fours and do Jane Fonda-like leg lifts until our bodies burn. We do
sets of squats, strengthening our thighs. We join with partners and
rise up on our toes, then roll back down on our heels, working our
calves until they ache. (This is supposed to help alleviate leg
cramps, which many women get during pregnancy.)</TE>
<TE>   Golden Bridge Yoga offers numerous classes in Kundalini yoga. But
its founder and guru, Gurmukh, sees teaching yoga to mothers-to-be as
a calling. "Women think they should know everything about pregnancy,
but they have never been pregnant before, so why would they know?"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days they had a mother, a nurse, a midwife. Today so
many women are isolated from families, from their community, from
knowing. This is to teach a woman to stand up for herself. To have
strength, a backbone, a support system. It is to give them education
so they can make intelligent choices."</TE>
<TE>   Interspersed through our stretching and strengthening on this
night are what our instructors call "keep-up exercises." They look
simple but must be done continuously for periods of three to five
minutes. Sometimes we make circles with our arms extended to the
side. Sometimes we move our hands over our heads. This time we throw
our arms back behind us, forward across our chests, then raise them
up over our heads, and repeat. These small, simple movements become
excruciating when carried out over an extended period of time. They
will not make your muscles big, or your physique powerful. They are
designed to help your mind triumph over your body.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you are doing difficult things, remember, this is all
preparation for labor," says Khalsa. She encourages us to breathe
through our pain, to chant Sanskrit mantras. I sneak a peek around
the room. Some women have dropped their arms. Some are resting. Some
have a sheen of sweat on their upper lips. It's hard. But we are
still on the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "Think ... 'I am good. I am beautiful. I am a powerful woman,' "
says Khalsa. "I can do this thing called labor."</TE>
<TE>   After our keep-up exercises, Khalsa puts on ethnic-sounding music
with a primal drum beat, meant to help us get in touch with our less
intellectual, more primitive selves -- and we dance. Sometimes there
are cymbals and sitars that make you want to belly dance. Other times
there is soulful drumming that makes you want to get down in the
streets of Rio at Carnevale. We move our hips and rock our wombs. It
feels so good.</TE>
<TE>   We end the class with chanting, singing and a prayer for the baby
growing within us. Then we lie on our backs in the darkness in
silence. We finish class with a song about sunshine and love.</TE>
<TE>   After class the women chat over cardamom tea and graham crackers.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Catalena, who is about eight months pregnant, drives an
hour every Tuesday evening to get to this class. She doesn't come
just for the exercise, because her job as a personal trainer provides
plenty of exercise at work, lifting weights and doing time on an
elliptical trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think to some people it sounds too New Age-y," she says. "But I
come for the spiritual aspect of it. There is a sense of calm I get
here that I do not get anywhere else. One night a week I can feel
centered and focused on the pregnancy."</TE>
<TE>   Another woman, who is 29 weeks pregnant and declined to give her
name, says she comes to class because in a fitness-obsessed city like
Los Angeles, the class helps her feel good about her body.</TE>
<TE>   Early in my pregnancy I came for psychological support. A regular
yoga class, or a jog, would have been a better workout. I was still
hiding my pregnancy from colleagues at work. At that point, I cried
with relief to be in a place where pregnancy was celebrated. Now,
when my belly is so huge I can't see my toes, I still come for the
camaraderie, but also because my body has grown so unwieldy that the
simple yoga postures have become a real workout.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the tone is touchy-feely, the flavor hippie-dippy. I
wouldn't let my husband come within five miles of this room because
of the teasing I would have to endure. But this yoga class --
scheduled for the end of the day so pregnant working women can attend
-- is the one place in my high-speed life where I have the chance to
slow down and reflect on the miracle of what is happening inside me.</TE>

<LD>Baby boomers may not be doing as well in their later years as they
expected when they kicked off the fitness boom and made health food
stores mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   A recent survey found that 59% of men and women ages 35 to 54 were
"incompletely healthy." In fact, of the more than 3,000 Americans
ages 24 to 74 who were surveyed, 62.2% were "incompletely healthy" --
and almost all of them were boomers.</LD>
<LD>   The Emory University survey, published in the November/December
issue of the American Journal of Health Promotion, focused on
physical and mental health, including whether participants suffered
from one of 37 chronic conditions. People were categorized according
to World Health Organization definitions of health that also took
into account other physical and mental characteristics, such as
physical limitations and social and emotional well-being, says lead
author Corey Keyes, assistant professor of sociology at Emory
University in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   But, in a surprising finding, the unhealthiest group in the random
sampling was the youngest: 22% of the "completely unhealthy" were
under age 44.</TE>
<TE>   "The boomers get all the attention because they're the largest
group of aging Americans, but we should be concerned about the
younger adults because they're going to spend a better part of their
adult life with [health] problems," says Keyes.</TE>
<TE>   For lowering cholesterol, diet could be as effective as drugs</TE>
<TE>   Various foods are thought to help lower cholesterol, but combining
all of them at once may work even better.</TE>
<TE>   University of Toronto researchers designed a diet that combined
the most-promising cholesterol-lowering foods -- soy products,
vegetable proteins, almonds and plant sterols (which block absorption
of cholesterol) -- and asked a group of 13 men and women to eat
nothing but this diet for a month. Within two weeks of eating the
prescribed diet, participants had reduced their low-density
lipoprotein, or bad, cholesterol by nearly 30% on average and
maintained that healthy level for four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about the same reduction we see in people who take
cholesterol-lowering drugs," says Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, professor
of medicine and nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto and
St. Michael's Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The study, funded by the Canada Research Chairs Program and the
Almond Board of California, appeared in the December issue of the
journal Metabolism.</TE>
<TE>   Treating sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer</TE>
<TE>   A man's sex life after prostate cancer treatment suffers more than
had been thought, concluded a survey published last month, and now a
second report says that the track record for treating the common
complaint of erectile dysfunction in this group isn't very good
either.</TE>
<TE>   Of more than 1,000 men whose cancer was treated with radiation or
surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, only 13% were having spontaneously
firm erections an average of 4.3 years later. An additional 8% were
able to have good erections by using a medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60% of the men had used at least one treatment, according
to Leslie R. Schover, associate professor of behavioral science at
the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and her
colleagues in the Dec. 1 issue of the journal Cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular therapy was sildenafil (Viagra). The most
invasive approaches -- penile injection therapy and penile prosthesis
surgery -- were most successful, improving sex for more than 25% of
the men who tried them. The dropout rate for all treatments, however,
except the penile prosthesis, was greater than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Men who had the best outcomes in general were those who had no
sexual problems, such as lack of desire, and who had partners who
were interested in sex, says Schover.</TE>

<LD>If you take the time to strengthen the backs of your thighs, you will
develop stronger hamstrings that will give you more power in sports
and other athletic activities. Balanced leg strength will also help
you avoid serious injuries to the knees and hip joints.</LD>
<LD>   1 Adjust the ankle pads of a leg curl machine so that the pads are
just above your heels as you lie on your stomach. Grasp the handles,
pull in your abdominal muscles and keep your hip bones on the pad.</LD>
<LD>   2 Bend your knees, flex your feet and squeeze your hamstring
muscles to lift the ankle bar. Pause when your calves are
perpendicular to the floor, then slowly straighten your legs to the
starting position. During the exercise try not to let your buttocks
rise off the pad to avoid putting undue strain on your lower back. Do
two to three sets of eight to 12 reps.</LD>

<HD>Severe leg injuries pose a dilemma for surgeons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Bor</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, new techniques have enabled surgeons to rebuild the
crushed and mangled legs of accident victims that were once
considered unsalvageable, leading to fewer amputations.</LD>
<LD>   But some have questioned whether they are doing patients more harm
than good by subjecting them to numerous operations -- and often, a
longer and more painful recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Now researchers have found that patients with severe leg injuries
fare equally well, or poorly, whether they have reconstructive
surgery or lose their damaged limbs to amputation.</LD>
<TE>   The sobering truth, doctors said, is that 40% of patients remain
severely disabled two years after their injuries, and half do not
return to work, no matter which route they take. "If you have
reconstruction, you're going to have more surgery, more
hospitalizations and are at risk for complications of those
surgeries," said Dr. Alan L. Jones, chief of orthopedic surgery at
the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. "But
your chance of being able to work and your level of function is going
to be about the same."</TE>
<TE>   The new study, published in the Dec. 12 issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, found that most patients opt for surgery to save
their leg.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said last week that all patients should be given
better physical therapy, psychological counseling and vocational
training to prepare them for the difficult road ahead.</TE>

<HD>The brain in love</HD>
<DH>Science suggests we're neurologically wired to look for
romance. But how to tell if it will last is another question.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For generations scientists have studied the peacock feathers of human
mating, the swish and swagger that advertise sexual interest, the
courtship dance at bars, the public display. They've left the private
experience -- what's happening in the brain when we fall for someone
-- mostly to poets.</LD>
<LD>   We know there's an inborn human urge to mate, after all. Love is a
mystery, a promise, an arrow from Cupid's bow.</LD>
<LD>   Yet recent research suggests that romantic attraction is in fact a
primitive, biologically based drive, like hunger or sex, some
scientists argue. While lust makes our eye wander, they say, it's the
drive for romance that allows us to focus on one particular person,
though we often can't explain why. The biology of romance helps
account for how we think about passionate love, and explain its
insanity: why we might travel cross-country for a single kiss, and
plunge into blackest despair if our beloved turns away.</LD>
<TE>   This view of romantic attraction rests on observations of
passionate behavior across cultures, studies of animals during
courtship and, most recently, findings by scientists studying the
human brain. Using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machines to
peer into the brains of college students in the throes of early love
-- that crazed, can't-think-of-anything-but stage of romance --
scientists have developed some of the first direct evidence that the
neural mechanisms of romantic attraction are distinct from those of
sexual attraction and arousal.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing here is the biological drive to choose a mate,
to focus on one person to the exclusion of all others," said Helen
Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who
spells out the biological basis for romantic attachment in a paper
appearing this month in the journal Neuroendocrinology Letters.
"Let's say you walk into a party and there are several attractive
women or men there. Your brain is registering this attraction for
each one; then you talk to the third or fourth one, and whoosh -- you
feel something extra."</TE>
<TE>   Unique brain activity</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's group is analyzing more than 3,000 brain scans of 18
recently smitten college students, taken while they looked at a
picture of their beloved. She expects the results to build upon the
findings of English researchers who recently completed a similar
study of young men and women in love. When shown a picture of their
romantic partner, their brain activity pattern was markedly different
from when they looked at a picture of a close friend, reported
neurobiologists Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki of University College
London. The pictures showed that the experience of romantic
attraction activated those pockets of the brain with a high
concentration of receptors for dopamine, the chemical messenger
closely tied to states of euphoria, craving and addiction. Biologists
have linked high levels of dopamine and a related agent,
norepinephrine, to heightened attention and short-term memory,
hyperactivity, sleeplessness and goal-oriented behavior. When they're
first captivated, Fisher argues, couples often show the signs of
surging dopamine: increased energy, less need for sleep or food,
focused attention and exquisite delight in smallest details of this
novel relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Bartels and Zeki compared their MRI images to brain scans taken
from people in different emotional states, including sexual arousal,
feelings of happiness and cocaine-induced euphoria. The pattern for
romantic love was unique. But there was some overlap with and close
proximity to other positive states. "This makes sense," said Zeki.
"These were young people who were practically willing to die for
their lover. You would expect that the images would reflect many
strong emotions all at once."</TE>
<TE>   MRI machines can't read people's minds, psychiatrists say. The
pictures are not nearly sensitive enough to separate and measure each
of the emotions that comprise romantic feeling, as if they were on a
color-by-numbers map. Yet the images' emotional complexity itself
reflects how many people think about being in love, some
psychologists say.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent study, University of Minnesota researcher Ellen
Berscheid asked a group of young men and women to make four lists: of
all their friends; of the people they loved; of everyone they thought
sexually attractive; and finally, of those with whom they were "in
love." As expected, the last list was the shortest, usually just one
name. That same person, however, appeared on all the lists. "It's
this combination of friendship, affection and lust," Berscheid said,
"that makes it so powerful."</TE>
<TE>   This power is enough to warp judgment in otherwise sensible
people, just as a spike in dopamine activity might. As psychologists
have demonstrated in several studies, newly smitten lovers often
idealize their partner, magnifying the other's virtues and explaining
away their flaws: She is the funniest person I've ever met. He's
moody because of his job. This behavior, sometimes called the "pink
lens effect," is often sharply at odds with the perceptions of
friends and family, psychologists say. New couples also exalt the
relationship itself. "It's very common; they think they have a
relationship that's more special, closer, than anyone else's," said
Berscheid, a leading researcher on the psychology of love.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some idealization may be crucial to building a longer-term
relationship, said Pamela Regan, a researcher at Cal State L.A. and
author of the recently released "The Mating Game" (Sage), ) a book
about relationships. "If you don't sweep away the person's flaws to
some extent, then you're just as likely to end a relationship or not
even try," she said. "This at least gives you a chance. If you think
of romantic attraction as a kind of drug that alters how you think,
then in this case it's allowing you to take some risks you wouldn't
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Passionate love's euphoria is certainly enough to push many people
through the first two stages of courtship: self-disclosure, the
up-all-night storytelling; and interdependence, when lovers are
continually together, often contentedly doing nothing. But that pink
lens effect might also help people through stage three: conflict,
when tension and doubts about the couple's future prompt arguments
and soul-searching.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy romanticizing</TE>
<TE>   In a 1996 experiment, psychologists at the State University of New
York at Buffalo followed a group of 121 dating couples. Every few
months, the couples answered questionnaires designed to determine how
much they idealized their partner, and how well the pair was doing.
The researchers found that the couples who were closest one year
later were those who idealized each other the most. The idealizing
seemed to help carry these couples through the inevitable rough
spots. "Intimates who idealized one another," concluded the
researchers in the paper, "appeared more prescient than blind,
actually creating the relationships they wished for as romances
progressed."</TE>
<TE>   Short-term studies of courtship mean little for the issue that
most people confront: What are the ingredients of a long-term, loving
relationship? Psychologists at the University of Texas in Austin have
been looking at the subject for more than a decade, following 168
couples who were married in 1981. What they're finding is that
idealization of a kind can keep people happily married. "Usually,
this is a matter of one person putting good spin on the partner,
seeing the partner as more responsive than he or she really is," said
Ted Huston, the study's lead investigator. "People who do that tend
to stay in relationships longer than those who can't or don't."</TE>
<TE>   But the findings are mixed. Huston's research also has identified
three paths through early courtship: fast and passionate, slow and
rocky, and in-between. The fast-track group, about 25% of the total,
usually were interdependent within weeks, tended to ignore or forget
their initial problems and were committed to marriage within several
months. By contrast, the slow-motion group took an average of two
years to reach a commitment, spending up to six painstaking months in
each stage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when it came to success at the 13-year mark, the tortoises won
out. "The more boring and deliberate the courtship, the better the
prospects for a long marriage, I'm afraid," he said. "People who had
very intense, Hollywood-type romances at the beginning were likely to
have a big drop-off later on, and this often changed their view of
the other's character."</TE>
<TE>   That's the rub. If passionate romance is like a drug, as the MRI
images suggest, then it's bound to lose its kick. Studies of dating
and engaged couples find that feelings of passionate love and
infatuation tend to fade quickly in the first year, and a year or two
later often are all but gone, said Regan. What's more, simply having
a strong romantic drive says nothing about how wisely you'll use it
-- or on whom. "The drive is there simply to focus your energy on one
person," said Fisher. "People make wrong choices all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional fallout from that kind of decision is no less awful
for its being wrong, of course. But seeing romance as a biologically
based, drug-like state can at least provide some balm for a broken
heart. "Like a drug addict would tell you," said Regan, "the highs
don't last, but neither does the withdrawal. With time the craving
and pain go away and the brain returns to normal."</TE>

<HD>The victims of billing fraud: from insurers to patients</HD>
<DH>When doctors claim reimbursement for expensive procedures
or for services not given, everyone pays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Trudy Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was looking over my medical insurance statement recently when I
noticed something amiss: My doctor had apparently billed the insurer
for two office visits in August, but I had only seen the doctor once
for a routine Pap smear. I complained to my insurer, who suggested I
call the doctor to see if this was a mistake. "We want to give the
doctor the benefit of the doubt," the insurance representative said.
The doctor had billed the insurer for an "extended" office visit--a
60-minute encounter to discuss symptoms of moderate to high severity.
But I hadn't spent 60 minutes with this doctor.</LD>
<TE>   Billing for more expensive services than were actually performed
-- or billing for services not rendered at all -- are two of the most
common types of fraud in the medical profession, according to
insurance companies. They occur with some regularity and involve
medical providers of all kinds -- family doctors, specialists, labs
and hospitals. The problem was illustrated recently when the federal
government announced it was investigating Redding Medical Center, a
hospital owned by Tenet Healthcare, for questionable billing
involving Medicare patients. A study reported in 2000 in the Journal
of the American Medical Assn. found that 39% of the doctors surveyed
admitted that they exaggerated the severity of patients' conditions
to help them stay in the hospital, reported symptoms patients did not
actually have or changed an official diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very easy system to manipulate," says Michael P. Stergio,
director of special investigations for Aetna Inc. "You take their
word that services were performed, and they were medically necessary
and justified." But what happens to patients when services are
neither necessary nor justified? I'm still not sure whether my doctor
had made a simple mistake or deliberately created a phantom office
visit to make a little more money. The doctor's office says it is
investigating the charge. What is clear, however, is that my medical
record now includes information about severe symptoms for a medical
condition I never had.</TE>
<TE>   A future liability</TE>
<TE>   False information on your medical record can come back to haunt
you. Because your information is available to insurers, it could
cause you to pay more for -- or be denied -- coverage for life,
health or disability insurance. Many insurance companies belong to
the MIB Group in Boston, the only organization that allows carriers
to exchange health information about applicants. When you apply for a
policy, the insurer scrutinizes your medical history.</TE>
<TE>   Say, for example, your medical records indicate that a doctor has
diagnosed you with minor depression when you really had insomnia. An
insurer can cite the diagnosis of depression as the reason for
denying coverage. The insurer can also send this bit of your medical
history to the MIB Group databank, which another insurer may look at
when considering whether to sell you a policy or not.</TE>
<TE>   False or misleading information, such as an incorrect diagnosis,
may also rob you of health benefits you may need in the future. Many
health policies set a limit on the maximum benefits the insurer will
pay out over the customer's lifetime. Often policies have lifetime
caps of $1 million, though the figures may be lower. There are also
limits on other kinds of benefits -- mental illness, for example. A
Massachusetts psychiatrist was sentenced to prison in the late 1990s
for routinely billing patients' health insurers for the maximum
number of visits allowed under their policies. In fact, he had seen
them only a few times. Patients discovered the fraud when claims for
treatment from different psychiatrists were denied because their
benefits had been exhausted by the bogus billing.</TE>
<TE>   Questionable billing practices also cost the health system plenty.
Aetna's Stergio says that if a physician can create phony or inflated
billings for five or six patients a day, the extra income quickly
adds up. Earlier this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services found that a clinic in Los Angeles had been paying people
$20 or $30 to undergo tests they didn't need so that the clinics
could bill Medicare and Medi-Cal for the services. The federal agency
said it is working with law enforcement officials on the case. It has
long been known that health-care fraud is big business. Government
and law enforcement agencies have estimated that health fraud may
account for as much as 10% of the nation's $1.3-trillion medical bill
-- or $130 billion a year. Obviously, we all pay for this, whether
through higher medical premiums or increased taxes to pay for law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Why do such practices continue? Insurers say that proving fraud is
time-consuming and costly. And crooks can be ingenious: When one
scheme is uncovered, another invariably pops up, often involving the
same people. "It all comes down to money and greed," says Mike
Brandt, manager of special investigations for insurer Health Net's
western region.</TE>
<TE>   While greed is not a human trait likely to disappear anytime soon,
there are steps you can take to help protect yourself. First, look
over your medical bills carefully and report charges that look
suspicious. Never give your insurance card or Medicare card to
anyone. Protect it like a credit card. If you have reason to believe
that your medical records might contain false information, you can
request a copy of your file from the MIB Group. (In most cases, there
is a $9 charge per request.) You can download a request form from
MIB's Web site at www.mib.com or call the company for information at
(617) 426-3660.</TE>

<LD>Youths in juvenile detention centers were certain to have their share
of mental illness, researchers thought. What they didn't expect was
the size of the problem: More than two-thirds of detained youths have
diagnosable psychiatric disorders, they found.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers from Northwestern University near Chicago found that
nearly two-thirds of boys and three-quarters of girls, ages 10 to 18,
had at least one psychiatric disorder. In the general population,
about 15% of children have mental illnesses or substance abuse
disorders.</LD>
<LD>   Previous studies on the rates of mental illness among detained
youths ranged widely. The new study, in the December issue of the
Archives of General Psychiatry, sampled 1,829 youths of various
ethnicities, both boys and girls, upon admission to the Cook County
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.</LD>
<TE>   "In this, a random sample of kids in a typical detention center --
Cook County is typical; it's not a particularly bad or good center --
our findings were quite alarming. We anticipated high rates, but not
this high," said Linda A. Teplin, a professor of psychiatry at
Northwestern and lead author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said, while researchers expected to find that
many children used drugs and alcohol, they were surprised that about
half of the detainees had diagnosable substance abuse disorders,
which involve serious addiction or long-term abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that 20% of the females met the criteria for
major depression.</TE>
<TE>   "We often think of kids in detention as being delinquent or bad.
But depression is a very serious mental disorder with serious
impairment in your day-to-day life," Teplin said.</TE>
<TE>   Although many youth offenders have conduct disorder, defined as a
persistent pattern of aggressive and destructive behavior, the rates
of psychiatric illness remained high even when that diagnosis was
excluded; 60% of boys and two-thirds of girls still had a diagnosable
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   The report is the first in what Teplin anticipates will be a
series of studies aimed at understanding the mental health needs of
youth who run afoul of the law. Her research group gained attention
in the 1990s with the first detailed analyses showing high rates of
mental illness among incarcerated adults.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel, in part because of our studies, that those populations
received a lot more attention and resulted in jails nationwide being
much more concerned about treatment of mentally ill detainees in
their care," said Teplin. "We anticipate that this study will have a
similar impact."</TE>
<TE>   In the paper, Teplin and her group hypothesize that more poor and
disadvantaged children than ever are not receiving adequate mental
health care.</TE>
<TE>   The shift to managed care, in which mental health care is often
not covered by insurance, and the trend toward welfare-to-work
programs may leave more children without services. For example,
families on welfare can receive Medicaid benefits to obtain mental
health services. But many parents leave welfare for jobs that do not
supply insurance or offer affordable co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of cuts in the funding of children's mental health care
... there is concern that this problem is not going to get better;
it's going to get worse," Teplin said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers plan to publish studies early next year on HIV
risk and sex abuse among detained youth.</TE>

<LD>Grip strengtheners have been around for years and are used to build
stronger muscles in the hand, wrist and forearm. Those exercises are
important, says Dino Nowak, general manager of the Equinox Fitness
Club in Pasadena, for everything from improving one's tennis game to
climbing mountains to relieving stress.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one thing that people never really work on, unless they're

<HD>Norwalk thrives at sea -- and on land</HD>
<DH>Recent outbreaks on ships put the virus in the spotlight,
but it has long been second only to the common cold in causing
illness in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Americans heard of the Norwalk virus only recently, after it
sickened hundreds of cruise ship passengers. But the microbe is
hardly a stranger.</LD>
<LD>   Medical experts say the germ is usually the culprit behind those
bouts of the "stomach bug" that sweep through homes, day-care
centers, restaurants and other places people congregate. In fact,
with the exception of the common cold, it's the most frequent cause
of illness in the United States, according to the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   "Just about everyone gets exposed to it in their lifetime," says
Dr. John Painter, a CDC epidemiologist. "Norwalk is the most common
of infectious bugs, like salmonella or E. coli."</LD>
<TE>   First identified in 1971 after an outbreak in Norwalk, Ohio, the
pesky germ strikes 23 million people a year, triggering stomach
cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and low-grade fever.
Transmitted through person-to-person contact or by ingesting
contaminated food or water, the virus causes two-thirds of the known
food-borne illnesses, said Dr. Marc-Alain Widdowson, a CDC
epidemiologist, dwarfing the incidence of illnesses caused by
salmonella or E. coli.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are just beginning to get a handle on the magnitude of
this virus' impact, however. Tests sensitive enough to detect the
microbe were only recently developed, Widdowson said, "so we're still
in the process of determining its actual prevalence," which could be
even greater than current estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwalk virus is actually a group of similar viruses that are
now called noroviruses. Like the common cold, which can be caused by
more than 100 viruses, any strain of these noroviruses -- and many
strains are circulating at any one time -- can trigger the same
constellation of symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, it's just a terrible nuisance that can fell an
entire family, leaving everyone reeling for a few days. The
incubation period is 12 to 48 hours, and the symptoms persist from 12
hours to three days, though some cases linger longer.</TE>
<TE>   For infants and the frail elderly, however, it can be deadly: The
vomiting and diarrhea can cause severe dehydration, which in rare
instances can be fatal. Each year, about 20,000 hospitalizations and
124 deaths are attributed to the Norwalk virus. "Usually, though, it
lasts one to three days, and then people feel fine, if a little worn
out," Painter said.</TE>
<TE>   People confined to close quarters -- on cruise ships, in nursing
homes or camp grounds -- are especially susceptible when an outbreak
occurs because the virus spreads so easily.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very contagious and just a few virus particles can make
people ill," Painter said. "And when one person is ill, he or she has
the potential to contaminate many other people, who then infect
others." Suddenly, you have a major outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   In about 14 million cases, people catch the bug through direct
contact with someone who is infected, from touching or shaking hands,
or being around them when they vomit. "The vomit can be aerosolized
with multiple particles in the air," said Michael P. Doyle, director
of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia. People
can also unwittingly spread the virus for up to two weeks after
they've recovered from the acute phase of their infection; the virus
on their hands or in their stool continues to shed, though it
gradually loses it potency.</TE>
<TE>   In the other 9 million cases, people get sick from drinking water
or eating food containing the virus, which can be in raw shellfish,
such as oysters or clams, that have been harvested from seas
contaminated with sewage, or in foods handled by someone infected
with the virus -- fruits, salads, crab dishes, sandwiches or luncheon
meats.</TE>
<TE>   Since the virus can survive five days or longer on surfaces, it
can also be picked up from carpeting, floors, walls or even toys
touched by infected kids in day-care centers. And it's hard to kill
-- some cruise ships have been sanitized with strong disinfectants
several times to no avail, while hospitals in Europe and Canada had
to be shuttered until the virus ran its course. The CDC is
investigating why this happens.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to distinguish whether an upset stomach is caused by
the Norwalk virus or other microbes carried in food, because the
symptoms are similar. But Norwalk virus infections normally don't
last as long, and the symptoms are usually milder. "If people have
high fevers, bloody stools and a number of individuals are
hospitalized during an outbreak, it's probably not caused by the
Norwalk virus," Painter said. These symptoms are more likely the
result of a salmonella, E. coli or shigella infection.</TE>
<TE>   There is no treatment for this illness other than staying in bed,
drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and riding it out.
If someone in your family gets sick, good hygiene can minimize the
risk of further infections -- thoroughly wash towels, blankets and
utensils they may have used, and keep your own hands clean.
"Hand-washing may sound like an old-fashioned remedy, but it works,"
Widdowson says.</TE>

<LD>Which is better for burning calories -- weights or cardio?</LD>
<LD>   Research has shown that aerobic activity burns more calories and
fat during exercise than weightlifting. However, some studies have
shown that weightlifting burns more calories and fat after exercise.</LD>
<LD>   Consider that aerobic exercise and weightlifting are doing two
very different things to help our bodies stay fit. Aerobic exercise
has favorable effects on our cardiorespiratory system (the heart,
lungs and blood vessels), whereas weightlifting has favorable effects
on skeletal muscle. That is, it increases the size and strength of
your muscles. For optimum health and fitness, do both types of
exercise.</LD>
<TE>   Do you have any personal fitness tips for exercising when it's
rainy and cold? I have a busy schedule, but I do have a treadmill at
home.</TE>
<TE>   To make indoor exercise easy, set up your exercise equipment in
front of a television, or even better, a TV with a VCR or DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   At home, I won't watch TV (or a movie) unless I'm exercising. This
takes my mind off the pressure and boredom of exercising indoors and
helps the time pass more quickly. You can also listen to books on
tape.</TE>
<TE>   When I do venture outside for walks or runs in the cold, I always
make sure I'm dressed properly. Inclement weather isn't so bad with
all the warm weaves and new fibers available in athletic wear these
days.</TE>

<HD>The other effects of getting high</HD>
<DH>Though illicit drug use is on the rise among young adults,
few are aware of what it does to the brain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Judy Foreman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The son of a friend of mine is 17, tall, good-looking, quiet -- and a
prime example of how much and yet how little many kids know about
illegal drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Asked what he has used, the teen rattles off pot, alcohol and
'shrooms (mushrooms), which he and a friend grow. But he's also done
acid (LSD), crack (cocaine), crystal meth (a form of
methamphetamine), prescription tranquilizers and painkillers such as
Valium and Percocet, and, oh, yeah, GHB, Ecstasy (and its variants)
and mescaline. Asked if he wants to get clean, he says, "Not right
now. My use is just recreational."</LD>
<LD>   And perhaps it is. But the latest government figures released in
September show that illegal drug use is up among young adults between
18 and 25. There may be much that my friend's son, and America's
other 16 million illicit drug users, don't know about how street
drugs affect the brain.</LD>
<TE>   One main class of street drugs is the psychostimulants, which
include amphetamines (such as methamphetamines and MDMA, or Ecstasy)
and methylphenidate and cocaine. In low doses, amphetamines generate
feelings of euphoria and alertness. But at higher doses, these drugs
can trigger paranoia and psychosis.</TE>
<TE>   Amphetamines are psychologically and physically addicting. Also
called speed, they can increase blood pressure and heart rate.
Because they constrict blood vessels, they "deprive the heart of
blood flow while forcing it to do more work," says
psychopharmacologist Glen Hanson, acting director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In the brain, Hanson says, amphetamines and methamphetamines act
as "releasers" of neurotransmitters, forcing the brain to pump out 30
to 40 times the normal levels of these neurotransmitters, most
notably dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. The immediate effect
is to activate the brain's "reward" circuits. But over-revving this
circuitry can also cause violent behavior. Chronic stimulation
depletes brain cells so that they can no longer produce
neurotransmitters.</TE>
<TE>   MDMA, or Ecstasy, now used by nearly a million people, according
to federal figures, works somewhat differently. As one might guess
from its chemical name (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), MDMA is
an amphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, scientists thought that MDMA worked primarily on
serotonin, creating such a flood of good feeling that users called it
the "love drug."</TE>
<TE>   In one set of studies, Dr. Una D. McCann, associate professor of
psychiatry and behavior sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
and her husband, Dr. George A. Ricuarte, associate professor of
neurology, also at Johns Hopkins, examined monkeys, baboons and
humans, and found that MDMA is toxic to neurons that make serotonin.</TE>
<TE>   In humans, McCann and Ricuarte have documented damage using PET
scans, a brain imaging technique, and tests for 5-HIAA, a breakdown
product of serotonin. The implications are serious -- without
sufficient serotonin, sleep, mood, memory and other crucial brain
functions may be disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, MDMA users often report that depression (or "E-pression")
strikes after a weekend on Ecstasy. MDMA can also induce muscle
tension and trigger such high body temperatures -- 107 to 108 degrees
Fahrenheit -- that seizures, multi-organ failure and even death can
result.</TE>
<TE>   Recently Ricuarte's group reported in Science magazine that in
animals, Ecstasy lowers levels of dopamine as well as serotonin,
raising the risk of Parkinson's disease. So far, however, there
appear to be no increased rates of Parkinson's disease among human
Ecstasy users. In fairness, it's also true that the benefits of
Ecstasy are beginning to be taken seriously as well. Last fall, the
Food and Drug Administration approved a study of Ecstasy as an aid to
psychotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Cocaine, a psychostimulant, works in yet a different way, notes
Dr. Marc Kaufman, a research pharmacologist at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   It does rev up the brain's "reward" circuitry. But unlike other
drugs, cocaine does its damage not by directly damaging neurons that
make neurotransmitters but by reducing blood flow to parts of the
brain. By causing blood vessels to narrow, it raises the risk of
stroke and heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most popular street drugs are depressants, among them,
the "date-rape" drugs. One such downer is GHB, called gamma
hydroxybutyrate but also known as liquid ecstasy or Georgia HomeBoy.
It can be easily slipped into a person's drink. Like alcohol and the
tranquilizer Valium, GHB acts through so-called GABA receptors, the
brain's intrinsic tranquilizer system; when GABA receptors are
activated, neural activity slows down.</TE>
<TE>   So far, GHB has not been shown to cause damage to neurons. But it
can relax a user too far -- to the point of rendering someone
incapable of resisting unwanted sex. It can also lead to coma and
even to death; alcohol can enhance this effect.</TE>
<TE>   Another date-rape drug, Rohypnol, has similar effects. Dubbed
Roofies, Rohypnol is a benzodiazepine. Like GHB, it works through
GABA receptors and receptors for benzodiazepine as well. Rohypnol,
which is legally available overseas, can also trigger amnesia, making
it treacherous in the hands of anyone seeking to coerce someone into
sex and render his victim unable to recall events.</TE>
<TE>   Ketamine, a powerful anesthesia drug often used by veterinarians,
is another popular downer. Dubbed K and Special K, it is similar to
PCP (phencyclidine, or angel dust) and is easy to make. It blocks
NDMA receptors in the brain, producing general anesthesia.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, meaning it
does not directly kill pain but makes people not react to the pain
they are feeling.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, heroin is a direct painkiller, acting on opiate
receptors in the brain. Users who are hooked must have heroin, or its
legal substitute, methadone, every day simply so they won't feel
sick. The list of drugs that are abused -- including alcohol, LSD and
mescaline -- is endless. Finally, I'll mention marijuana, a sedative
and a light hallucinogen. Marijuana acts on cannabinoid receptors and
is not believed to cause permanent brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line with all drugs of abuse, adds Hanson, is that
recreational use can turn into a "game of Russian roulette." Street
drugs "don't kill everyone who takes them," and obviously not
everyone becomes addicted. But he adds, "The benefits just do not
warrant the kind of risk you are exposing yourself to."</TE>
<TE>   My friend's son, among others, is not convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it all comes down to the person. We are all different,
with such different brain chemistry," he says.</TE>

<HD>Software for a harder body</HD>
<DH>Programs that track heart rates, give detailed progress
reports and even plan workouts grow more popular.</DH>

<LD>When Los Angeles personal trainer Antony Galvan joined a pro cycling
team, he knew he couldn't afford to have a bad workout. So three
months ago, he turned to software programs to track his progress.</LD>
<LD>   Devices attached to his body and his bicycle now track his heart
rate and how much power he's expending, and that information is then
downloaded into his computer. "I can see where I'm most efficient and
where I need to work more," says Galvan, who races with the KB Home
Pro Cycling Team. "It's made so much of a difference because you have
solid numbers you can work with and you understand how your body is
adapting."</LD>
<LD>   Galvan is among a growing number of exercise buffs, athletes and
fitness professionals who have traded their spiral notebooks for
software programs that can track everything from heart rates and
workout intensity levels to bench presses and calories expended. The
programs can create graphs and charts to mark progress and plan
workouts. One program allows exercisers to set up their own treadmill
workout on a personal digital assistant and beam it into the machine
-- no need for pushing speed or incline buttons.</LD>
<TE>   These electronic fitness logs aren't just for exercise-obsessed
techno-heads; even people who simply want to lose 10 pounds or beef
up their biceps can benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Louis Gareau, a San Diego-based computer consultant and
writer, created My Sport Training software for Pocket PCs and Windows
after he became frustrated with the limitations of his spreadsheet
program. "I started seriously training for cycling and I'm a computer
buff, so I started to use [a Microsoft] Excel program. But when I
wanted to see how many workouts I did last year compared to this year
or what I've accomplished in the last three months, it wasn't
convenient."</TE>
<TE>   His program allows users to track cardiovascular activities such
as cycling or running, plus strength training, as well as keep notes
on weight, calorie intake, heart rate, blood pressure, body fat, even
mood and quality of sleep. It offers daily and monthly views of
workouts and various graphs to see duration, distance and weight
levels over time. The Windows program allows users to download
information from Polar heart rate monitors and e-mail the data.
Prices run from $14.95 to $34.95.</TE>
<TE>   Although serious athletes do buy the program, he says, the
majority of users are "casual fitness people, people who take good
care of themselves, not maniacs like me or experienced computer
users."</TE>
<TE>   Exercisers don't even have to own a computer to use fitness
software if they belong to certain YMCAs. A program called Fitlinxx
incorporates small devices attached to weight and cardiovascular
machines that track exercisers' use and sends the information to a
database. A kiosk spits out the workout results at the end of the
session; the program can also be accessed online.</TE>
<TE>   On weight machines, the device recalls the user's preferred seat
height and last workout -- such as how many repetitions were done at
what weight -- and gives a target for that day. Sensors beep when the
range of motion has gone awry or repetitions are done too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for the program from a consumer's standpoint is to
stay motivated and get good results once they do," says Keith Camhi,
Fitlinxx co-founder and chief executive. The Connecticut-based
company leases its program to about 450 facilities around the
country, including health clubs, hospitals and military bases, for
$1,000 to $4,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We based the program on watching 50 different trainers interact
with their clients," Camhi adds.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't replace a personal trainer, but it's an electronic
fill-in for some of the things a trainer does."</TE>
<TE>   JC Holt Jr., executive director of the Stuart M. Ketchum-Downtown
YMCA in L.A., says Fitlinxx has helped retain members who might have
dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "For beginning exercisers or people who have been dieting on and
off for ages," he says, "this is a support system that helps them
stay with the program because it can help motivate them. They can see
the results right away." Counselors also peruse readouts, allowing
them to help people who have skipped workouts or reached a fitness
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   Star Trac, an Irvine-based fitness equipment manufacturer, now
offers the Pro Elite treadmill, which incorporates software allowing
users to create their own program -- whatever speed, incline or
duration they choose. That program is beamed via a Palm device into
the treadmill, which then sends the workout results back.</TE>
<TE>   But these programs aren't for everyone. "They're very good for
people who are getting started or when you plateau," says Jeffrey
Potteiger, director of the health and human performance laboratory at
Virginia Commonwealth University.</TE>
<TE>   "It can get you over the edge. It's simply another mechanism to
help you accomplish what you need."</TE>
<TE>   While jotting down statistics in a notebook is fine, he does see
the benefits of technology: "You have the ability to do some
calculations, identify some trends and, if you want to increase your
intensity by 5%, you can recalculate your target heart rate training
zone."</TE>
<TE>   Potteiger predicts that software programs will offer personalized
workouts based on age, weight and health. "I'm not advocating
eliminating physicians or personal trainers, but this will allow us
to use computer technology to its fullest."</TE>

<LD>Many people don't get enough vitamin D, the nutrient produced in the
body through sun exposure, recent studies have found. Although the
problem is more common in northern climates, even some residents of
sunny Southern California are vitamin D deficient. The nutrient is
found in eggs, seafood, mushrooms and some fortified milk and cereal,
but it's hard to get enough from food alone -- and supplements are
often necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium from food.
Deficiencies contribute to the weakening of bones and an increased
risk of bone fracture. People who are over age 65, dark-skinned or
overweight are at risk of vitamin D deficiency, as well as anyone who
lives in climates without much winter sun. Sufficient vitamin D also
might protect against the development of numerous disorders,
including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, schizophrenia and multiple
sclerosis.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: From 400 international units (for people who get some sun)
to 1,000 IUs, daily.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Vitamin D should be avoided in doses of more than
2,000 IUs per day because of potential kidney damage. It's impossible
to get too much vitamin D from sun exposure because the body
regulates how much it makes on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Studies are exploring whether vitamin D supplements can
decrease the rates of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Another reason to brush and floss: stroke prevention</HD>
<DH>Losing one's teeth may increase the risk for infections and
blockages to the brain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dentists often warn patients that inadequate toothbrushing and
flossing habits could lead to gum disease and tooth loss. Now a study
by Harvard University researchers suggests that losing your teeth may
also heighten your risk of suffering a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   The new study has found that men with fewer than 25 teeth had a
57% higher risk of suffering an ischemic stroke than those who had 25
or more teeth. Ischemic strokes are caused by blockage of an artery
to the brain.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists haven't yet established a direct cause-and-effect
between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. But the
latest findings add to a growing body of research linking infections,
including those of the mouth, to heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists have proposed several explanations. Some believe that
when bacteria in the mouth get into the bloodstream, they create
inflammation that increases the buildup of plaque in the arteries.
Plaque can break off and lodge in the heart, causing a heart attack,
or in the brain, causing a stroke. Some believe a periodontal
infection makes blood more likely to clot, raising the risk of stroke
or heart attack. Another idea is that the bacteria may release a
toxin that damages cells lining the arteries.</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies of the link between gum disease and
cardiovascular disease have been mixed. One found that stroke
patients were more likely to have oral infections than healthy
patients, and another found that people with periodontal disease were
more likely to have thickened carotid arteries in the neck.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from the Harvard School of Dental Medicine published
their findings in the Dec. 13 online issue of Stroke: Journal of the
American Heart Assn. The 12-year study followed 41,380 men, mostly
white dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, optometrists, osteopaths
and podiatrists. All were 40 to 75 years old and had no heart disease
or diabetes when they signed up.</TE>
<TE>   There were 349 ischemic strokes among the men. Patients with 17 to
24 teeth had a 50% higher risk of stroke than those with 25 to 32
teeth (a full set is 32). Those with 11 to 16 teeth had a 74% higher
risk; those with 10 or fewer teeth had a 66% higher risk.Stroke risk
was most closely related to the number of missing teeth when a man
entered the study, not the number lost in the subsequent years.</TE>
<TE>   "If infection is a major factor," said Dr. Don Smith, director of
the stroke program at Colorado Neurological Institute, "then good
dental hygiene may achieve the level of importance in stroke
prevention that we now accord to control of blood pressure, cessation
of smoking, exercise and healthy diet."</TE>

<LD>Jack watched through the car window for the first glimpse of Grandma
and Grandpa's farm. He could hardly wait to see them and all their
animals -- the cows and the old horse and Tarzan, their big brown
dog.</LD>
<LD>   He could hardly wait to see the Christmas Cousins too.</LD>
<LD>   Grandpa called all of his grandchildren the "Christmas Cousins"
because they got together only once a year, at Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   "We're almost there," Jack's mom said from the front seat. "Have
all of you decided what your special gifts will be?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Jack's big sisters, Molly and Megan. They sat on
either side of him, making a sister sandwich with Jack as the
filling.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Jack. That was the only problem about the day. He
hadn't yet figured out a special gift.</TE>
<TE>   Every year Grandpa asked each of the Christmas Cousins to present
a special gift after the big family dinner on the day before
Christmas. The gifts had to be something they thought of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Jack's gift had been a song he'd sung for all the
cousins and parents and Grandpa and Grandma. He'd asked Mom to help
him learn all the words to "Away in a Manger."</TE>
<TE>   This year he hadn't thought of anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   Finally he saw Grandpa and Grandma's house. Dad drove down the
long lane. Jack waved at Grandpa's old gray horse and the cows that
gazed at him from the snowy pasture.</TE>
<TE>   Dad honked the horn as he stopped the car in the yard. Tarzan
bounced over, whirling his tail in welcome. Big cousins and little
cousins tumbled out of the house like apples from a basket. They were
all smiling.</TE>
<TE>   They probably all had their special gifts ready.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Jack be the only cousin who hasn't thought of a
special gift to give?</TE>

<HD>Ashanti struts on stage and takes over the Wonderjam at the
Shrine</HD>
<DH>Singer brings power and personality to her first solo set.
Keith Sweat also performs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stardom comes easily for some singers, if not always for the same
reasons. So while Ashanti is no threat creatively to such distinctive
soul artists as Alicia Keys and India.Arie, she still carries herself
on stage like she belongs there. And she does.</LD>
<LD>   Ashanti's first solo set in Los Angeles was the high point in
Friday's Hot 92 Winter Wonderjam at the Shrine Auditorium, which also
included sets by Keith Sweat, Midnight Star and Rose Royce.</LD>
<LD>   There was real power and personality in Ashanti's young voice,
both light and sultry, reaching far beyond the limitations of her
material. She was bright and playful if not unique. During the song
"What's Luv" (her hit with Fat Joe), Ashanti vamped across the stage
in a short skirt, swinging her hips, pointing to fans in the crowd
while declaring, "It's definitely all the way live out here."</LD>
<TE>   It was a fire Ashanti will need for an accelerating career she
said had her playing another concert earlier the same day in New York
City. She sang to pre-programmed backing tracks from DJ B-Lyse, who
also offered an occasional grunt or cheer from beneath a hooded
Celtics jacket. But the prefab sounds were surprisingly full-bodied.</TE>
<TE>   Many songs seemed abbreviated, ending abruptly and rolling right
into the next one, as if Ashanti were trying to fit her entire
repertoire into a short set. But she made them count with humor and
attitude, explaining to cheers that her hit "Foolish" was about
undependable men: "They got us ladies doing crazy things!"</TE>
<TE>   Top-billed Keith Sweat is deep into his own multi-platinum career,
a rigid lover-man riding waves of soothing, innocuous sound, vaguely
soulful and with a thin layer of romance. On Friday the singer fed
off the energy of his four-piece band, dancing across the stage in
baggy leather pants, repeatedly grabbing his crotch like he meant it.</TE>
<TE>   Sweat has turned to a more danceable sound recently, but it's a
minor adjustment to the same formula: music of manufactured feeling,
with nothing truly at stake, emotional or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd reaction was virtually as strong for Midnight Star, even
if the band still looks and sounds like an '80s R&amp;B act. That wasn't
the genre's best decade, but the veteran act still turned its
danceable funk, "slow jams" and cartoonish keyboards into a party
worth having.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>How a Frog and Toad soft-shoed into our memories</HD>
<DH>Theater people are mostly unsentimental about the end of a
play. After eight performances a week, for weeks on end, the cast and
the crew invariably are eager to move on. "They all close, sooner or
later," ho-hums Mark Linn-Baker, an actor who recently stopped
playing a toad off-Broadway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>But for those of us in the seats, it is not so easy to move on.
That's the magic, the ephemeral nature of reliving in our minds what
is gone forever. I can still see Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson
embracing on stage in "Anna Christie" in 1993. The show won a Tony
and they wound up married. And for New Yorkers, such reminiscing
about great theater is a form of theater itself.</LD>
<LD>   I happened to attend the last performance of "A Year in the Life
of Frog and Toad," a musical based on four children's books at the
New Victory Theater on 42nd Street and Broadway. It is a charming
tale of friendship between a worrying, twitchy Toad and a stable,
silky-smooth Frog.</LD>
<LD>   Near the end of the performance, my 6-year-old daughter leaned
close to me and whispered, "Mommy, is it over? I don't want it to
be."</LD>
<TE>   But it ended, and therein lies the sadness and the glory. My
little girl can reread the books, but she cannot relive the songs and
dances by popping something in the VCR or DVD player. The theater is
one of the last temporal experiences in an over-archived world. And
while the show will surely be produced again -- maybe in an even
better version this spring in a larger Broadway theater-- all my
daughter has for now is her recollection of what happened on a crisp
Sunday in December between two silly, soft-shoeing amphibians.</TE>
<TE>   This is how one little girl's vision came to be another little
girl's memory:</TE>
<TE>   Long ago in Brooklyn, an 11-year-old girl named Adrianne who loved
slimy animals went with her family to "the country," as New Yorkers
call any patch of grass beyond Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   There, she caught a toad.</TE>
<TE>   "What a nice frog you have there!" her father said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it's a toad," she replied, explaining the difference.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Arnold Lobel, an illustrator and author, began the
"Frog and Toad" book series. The books caught on.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the little girl dreamed of becoming an artist
like both of her parents. They took her to museums and plays, and
after every good report card her father would spirit her away to a
Fred Astaire movie.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of going to college, the little girl, now 18, fled New
York for Hollywood, and got jobs drafting and building set models in
movie studios. After two years, she fled again, this time to the Yale
School of Drama, where finally she met Toad, masquerading as a
student named Mark Linn-Baker.</TE>
<TE>   They were friends and collaborators for years before they married.
Toad started a theater workshop, and starred in Broadway hits and for
seven years in TV's "Perfect Strangers." Meantime, the little girl
was designing sets for operas (John Adams' "Nixon in China"), for
Broadway (Stephen Sondheim's "Passion"), and for choreographer Mark
Morris.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s the two friends began meeting regularly for
late-night dinners after working on separate shows. Eventually the
little girl, now an accomplished set designer, and Toad -- that's
Linn-Baker -- fell in love, for real, and in time embarked on two
very big projects together -- a musical and parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   The first was the musical.</TE>
<TE>   "Marrying Mark had a lot to do with my adapting 'Frog and Toad,' "
says Lobel, 47. "He was always Toad in my head. And I always loved
toads, and was offended by the frog-to-prince transition."</TE>
<TE>   It took six years for them to assemble a hive of friends and
collaborators in theater who together created this unabashedly
sentimental musical.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of all these talented people was Adrianne Lobel, the
little girl. She was the visionary, the producer, the pitchman, and
inspiring her were her father's beautiful little stories as well as
her memory of all the things that he had loved.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Lobel, who died in 1987 at age 54, was passionate about
jazz music and Fred Astaire-/Gene Kelly-style dancing and vaudeville
gags and the gentility of Edwardian gentlemen. That was all in the
script when the show opened last summer with glowing reviews first at
the Children's Theater Company in Minneapolis and then in November at
the New Victory, and again at that wistful last performance in
December.</TE>
<TE>   The team of Lobel/Baker also completed another project in 2002:
After six years of trying -- almost the same amount of time it took
to bring their show to Broadway -- they brought their own little girl
into the world, Ruby Beatrice Baker.</TE>
<TE>   This week, I took a reluctant Lobel back to the New Victory. We
entered through the stage door, and the security guard didn't
remember her and had to call "upstairs" before he let us in. The sets
and costumes for "A Year in the Life of Frog and Toad" were packed in
boxes and sent for storage somewhere in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Lobel didn't even know where they were. The stage has been
redesigned to house the Shanghai Circus. As we navigated the darkened
backstage with unicycles strewn about, Lobel explained how her
old-fashioned sets were perfectly suited for the New Victory, which
has been every incarnation of theater in its 100 year history --
burlesque, vaudeville, porno movie house and now restored as a family
theater.</TE>
<TE>   It was the perfect cozy place for Frog and Toad and their animal
friends who just days ago were alive there -- planting flowers,
swimming, sledding, baking cookies, fighting, reconciling and singing
such songs as "Getta Loada Toad." Now they are gone.</TE>
<TE>   Lobel pulls her coat around her, against the drafty, empty theater
and heads for the exit. What's done is done.</TE>

<HD>Engaging fable contrasts 1960s ideals with age of greed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1960s are a decade that has been (to borrow a once-fashionable
academic term) "reified" on both sides of the political spectrum: by
the nostalgic left as a golden age of hope and idealism, by the
affronted right as a chaotic carnival of decadence, anarchy and
self-delusion.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Here and Now," an engaging fable about a cynical, wildly
successful corporate lawyer whose well-oiled life is suddenly
disrupted by memories of his youthful '60s idealism, Gregg
Easterbrook uses the earlier era as a symbol of integrity and
altruism in contrast to the current age of trickery and unbridled
greed. But despite a tendency to oversimplify that is inherent in
writing a fable, Easterbrook, a senior editor at the New Republic and
a contributing editor to Atlantic Monthly, manages to get beyond such
black-and-white thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Having enjoyed a brief shining moment as the nonviolent "Daffodil
Man" of the antiwar movement and lover of the spirited and principled
activist Jayne Anne LaMonica, Carter Morris has become the kind of
man he and she would have once despised. At present, he is working
out a sweetheart deal with the aptly named Value Neutral clothing
company, which has become the subject of a class-action lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   The company has been charged with using an unapproved chemical
substance called Simu-Sweat (to give its sportswear that coveted wet
look whether the person wearing it actually bothers to exercise).
Carter has been handpicked by Value Neutral as the lawyer to
represent the class of injured consumers. The settlement deal will
include an astronomically large sum to Carter and his law firm, and
some measly discount coupons for the consumers on whose behalf the
lawsuit was purportedly filed.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Carter's youthful ideals? The young man who once
ridiculed the work ethic has buried those ideals under a ton of work:
"The age group to which Carter belonged grew up detesting the
fifties-style institutional culture of conformism, yet the new
institutional culture it created was just as inimical. Careerism ...
the cell phone ... the tyranny of the stock price; his enlightened
peers bowed to them all."</TE>
<TE>   While working on the Value Neutral case, Carter suddenly begins
having weird, inexplicable episodes during which he seems to go back
in time to earlier versions of himself. Although the net effect of
this time travel is to reawaken his lost idealism, it also enables
him -- and us -- to understand how and why many of these idealists so
easily transformed themselves into cynical careerists.</TE>
<TE>   Some, it seems, weren't really very nice in the first place. For
example, Carter's least favorite fellow activist, Marshall Lelchuck,
is making a fortune buying up land for malls: His pet project is to
build a theme park called Gates of Hell, with virtual-reality
chambers in which kids can play killers from psycho movies or watch
holograms of their friends and families being slashed by crazed
stalkers. Yet others, like Carter's lost love Jayne Anne, have
continued the quest to make the world a better place. The
free-spirited girl who had championed love not war and defused many a
tense situation in the 1960s is now running a home for children whose
parents are in jail. Indeed, it would seem that genuine idealists
like Jayne have not changed with the times, just as the vicious and
opportunistic members of the movement are now vicious, opportunistic
pillars of the establishment.</TE>
<TE>   As for Carter, like many of his generation, he may have had too
easy a childhood. Discouraged by his experiences in criminal law,
Carter opted for the easy and lucrative way out, then tried to
rationalize his choice by chalking it up to the temper of the times.
Easterbrook seems to suggest that many of Carter's generation,
conditioned by the affluent society that bred them to expect instant
gratification, quickly lost interest when the millennium didn't
materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Easterbrook gets in some good satirical licks against a variety of
reprehensible targets, from venal lawyers to corporations happy to
shower money on high-priced executives or celebrity endorsements but
that would "sooner die than give an extra dime to a seamstress in
Vietnam."</TE>
<TE>   But he has some subtler points to make. Greed and venality are not
the only problem. More insidious is the way that people have been led
to believe that economic injustice is inevitable: "[W]hat if the
economists were right and closing sweatshops just meant the people
who once toiled there would be even worse off?" Carter wonders. "The
sort of international fair-wage agreements that would resolve this
dilemma to everyone's mutual benefit seemed hopelessly utopian.
Carter let the idea go. It was a fight for somebody else to take on."</TE>
<TE>   Reading "The Here and Now" is rather like attending a pep rally
against this kind of defeatism. As Carter travels between his hopeful
youth and his cynical current self, he finally realizes that the real
danger is thinking in terms of "decades" or "periods." Blaming the
times instead of ourselves cuts us off from our ideals and
identities, depriving us of the opportunity to act in the here and
now.</TE>

<HD>Now, 'My Big Fat Greek' TV show</HD>
<DH>The wide success of the film has rekindled interest in a
CBS sitcom, with Nia Vardalos in the lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As box-office returns continue to pour in for "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," CBS executives are updating their original plans for an
underdog, midseason replacement purchased last year from a comedian
who was hoping to get a movie version of the show distributed.</LD>
<LD>   CBS shot the pilot of "My Big Fat Greek Family" in March -- after
the film had been made but before it was released -- starring the
funny woman, Nia Vardalos.</LD>
<LD>   But the success of her film, released in April, has changed the
fate of that "backup" sitcom.</LD>
<TE>   The title has been changed to "My Big Fat Greek Life," and every
cast member from the movie, except for John Corbett, who played the
WASPy boyfriend, has agreed to appear in the TV show.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, instead of centering the pilot around the wedding
day, Vardalos insisted they launch the series the day after the
boisterous family event.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to see the journey between honeymoon and 6-year-old
(daughter)," Vardalos said in her upbeat, husky voice at a recent
Writers Guild of America seminar.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Grey Television, which is producing the show for CBS and
which also handles such successes as "The Sopranos," will reshoot the
pilot next month.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to scrap the original pilot is a good look into how
Vardalos' leverage at the network has changed. Along with worldwide
fame and a cut of the movie's profits, Vardalos is now overseeing a
newly hired team of TV writers who are creating story lines for
characters based on her family. Admittedly, Vardalos said, it's a
format and a process she knows nothing about.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a commitment for seven episodes and I'm off promoting the
film and they're coming up with great premises," she said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The film hardly needs additional promoting. Made for $5 million
and featuring the virtually unknown Vardalos, "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding" was initially distributed to 108 theaters. To date, it has
grossed $215 million and is playing on thousands of screens. It's
also getting some Oscar buzz.</TE>
<TE>   But its box-office triumph may ultimately pose a problem for CBS
executives, who admit they won't be able to recapture the delight
felt by moviegoers in "discovering" the low-budget family comedy.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, now that the film has benefited from slow and steady
hype, CBS viewers may experience deja vu as the sitcom gets thrown
into a lineup with another sitcom centered around the zany
predicaments of a couple who clash with well-meaning, overbearing
in-laws.</TE>
<TE>   Executives dismiss any similarity between their long-running Emmy
Award-winning sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "My Big Fat Greek
Life."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a family show and there's a couple at the center, so I guess
you can make the comparison, although we're not making that
comparison," said Wendi Goldstein, senior vice president of comedy
development at CBS, who also helped develop "Raymond."</TE>

<HD>On skid row, a Modernist</HD>
<DH>A designer of homes for the affluent brings his flair to a

<LD>As he strides across the brightly colored second-floor terrace of the
new James M. Wood Community Center, architect Michael B. Lehrer
virtually dances with glee.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't this the most delicious urban site?" he says, looking out
over the skid row intersection of San Julian and 5th streets, which
at this moment is teeming with people -- some sitting curbside
smoking and chatting, others in constant motion, wandering up and
down the sidewalks and in the middle of the street. Across San
Julian, a well-kept pocket park is brimming with men and women
playing cards and chess, hanging out and just joking around. Looming
just beyond are the layers of downtown L.A.'s ever-evolving business
districts, culminating in the high-power skyline of wealthy Bunker
Hill -- an image of beauty and a sure sign of just how diverse Los
Angeles really is.</LD>
<LD>   "They really get it," Lehrer says of the future patrons of his
latest design, which will be officially unveiled at a public ceremony
this morning. "This is a fancy building, and my belief system tells
me that makes people happy."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, this $1.6-million structure, created as a gathering place
for residents of skid row's single-room-occupancy hotels, recalls
many of the great moments in Modernist architecture. There are echoes
of Frank Gehry's use of mesh screens, Richard Meier's blinding white
walls and a Constructivist palette distinguishing a variety of
surfaces. And none of those references are by accident. Lehrer, 49, a
native of Los Feliz, where he still lives, is a Berkeley- and
Harvard-trained architect, a student of Modernist architecture and
art, and a former employee of Gehry.</TE>
<TE>   Under the auspices of his firm, Lehrer Architects, he has spent
most of his career designing homes for wealthy clients, among them
actresses Sally Field and Jamie Lee Curtis. (Curtis' residence graces
the cover of this month's Architectural Digest.) But he is by nature
a social activist as well, and in recent years his career has taken a
turn toward public projects, including a drop-in center for
indigents, completed in 1999, just down the street from the new
community center; a Reform synagogue in Newport Beach, completed last
summer; and plans for renovation of the Westside Jewish Community
Center on Olympic.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he and architect Mark Gangi, in partnership with
landscape architect Mia Lehrer, Michael's wife, have developed the
designs for two new museums on a single campus in Hemet -- the
Southern California Water Education Center, commissioned by a
foundation established by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California, and the Western Center for Archeology and Paleontology,
funded by the Western Center Community Foundation. The budget for the
project is $66 million; groundbreaking is expected to take place
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer insists that he uses the same approach in his public and
private works. "You depend on the pursuit of truth," he says in one
of many grand statements. "Architecture is fundamentally optimistic
-- all you do is look at anything and imagine how it can be
beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   As he walks through the new Wood Center, Lehrer points to the
complex perspectives he has created. Views of downtown from the
second-floor terrace. Windows onto the street in the large community
room downstairs. A small angular outdoor terrace on the ground floor,
surrounded by metal mesh painted bright silver, with a floor that is
bright red. "It's a place of dignity and joy," he says. "There is no
condescension. I believe that to the core of my body."</TE>
<TE>   All of Lehrer's designs are defined by a reverence for natural
light and dissonant geometry. His abundant use of white creates an
uplifting feeling. In recent projects he's included a palette of
violet and purple -- which he idiosyncratically insists are really
blues -- as well as blood red and forest green. These brilliant
colors add a sense of playfulness while enhancing the buildings'
relationship with the natural environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Wood Center's overt gaiety stands out in a largely
monochromatic neighborhood, beckoning people in. And no doubt it will
be used -- as a long-needed "community living room," its sponsors
say, a place for neighborhood residents to come for entertainment,
classes, meals and meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Need for a gathering place</TE>
<TE>   Located at an intersection once known as "Thieves Corner" for its
popularity as a place to fence stolen goods, the project was six
years in the making. It was commissioned by the nonprofit SRO Housing
Corp. in memory of its founder, labor leader and downtown activist
James M. Wood, who died of cancer at age 51 in 1996. Wood was a major
force in rehabilitating housing throughout skid row, once one of the
darkest corners of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The man behind the center's creation, Charles "Bud" Hayes,
executive director of SRO Housing, says the property was originally
slated to become the organization's administrative home. Looking for
a way to pay tribute to Wood, SRO, which provides housing for
transients, decided to poll its residents. The desire for a place to
gather became obvious, and Hayes says SRO immediately recognized that
a community center would be a fitting way to celebrate Wood's
ambitions to improve the lives of the very poor.</TE>
<TE>   "This center is an answer to tremendous need," Hayes says. With
18-foot-high ceilings on the ground floor, abundant natural light,
brightly colored walls and staircases and plenty of outdoor spaces,
it is also an unusual answer, Hayes believes, a reflection of
Lehrer's distinctive vision. "Michael doesn't have a box to think out
of. Michael's thinking is out of the box already," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that a risk to work with? Well, yes," Hayes adds. "But the
greater the risk, the greater the opportunity for return. We got
amazing return with this building. I'm absolutely in love with it."</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer was hired as project architect because of the success of
his design for the nearby Downtown Drop-In Center, also built by SRO,
just two blocks south on San Julian. That earlier building, which
provides temporary shelter, showers and resources to the
"service-resistant homeless" -- people who choose to live on the
streets -- won Lehrer an Honor Award for Architecture in 2001 from
the American Institute of Architects. It now accommodates about 700
to 800 people in the course of a day, with a typical occupancy of
about 40 to 50, except at evening peak hours, when its clients number
about 200, according to Jim Howat, director of homeless services for
Volunteers of America, Los Angeles, operator of the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The Drop-In Center was a pet project of then-Mayor Richard
Riordan, and Lehrer and Hayes say that despite its success, they
still regret compromises in the building's colors that were made for
political reasons. They believe they've recaptured some of what they
lost in the creation of the new Wood Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Drop-In Center nevertheless illustrates Lehrer's taste for
beauty -- in its trellises covered with bougainvillea, and its mix of
colonnades and open spaces that avoid the monotony of most
institutional design. Open to the street, it stands as an invitation
to escape from a harsh neighborhood, says Howat, a haven in which to
relax and regroup.</TE>
<TE>   A big-picture man</TE>
<TE>   Many architects pride themselves as much on the precision of their
personal presentation as in the clean lines of their work. Michael
Lehrer, by contrast, comes across as somewhat eccentric, a mensch
whose pockets are as like as not to be turned inside out, whose
thoughts are going in a million directions, and who spouts
Yiddishisms with the fluency of a child of immigrants. It's not that
he's not interested in details -- his care for the painted stripes on
the terrace floor at the Wood Center demonstrates his focus -- but
his demeanor quickly shows he's a big-picture man, with a lot going
on in his head.</TE>
<TE>   A proud homeboy, Lehrer offers a resume listing some unusual
information, including his graduation from the Los Feliz Jewish
Community Center nursery school in 1958. It is a pride of place that
he is revealing; he is an inveterate Angeleno who lives and works in
a 1930s house just blocks from where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   He is also active in local policymaking. He is vice chairman of
the School Construction Bond Citizens Oversight Committee, which
monitors repair of 700 existing schools and construction of 85 to 150
new ones for the Los Angeles Unified School District (projected to
cost between $6 billion and $8 billion). He served as president of
the L.A. chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1999 and
has also been a longtime adjunct professor of architecture at USC.</TE>
<TE>   But he is as likely to spend his time talking about his family --
his wife and frequent collaborator, Mia, and his three children -- as
he is about his civic accomplishments. Last summer his younger son,
Raphael, had his bar mitzvah in the chapel Lehrer designed for Temple
Bat Yahm in Newport Beach, the first ceremony conducted in the
then-not-quite-finished sanctuary, and Lehrer beams when he
repeatedly refers to the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Like the downtown centers he designed, Temple Bat Yahm displays
Lehrer's signature mix of natural light and color, but at the
synagogue these elements evoke a sensual spirituality. Above the
heart of the new chapel, a sculptural form of large metal open frames
wrapped in mesh serves as metaphorical steps toward the sky. Lehrer
calls this "Jacob's Ladder," referring to the passage in Genesis in
which Jacob dreams of angels traveling on a ladder between God and
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I took the theme of light and spirit very seriously," Lehrer
says. "The stripes of the ladder are primal images, with references
to everything from Don Judd's sculpture, on the one hand, to the
stripes on a tallit," the Jewish prayer shawl.</TE>
<TE>   As he drives to Orange County to visit Temple Bat Yahm, Lehrer
talks about how, soon after he finished the graduate architecture
program at Harvard in 1978, he came to the county to work on a house.
He has worked steadily since, building about 100 projects in his 24
years in practice, currently with eight architects working alongside
him in his office, although the number has ranged from two to 15.</TE>
<TE>   Whether his design is for the wealthy or the poor, he says, the
guiding principle is always the same. You have to pay attention to
every aspect of the job, to be almost "paranoid" about the end
result. Only the architect can ensure that the vision is realized.</TE>
<TE>   "My ambition has always been very simple," Lehrer says. "No
problem is too banal or mundane for an architect to solve. We are
deeply grounded in the everyday, but what I am doing is using art and
an understanding of technology to give form to peoples' needs and
aspirations."</TE>

misidentified architect Michael Lehrer's wife as a landscape
architect. Although her firm, Mia Lehrer + Associates, is a landscape
architecture firm, she is a landscape designer and is not licensed as

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Period pieces colored with swift tempo, raw passion</HD>
<DH>L.A. Chamber gives its performers -- and 18th century music
-- a chance to shine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is taking an eclectic, refreshingly
non-doctrinaire look at 18th century music this season. In April, the
orchestra will defy the edicts of fashion and musicological
correctness by reaching back to Mozart's lavish arrangement of
Handel's "Messiah." Yet at the Alex Theatre on Saturday night, music
director Jeffrey Kahane leaned in the other direction, incorporating
period practices into a bracing program of 18th century music.</LD>
<LD>   The forces were small, and the tempos were racing; at times, one
wondered if the holiday hustle and bustle from Brand Boulevard and
the Glendale Galleria nearby had infiltrated the music-making within
the hall. The versatile strings convincingly molded Corelli's
"Christmas" Concerto in the swelling manner of a period orchestra,
with little or no vibrato, while switching to more conventional
bowing in Domenico Cimarosa's by-the-book classical-period work, the
Concerto for Two Flutes. Kahane also occasionally performed continuo
parts on a small organ while directing traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Canadian soprano Karina Gauvin took on a formidable challenge in
trying to sing the outer movements of J.S. Bach's Cantata No. 51 at
Kahane's rollicking tempos; the fast runs passed in an indistinct
blur. Yet Gauvin was more comfortable in Handel's
motet-in-search-of-an-opera, "Silete venti," a strongly characterized
performance with gusts of raw passion. Gauvin doesn't dominate the
stage per se, but she draws you in with her varied command of
dynamics, weaving in and out of the orchestral texture, and in the
final section, she could come up with dozens of ways to shade the
single word, "alleluia." The program also allowed individual soloists
to shine. Trumpeter David Washburn crisply punched out each note in
the Bach, hardly batting an eye at the swift pace, and flutists David
Shostac's and Susan Greenberg's differing tone qualities complemented
each other in near-perfect unison in the Cimarosa.</TE>

<KH>JAZZ REVIEW</KH>
<HD>When singer Andrea Baker joins the band, she steps away
from the spotlight</HD>
<DH>In a performance at Spazio, the artist's collaboration
lessens her singing presence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some jazz artists are known as singers' singers, others as musicians'
musicians -- direct acknowledgments of the high quality of their
professional abilities. Andrea Baker, in an unusual variation on the
label, might best be described as a musician's singer.</LD>
<LD>   In her performance at Spazio in Sherman Oaks on Friday night, she
functioned, for the most part, as another member of her accompanying
ensemble, tailoring almost every vocal as an integral part of the
instrumental mix.</LD>
<LD>   The upside of that approach was an entertaining group of numbers
in which she worked hand in glove with her musicians -- pianist Ed
Czach, bassist Jeff D'Angelo and drummer Dick Weller -- scatting
rhythmically through up-tempo numbers such as "Centerpiece" and
delivering smooth-toned ballads such as "Prelude to a Kiss," with a
subtle understanding of their harmonic underpinnings.</LD>
<TE>   The downside of this sort of member-of-the-band posture for a
singer is that it tends to diminish the impact of the vocal
presentation. And Baker further lessened her own presence by
encouraging long, extended solos from the trio and, worse,
occasionally facing the musicians rather than her audience in some of
the livelier improvisational passages.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, a jazz educator who leads a large ensemble at Pasadena City
College, clearly possesses first-rate skills and a knowledge of
music. And it's not surprising that she would choose to exercise
those qualities in such intimate proximity with instrumentalists.</TE>
<TE>   But if she plans to move into a standout position as a vocalist --
a goal well within her reach -- she'll have to find a way to spend
more solo time in the spotlight.</TE>

<HD>A majority audience for 'minority' films</HD>
<DH>Fueled by teen audiences, 'Barbershop' and other 'urban'
movies have moved from their traditional markets to become crossover
hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Horn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the producers of "Drumline" asked 20th Century Fox for more
money to make their movie, they made an inspired appeal. Yes, it's a
movie about black college marching bands. Yes, there's but one
non-black actor (and in a minor role). And yes, the movie's musicians
range from Nappy Roots to Trick Daddy. But this is a movie for all
audiences!</LD>
<LD>   Fox bought the argument, forking over $20 million. "At first
glance, you looked at 'Drumline' and said, 'It looks like an African
American movie,' " says Bob Harper, Fox's vice chairman. "But then
you look at it more closely and say, 'Whoa, it really works for
everybody.' "</LD>
<LD>   Working for everybody is the new battle cry for movies
traditionally aimed at minority audiences. As recently as a few years
ago, the studios looked upon black and Latino stories as movies
targeted at filmgoers from only those ethnic groups. A studio might
manage a small profit, but the limited size of the target audience
would always curb the returns. But then the teen moviegoers who drive
ticket sales began rejecting black-and-white labels. That rapid shift
is sparking Hollywood's hottest phenomenon: movies that star
minorities but attract moviegoers of all ethnicities.</LD>
<TE>   "The young audience is much less racially confined than the older
generation," says Tom Rothman, Fox's co-chairman. "Kids today are
much less doctrinaire in the way they see the world."</TE>
<TE>   Two recent movies dramatize that shift. "Waiting to Exhale" and
"Barbershop" are two black comedies with similar box-office grosses.
The first film took in $66 million in 1995 and the second movie more
than $74 million this year. Yet the parallel numbers actually tell
completely divergent stories.</TE>
<TE>   The audience for "Exhale," an adaptation of the Terry McMillan
novel starring Whitney Houston, was 90% African American. Attendance
at "Barbershop," starring Ice Cube as a haircutting entrepreneur, was
far more diverse, with non-black audiences accounting for nearly 40%
of ticket buyers.</TE>
<TE>   In show business terms, it was a crossover hit.</TE>
<TE>   What changed? The rigid cultural segregation that existed a
generation ago has vanished. White teens who once listened to Soul
Asylum now follow Jay-Z; African American kids tune in Eminem; and
high-schoolers everywhere wear baggy hip-hop clothes and laugh at
Bernie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be if you showed African American images, you only got
African American audiences," says Revolution Studios partner Tom
Sherak. "But the younger audience is starting to see less color."</TE>
<TE>   The latest entry in the crossover campaign, following "Barbershop"
and last week's urban gangster drama "Empire," is "Drumline," a tale
of two college marching bands and one talented but rebellious
percussionist (Nick Cannon). Facing strong competition from Jennifer
Lopez's "Maid in Manhattan" and a new "Star Trek" sequel, "Drumline"
grossed $13 million in its debut weekend, finishing in third place.
Fox said 40% of its audience was non-African American.</TE>
<TE>   'Four-quadrant' hit</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's paradise on earth still remains the "four-quadrant"
smash, a film appealing to both young and old, male and female. But
reaching all segments of the audience is expensive and, consequently,
risky. It often costs more than $100 million to produce a blockbuster
such as "Spider-Man," and mass-appeal titles require an additional
$50-million marketing blizzard to entice every demographic
constituency.</TE>
<TE>   Crossover movies can be a more attractive investment. Because they
rely more on concepts than stars, they don't cost much. Universal and
partner Arenas Entertainment purchased distribution rights to
"Empire" for just $650,000, and it has so far grossed an estimated
$10.7 million. MGM spent $12 million making "Barbershop," and another
$12 million selling it. Fox Searchlight's "Brown Sugar" was made for
$8 million, and it grossed more than $27 million.</TE>
<TE>   Thrifty production budgets are only the start of the savings for
these films. Advertising buyers can cheaply target the core
demographic, rather than blow a fortune pitching a movie to all
audiences (including many with zero interest in seeing it) by buying
pricey spots on such mass-appeal TV shows as "The West Wing." Want to
reach just middle-age Latinas? Buy an ad on Univision's talk show "El
Gordo y La Flaca." Need young black males? Book a spot on KHHT-FM
(92.3 FM). Thanks to tailored marketing such as this, the typical ad
budget for an "urban" film is about $10 million, a fraction of the
resources committed for the average major studio release.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why so many people are attracted to making movies for
urban audiences," says Nancy Utley, Fox Searchlight's marketing
chief. She sold "Brown Sugar" with TV spots on "Soul Train," "The
Steve Harvey Show," "Cedric the Entertainer Presents," "Girlfriends"
and "The Parkers." "These movies are easily targeted, and the African
American audience is generally very reliable in coming out to see the
movies."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, are more and more teens of all races. To broaden the fan
base of "Barbershop," MGM committed a sixth of its marketing budget
to MTV. Slowly but surely, non-African Americans turned out. In its
first weekend, 85% of "Barbershop's" audience was black or Latino. By
the second weekend, it was 75%; by the third, 70%; and by the fourth,
60%. That crossover surge will make "Barbershop" one of 2002's most
profitable releases.</TE>
<TE>   Universal and partner Arenas had similar wide-appeal success with
"Empire," whose first-weekend audience was 51% Latino, 21% Caucasian
and 18% African American. The John Leguizamo movie actually crossed
over within the Latino population as well: Just as Caucasian
audiences are hardly homogenous, neither are Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Universal and Arenas drafted different "Empire" trailers for
Eastern and Western markets to address regional differences. TV ads
in New York and adjacent states, where the vast majority of Puerto
Ricans live on the U.S. mainland, featured a scene from the movie of
a traditional Puerto Rican meal of roast pork and fried plantains. In
California and other Western states, the TV ad's food was replaced by
other footage. To make the film's music appeal to a broader national
audience, Universal added the DMX song "Fame" to both "Empire's"
trailer and soundtrack, even though the song does not appear in the
film itself. Universal put the "Empire" trailer on "8 Mile," further
guaranteeing wide demographic exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy worked. Debuting in just 867 theaters, "Empire"
grossed $6.3 million in its premiere weekend, with the highest
per-screen average among the Top 20 films. The movie performed
strongly not only where it was expected (such as Los Angeles and New
York), but also in such cities as Boston and Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Not all attempts to broaden an audience are successful. In a
reverse instance of trying to cross over a movie to urban moviegoers,
Artisan tried to attract young blacks to its much-admired documentary
"Standing in the Shadows of Motown," booking the film into Magic
Johnson Theatres in Los Angeles. But the core audience remained
older, art-house moviegoers who grew up listening to the music.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike critic-proof action movies that can generate huge opening
numbers just by a familiar concept and extensive marketing -- think
"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" -- urban movies actually have to be good to
succeed. In fact, the crossover audience typically doesn't buy
tickets until favorable word of mouth trickles down, and it is likely
to be influenced strongly by reviews. "If a Mexican person tells you
this is the best place for tacos and salsa, then you will go there to
eat," says Santiago Pozo, Arenas' chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Some other crossover benefits can come from unexpected places.
When Jesse Jackson and others protested "Barbershop's" jokes about
civil-rights leaders, a movie just off the mainstream radar suddenly
turned up on TV news programs and the front pages of major
newspapers. "That controversy," says Alex Gartner, the MGM production
president who supervised making the film, "probably brought us an
extra $10 million."</TE>

<HD>A visual, thoughtful examination of Islam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crackpot preacher Jerry Falwell in October called Muhammad -- founder
and chief prophet of Islam -- a "terrorist."</LD>
<LD>   Falwell declared on "60 Minutes" that he'd read enough of
Muhammad's history to know that "he was a violent man, a man of war."
The planet's most quotable Christian added that "Jesus set the
example for love, as did Moses. And I think that Muhammad set an
opposite example."</LD>
<LD>   An inevitable public outcry forced a tepid apology from Falwell,
who said, gee whiz, he'd intended "no disrespect to any sincere,
law-abiding Muslim." And if you believed that ...</LD>
<TE>   Look, Falwell is Falwell, a Beavis-and-Butthead-rolled-into-one
whose smiley-face harangues against those he titles "pagans" deliver
notoriety and national media to his doorstep. Hadn't he earlier held
"abortionists," feminists, gays and his other favorite scapegoats
partially accountable for the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   Before his analysis of Muhammad is dismissed entirely, though,
it's appropriate to note, as many have, that most global terrorists
appear to be followers of Islam. Can this be a coincidence? If the
religion that Muhammad created 1,400 years ago is as peaceful as
Muslims and others say it is, why do so many see in it a call to
extremism and violence? Just as European fanatics of an earlier age
found in Christianity a motivation for the Crusades, the Inquisition
and other forms of aggression, persecution and brutality.</TE>
<TE>   That question resonates louder than ever.</TE>
<TE>   So right on cue is the two-hour "Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet," a
candid, thoughtful, flowing, visually stunning film by Michael Wolfe,
Alexander Kronemer and Michael Schwarz that is as timely as
documentaries get, even though much of it was shot prior to Sept. 11.
It premieres at 9 p.m. Wednesday on KCET-TV.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to charting Muhammad's life and influence, the film
visits mosques and spends time with Americans of Muslim faith, from
critical care nurse Najah Bazzy in Dearborn, Mich., to Kevin James, a
Brooklyn fire marshal who recalls what entered his mind when he
approached Manhattan's devastated Twin Towers with other firefighters
on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt ... please, don't be Muslims doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the other estimated 7 million Muslims in the U.S. (among
1.2 billion worldwide) probably felt similar anxiety. This film
should be of great interest to them. And also to viewers who haven't
read the Koran and are puzzled by the dichotomy in modern Islam whose
followers in the main are peaceful and law-abiding, but which has
also yielded criminal savagery in its name.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam is really a soft thing, it's not a hard thing," artist
Mohamed Zakariya says here. "There is absolutely nothing in Islam
that justifies the claim of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda or other
similar groups to kill innocent civilians," adds M. Cherif Bassiouni,
one of many scholars speaking in the film. Acts of terror, he says,
"are contrary to Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Not according to Islamic terrorists, obviously.</TE>
<TE>   Does it all come down to interpretation shaded by current events,
just as Falwell and other fundamentalist Christians differ with
mainline Christians about the meaning of scripture?</TE>
<TE>   The birth of Islamic scripture is described here with precision
and clarity. We learn of Muhammad's revelation in the mountains
outside Mecca when he was squeezed hard by an angel and felt the
words of a new scripture in Arabic pouring from his lips. "And Islam
had come into being," says scholar Karen Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Muhammad speaks of another revelation, this one
sanctioning self-defense by Muslims persecuted for their religious
beliefs. "Killing is abhorrent" in the Koran, Armstrong says. "It's
always wrong to start a war, to be an aggressor. But persecution is
worse than killing. When people have been driven from their homes or
deprived of their basic human rights, when an evil ideology comes
into the world, sometimes, regrettably, it may be necessary to fight
and sometimes lives will be lost."</TE>
<TE>   Aha! The problem, of course, is that one person's terrorism is
another's noble fight; one person's religion, another's "evil
ideology." And echoing an issue underlying U.S. response to Saddam
Hussein's potentially lethal bag of tricks, self-defense to one
people may be seen as aggression by the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Did Muhammad's words promote rampant slaughter? Bassiouni says no,
that Muhammad forbade killing of women and children and giving "no
quarter" in battle.</TE>
<TE>   Do roots of the anti-Semitism displayed by today's Islamic
terrorists surface in this telling of Muhammad's story? That's no
easy call for an ordinary viewer. However, we do hear of a pivotal
incident in which Muhammad -- whose role as head of state in Medina
made him more than a spiritual leader -- approved the execution of
Jews he believed betrayed him during a series of bloody battles with
Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   "Muhammad had nothing against the Jewish people per se," Armstrong
says. "The Koran continues to tell Muslims to honor the People of the
Book, and to honor their religion as authentic." Muhammad did not
want to exterminate Jews, she says, he wanted only to erase "very
dangerous internal enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Bassiouni believes that some Jews twist the meaning of this
incident, believing it to be proof that all "Muslims hate the Jews
and they kill them," just as some Muslims see it validating Jews as
treacherous. Both are mistaken, he says. As are Falwell and everyone
else whose views mirror facile stereotypes, a message this important
film delivers again and again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>'Thornberrys' movie plan: Pretend series never existed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Mallory</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a jungle out there for new family films in this crowded holiday
season, which means "The Wild Thornberrys Movie," based on the Klasky
Csupo TV series on Nickelodeon, should feel right at home.</LD>
<LD>   Set largely on the Serengeti Plain of Africa, Paramount and
Nickelodeon Movies' animated adventure centers on 12-year-old Eliza
Thornberry, who travels the globe with her naturalist family, and her
mission to rescue animals -- with whom she can converse, thanks to a
shaman's spell -- from poachers.</LD>
<LD>   Television properties that jump into theaters typically try to
grow to movie-size, though if "The Wild Thornberrys Movie" succeeds
in feeling like a bona fide theatrical film, it is because the
emphasis was less on expansion than starting over fresh (although
writer Kate Boutilier and directors Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian
are all veterans of the series). "We made the movie as if the TV
series never existed," says Nickelodeon president of film and TV
entertainment Albie Hecht. "We created an adventure-comedy story that
existed for the big screen."</LD>
<TE>   "Big" is the operative word. The lushly painted African vistas are
presented in CinemaScope (relatively uncommon for animation), and the
voice cast includes Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Marisa Tomei,
Brenda Blethyn and Alfre Woodard, with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel
contributing new songs. Experts on African culture were brought in to
review the script and translate some of the dialogue into the African
Lingala dialect.</TE>
<TE>   Hecht and co-producer Gabor Csupo stress that the PG-rated
adventure is targeted to all ages. "The 'Rugrats' movies that we did
before were aimed more at younger kids," says Csupo, "but this one I
believe is going to cross over to an older audience, especially
adults."</TE>
<TE>   The TV show is one parents can enjoy watching with their kids, and
if the movie follows that formula, it just might be the kind of
counter-spell that "The Wild Thornberrys Movie" needs to break out of
the herd.</TE>

<HD>Stones take back seat to McCartney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul McCartney is rewarding fans who bought his recently released
"Back in the U.S. Concert Tour" DVD with a Web cast today featuring
30 minutes of bonus concert and behind-the-scenes footage. It's
accessible through a link embedded in the DVD.</LD>
<LD>   He has good reason to be thankful. The Rolling Stones might have
conducted one of the year's most high-profile tours, but it's the
former Beatle who gets the satisfaction: His was the top-grossing
U.S. tour of 2002, leaving the Stones in the No. 2 slot, according to
Pollstar, the concert-industry tracking publication.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the first time since we've been ranking the concert business
that the Rolling Stones went on the road and did not have the No. 1
tour," says Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni.</LD>
<TE>   McCartney's tour, divided into legs titled "Driving Rain" and
"Back in the U.S.," grossed $103.3 million, solidly ahead of the
roughly $90 million for the Stones. He didn't, however, dislodge Mick
Jagger, Keith Richards and company from their spot at the top of the
list of all-time tour grosses. McCartney is now fourth on the overall
list. The Stones' 1994 tour took in $121.2 million, the highest ever.
U2's tour last year ranks behind the Stones with gross ticket sales
of $109.7 million, and Pink Floyd is No. 3 with $103.5 million on its
1994 tour.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 2002 tour figures are still being finalized, but
Bongiovanni said that Cher's farewell tour probably will wind up as
the year's third biggest. Others expected to finish in Pollstar's Top
10 -- the year's results will be in the issue sent out Jan. 2 -- are
the Billy Joel-Elton John teaming, the Dave Matthews Band, Bruce
Springsteen, Creed, the Eagles, Aerosmith and Crosby Stills Nash &amp;
Young.</TE>
<TE>   Those names add up to a big endorsement of veteran rockers who
appeal to baby boomers, and a sign that music fans preferred playing
it safe in a year with a shaky economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the industry are pretty unanimous about business not
being very good this year," Bongiovanni says. "We're probably looking
at gross revenues from last year hitting record levels for the third
year in a row. But the number of tickets sold has declined. The rise
in ticket prices is responsible for the increased revenue."</TE>
<TE>   One highly anticipated tour that won't make the Top 50: Guns N'
Roses' aborted "Chinese Democracy" tour. Bongiovanni said that before
canceling the remainder of their ill-fated tour last week, Axl Rose
and his bandmates did sell enough tickets to finish in the Top 100.</TE>

<HD>Old controversy gives birth to a new boxed set</HD>
<DH>Landmark, brutally racist 'Birth of a Nation' is among
titles on 'Griffith Masterworks.' Other releases include 'The Thief
of Bagdad.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation," unquestionably among the
most controversial -- and successful -- films of the 20th century,
leads the list of vintage oldies making their DVD debuts.</LD>
<LD>   Kino on Video's "Griffith Masterworks DVD Box Set" ($100) features
Griffith's landmark but brutally racist 1915 Civil War picture, "The
Birth of a Nation," his 1916 epic "Intolerance," the 1919 drama
"Broken Blossoms," the 1921 French Revolutionary war drama, "Orphans
of the Storm," and numerous one-reel shorts he made for Biograph from
1908 to 1913. Extras on the discs include footage taken at Griffith's
funeral, an amazing 25-minute radio eulogy for Griffith by Erich Von
Stroheim, a 1908 film, "Rescued From the Eagle's Nest," which
actually features Griffith as an actor, and vintage introductions to
several of the films by Orson Welles.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Wood, who produced the DVD set for Kino, says that the firm
wasn't worried about bringing "Birth of a Nation" out on DVD even
though the film depicts African Americans as monsters and rapists and
portrays the Klu Klux Klan as heroes of the Reconstruction era in the
South. The film caused race riots when it was first released.</LD>
<TE>   "We had it out on VHS and laser disc before," says Wood. "We
didn't want to gloss over the fact that it is very racially
offensive, but at the same time we didn't want our release to be just
talking about it. We wanted people to try to see it as a film but
also be mindful of the subtext in the film."</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc "Birth of a Nation" features a 24-minute documentary
on the making of the film and the controversy surrounding it, a
prologue to the film from 1930 featuring a conversation between
Griffith and Walter Huston in which Griffith, a Southerner, talks
about the need for the Klan in the 1860s, several Civil War shorts
directed by Griffith, excerpts from the film's souvenir book and
archival information documenting New York versus "The Birth of a
Nation," chronicling the legal battles over the film's 1922
re-release, including protests by the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Kino is Fritz Lang's full five-hour, two-part German
saga "Die Nibelungen" on VHS ($25) and DVD ($40). Directed by Lang in
1922 and 1924, "Die Nibelungen," which consists of the two features
"Siegfried" and "Kriemhild's Revenge," has been beautifully restored
by the Munich Film Archive and includes never-before-seen footage and
re-translated titles and the 1924 orchestral score from Gottfried
Huppertz. The end result is staggering, magnificent film experience.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the 12th century German and Norse epic poem, "Die
Nibelungen" was also adapted by Richard Wagner into the opera cycle
"The Ring of the Nibelungen."</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes footage of Lang on the film set, production
design and special effects sketches, and a photo gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Lang plays himself, an old German director named Fritz Lang, in
Jean-Luc Godard's riveting 1963 drama, "Contempt," which Criterion
has just brought out on a classy two-disc DVD ($40). This lusciously
filmed Cinemascope production stars Michel Piccoli as a French
screenwriter who has been hired by a crude, obnoxious American
producer (Jack Palance) to doctor a troubled script for a new film
version of "The Odyssey." Lang plays the director of the film within
the film, and Brigitte Bardot plays Piccoli's wife.</TE>
<TE>   The first disc features a new high-definition digital transfer
supervised by renowned cinematographer Raoul Coutard and inspired
commentary from film scholar Robert Stam. The second disc features
two short documentaries that were shot on the set of "Contempt":
"Contempt: Godard et Bardot" and "Paparazzi."</TE>
<TE>   Godard and Lang talk about filmmaking and the art of film
criticism in the 1967 documentary "The Dinosaur and the Lady." Lang
is also the subject of another documentary shot on the set of
"Contempt" by Peter Fleischman titled "Encounter With Fritz Lang."
Rounding out the disc is an excerpt from a 1963 interview with the
enigmatic Godard, a new interview with Coutard and a comparison
between the wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film.</TE>
<TE>   New from Image Entertainment is a recently discovered and restored
1929 French swashbuckler, "Captain Fracasse" ($25). Lavish and
exciting, "Captain Fracasse" stars Pierre Blanchar as a nobleman
traveling incognito with a troupe of actors who must battle an evil
duke (a very young Charles Boyer) over the woman they both love. The
DVD includes cast and crew biographies, a score featuring period
French piano music by Neal Kurtz and an annoying contemporary jazz
score by clarinetist Michel Portal.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Image on DVD is the 1938 drama "Blockade" ($20),
starring Henry Fonda, Madeleine Carroll and Reginald Denny. The film
whipped up a lot of controversy when it was released because it was
the only major studio feature of the time brave enough to focus on
the Spanish Civil War. In fact, there was pressure not to release it.
In hindsight, the film seems rather toothless. Though set during the
war, there is no discussion of the political motivations of either
side of the conflict -- just who is fighting whom and why. John
Howard Lawson, who later was blacklisted, did receive an Oscar
nomination for his screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Flicker Alley, a boutique DVD company that specializes in vintage
films, has just released its first presentation, the entertaining,
light 1928 silent "The Garden of Eden" ($23), a rediscovered and
restored romantic comedy starring Corrine Griffith and Lowell Sherman
that was directed by Lewis Milestone. Extras include photo galleries

<TE>   Alexander Korda's sumptuous 1940 Technicolor fantasy, "The Thief
of Bagdad," has just entered the Digital Age (MGM, $20) in a gorgeous
new transfer. Winner of three Oscars, "Thief of Bagdad" stars Conrad
Veidt, John Justin, Rex Ingram and Sabu. One of the film's three
directors was Michael Powell of "The Red Shoes" fame.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from MGM is the 1962 comedy "The Road to Hong Kong"
($20), which was the seventh and final "Road" picture starring Bob
Hope and Bing Crosby. In this rather limp vehicle, the boys play
vaudevillians who end up being sent to the moon by a group of spies.</TE>
<TE>   A year before he became as superstar as James Bond in "Dr. No,"
Sean Connery starred in the scrappy 1961 British thriller "The
Frightened City" (Anchor Bay). Connery plays a mob enforcer who
strong-arms and extorts money from pubs and merchants. Herbert Lom
and John Gregson also star in this rarity.</TE>
<TE>   "Fat City," one of John Huston's best films from his later period,
has emerged on DVD (Columbia TriStar, $20). Stacy Keach, Jeff Bridges
and Susan Tyrrell are all superb in this downbeat boxing drama
adapted by Leonard Gardner from his novel. Conrad Hall supplied the
gorgeously stark cinematography. A must-see for any discerning film
fan.</TE>

<HD>A reinvention of printmaking</HD>
<DH>Munakata Shiko's efforts to revive a Japanese form -- the
woodblock print -- are the focus of a LACMA retrospective. Works are
gutsy but haphazard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Japanese Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a
retrospective of Munakata Shiko (1903-1975) surveys an unusual career
characterized by a mighty struggle to invest new life into a
tradition that had faltered. Ambitious, gifted and far more
adventuresome than most of his countrymen, Munakata was not
altogether successful in his pursuit.</LD>
<LD>   In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the later stages of a
lengthy era of unprecedented social stability in Japan had given
birth to an extraordinary cultural efflorescence. Economic power was
passing from the samurai elite to a new urban merchant class, and it
wanted art that spoke to its own experience. Japanese painters began
to make woodblock prints that responded to the shift -- images that,
unlike a one-of-a-kind painting, could be made in large editions in
reaction to the rapidly expanding new audience. Their subject,
exquisitely rendered in a range of eye-boggling techniques, was the
fleeting quality of life and its earthly pleasures. Ukiyo-e, or
"pictures of a floating world," came to define the glory of Japanese
printmaking.</LD>
<LD>   Like most such phenomena, the glorious definition eventually
passed into the realm of stale cliche. Japanese printmaking went into
steep, long-standing decline. Then, along came Munakata.</LD>
<TE>   "The Mountain; the Sea; Dedicated to My Virtuous Parents" shows
what he was capable of. Made in 1958, it's a monumental work that
unfolds on a pair of eight-panel standing screens. Each of the two
prints, assembled from multiple sheets of paper, is 5 1/2 feet tall
and more than 14 feet wide. The screens are a tour de force.</TE>
<TE>   Printed only in black ink, which is applied to both sides of the
thin paper and ranges from luminous gray to pitch black, the
landscapes are picked out in a flashing torrent of delicate white
lines. Sharp mountains and roiling seas are interlocked through
diagonal cuts. Between the jagged peaks of earth and water, the
shapes of diamonds, triangles and lozenges suggest niches, caves and
womb-like voids. Indistinct but evocative figures of Buddha flicker
within them, animating the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In Munakata's dynamic screens, nature comes to life as a
mysterious sacred space. The concept is a traditional one in Japanese
art, and the artist calls on the vaunted medium of woodblock and the
revered format of a folding screen to invoke a sense of honored
custom. But, by forcing two distinct traditions together into
something wholly new, Munakata also shows that he has other, more
experimental things on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Formally, the graphic technique of "The Mountains; the Sea"
resembles nothing so much as Willem de Kooning's great abstract black
paintings from the late 1940s. The resemblance is not an accident.
Munakata was an Expressionist at heart, and his interest in Modern
art in the West was keen.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to become the next Van Gogh," said this son of a poor,
rural blacksmith when, as a 19-year-old kid, he ventured to Tokyo to
pursue a career in painting. The elegant and informative bilingual
catalog to the show, which was jointly organized by LACMA, the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and the private Munakata Museum in Aomori
City, Japan, explains that he worked in a variety of mediums,
including painting, ceramics and calligraphy. (The curators --
LACMA's Robert T. Singer and Munakata Yoshiaki, the artist's son --
have put a few examples of each on view, including small floral
paintings in thick, blazingly colored impasto and some exceptional
decorated plates.) But woodblock printing proved to be a special
attraction -- partly because Munakata was extremely nearsighted and
the medium suits close work. A video shows him hunched over, cutting
into a block with great speed and furious deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Gogh remark demonstrates the wonderful spirit and frank
enormity of Munakata's ambition. Yet, it's also indicative of his
provincial beginnings. By 1924, the Dutch painter had been dead for
more than 30 years. Art had moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Early works in the LACMA exhibition show Munakata developing a
sharp, blunt line and covering the entire sheet with tangled imagery.
Horror vacuii -- a fear of empty space -- is endemic to his work
throughout his career.</TE>
<TE>   The thick black tracery outlines figures, landscapes and elements
of still life. Color, sometimes printed and sometimes painted,
emphasizes primary and secondary hues. The absorbent paper often
washes out the color, softening the jangle of black. Take 1963's "A
Self-Portrait with Joy": It's a bit like an aggressive, Expressionist
version of a painting by Fernand Leger or Raoul Dufy, or the later
paintings of Marc Chagall.</TE>
<TE>   It is also an acquired taste -- which I haven't yet acquired.
Munakata's work is more appealing for the gutsiness of the project
than for the haphazard result. He was attempting to remake
traditional Japanese woodblock prints in a modern context--ukiyo-e
for an apocalyptic world of fresh anxieties. A modest, elegant medium
was being pushed toward something big, brash and wild. American
Abstract Expressionists had banished easel painting in favor of the
wall-size scale of murals, and Munakata followed suit by pumping up
the humble woodblock print to the scale of a folding screen. His work
emphasized an almost manic quality of public performance, and he
experimented at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   But the work -- which will be rotated in the exhibition because of
fragility -- rarely seems to gel. Its frequent ugliness (which can
elsewhere be a virtue) just grates. Oddly, Munakata's prints seem
unconcerned with the obvious modern antecedent of German
Expressionist woodcuts, in favor of melding Japanese traditions with
French tastes and New York sensibilities. It's an uneasy fit.</TE>

<HD>Another TV boss is ready for a close-up</HD>
<DH>By playing himself on the CBS' 'Yes, Dear,' Fox's Sandy
Grushow joins a long list of executives who have acted in prime time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox Television Group Chairman Sandy Grushow took time from his busy
schedule last week -- which includes wrestling with how to improve
the network's lineup -- to continue a well-established Hollywood
tradition.</LD>
<LD>   He played himself in a prime-time sitcom.</LD>
<LD>   Grushow will be seen next year -- possibly during the February
sweeps -- in an episode of "Yes, Dear," the CBS comedy sandwiched
between "King of Queens" and "Everybody Loves Raymond." Although the
program is on a competing network, it's partly produced by 20th
Century Fox Television, which Grushow oversees.</LD>
<TE>   Like most executives ready for their close-ups, Grushow didn't
have to audition for the part. Executive producers Alan Kirschenbaum
and Greg Garcia wrote him into a script, given that one of the show's
characters works at a studio.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little bit self-deprecating, which I liked," said
Grushow.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding his performance, he said he was told he was "a natural"
by people who "undoubtedly" were kissing up.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Garcia said pandering wasn't the issue. Producers, he
noted, frequently do such things largely to entertain themselves,
from using writers in walk-on roles to naming characters after
friends, relatives or former prom dates.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're doing a show, there's a lot of things that you do
just for fun for you," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   The late Brandon Tartikoff was perhaps most responsible for
popularizing the practice of executive cameos. During his tenure at
NBC, he hosted "Saturday Night Live" and appeared on "Alf" and "Night
Court."</TE>
<TE>   Tartikoff's successor, Warren Littlefield, showed up on "The Larry
Sanders Show" and "Blossom." Warner Bros. Television President Peter
Roth danced with Lisa Nicole Carson on "Ally McBeal." NBC Studios
President Ted Harbert recently played himself on HBO's Larry David
series "Curb Your Enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Former CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky turned up a few
times, and current CBS Television President Leslie Moonves -- who
began his career as an actor -- has been seen on multiple shows, the
latest being HBO's "Arli$$."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why they chose Grushow instead of Moonves, Kirschenbaum
quipped, "We didn't think it was big enough for Les."</TE>
<TE>   After shooting the scene, Kirschenbaum introduced Grushow, and had
the studio audience give him a standing ovation. Referring to the
challenge of getting an audience to laugh, the producer said, "It
makes powerful people humble."</TE>
<TE>   One of the more amusing cameos may have belonged to former CBS
executive Rod Perth, who took part in the network's pursuit of David
Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   In the HBO movie "The Late Shift," documenting the succession
battle over Johnny Carson's throne, Perth is mistaken for actor Ed
Begley Jr., who co-starred as Rod Perth.</TE>

<CX>   Sandy Grushow caption -- A caption in Monday's Calendar accompanying
a photo of Fox Television Group Chairman Sandy Grushow incorrectly
attributed a quote to Grushow. The article was about Grushow's
upcoming appearance on the CBS comedy "Yes, Dear." The quote, "It
makes powerful people feel humble," was from the show's executive
producer Alan Kirschenbaum, referring to the challenge of getting an
audience to laugh.</CX>

<LD>The city of Orange is a sweet little town southeast of L.A. where
just about everyone in Southern California goes to buy old things.
I'm talking about stuff you threw away years ago that's now being
sold as a valued relic of the past for 50 times its original cost.
Toy cars, comic books, dolls, tops, tin drums, lunch boxes, and even
that old hat your mama wore when she went to the five-and-dime.</LD>
<LD>   I know this because Cinelli and I are antique junkies and have
spent time in Orange, which, with its 275 dealers, has more old
things than an Egyptian museum. That may be the only reason to visit
Orange, except for a restaurant called P.J.'s Abbey, which is in an
old church. I don't know why it isn't used as a church anymore.
Someone figured there was more profit in selling meatloaf and
martinis than in hustling God.</LD>
<LD>   Cinelli's eyes glaze over when she's in the presence of antique
stores, and they surrounded her in Orange. I don't usually go to
towns named after fruit, but we were in the vicinity and there's no
way I was going to keep her from antique heaven.</LD>
<TE>   The stores are in an area called Plaza Square, which dates to the
late 1880s and gives the town center a sort of other-times
appearance. One store blends into the other, from the Antique Mall to
Country Roads, and we went to every one. By the time we were finished
I felt like I had just emerged from a near-death experience.</TE>
<TE>   Too much shopping disorients a man. We can take the rigors of war
OK, but our brains liquefy and our legs buckle in a shopping attack.
Women rev up as we fade out, swimming up and down the aisles with the
relative ease of tetras in a fish tank.</TE>
<TE>   I cautioned Cinelli as we began 'tiquing, as they say, that we
were only going to stay three hours and weren't going to spend more
than $25 each. She looked at me as though I had just denied
fatherhood of our children and said, "In your dreams." And off she
went, seeking treasures amid the flotsam and jetsam of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The antique malls are particularly intriguing, because they
feature hundreds of individual booths loaded with, well, old things.
Some are even broken old things or chipped old things that have
absolutely no use or value whatsoever. I bought three. Cinelli, on
the other hand, is more discerning in her purchases. "You don't see
many of these anymore," she said, holding up a dish with a metal stem
in the middle and a lid that covered half of the opening.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably because no one ever understood what they were
for, so they stopped making them," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a candy dish with a handle, dodo. Or a nut dish. Or
something. The trouble with you is you don't appreciate
possibilities. Antiques should be valued, not discarded. I'll never
forgive you for dumping your mother's lamp."</TE>
<TE>   Not that again. The Mother's Lamp Episode has haunted our
marriage. It is right up there with The Time You Slammed the Door on
the Cat's Head Episode. Whenever we visit an antique store she
mentions the wrought-iron lamp that once belonged to my mother, which
I gave to the Goodwill. Not my mother, the lamp.</TE>
<TE>   I said, "It was old, it was broken and it was junk."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised you haven't hauled me off to Goodwill."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not old, you're not broken and you're not junk. You're
just Italian."</TE>
<TE>   "You accuse me of buying junk, but what's that thing in your
shopping bag?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a snow globe. You know, you shake them and snow falls on
Santa or a little log cabin or whatever. I've started collecting
them."</TE>
<TE>   "I know what a snow globe is, but there's a hole in the glass
ball, Elmer, and it has no snow to fall on Santa, the Tooth Fairy or
the Queen of England or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   "That's just it," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just what?"</TE>
<TE>   "That's what gives it value. It's a snowless snow globe. You don't
see many of them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   By the time we had finished, the trunk of our car was loaded with
the treasures she found and the, you know, things I managed to
gather. If my new possessions seem more junk than loot, I can only
point out that one must look ahead to their future worth. I will pass
my knickknacks on to our children and they to their children and
their children to their children, and so on, ad infinitum.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in the year 3002, one of our heirs will study the
snowless snow globe and say, "You don't see a lot of these anymore,"
and sell it for $7,835.81.</TE>
<TE>   And somewhere amid the cosmic dust of things past, I'll smile.</TE>

<DH>Kaisik Wong may have been an obscure designer, but his
collage style has stayed in the forefront of fashion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you have heard of Kaisik Wong at all, it's probably because of the
infamous vest. After the spring 2002 collections, Balenciaga's
much-ballyhooed designer Nicolas Ghesquiere was forced to admit he
copied a 1973 patchwork vest from Wong, a relatively obscure clothing
artist who worked in the Bay Area in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. As
questions of plagiarism abounded, the buzz about the rediscovered
talent traveled the fashion channels from Paris to New York to L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Barneys New York began selling vintage clothing from Wong and
others involved in the late 1960s San Francisco wearable-art
movement. And "Native Funk &amp; Flash," the 1974 book of hand-crafted
fashion in which one of Ghesquiere's design assistant's saw Wong's
vest, became a must-read for the style obsessed.</LD>
<LD>   Wong, who died in 1990, was in the spotlight again in May with the
release of a documentary about the 1960s-era drag troupe the
Cockettes, with whom he collaborated. And now Cameron Silver, whose
Melrose Avenue vintage boutique Decades is an idea lab for major
designers who come from New York and Europe to plunder the work of
others for inspiration, is celebrating the work of Wong. Silver has
assembled "Live the Fantasy," a retrospective exhibit and sale of
pieces from the Wong family collection.</LD>
<TE>   Wong's clothing, like much of what designers have been showing on
the runways recently, is escapism for a tumultuous time, said Silver,
who has sold about a dozen pieces to customers who include Jennifer
Tilly and Linda Evangelista. "The best-selling clothes are the most
fantastic, over-the-top and one-of-a-kind pieces," he said. The
pieces range from about $300 for a belt to $3,000 for a gown.</TE>
<TE>   The 100 or so items on view through the end of the month are
something to behold, each one a masterful fabric collage. Years
before John Galliano did it, Wong was embracing the tribal look. He
used the costumes of ancient civilizations -- kimonos, tunics,
tapestries, and the embroideries and appliques of South America and
Asia -- to realize fashion fusion early on.</TE>
<TE>   Wong handmade most of his pieces, cutting them free form "with
scissors in both hands," according to Juan Fernandez, an actor and
model who was a friend of the designer's. The collection at Decades
includes a coat crafted from patches of colorful Guatemalan fabric; a
halter dress covered in jagged scraps of forest green and brown
fabric that give the illusion of fluttering leaves; and a quilted
vest that has two Japanese carp wind socks across the back.</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces combine futurism with mythic themes the way the
costumes do in the "Star Wars" films. Gold piping adds flash to
multilayered, Greek goddess-like chiffon tunics; a dramatic dress
with a metallic starburst front has a traditional Chinese knot at the
waist; and a fabric headdress decorated with metallic thunderbolts
evokes at once the Space Age and ancient Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "He really bridged the gap between the hippie movement and the
glam-rock movement," said Jonalain Guzik, author of "Radiate -- The
Life and Work of Kaisik Wong." The first book devoted to the designer
is scheduled for a fall 2003 release by Rizzoli.</TE>
<TE>   The only item on view that is not for sale is that patchwork vest.
After the Decades show closes, it will travel north to the Oakland
Museum of California to be included in the exhibition "Iconic to
Ironic: Fashioning California Identity," which opens March 15.</TE>
<TE>   Wong was at work at a time when handmade clothing became popular
as a reaction against materialism. But Inez Brooks-Myers, who is
curating the Oakland show, believes Wong transcends the wearable-art
movement. "His work is unique," she said. "He had an eye not only for
creating garments for the body but also for presenting them in a
static manner. Some of the photographs he took are like mental
collages of the real and the fantasy, put together to create theater
in your mind."</TE>
<TE>   The designer photographed his models with elaborate sets at
botanical gardens, Stinson Beach and other San Francisco-area sites,
creating pictures that were almost surrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Wong was born in San Francisco in 1950 and grew up in Chinatown.
His father was an accountant and his mother a homemaker from New
Orleans whom Wong's brother, Kailey, described in an interview last
week as a "glamourpuss." From the age of 14, Kaisik was silk
screening fabrics and making his own clothes, including shoes, hats
and belts, according to Kailey, 57, a bus driver in the Bay Area
suburb of Pleasant Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Kaisik dropped out of high school at 15 at the urging of his art
teacher, and studied for three years at San Francisco's Pacific
Fashion Institute. He frequented the Fillmore, the Avalon and other
meccas of the hippie movement, where he often was invited to
after-parties because of his clothes, his brother said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, at 17, Wong moved to New York where he worked with
designers such as Adele Simpson. He traveled to Paris and met
Salvador Dali, as well as Yves Saint Laurent, Thierry Mugler and
Pierre Cardin. Cardin asked Wong to work for him. "Kaisik was wise
enough to turn it down, because he realized he wouldn't be recognized
for his work," said Kailey.</TE>
<TE>   (Kailey Wong is a part of cultural history in his own right.
According to the New York Times, he inspired the title of a famous
Tom Wolfe book after meeting the author in San Francisco when Wolfe
was working on a story about Chinese American activists. Kailey was
taking fitness tests to become a cop, and told Wolfe, "I guess they
want to make sure you're made of the right stuff.")</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Kaisik Wong returned to San Francisco to
launch his own fashion label, Muuntux. He designed for stars such as
Tina Turner and Robin Williams, and collaborated with filmmaker
Steven Arnold of the Cockettes, creating costumes and performance
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Always theatrical, Wong often appeared in public dressed as the
Monkey King, a mythological Chinese trickster.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Wong closed Muuntux. For the rest of his life, he
produced one-of-a-kind pieces for the San Francisco art-to-wear
boutique Obiko, I. Magnin and Henri Bendel.</TE>
<TE>   After Kaisik's death from leukemia in 1990, his mother, Alma,
refused to sell any of his clothing, and kept his workroom intact.
"His scissors, sewing machine and pins were just the way they were,
as if he was going to the store and coming right back," Kailey said.</TE>
<TE>   When Alma died in 2000, the family decided it was time to let go.
"His clothes have so much chi energy that they don't need to be in a
closet or in a bag, they need to be shared," Kailey said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, when a friend e-mailed him a picture of
Ghesquiere's vest, Kailey was not surprised. He had already seen
references to his brother's work in "Return of the Jedi."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess nothing is original," he said. "Except maybe Kaisik."</TE>

<HD>'Maid' and 'Trek' top enterprises</HD>
<DH>J. Lo's comedy barely tops the space series as 'Drumline'
makes an impressive debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to jump-start Christmas moviegoing, the studios launched four
wide-release movies this weekend, and Jennifer Lopez squeezed ahead
of the pack with an estimated $19 million for "Maid in Manhattan."
The romantic comedy pairing Lopez and Ralph Fiennes beamed in front
of "Star Trek: Nemesis" by only $250,000, if studio estimates
released Sunday hold up when full weekend results come in today.</LD>
<LD>   But Fox's modest $20-million-budget "Drumline" arguably made the
flashiest entrance, at No. 3 with $13 million. The film captured a
largely African American audience but also demonstrated huge
crossover appeal -- 40% of its audience was non-black With an average
of $7,119 in 1,833 locations, "Drumline" posted the highest
per-theater average of any widely released film this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "The movie had universal themes, it was well marketed and it got
good reviews, which really matter around this time of year," said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor
Relations Co. "It came in at No. 3, but it was in fewer theaters and
they were filling more seats in each of those theaters than the top
two films."</LD>
<TE>   Lopez's latest picture no doubt got a boost from the tidal wave of
publicity surrounding the release of her latest album and her
recently announced engagement to actor Ben Affleck.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Wayne Wang and co-starring well-regarded British
actors Natasha Richardson and Bob Hoskins, the Cinderella tale pulled
in a large adult audience as well as many women under 25. The
$55-million-budgeted movie skewed more to women, with 60% of the
audience female. Although "Maid" opened with numbers comparable to
past romantic comedies released during the crowded holiday season --
such as "Family Man" in 2000 with $10.5 million and "Jerry Maguire"
in 1996 with $17 million -- it still didn't come close to "What Women
Want," which opened to $33 million in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Stiff competition kept "Star Trek: Nemesis" in a lower orbit, with
its $18.8-million opening coming in below the past two "Star Trek"
movies. "Star Trek: Insurrection" opened to $22 million in 1998 and
"Star Trek: First Contact" came in with $30 million in 1996. Disney's
latest Rob Schneider picture, "The Hot Chick," opened to a not-so-hot
$7.5 million. Schneider's last Disney picture, "Deuce Bigalow: Male
Gigolo," opened with $12.2 million in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Other smaller films fared much better. Jack Nicholson's dark
comedy-drama, "About Schmidt," grossed a hefty $47,167 per theater on
six screens for a total of $283,000. The film, directed by Alexander
Payne ("Election"), won several Los Angeles Film Critics awards over
the weekend including best picture and best screenplay. Nicholson
tied with Daniel Day-Lewis ("Gangs of New York") for the group's best
actor.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's top 12 films grossed nearly 3% more than the
comparable weekend last year, bringing in $90.5 million versus $87.9
million last year, according to Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, "Talk to Her," whose director, Pedro Almodovar, was
named best director by L.A. film critics over the weekend, opened
strongly here this weekend, grossing an estimated $25,000 in one
Westside theater, and $27,500 in three New York locations. The Sony
Pictures Classics release, which opened in New York last month, has
made $500,000 to date. Also debuting in limited release was the Irish
drama "Evelyn," with "Die Another Day" star Pierce Brosnan. "Evelyn"
took in $72,000 at 15 theaters for a $4,800 average.</TE>

<HD>Jazz triumphs at a Cuban festival that's harder to get to</HD>
<DH>With the U.S. cracking down on travel to the island nation,
musicians struggle to get to the event in Havana. But, oh, is it ever
worth it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Reich</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>HAVANA -- Compared with earlier editions, this year's Havana
International Jazz Festival has proved to be a splitting headache for
the American musicians who paid their own way to attend.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides have toughened the bureaucracy of getting to Havana,
with the Bush administration promising to enforce rules that
previously were overlooked. And the response from American officials
in Cuba has gone from one of celebration -- in past years officials
planned concerts and sponsored lavish dinners -- to one of reproach.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite all this, the music has broken through. The American
musicians have been rewarded with adulation from Havana's
jazz-obsessed public. And as last week's performances showed,
virtually every time an American player shared the stage with a Cuban
musician, both were transformed.</LD>
<TE>   In jazz, Cuban musicians command special respect, and not only
because of the Herculean technique and conservatory-bred musicianship
for which they are famous. Equally important, the roots of jazz run
at least as deep in Cuba as in the United States, because the slave
trade that came to the Americas also came to this island, bringing
with it the musical culture of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Because Afro-Cuban jazz evolved somewhat differently than its
North American counterpart, emphasizing rhythmic complexity above all
else, the music there long has held the lure of something exotic to
American jazz artists and jazz lovers.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the musicians and the hundreds of fans who have
followed them to the festival say they are determined to overcome the
more formidable travel obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "I come here to play because I have learned that jazz is not the
music of America alone," said Danilo Perez, a prodigiously gifted
Panamanian artist based in the Boston area.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz always has been a music of different cultures coming
together, and one of those cultures is Cuba," he said. "If you don't
come to terms with the music on this island, you have not come to
terms with the full meaning of jazz."</TE>
<TE>   For this reason and others, many of the foremost musicians in
American jazz -- from trumpeter Roy Hargrove to saxophonist David
Sanchez -- have flocked to this festival, performing multiple shows
most nights.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been wanting to come here for I can't remember how long --
ever since [trumpeter] Dizzy Gillespie told me how great it was,"
said American guitarist Larry Coryell, who helped open the event
Wednesday evening before a capacity audience at the Teatro Amadeo
Roldan.</TE>
<TE>   "When I played my first two tunes with the Cuban musicians, my jaw
just about dropped. I could not believe how great they are," added
Coryell, echoing an observation made by musicians from around the
world after standing toe-to-toe with their Cuban counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   What has made this year's festival intriguing is the particular
alchemy that American and Cuban musicians have achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Coryell, for instance, under normal circumstances can be an
unapologetically cerebral player given to the softest musical
gestures.</TE>
<TE>   But when he played alongside the mighty Cuban pianist Chucho
Valdes, who is artistic director of the festival, Coryell produced
fiery lines and volcanic gestures of a sort that listeners would not
have expected from him.</TE>
<TE>   When the American blues musician Taj Mahal joined Valdes' band,
his rhythmic energy proved unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   "We come here as often as we can," said Larry Clothier, the
manager for Hargrove and one of the driving forces behind Hargrove's
Grammy Award-winning album "Crisol," which was recorded partly in
Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Roy realized early on that there was so much to be
learned from Cuban musicians that he wanted to play here as often as
he could," Clothier said.</TE>
<TE>   The experience transformed not only Hargrove's art but his career:
The Grammy he received for "Crisol," as well as the searing power of
the music on the CD, catapulted the trumpeter to a new level of
international acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many of the American musicians and their managers said they
have never had such a difficult time getting into Cuba. They
complained of trouble obtaining licenses and other paperwork required
by Washington, getting visas from Havana, and problems at airports in
the U.S. and Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I was here, in 1998, it was totally different,"
said noted New York trombonist-bandleader Steve Turre, who is among a
long list of visiting Americans here, including such Hollywood
celebrities as Danny Glover and Harry Belafonte.</TE>
<TE>   "Last time, you had Cuban and American musicians getting together
at parties hosted by the American government," Turre said. "You don't
see that this time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the American Interests Section, which replaced the U.S.
Embassy after the 1960s freeze in American-Cuban relations, this year
did not organize a reception for American and Cuban musicians. In
past years, jazz festival participants partied into the wee hours in
the impeccably landscaped gardens behind the mansion where American
diplomats work.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time the international edition of the festival
has been staged since President Bush took office, so a new staff and
a new chief of the mission, James Cason, represent the U.S. in
Havana.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the American government's attitude toward this
week's influx of U.S. performers and fans, an official with the
American Interests Section said that Americans who do not have the
proper licenses would be subject to penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations issued by Washington in 1963 as part of the Trading
With the Enemy Act allow for sanctions, including $250,000 in fines
for individuals and $1 million for corporations deemed in violation,
though such fines rarely have been imposed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole new attitude from the American government toward
Americans trying to perform here in Cuba," said Clothier, who has
been bringing American artists to Cuba since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the musicians who persevered said they were glad they did.
They relished the response from the musically passionate Cuban
audience members, who line up for the concerts hours before starting
time and wait patiently until auditorium doors are opened. Virtually
every performance has been packed, with new listeners rushing in to
fill the seats of the occasional concertgoer who can't stay for the
marathon three- to four-hour shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wouldn't want to play for an audience like this?" Turre
asked.</TE>
<TE>   During the five-day run of the festival, the American jazz
musicians become minor celebrities in Havana. They appear on local
television with a frequency and prominence rarely accorded them back
home, and they are recognized in the lobbies of the hotels by
autograph seekers.</TE>
<TE>   And there are benefits for the Cuban musicians as well. Because
the long-running U.S. embargo has made it difficult for all but the
most illustrious players to tour the United States, the jazz festival
enables the local talent pool, which is deep, to be heard by American
musicians, managers and entrepreneurs, who can spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   The chance to create a buzz in the U.S. can be beneficial to a
Cuban player, as it was for pianist Frank Emilio, who years ago won
the attention of Blue Note Records, an American label with foreign
operations. In 1999, one of Blue Note's foreign imprints released
Emilio's stunning CD "Ancestral Reflections."</TE>
<TE>   The recording instantly turned a septuagenarian musician known
primarily in Cuba into an internationally revered player with a
fervent following in the States. "I'm always knocked out by the level
of musicianship in this town," said Jean Bach, director of the
celebrated jazz documentary "A Great Day in Harlem." "This time it's
the same as when I was here in 1948 and '78. The music is colossal."</TE>

<HD>A concerto in the tradition of Copland</HD>
<DH>Pasadena Symphony presents West Coast premiere of composer
Peter Schickele's sweeping piece, which opens with a fanfare and
takes off from there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his Concerto for Chamber Orchestra, Peter Schickele carves out a
musical geography of America, much like Aaron Copland did. Copland
portrayed a mythic wilderness of pioneers, outlaws and limitless
space. Schickele picks the Southwest and a later time. But he also
captures the energy and optimism that add to Walt Whitman's American
yelp.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Mester and the Pasadena Symphony gave the West Coast
premiere of the work as part of a three-part program Saturday at
Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Schickele was on hand to accept the
enthusiastic applause the concerto received. He'd given the
preconcert lecture, where he was peppered with questions about his
musical alter ego, the fictitious, hilarious P.D.Q. Bach. Hardly
anyone asked about his serious music.</LD>
<LD>   Pity because the Concerto has immediate appeal and staying power.
Schickele wrote it in 1998 for Ramson Wilson and the OK Mozart
Festival in Bartlesville, Okla., where it was premiered that year.
The work runs about 30 minutes and falls into a traditional
four-movement pattern, with the first and second movement linked.</LD>
<TE>   It opens with a fanfare and goes like blazes from there. The
writing is agile and beautifully proportioned with lots of solos for
individuals as well as whole sections. The piece carries on the
Copland tradition, but adds the birth of rock 'n' roll, a little more
jazz, other national ethnic influences. It is familiar but new. It
never sounds forced, faked or condescending. It's a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Shelley was the powerful soloist in Rachmaninoff's
"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini," gobbling up octaves as if they
were easy finger exercises but also keeping us involved in all the
sections, rather than just waiting for the big tune. Mester led
skillfully and sympathetically.</TE>
<TE>   He closed the program with a magisterial account of Mozart's
"Jupiter" Symphony, revealing its proper stature partly by his pacing
and partly by taking all the repeats.</TE>

<CX>   Pasadena Symphony--A review of a weekend Pasadena Symphony concert in
Monday's Calendar stated that Peter Schickele's Concerto for Chamber
Orchestra was getting its West Coast premiere. In fact, Schickele's
Concerto was performed three years ago by the Idyllwild Arts Academy
Orchestra in Idyllwild, led by Ransom Wilson, who commissioned the
work for the OK Mozart Festival in Oklahoma.</CX>

<HD>Andy Richter reigns in his own universe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frazier Moore</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Who is Andy Richter? This seems like a simple question, especially
for longtime fans of "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," where Richter
made his name as an easygoing yet waggish sidekick.</LD>
<LD>   But now he's the leading man in his own prime-time comedy, "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe," which introduces new facets of Andy's
personality. Like Conan's Andy, this Andy isn't out to rule the world
(he seems fine with his job as a technical writer in a big office
tower). But he does fantasize about controlling the universe -- at
least, his little corner of it.</LD>
<LD>   Accordingly, the show hasn't pegged its hero as a clownish
wannabe. Sometimes he wins. Sometimes his dreams come true. From time
to time, he even succeeds with a woman! "I didn't want this to turn
into a 'Cathy' comic," says Richter. " 'Poor me, I can't get a date'
isn't funny."</LD>
<TE>   Granted, when a script calls for romance, "it makes me very
uncomfortable," admits Richter, who in real life is married and the
father of a 2-year-old boy. "You have to make out and stuff with a
stranger. But if my character never got lucky with the girls, viewers
would start to wonder. In real life, most people get lucky, now and
then."</TE>
<TE>   So the new, well-rounded Andy is in the service of a goofy brand
of authenticity, a twisted realism that helps make "Andy Richter
Controls the Universe" a refreshing TV comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Chatting with a reporter on a recent visit to Manhattan, Richter,
35, allows that he's proud of his show, especially in comparison to a
lot of other TV comedies. "Of course, that's like saying, 'Wow! My
gorilla can beat up your canary.' It's not that big a deal."</TE>
<TE>   It's a big deal. He packs more laughs in an episode's two-minute
teaser than you find in a night of Must-See TV. Richter has come up
with an Andy-dote to sitcom fatigue. That's very big. (After a brief
run last spring, it recently returned to the Fox schedule Sunday
night; during December, it airs Tuesday night.)</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Richter Controls the Universe" is shrewdly plotted, then
overlaid with Andy's play-by-play, such as, "Here I was, facing a
problem as old as civilization itself: How to catch a drunk cat in
the ceiling so I can go to France." It's replete with wisdom. How can
the races get along? One character tells Andy, "You ignore as well as
celebrate what makes each person exactly the same and completely
different from everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   The show comes equipped with an escape valve to release pent-up
silliness: the fantasy blackouts where Andy's control-the-universe
musings manifest themselves. And it's filmed without a studio
audience.</TE>
<TE>   For his show, Richter has rounded up a sparkling ensemble of
co-stars: Paget Brewster as Jessica, Andy's off-the-wall supervisor
and off-the-job pal; Jonathan Slavin as his childlike office mate;
Irene Molloy as the winsome receptionist on whom he has an unrequited
crush; and James Patrick Stuart as her boyfriend, whom Andy likes,
even though his biggest problems are a charmed existence and
excessive handsomeness.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their quirks, these characters are good-hearted people who
share a real affection. That lets the humor rise above most sitcoms'
volley of insults.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Jessica hears that Andy wants a second TV in his
bedroom, so that, when he rolls onto his side, he won't miss
anything. But she doesn't jeer at this. Instead, she validates his
dream. "It's crazy," she sighs. "But I'll bet in 10 years we're all
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Even when Andy gets excited that his age has reached the
billion-second mark, his pals indulge him. How come this fivesome
doesn't go at it like the cutthroat family on "Everybody Loves
Raymond," or even like the gang on "Friends," who express their
togetherness primarily by swapping wisecracks?</TE>
<TE>   "Conflict isn't funny," Richter replies. "Conflict is drama."
Elaborating, he draws on his past as an improvisational comic to
outline how "Yes" humor differs from "No" humor. "It's a basic improv
rule," he says. "If you're in a scene and somebody says, 'Doctor, my
dog is sick,' you don't say, 'I'm not a doctor and that's not a dog!'
It might get a laugh, but it doesn't build the scene. Agreement
builds the scene. So you might say, 'Yes, your dog is sick -- and
he's also growing a beard!' You layer the scene. You build it with
yeses."</TE>

<HD>Witness to cultural exchange and culture shock</HD>
<DH>Marlo Poras' first documentary leads her to Vietnam and
back as she follows a young woman's experience in America. The
result? An award-winning film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Sandler</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Marlo Poras' apartment is empty, save for an inherited couch, a desk
and a box spring. That's because this is her first apartment since
she packed her bags for Vietnam several years ago to escape her life
in the film business, working for Martin Scorsese's Tribeca Films in
New York. Many thousands of miles and days later -- having traveled
with her movie camera from Hanoi through the American South, then
crashed in her childhood bedroom between jaunts through the country's
film festival circuit -- Poras can finally settle once again.</LD>
<LD>   She'll be moving a host of festival documentary awards into her
new home, including the audience award from South by Southwest, and a
new one she picked up Friday in Los Angeles: the International
Documentary Assn. award for feature documentary. Not bad for a first
film.</LD>
<LD>   "Mai's America," Poras' movie, is the story of Mai Nguyen, a
spunky exchange student from Hanoi whose Hollywood concepts of
America are shattered when she is placed with a depressed and
unemployed white family in rural Mississippi.</LD>
<TE>   Her eyes are further opened to some of the country's cultural
realities when she moves into the home of another host family, a
married black Southern Baptist couple in their early 20s. Mai finds
friendship in a compassionate and flamboyant local drag queen, as
well as two Vietnamese Americans whose experience of their adopted
country and their homeland vary widely from her own.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just the first year of her journey. Nguyen's second
year brings her from the classrooms of Tulane, where she begins her
college degree, to the nail salons of Detroit, where she is forced to
work when she runs out of tuition money.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people don't believe it's a documentary -- it seems like
narrative, like this only exists in fiction," Poras says, chuckling.
But that's hardly the focus of discussion about this
discourse-generating film. Poras' movie has agitated Vietnamese
Americans with its empathetic story of a modern girl from the
communist North who finds herself at a remove from not only Anglo
America, but also from the Vietnamese immigrants she meets in her
travels, a community connected to a frozen image of prewar Vietnam
she's too young to know.</TE>
<TE>   Many people who have strong and painful memories of Vietnam before
the war refuse to watch the story of a daughter of Hanoi, and some of
those who do opt for a screening don't make it past Nguyen's
performance of the Ho Chi Minh song for her history class.</TE>
<TE>   "The older generation hears that song, and no matter what the film
actually says, they will only see it as a propaganda piece. It's what
they know," says Hung Quoc Nguyen, an organizer in the Vietnamese
community in and around Washington, D.C., who used the film to
generate discussion about the clash between not just North and South
Vietnam, but also about discrepancies between the lives of people who
stayed and those who left.</TE>
<TE>   "But for younger professionals like me, we'll say we'll bear
through this and watch the rest of the film and try to put our own
personal judgments aside. And then we can think about it together."
That collective thinking has kept the message board at PBS' "P.O.V.,"
where the film ran in August, buzzing for months with postings of
outrage and support.</TE>
<TE>   A vibrant, young Vietnam</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, there was basically no public information about
the people of North Vietnam. During the years Poras was based in
Hanoi, she would return to the States on a visit and find herself
bombarded with questions about the North Vietnamese -- how they
lived, what they thought about Americans, what kinds of attitudes
they had about the war.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam she experienced was extraordinarily young and vibrant
-- 60% of its population is under 25 -- its thoughts about America
drawn more often from bootleg Arnold Schwarzenegger films and Mariah
Carey CDs than memories of artillery fire in the Mekong Delta. To
tell their story, she decided to tell Nguyen's story, and to make the
first film to introduce an American audience to a teen from the
North.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Nguyen (no relation to either the film subject or the
community organizer), an L.A.-based television journalist who hosts a
daily talk show on the Saigon Broadcasting Network, says that before
she saw "Mai's America," she would have never imagined that she could
relate to a young woman from Hanoi.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time I've been able to see a documentary about a
woman with Mai's background. Before, I would have never sat down to
watch it. But I saw comments on the Net good and bad. And when I saw
the film, I cried. I was surprised that I could open myself up and
put myself into her situation, but it was impossible not to. I was
shocked. I thought I could have shut everything out and said, 'Why
should I care?' But I was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "It means everything to me what people in the community think,"
says Poras, a pixie-like 31-year-old with sharp eyes and a quick,
ironic smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, here I am, this Jewish, white American girl making this
film, right? It's really important to me how Vietnamese Americans
receive this story."</TE>
<TE>   That's how Poras got into the film biz -- telling stories.</TE>
<TE>   As a history major at Washington University, she realized that
documentary film was a great way to record personal histories -- "it
was like a lightbulb went off" -- and her interest in movies grew
from there. She moved to New York after graduation and took whatever
production assistant jobs she could find.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horrible at it. I'd be sent out for envelopes, go buy some
gum for myself and come back without the envelopes," she says. "And
cutting up strawberries for people's cereal wasn't exactly connecting
me with the creative side of things."</TE>
<TE>   A number of colleagues suggested Poras apprentice as an editor,
which could lead to work on features and documentaries. "I literally
went out knocking on doors," she says. Poras instantly landed a job
working on the indie dysfunctional family comedy "The Daytrippers,"
which led to a dream gig at Tribeca Films, working with the noted
Thelma Schoonmaker on Scorsese's "Casino" and Allison Anders' "Grace
of My Heart."</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I'd landed in nirvana. One of my first days at work,
Scorsese shows us 'Raging Bull' in his private screening room. We're
all sitting on these lush leather seats, and he's talking about
making the movie. I was on cloud nine."</TE>
<TE>   But the euphoria didn't last. Poras' work at Tribeca was
isolating, frustrating and, she thought, divorced from the creative
practice of moviemaking. Eventually, she turned down such choice
offers as one to work on "Great Expectations."</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that if you spend your life as an editor, you work on
two or three films that you love. That's it. And I realized feature
film wasn't the place for me."</TE>
<TE>   A friend and mentor shook Poras one day after two consecutive
all-nighters and told her to get out. "This is a gilded coffin, but a
coffin all the same."</TE>
<TE>   'Transfixed' by Vietnam</TE>
<TE>   Poras gave up her stellar position and her New York apartment, and
boarded a plane for Vietnam, where a friend had gone to do public
health work. Born on a military base in Kentucky during the Vietnam
War, Poras has always been fascinated by that country. "The moment I
stepped off the plane I was completely transfixed," she says. And
most important, she had gotten herself as far as possible from the
world of filmmaking. But her friend had other ideas for Poras and
surreptitiously crafted a job for her producing AIDS education
videos. "I was furious, like, 'What kind of a friend are you! Haven't
you seen how miserable I've been? Haven't you listened to a word I
said?' "</TE>
<TE>   Poras, however, gave in to her friend's pressure, and consequently
came closer to documentary filmmaking than she ever had in New York.
Two years of immersion in Hanoi's culture led her to the story she
needed to tell. She began teaching a program for U.S.-bound exchange
students, where she met many students, including Mai Nguyen, and she
didn't return home until it was time to follow the students to the
States.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly three years, Poras filmed Nguyen's experiences,
revealing as much -- if not more -- about the contradictions of this
country as those in Vietnam. She moved back to her parent's suburban
Boston home, funding the project with her own savings, then tapping
into her parent's funds and finally receiving grants to finish the
film.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized this wasn't just a story about Mai, but about the
States through her eyes. Sure, it's political, but in an organic
sense, true to what was going on with Mai, trusting her story and her
vision," Poras says. "It's not like there was stuff I wanted to say,
just what I found interested, themes I was personally fascinated by.
Whatever I would find that would make me think, I thought would make
other people think as well."</TE>
<TE>   Although the film roams an expansive territory of ideas about
American education and identity, ranging from transvestitism to
higher-education funding to depression -- and the film's online
discussion board hums on all topics -- perhaps the most surprising
dynamic Poras discovered was between Nguyen's sense of Vietnam and
that of her Vietnamese American friends. Her friends take her to a
celebration for Vietnamese American immigrants at a Mississippi
hotel, where she feels desperately out of place.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen sadly muses, "The Vietnamese in America are trying to hold
on. Vietnam before the war is what they're trying to hold on to. But
that isn't the Vietnam I left. I feel like we're from different
countries, different cultures."</TE>
<TE>   A controversial scene</TE>
<TE>   The moment she heard those words, Poras knew the film would
produce a profound response in the community. She screened the film
for Vietnamese American student groups at Harvard and Wellesley while
making the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   At Harvard, she says, some students were furious about that scene,
and about the sentiments encompassed in that moment that resonate
through other parts of the film. Students argued vehemently about
whether those elements should be cut out, whether they presented
Vietnamese Americans as backward, or whether they revealed an
important fissure that needed to be communicated.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I knew how intense this was going to be," Poras says,
"and I just sat silently and watched it all happen." At Wellesley,
students had a very different response, much like that of talk show
host Victoria Nguyen. "The women there kept repeating that in their
wildest dreams they never thought they'd want to hear the perspective
of a girl from the north of Vietnam. They said they felt their minds
opening," Poras says. "And I thought, what else could I want from
this?"</TE>
<TE>   Now, in her new apartment, once the festival schedule calms down
and the awards are put away, Poras will be researching her next film,
a somewhat mirroring project about cultural identity and the journey
of immigration. It may not be Scorsese's sumptuous screening room,
and she certainly doesn't have anyone cutting up strawberries for her
cereal, but take notice. It's all hers.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any decade that saw the rise of designer jeans as well as the fall of
the Berlin Wall merits some serious scrutiny, and except for the
serious part, VH1 takes on the challenge in its five-day, 10-hour
series, "I Love the '80s."</LD>
<LD>   Far too scattershot to be called ambitious, the series
nevertheless manages to serve as an entertaining diversion as it
slices and dices the people, places and events of the decade's
pop-culture landscape into messy but filling one-year portions. The
hourlong segments -- two air each evening -- continue nightly through
Friday, where Milli Vanilli awaits to help wrap up the decade. The
year 1980 kicks things off tonight at 9, with 1981 following at 10
p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than assign a lone narrator to lead us through the jungle
of video clips chronicling the wild and woolly '80s, VH1 enlists an
army of celebs and semi-celebs to weigh in with sound bites that
provide some measure of perspective, however warped, fawning or
irreverent. The 200 or so talking heads include everyone from John
Travolta and Juliette Lewis to Mary Lou Retton and Carrot Top.</LD>
<TE>   With the average clip lasting about five seconds and the average
interview reflecting on it only slightly longer, the special would
seem to be a film editor's nightmare, but the precious little
structure to each hour must have made things easier.</TE>
<TE>   Every so often a coolness debate breaks out along the lines of
Debbie Harry versus Pat Benatar or Han Solo versus Luke Skywalker,
and occasionally there's a "Hot Guys" and "Hot Gals" interlude, but
then it's quickly back to the blizzard of scattered clips and quips.
The latter can get a little salty, but usually it's just good-natured
sniping.</TE>
<TE>   Says Lea Thompson tonight of the film "Xanadu": "You have to be on
drugs to understand anything about it." Saucy words for an actress
with "Howard the Duck" on her resume, a movie that takes its own turn
in the barrel Thursday during the 1986 installment.</TE>

<HD>Deck the malls with gals so gaudy</HD>
<DH>It jingles and glows with Rudolph's red nose. No, it's not
Santa's sleigh. It's Mom's sweater.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No doubt it started innocently enough, probably during the
Renaissance when some overworked seamstress with dreams of
egalitarianism looked up from the robes she was embroidering for the
local nobleman and thought, "If His Royal Humphety-humph can wear
stars and angels on his clothes at yuletide, why can't I?"</LD>
<LD>   And so the holiday sweater was born.</LD>
<LD>   Three minutes after the Thanksgiving leftovers are put away, the
stores are full of sweaters festively aglitter with images of the
season: applique Christmas trees with real ornaments, glitter-dust
snowmen and boiled-wool teddy bears, bangle rocking horses and jingle
bells that ring at the slightest movement. Some of them glow in the
dark, some of them chirp electric carols, some of them have their own
blinking lights.</LD>
<TE>   It's full-frontal revelry, the holiday spirit in S, M, L and XL
brought to you directly from Santa's Village. Via Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to note that these sweaters are almost totally
confined to one department. Oh, men may find the occasional Santa
hat-and-matching-boxer set under the tree or delight in the blinking
red nose on their Rudolph holiday tie, but the heavy artillery, the
red cardigans with nutcrackers as tall as a 5-year-old, are reserved
for the ladies. More specifically, the mommies and the grandmommies.</TE>
<TE>   "Little kids love them," says Kate Rice, a style consultant for
Mervyns. "And moms will do anything for their kids at Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Most of us remember a maternal holiday sweater or, more probably,
hostess apron, from our childhoods, but if it seems like things have
gotten a tad out of control lately, well, they are. Mervyns alone
offers about a dozen styles of holiday novelty sweaters this year
and, according to Rice, the styles are growing in number and
gaudiness.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting more and more over the top," she says. "It used
to be a snowflake design or maybe a little tree, but now it's snowmen
all over the place and a trimmed Christmas tree down the front."</TE>
<TE>   Novelty of all types is a growth industry, she says, and while
there are still plenty of women who haul out the same sweater year
after year, more are buying new every season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think now you have people who collect them and so every year
their families are waiting to see what The Sweater will look like
this time," she says. "There's a real kitsch factor."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the mall, Nordstrom sees some of the same
trends, although at $40 to $100 a pop, their demographic is slightly
different from Mervyns. A call to the store in South Coast Plaza,
surely the local cradle of sequinization, is routed up through the
Seattle headquarters, where Deniz Angers says the store carries a
whopping 40 variations on The Sweater. Tassels and 3-D elements --
protruding reindeer noses, fuzzy teddy bears -- are popular this
year, she says, and royal blue is the new red.</TE>
<TE>   Although the glittery sweater may now seem a requisite concession
of motherhood, there are still plenty of women who balk, who stare
down those sequined nutcrackers and Santas and head over to the
claret sweater sets.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very opinionated about The Sweater," says Rice. "They
love them or they hate them."</TE>
<TE>   Mercifully, there does not, however, appear to be a holiday
sweater gene. "My mother loves them," she says. "My grandmother?
Never in a million years."</TE>

<HD>Thirsty? Consider It Your Just Deserts</HD>

<LD>None of the recent public debates over Southern California's share of
Colorado River water have mentioned the simple fact that none of us
are living within the ecological limitations of where we live.</LD>
<LD>   The discussion covers urban versus rural entitlements, surpluses,
allotments, agreements among states and water districts, and who is
privileged to consume more. We have forgotten that Southern
California is essentially a desert and that we're all using water as
if it's the tropics.</LD>
<LD>   As a small farmer, I have never had that luxury. I don't get
government-subsidized water, so by necessity our farming systems have
evolved in ways that do more with less. This is not just a financial
issue but also my responsibility to the other people who share this
desert, and to an ecosystem that is essential to all of us. And
ultimately, it is also a creative and rewarding endeavor.</LD>
<TE>   Each year thousands of people come through our Southern California
farm to see how it is possible to feed hundreds of families with the
harvest from only 12 1/2 acres.</TE>
<TE>   They see efficient drip irrigation and recycled hay mulch, and
they taste sweet dry-farmed tomatoes grown with the remains of the
rainfall we get from November to March. They also see composting
toilets that use no water, showers that also irrigate orchards and
tractors that run on French fry oil.</TE>
<TE>   As long as farmers grow thirsty crops like alfalfa or lettuce and
city dwellers worship green lawns, tropical landscapes and carwashes,
the struggle will continue to be over who gets more of a shrinking
resource.</TE>
<TE>   As populations increase, water resources -- whether aquifers or
rivers -- will continue to decrease. Drought conditions will stress
systems that are expected to yield at a far greater rate than they
can replenish themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Wars have been (and may still be) fought over oil; in the future
they may be fought over fresh water. Rather than responding as we
always seem to do by grasping and grappling for "more," why not seek
out solutions that are based on conservation and efficiency?</TE>
<TE>   Farmers could continue to farm with a fraction of the water they
use now by selecting crops and varieties that better fit within the
desert climate, using time-honored dry-farming techniques, replacing
inefficient sprinkler systems with drip irrigation and improving
soils so they better absorb and retain moisture.</TE>
<TE>   Urban dwellers could rethink their landscapes to eliminate
irrigation, install waterless toilets, reduce shower and sink flows
and recycle gray water.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers could provide incentives for conservation rather than
the subsidies now available for those who use more. When Cuba lost
access to Soviet-produced agricultural fertilizers and pesticides,
its people faced starvation. Instead of seeking out more of the same,
they applied all of their creativity and knowledge to creating an
agriculture based on self-reliance and natural systems that did not
require outside help. The greening of Cuba's agriculture has become a
model for the world.</TE>
<TE>   I am not so naive as to believe that we will change without a
crisis. If the Imperial Valley water district continues to refuse a
deal, and the federal government cuts Southern California off from
surplus Colorado River water, we will be forced to find another way
to farm and to live.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps only then will we learn to view fresh water not as ours to
use and abuse but as the sacred and precious resource that it is.</TE>

<HD>Iranian Reformers Squander Chances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shaul Bakhash</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iranian student protests of the last few weeks -- the largest in at
least three years, with scores arrested -- reflect widespread
discontent with current conditions, felt not only by the younger
generation but by Iranians of all classes and age groups. Student
aspirations for political freedom, accountable government, economic
opportunity and an easing of social controls are widely shared. But
the response by politicians also demonstrates the political
bankruptcy of the hard-line conservatives who oppose the students,
not to mention the failure of political leadership of the reformers
who support the students.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-liners retain considerable coercive power, but they have
no ideas or policies for dealing with the serious economic problems
facing the country, or with Iranians chafing under the clerical
monopoly on power. Their response to the demands for change has been
to shut down newspapers, imprison critics, insist on clerical
supremacy and label protesters "agents of foreign powers."</LD>
<TE>   Reformist politicians, well represented in the Majlis, or
parliament, are much closer to the popular temper. They are critics,
after all, of arbitrary arrests, a politicized judiciary,
interference in elections and suppression of press and social
freedoms. Voters elected Mohammad Khatami to the presidency by large
margins and gave a reformist coalition a workable majority in the
2000 elections. But after a promising start, the reformists appear to
lack a strategy for translating this considerable public support into
effective politics.</TE>
<TE>   This was evident in the reformists' weak response to protests --
from the violent crackdown on student protests in 1999 to the
conservative backlash that was launched in earnest three years ago to
the latest demonstrations. Support for the students by reformist
deputies in parliament has been mild. Deputies joined the students in
criticizing the death sentence passed on university professor Hashem
Aghajari, who had called for a kind of "Protestant Reformation" in
Islam. But, so far, the judiciary has blithely ignored them. The days
when the reformers called mass political rallies of their own, or
encouraged the general public to actively engage in the political
process, seem to be over.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, students and reformists wish to avoid clashes with
club- and chain-wielding thugs. The club-wielders were out in force
when several thousand people joined in student-led demonstrations
outside Tehran University last week.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami and the reformist parties are correct in their conviction
that peaceful change through the political process is preferable to
violent change. But the reformers have failed to exploit numerous
opportunities to press their political advantage. As a result, most
middle-class Iranians have dropped out of the political process;
disillusioned students may soon do so as well.</TE>
<TE>   Strikingly, the most powerful spokesmen for reform today are
individuals of immense courage rather than political parties or
movements. Aghajari got a death sentence for arguing that Islam does
not require Iranians to blindly follow the dictates of religious
leaders. Another intellectual, Qasem Sho'leh-Sa'di, dared to take
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini to task for clerical corruption
and distortion of the judicial process.</TE>
<TE>   The reformist parties are vesting considerable hope in two bills
before parliament. The first would curtail the authority of the
Guardian Council to disqualify candidates for elected office; the
second would enhance the president's authority. If enacted, these
laws would be significant.</TE>
<TE>   But enhanced presidential powers won't help if Khatami is
unwilling to challenge the conservatives when they manipulate the
constitution and institutions of the state in contravention of the
law. He needs to display the firmness he exercised early in his first
term, when he forced the intelligence ministry to admit its agents
were complicit in the murders of Iranian intellectuals and political
figures.</TE>
<TE>   The idea dear to some in Washington and even in Tehran that the
U.S. can help resolve the political deadlock in Iran is not
persuasive. The Bush administration expresses support for the
democratic forces in Iran but has yet to find a way to engage with
the government and organized political groups in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Reform can be effective but only with determined, organized
political leadership and broader political mobilization. Otherwise,
the efforts of students and others may be squandered.</TE>

<HD>Some People Can Get Very Possessive About Apostrophe's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That's it. I'm at the end of my rope. Or, more appropriately, my
rope's end -- because that's the thing that's got me so worked up:
the growing misuse of that puny piece of punctuation called the
apostrophe.</LD>
<LD>   The phenomenon is spreading so rapidly that it's practically,
well, an apostrodemic.</LD>
<LD>   You see the grammatical gaffes everywhere: on billboards, in movie
ads, in grocery stores, on restaurant menus -- even in the hallowed
pages of the New York Times.</LD>
<TE>   Just the other day, I saw a headline in that paper that read:
"Saudis Seize Kuwaiti in Shooting of G.I.'s, Who Are Recovering." I
couldn't help wondering: the shooting of the GI's what? His jeep? His
superior officer? Or perhaps it was in a part of his body too
sensitive for a family newspaper to mention?</TE>
<TE>   And why "Are Recovering"? Why not "Is Recovering"? And if there
was, in fact, more than one GI shot, why not say GIs? Why tag a
gratuitous apostrophe onto the poor soldier? It's bad enough that he
was shot; why add insult -- in the form of an unnecessary punctuation
mark -- to his injury?</TE>
<TE>   Now, I really hate to make such a big stink about a little
squiggle -- especially at a time when life-and-death matters like the
march to war in Iraq, the murderous bombing in Kenya and the
disastrous oil spill off the coast of Spain cry out for our
attention. But sometimes a small thing like this can have much bigger
ramifications. Think of it as the literary equivalent of the
broken-windows theory of crime fighting, which holds that by fighting
small crimes like graffiti and vandalism, police send a persuasive
message that antisocial behavior of any scale will not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, putting an end to the chronic misplacement of
apostrophes could eventually lead to a better-educated populace, a
greater sense of harmony and order, more fuel-efficient cars, a
slimmer-trimmer you, cleaner air, an end to the heartbreak of
psoriasis, the cancellation of "The Bachelor" and, who knows, maybe
even world peace.</TE>
<TE>   OK. Putting an end to the scourge of punctuation abuse wouldn't
actually lead to any of those things. But it would lower my blood
pressure and that of a few million other grammar scolds across the
English-speaking world.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for regime change in apostrophe land.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that vanquishing this enemy won't take
congressional approval, a U.N. Security Council resolution or
permission from the Turks to use their airspace. But neither can it
be accomplished just by deploying a few unmanned apostrophe drones.</TE>
<TE>   No, this will require a coalition of journalists, copy editors, ad
execs, teachers and people like you and me willing to draw a line
(albeit it a small, crescent-shaped one) in the compositional sand.</TE>
<TE>   It's really not that complicated.</TE>
<TE>   To make a word plural, you simply add an "s" (ropes). To make the
word possessive, you add an apostrophe and an "s" (rope's). To make a
plural noun ending in "s" possessive, add only the apostrophe
(ropes', states' rights, the girls' toys, etc.).</TE>
<TE>   Of course, apostrophes are also used for contractions like
"can't," "he's," "won't" and "it's."</TE>
<TE>   My biggest beef, though, is with the erroneous use of apostrophes
to pluralize abbreviations or acronyms like CEOs, GIs and CDs. The
rule is: If there is more than one CEO it's "CEOs" -- no apostrophe.
If an individual CEO possesses something -- and you can bet the farm
he does -- it's "CEO's," as in "the CEO's $125-million-dollar yacht,
paid for by company shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   And if those execs jointly possess something, then it would be
CEOs', as in "the targeted CEOs' lushly appointed offices were raided
by SEC investigators at roughly the same time."</TE>
<TE>   OK, students, class dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   And leave those apples -- or, more likely, brickbats -- in my
e-mail inbox.</TE>

<HD>We Wish You a Merry Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Santa brings lots of litigation on religious symbols.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For me, a constitutional law professor, it is the best time of year.
Houses are festooned with lights and decorations with the promise of
Christmas. 'Tis the season to be suing.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, groups are fully engaged in the annual battles
over creches, crosses and other religious symbols appearing on public
property. It is like a form of Christmas Kabuki. Public officials
first defiantly place a creche on public land and then wrestle with
the dark forces of the American Civil Liberties Union until some
federal judge ends the matter with the predictable court order to
remove the display.</LD>
<LD>   This year, one of the most notable cases involves a 5,300-pound
monument to the Ten Commandments in front of the Alabama Supreme
Court. Alabama's chief justice, Roy Moore, stated that the monument
was meant to remind all citizens of the "sovereignty of God over the
affairs of men." In case of any uncertainty as to which "God," Moore
said he was referring to Jesus Christ and that other deities would
deny our freedoms and specifically would "not allow for freedom of
conscience."</LD>
<TE>   Unpersuaded, a federal court recently ordered the removal of the
monument and noted that Moore's views came "uncomfortably ... close
to ... a theocracy." In the spirit of the season, Moore is appealing
with the financial support of a religious group.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's something new in this year's list of the naughty and
the nice of state-church entanglements. Cities have hit on an idea of
how to allow religious displays on public land: They are simply
selling or giving public land to religious or civic organizations.
Under this theory, a city could have a permanent creche with "Christ
is the Lord" emblazoned across its display in the middle of the court
complex, so long as the 10-foot space was the property of a local
church.</TE>
<TE>   If the federal judge viewed Alabama's display as suggesting
theocracy, he might want to visit Main Street Plaza in Salt Lake
City. This plaza was city property connecting the main temple of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to its administration
building. The church has long chafed at the conduct of the public
there, conduct that it felt insulted Mormon values.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the city agreed to sell the entire block to the church,
with the stipulation that the sidewalk remain open for public
traffic. The church proceeded to enforce its ban on such things as
smoking, sunbathing, playing music, distributing literature and a
catchall category of "disorderly speech, dress or conduct." One
Baptist was arrested by city police for passing out literature. A
federal court ruled that the sidewalk remained a protected public
forum. The church is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent transfers are more modest. For example, the city of
San Diego thought that a transfer of a small part of its 179-acre Mt.
Soledad park could preserve the 43-foot cross that is a beloved
symbol in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   After it was sued by the ACLU, the city arranged the transfer of
the property under the cross to a civic group. But the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the deal as rigged to favor
organizations that wanted to preserve the cross.</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, 400 square feet of a tiny one-acre park may be
transferred to protect a Ten Commandments monument. Theoretically,
any religious endorsement could then be shown in the center of the
park.</TE>
<TE>   With all of these transfers, it is no wonder that the original set
of Commandments was made portable so Moses could carry them on his
person.</TE>
<TE>   Carving off parts of public land is hardly an answer to
church-state tensions. The Ten Commandments can be shown in public
buildings (like the display in the U.S. Supreme Court) only if part
of a display of early legal sources.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, for those who view the Ten Commandments as one of the
foundation stones for law, it is the American constitutional system
that is its greatest expression. The courthouse itself, not the
specific display, is the greatest testament to the pursuit of justice
and tolerance embodied by Moses as law-giver.</TE>
<TE>   Those looking at the empty space in the Alabama Supreme Court may
want to consider the Latin inscription above the tomb of Christopher
Wren, in his magnificent St. Paul's Cathedral: "Si monumentum
requires, circumspice": If you seek his monument, look around you.</TE>

<HD>An Idea Is Planted: Firm Uses Tobacco to Grow Cancer Drugs</HD>
<DH>Large Scale Biology has treated 16 patients. Signs show
promise.</DH>

<DL>VACAVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The tobacco seedlings reaching toward the bright sunlamps in an
indoor greenhouse look fairly ordinary. But the young plants growing
in this rural nursery aren't destined to become cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   Inside their broad, green leaves, the plants are pumping out bits
of cancer tumor as they spread upward in the 80-degree warmth. In a
laboratory nearby, the tumor fragments will be wrung from harvested
plants and used to make an experimental biotechnology vaccine.</LD>
<LD>   So far, 16 people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an incurable cancer
of the lymphatic system, have received this vaccine produced by Large
Scale Biology Corp. One patient was a 29-year-old mother of two;
another was a 12-year-old boy. Each received a vaccine that was not
mass-produced but customized to attack his or her specific tumor, a
step toward the long-promised era of "personalized medicine."</LD>
<TE>   Lymphoma spreads slowly, so it will be years before anyone can be
sure that the vaccine works. But the early signs are encouraging. At
a medical conference in Philadelphia last week, Large Scale Biology
reported that 10 of the 16 patients made tumor-fighting white blood
cells after getting the shots, a large percentage for a cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   Much is riding on Large Scale's vaccines -- both for cancer
patients and for the company.</TE>
<TE>   After raising $89 million from an initial public stock offering in
2000, Large Scale has 12 to 18 months of cash remaining. The cancer
vaccine is one of two drugs the company is feverishly developing. And
with its shares hovering in penny-stock territory, time is running
out for the company -- though it wouldn't be the first biotech firm
to roar back from the edge.</TE>
<TE>   All current biotechnology drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration are made by gene-splicing bits of DNA with live cells
-- usually hamster cells -- and turning them into mini-cell factories
to produce a specific drug. But Large Scale's scientists believe that
a vaccine created through plants might be purer and avoid copying
defects found in mammals. Large Scale chose tobacco because it is
cheap and grows rapidly, a promising vehicle for producing many small
batches of vaccine at an acceptable price.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, Large Scale hopes to persuade the FDA to approve a
more elaborate human test of its lymphoma vaccine on 280 patients.
Yet even if the company gets that go-ahead, it must raise an
additional $50 million to fund the trials, which could take four
years to complete.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of Large Scale is 48-year-old Robert L. Erwin, an
earnest, rail-thin biologist with a very personal grudge against
cancer: It killed his first wife in 1994 after agonizing surgeries,
radiation treatments and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   From the window of his Vacaville office at Large Scale, Erwin can
see the sprawling $500-million factory where South San
Francisco-based Genentech Inc., the world's second-largest
biotechnology company, makes its breast cancer drug Herceptin. The
drug combats breast cancer cells and might have saved his wife,
Marti, but she died while it was in development.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of his wife drove Erwin to find a way to slash
development times for cancer medications to weeks instead of years.
Large Scale says it now can develop a vaccine for a patient in six
weeks and hopes to eventually produce enough custom vaccine to treat
10,000 patients each year.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I've learned," said Erwin, "is that speed is important
for some patients."</TE>
<TE>   The vaccines produced by Large Scale differ from shots given to
healthy children to protect them from measles or chicken pox. People
who get a lymphoma vaccine already are sick, in part because their
immune systems failed to notice or sufficiently fight their tumors.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 50 biotech vaccines in development against
various types of cancers, but none has reached the market and few are
custom-made for individual patients. Typical is a melanoma vaccine
being tested by CancerVax Corp. of Carlsbad, Calif., that contains 30
different tumor fragments commonly present in skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists believe that lymphoma requires a personalized
approach because it has substances on the surfaces of its deadly
cells that vary from patient to patient. A vaccine made from these
so-called surface antigens could train a patient's immune system to
recognize and fight the cancer, researchers believe.</TE>
<TE>   Large Scale teamed up with Stanford University scientist Ronald
Levy, who started work on lymphoma vaccines in the late 1980s and who
now runs the firm's first round of drug trials.</TE>
<TE>   Levy and his students have treated hundreds of patients in his
Stanford laboratory over the last two decades. A former student,
Larry W. Kwak of the National Cancer Institute, is now a rival and is
preparing to test a personalized vaccine on hundreds of patients in a
clinical trial that could lead to FDA approval.</TE>
<TE>   To this point, Large Scale, in keeping with standard practices, is
providing its cancer vaccine for free as the company conducts its
testing, and no one knows what this kind of treatment might really
cost in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Kwak figures it could be as much as $50,000 for a series of five
or six shots. That would be half the $100,000 cost of a bone-marrow
transplant -- a last resort for lymphoma patients -- but 10 times the
expense of standard chemotherapy. Still, insurers may be willing to
cover vaccines if the shots allow patients to avoid years of
expensive medical care, Kwak said.</TE>
<TE>   Large Scale believes that it can shave costs by producing drugs in
tobacco, an innovative counterpoint to Kwak's complicated but
time-honored technique that involves fusing a patient's tumor cell
with a mouse antibody. Large Scale's president, John D. Fowler, said
the company's production expenses could be 30% lower than those of
biotech firms that use the routine method of making drugs in rodent
cells.</TE>
<TE>   Large Scale uses a natural enemy of tobacco, the tobacco mosaic
virus, to produce its vaccine. The company slips genes from a
patient's tumor into copies of the virus, a virulent bug that is a
scourge to farmers.</TE>
<TE>   As the altered virus infects plants, it produces tiny tumor
fragments that build up in the tobacco leaves and stems. Six weeks
later, the plants are harvested, washed and spun in a centrifuge to
extract plant juices. The solution is purified and reduced to an
amount of vaccine that wouldn't fill a Coke can. Patients receive six
shots spread over as many months along with other injections to boost
the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   In the company's greenhouse, young plants with yellowing, mottled
leaves grow in neat rows on long, wooden tables. The plants are a
cousin of the tobacco strain grown for commercial use. A team of
horticulturists tends the plants, which are grown from seeds no
larger than a pinhead in temperatures that never dip below 72
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Lab assistants painstakingly infect the plants by hand, gently
scratching the leaves with a solution containing the virus, which can
be transmitted only by direct contact. It takes 1,000 plants grown to
a height of 6 inches or so to make enough vaccine for a single
patient, an amount equal to half a teaspoon.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Gallegos, a school administrator in Monterrey County,
became one of the first patients to receive Large Scale's vaccine in
May 2001. By then, a harsh chemotherapy regimen had forced her neck
and abdominal tumors into remission, but doctors warned that the
cancer probably would recur.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegos' shots ended a year ago, but her immune system continues
to make anti-tumor white blood cells. To Gallegos, the vaccine offers
a chance to break the inevitable cycle of chemotherapy treatments
followed by shorter and shorter remissions, the deadly hallmark of
lymphoma.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives me peace of mind to know that my system is responding,"
said Gallegos, 57, who lives near Santa Cruz. "I feel like I have my
life back."</TE>
<TE>   Erwin didn't have cancer vaccines in mind in 1986 when he founded
the predecessor of Large Scale. But his first wife's illness
sharpened his business focus. After the standard artillery of
surgery, chemotherapy and radiation failed Marti, Erwin became
convinced that a different approach was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Marti's inability to obtain Genentech's experimental drug also
transformed Erwin into a crusader, an unlikely role for a biotech
CEO. With his blessing, fellow activists stormed Genentech's campus
after her death in a mock funeral procession. Since then, Erwin has
quietly lobbied pharmaceutical companies to provide experimental
medications to patients whose cancer defies treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin acknowledges that it can be difficult to balance his zeal
with his responsibilities as Large Scale's CEO. His company recently
was ready to provide the cancer vaccine to an additional patient, who
didn't technically qualify for the drug trial, but she did not
survive a bone marrow transplant. However, Large Scale's financial
condition doesn't allow it to routinely offer treatment to others.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, if the firm does not find a partner to
fund another round of cancer vaccine trials, the vaccine could be set
aside. But it probably wouldn't sit on a shelf permanently. The
company hopes it can license its technology or possibly try to
develop it again later.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't just about making money," Erwin said. "We're giving
patients something that really matters."</TE>

<HD>Quiet FCC Maverick Raises His Voice on Media Rules</HD>
<DH>Commissioner putting pressure on Chairman Powell over his
move to relax ownership limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael J. Copps doesn't exactly cut the figure of a political
heavyweight.</LD>
<LD>   He's an old-school Democrat on a Republican-controlled Federal
Communications Commission. A former history professor, Copps is so
soft-spoken that even admirers say he can come across as a little
dull.</LD>
<LD>   FCC insiders sometimes roll their eyes as Copps -- who at age 62
is a generation older than the other commissioners -- champions
issues some view as out-dated, such as suggesting that the recent
broadcast of a Victoria's Secret fashion show met the government's
definition of indecency.</LD>
<TE>   But beneath the unassuming, grandfatherly exterior, Copps is
emerging as one of the most outspoken and politically savvy
commissioners at the agency, observers say. He has launched an
ambitious challenge to FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell on one of
Powell's key initiatives, the relaxation of decades-old rules that
restrict who may own broadcasters and how large they can grow.</TE>
<TE>   And though the biggest battles over media ownership won't occur
until spring, Copps is winning some early skirmishes, at times
out-maneuvering Powell and maintaining steady pressure to raise
public awareness about the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is No. 1 on my list," said Copps, who fears that the
growingconsolidation of broadcast and other media companies will
stifle viewpoints and give a few corporations vast power over what
Americans watch, hear and read. "I'm determined to have a
conversation with this country on these issues before we pass a vote,
and I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Copps' strategy so far has been to slow down the FCC's review of
media-ownership regulations. Powell had promised to wrap up the
proceeding by next spring. Today, that timetable is questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Copps first pushed the agency to extend a public comment period by
30 days. Then he demanded that the FCC conduct a public hearing about
the rules, even though Powell and his aides had dismissed that idea
as a waste of time and money and an exercise in "foot-stomping."</TE>
<TE>   The standoff was won after Copps announced that if Powell refused
to convene a formal hearing, he would organize a makeshift one of his
own. Faced with the prospect of appearing to be uninterested in the
public's views, Powell relented and called a hearing for February.</TE>
<TE>   Such tactics have gained Copps notice, both inside and outside the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very much an unknown," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of
Consumers Union, one of several advocacy groups that oppose the
relaxation of media ownership rules. "But he's flown in below the
radar screen and shown himself to be very effective and very adept."</TE>
<TE>   Reed Hundt, a telecommunications consultant and former Democratic
chairman of the FCC, said, "I don't remember any commissioner ever
forcing me to call a hearing I didn't want to have."</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of the February hearing, Copps is trying to spur
public support by linking his two pet issues: media consolidation and
indecency on television and radio.</TE>
<TE>   He has argued that media consolidation and corporate ownership of
television and radio stations have accelerated the "race to the
bottom" in offering sex and violence. Suddenly, his keen interest in
maintaining decency doesn't look so old-fashioned, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   If Copps can tap into community outrage over profanity and sex on
television and redirect anger at media consolidation, Powell may find
more public resistance than he expected, analysts and industry
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty crafty in the way he's going about this," one media
lobbyist said. "He's a seasoned political operative and he's keeping
the pressure on Powell."</TE>
<TE>   Copps has hit the road, speaking about the issue to lawmakers,
religious groups, unions and newspaper editorial boards, an unusually
aggressive strategy for a commissioner. At the recent annual Kennedy
Center Honors in Washington, Copps chatted up Walter Cronkite and
urged the veteran anchorman to speak out against media consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics accuse Copps of trying to delay -- or halt -- a
vote, he denies this. "I'm saying we need to get the facts. I have a
lot of questions."</TE>
<TE>   Powell declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   His media advisor, Susan Eid, said the chairman welcomes the
chance to gather public opinion at a hearing, though she noted that
the agency hears from the public on a daily basis. Interested parties
can submit comments to the FCC until Feb. 3.</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of Powell and others, the broadcast restrictions --
some of which are more than 30 years old -- should be updated to
reflect the growth of cable TV and the Internet. Over the last two
years, a federal appeals court has thrown out several of the rules,
questioning whether they still serve the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   "We must focus on developing broadcast ownership rules that are
sustainable in court," Eid said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a coalition of consumer groups released a report
warning that a relaxation of media ownership rules would spur a wave
of harmful consolidation. The report, by the Consumer Federation of
America, predicted that mergers between newspapers and TV stations
would reduce each sector's independence, stifling diverse viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune Co., parent of the Los Angeles Times and KTLA-TV Channel
5, has been a leading critic of the media ownership rules,
particularly one that prohibits control of newspapers and television
stations in the same market. Also pushing for relaxation of the rules
are Viacom Inc. and News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Though a relative newcomer to the FCC, Copps is a longtime
Washington insider.</TE>
<TE>   A Wisconsin native, he grew up as a Republican until the
presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy drew him to the Democratic
Party. After getting a doctorate in history and teaching at Loyola
University in New Orleans, he persuaded his fiancee to move to
Washington. "I always had this little bug that said I should go to
Washington at some point and get politics out of my system," he
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Copps figured he'd stay in the capital "for a couple of years."
Instead, he never left.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, he joined the staff of Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
and eventually became chief of staff for the powerful legislator, who
helped Copps win his FCC appointment last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He's smart as all get out," Hollings said. "He'll make Powell
stop, look and listen."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Copps left public service to work as a lobbyist
for Collins &amp; Aikman Corp., a manufacturing company, and the American
Meat Institute. With the election of President Clinton, he joined the
Commerce Department, where he remained for seven years, advocating
for U.S. businesses on trade issues abroad.</TE>
<TE>   A devout Catholic, Copps and his wife have five children, the
youngest age 14. He said his concerns about indecency on television
and radio stem partly from his role as a parent.</TE>
<TE>   The recent Republican takeover of the Senate represents a setback
for Copps and his media-ownership campaign because the election will
remove Hollings from his chairmanship of the Senate Commerce
Committee. Hollings, an outspoken critic of media consolidation, had
planned to hold his own hearings on the matter and would have been in
a position to cut the FCC's budget if the agency, in his view, moved
too aggressively in relaxing the rules.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear how Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is taking
over the committee, will act on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Copps said he plans to reach out to McCain as well as to
Republican FCC Commissioners Kathleen Q. Abernathy and Kevin J.
Martin and a second Democrat, Jonathan Adelstein, who was recently
confirmed and could give Copps a potential ally.</TE>
<TE>   Yet regardless of how many wind up in Copps' camp, lobbyists warn
against underestimating him.</TE>
<TE>   The only non-lawyer on the commission, Copps has more government
service under his belt than do all of the Republican commissioners
combined, and he's proving adept at using the bully pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   The big test will come when the issue is put before the commission
next year. Copps calls it the "High Noon showdown."</TE>
<TE>   Though he downplays his own political skills, Copps admits he
relishes the process.</TE>
<TE>   "I love politics," said Copps, whose office is decorated with old
presidential campaign posters dating to Teddy Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around town for a while. I'd like to think that's an
advantage.... But we'll see how many votes I can carry."</TE>

<HD>Group Is Launching New Types of Licenses</HD>
<DH>The nonprofit's goal is to promote creativity while
reinvigorating the public domain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For generations, the owners of creative material had tight control
over how it was distributed. Violating someone's copyright took a
major effort. A printing plant was needed to pirate a book, a factory
to bootleg an album.</LD>
<LD>   The Net changed all that, making casual infringement, unauthorized
borrowing and wholesale piracy effortless and pervasive. Copyright
holders are responding by cracking down on violators, who in other
circumstances might be customers.</LD>
<LD>   Into this messy and acid-edged situation comes Creative Commons, a
new nonprofit organization that will launch its first projects today.
Based at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society,
Creative Commons has a high-profile board and an ambitious mission.
The goal is to promote creativity and collaboration by developing new
forms of copyright while reinvigorating the ever-shrinking sphere of
copyright-free works: the public domain.</LD>
<TE>   "Using the copyright system, we will make a wider, richer public
domain for creators to build upon and individuals to share," said
Stanford law professor and Creative Commons Chairman Lawrence Lessig.
"Walt Disney built an empire from the riches of the public domain.
We'd like to support a hundred thousand more Walt Disneys."</TE>
<TE>   As a first step, Creative Commons has developed a group of
licenses that will allow copyright holders to surrender some rights
to works while keeping others.</TE>
<TE>   One license, for instance, allows people to copy or distribute a
work as long as they give the owner credit. Another allows a work to
be copied, distributed or displayed as long as it is for a
noncommercial purpose. A third license permits copying but forbids
using the work to make another, derivative work. (The licenses are
legal documents, although that doesn't guarantee that people will
honor them.)</TE>
<TE>   A license pioneer is Roger McGuinn, leader of '60s rock group the
Byrds and more recently a folk music enthusiast. He's licensing 80
songs through Creative Commons, giving the world permission to take
his work as long as all three of his licenses are respected.</TE>
<TE>   By encouraging free distribution and widespread sampling, McGuinn
might end up increasing his sales. It's an argument almost as old as
the Web; Creative Commons is merely offering tools to allow it to
happen on an easier, artist-sanctioned basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, the first group to use these licenses will mostly
be academics and hobbyists," said Executive Director Glenn Otis
Brown. "But I can imagine perfectly mainstream record companies
licensing things on parts of their Web site. In our wildest dreams,
in five years pretty much every kind of material will be licensed."</TE>
<TE>   That this will really happen, and that the material licensed will
be things worth looking at, reading or listening to, may seem
improbable. But then, so did the notion of mounting an effective
challenge to the constitutionality of the current copyright law,
which was the recent undertaking by several members of the Creative
Commons brain trust.</TE>
<TE>   The legal case arose out of the outrage felt by Eric Eldred, an
Internet publisher of material in the public domain, when Congress in
1998 extended copyright terms by 20 years. The result was that no new
material -- no Hemingway, no Gershwin -- will enter the public domain
until 2019.</TE>
<TE>   Lessig, then at Harvard, took Eldred as a client. He nursed the
case through two lower court defeats and an entirely unexpected
decision by the Supreme Court to review it. Oral arguments were in
October; a decision is due by the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Eldred is a member of the Creative Commons board. Other members
include computer science professor Hal Abelson of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Duke University law professor James Boyle
and former documentary filmmaker Eric Saltzman, all of them big guns
in the field of cyber law.</TE>
<TE>   If the Eldred case represents an attempt to short-circuit the
entertainment industry's desire to keep its old works under exclusive
control for an ever-lengthening amount of time, Creative Commons was
developed as an intellectual property conservancy through which
control would be shared, limited or nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of loosening the bounds of copyright isn't new. For
more than a decade, the Free Software Foundation has used for its own
programs and offered others a license that guarantees the freedom to
share and change software. O'Reilly &amp; Associates, a leading computer
manual publisher, uses the Web to publish a number of books under
open-publication licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the notion that creation confers ownership and that
ownership is practically eternal is embedded in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1978, copyright protection has been automatic on any new
work -- which has made it very hard to purposely free it. In
response, Creative Commons has developed what it is calling the
Founders' Copyright. A creator agrees to a contract with Creative
Commons to guarantee that a work will enter the public domain after
just 14 years, which was the span granted by the first copyright law
in 1790. O'Reilly said it will be the first to publish under these
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Another license puts work into the public domain immediately. One
of the first works to have a public domain license will be "The
Cluetrain Manifesto," an influential book on Internet marketing that
was published three years ago. It was a natural evolution,
considering that the text of "Cluetrain" was posted on the Web awhile
ago by the authors.</TE>
<TE>   "It continues to sell well in stores and on the Web," said one of
the book's four authors, Doc Searls. "Did having the whole text on
the Web help? I think so, but we can't tell."</TE>
<TE>   How much "Cluetrain," as well as the experiences of O'Reilly and
the Free Software Foundation, presages a wider movement toward
limited licensing or the public domain is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Critics already are wondering why a creator would donate anything
to the public domain beyond, for example, an unpublished or
unpublishable novel. Are people so altruistic as to create things for
free? "The same thing was said about the whole Internet a few years
ago," Eldred observed. "The existence of the Web is the answer."</TE>

<HD>Dole Given Deadline to Accept CEO's Bid</HD>
<DH>David Murdock's offer to buy the firm for $2.3 billion has
been rejected as too low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David H. Murdock, chairman and chief executive of Dole Foods Inc.,
has set Wednesday as the deadline for the world's largest producer of
fresh fruits and vegetables to accept his offer for the
three-quarters of the company he doesn't already own.</LD>
<LD>   Murdock has offered to buy 76% of the Westlake Village-based
company for about $2.3 billion. His offer of $29.50 a share has been
rejected by Dole's board as too low, but negotiations are continuing.
The deal also would include Murdock assuming about $1 billion of the
company's debt.</LD>
<LD>   If successful, the deal would give Murdock sole control of Dole,
freeing him from having to satisfy profit-hungry shareholders and
curry favor with Wall Street analysts.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think he likes outside involvement," said Heather Jones,
an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets. "He's the epitome of the
self-made man. He has always done things the way he wants to do them.
He's 79 years old, and he doesn't want to change things now."</TE>
<TE>   Since Murdock first made the bid in September, no competing offers
have surfaced. Dole's two main competitors, Chiquita Brands and Fresh
Del Monte Produce Inc., probably would face stiff regulatory
opposition in the United States and Europe if they tried to combine
with Dole. The deadline for Murdock's bid has been extended twice.</TE>
<TE>   Sole control would give the self-made billionaire the ability to
transfer cash from Dole to his other business ventures, something
that's prohibited as long as Dole remains public.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock did not respond to requests for an interview about the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's languishing stock has been trading below Murdock's offer.
Still, analysts believe Murdock will have to raise his bid to about
$34 per share to satisfy stockholders. On Friday, Dole shares closed
at $28.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the recent increased scrutiny of boards and CEOs, we
believe Murdock may have to increase his bid, as his offer clearly
benefits one large shareholder to the detriment of remaining
investors," Jones wrote in a September report.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Roepers, a vocal critic of the deal whose Atlantic
Investment Management Inc. owns 6% of Dole shares, says the stock has
been hurt by the "Murdock discount" -- an impression that he has run
Dole as a quasi-private company without due regard for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Dole, for instance, does not actively court financial analysts,
preferring to keep a low profile on Wall Street. A more aggressive
effort to tout the company could result in more demand for the stock
and more profits for investors, Roepers said.</TE>
<TE>   A key question for investors is whether Dole's shares will climb
on their own in the coming months, making it wiser to wait rather
than accept Murdock's offer.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Dole has bounced back from a number of problems,
including a worldwide banana glut, Hurricane Mitch and severe freezes
that hurt crops in California. The company has become a leader in the
packaged-salad business, which has surged as consumers seek
convenient, healthy foods.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves have helped bolster the bottom line. In the most recent
quarter, Dole reported net income of $14.7 million, compared with a
net loss of $94.8 million in the same quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the first nine months of 2002, Dole reported net income of
$137.8 million, compared with a net loss of $23.1 million for the
first nine months of 2001.</TE>

<HD>Farmers Bros. Protest Vote Recommended</HD>
<DH>Shareholders advised to oppose reelection of the chairman
and two other executives to the board of directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An influential shareholder advisory firm is asking stockholders to
vote against reelecting Farmer Bros. Chairman Roy F. Farmer and two
other executives to the Torrance-based coffee company's board of
directors.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises more than 950
institutional and corporate clients on corporate governance issues,
told shareholders to withhold votes for Farmer; his son Roy E.
Farmer, who is president of the company; and Guenter Berger, Farmer's
vice president of production.</LD>
<LD>   The Rockville, Md., advisory service objects to their reelection
because the executives failed to establish an independent nominating
committee for the board.</LD>
<TE>   Patrick McGurn, vice president and special counsel of ISS, said he
doesn't expect to throw the trio off Farmer Bros.' six-member board;
indeed there is no alternative slate and management has voting
control over 52% of the stock.</TE>
<TE>   But the company does not have enough independent directors to
provide the checks and balances for prudent corporate governance,
McGurn said, and the recommendation is the best way to send a
message.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. also is attracting criticism from another shareholder
advisory service, Investor Responsibility Research Center. The
Washington firm believes that only one Farmer Bros. director --
Glendale accountant John Merrell -- meets its standards of
independence, said Carol Bowie, the firm's director of governance
research services.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. executives did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   ISS gave its approval to the three remaining members of the
six-person board, but criticized two of them -- Merrell and John
Anglin -- for not holding stock in the company, which is a roaster
and seller of institutional coffee. Anglin, an attorney, is an
outside company counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. is mired in an increasingly bitter battle between its
longtime managers and a group of dissident family members and
institutional shareholders. The company, which has $200 million in
annual sales, plans to hold its annual stockholders meeting the day
after Christmas, a move dissidents claim was meant to limit
participation and hurt their longer-term efforts to elect independent
directors and to force Farmers to disclose more information about its
finances.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fight is over what Farmer Bros. should do with a
stockpile of $295 million in cash and investments, an amount
equivalent to about half of its total stock market value. The funds
represent about 70% of Farmer's corporate assets.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Mutual Advisors, which controls 9.6% of Farmer's stock,
has submitted a shareholder proposal that would force the company to
comply with the Investment Company Act, which has stricter disclosure
rules. Management has recommended a "no" vote on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Although ISS urged shareholders to vote against reelection of the
Farmers and Berger to the board, it supported management's views on
the shareholder proposal, saying it "appears to have exhibited
fiduciary responsibility in managing those reserves."</TE>
<TE>   ISS also noted that the company is returning an increasing amount
of cash to shareholders through dividends in recent years. It
calculated that the dividend per share has risen 7.5% annually since
1998 to $3.40 this year.</TE>
<TE>   However, the advisory service did offer a caveat, saying that as
an operating company, Farmer Bros. should look to reinvest the cash
in the business to improve "shareholder value."</TE>
<TE>   Management has voting control over 52% of the stock. But that
includes 12% of Farmer Bros. stock held in trust for dissident family
members, and a fight is likely over how those shares are voted.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros.' thinly traded shares closed Friday at $312 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>For a Price, Investors Can Get In on a Confidence</HD>
<DH>University of Michigan sells its market-moving survey of
consumer sentiment to insiders prior to public release.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Ward and Brendan Murray</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>For $4,650 a year, the University of Michigan will tip you to a
number that moves stock and bond markets.</LD>
<LD>   That's what the university charges J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., UBS
and 100 other firms to listen to a conference call as it discloses
its consumer-confidence index every month.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Michigan's consumer index is the only U.S.
economic indicator that's sold to insiders before the public sees it.
The tax-supported state university first sells the survey to those it
calls sponsors -- brokerages or companies that can turn their
advantage into a quick profit.</LD>
<TE>   "These numbers move markets, and only some people have access to
them," said Mercer Bullard, a former assistant chief counsel at the
Securities and Exchange Commission. "This is a serious regulatory
issue that undermines confidence in markets."</TE>
<TE>   In October, when the Michigan index fell more than traders
expected, the price on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped. A
trader on the conference call who immediately bought $10 million in
Treasuries, then sold as others reacted to the news, would have
profited by more than $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   A survey released Friday showed that confidence rose in December
to the highest level in four months. The preliminary sentiment index
rose to 87 from 84.2 in November. That suggested the economy may
accelerate next year, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell
more than a quarter of a point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount,
pushing its yield up about 4 percentage points to 4.06%.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan is "selling information so that traders
with a bigger pocketbook can take advantage of smaller traders," said
Robert Shiller, a Yale University professor and economist. "It's not
the kind of business that the ideal of the university suggests."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve, the Conference Board and more than a dozen
federal and nonprofit organizations release market-sensitive news
without charging for it. Unlike the University of Michigan, all take
steps to avoid selective disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York posts money-supply data under
an embargo in a secure area on its Web site. The Fed gives the news
media half an hour to digest the news before its scheduled release at
4:30 p.m. New York time on Thursdays.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't favor one group of investors or one audience over any
other," said Peter Bakstansky, the Fed's spokesman in New York. "The
first principles are principles of fairness."</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board, a private business group, publishes its own
confidence index on the last Tuesday of the month. The media are
given access to the information 30 minutes before its release at 10
a.m. EST, said Randall Poe, the nonprofit group's communications
director.</TE>
<TE>   "To release it instantly would be to give preference to whoever
got it first," he said. "It would be unfair. We operate under the
principle of trying to create an even playing field."</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management, a nonprofit trade group for
purchasing managers, issues a survey on business conditions through
Business Wire, an electronic news release service. It moves at 10
a.m. EST on the first business day of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure everybody gets it at the same time," said
Norbert Ore, head of the group's business survey committee. "Timing
is worth a good bit in the marketplace. There's an inherent advantage
in information somebody can glean about the economy or markets that
others don't have."</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan, by contrast, makes every effort to
selectively disclose its latest data. It excludes the media from its
list of subscribers and vows legal action against subscribers who
share reports, threatening to bar their access.</TE>
<TE>   The university's Institute for Social Research, which computes the
index from monthly consumer surveys, says expenses dictate its sales
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The subscriptions pay for the cost of the survey, but just
barely," said Richard Curtin, the survey's director since 1976. "By
keeping the data secret for a little while, we can earn some money to
keep the survey going."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the surveys cost $824,100, according to the institute's
budget figures. Its revenue from brokerages, companies researching
consumer-buying habits and government agencies totaled $989,500,
earning the institute a profit of $165,400.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan got $899 million in state and federal
funds for the fiscal year ending next June 30. Its mission statement
said such funds oblige it "to make available to the citizens of the
state and nation that portion of its specialized knowledge which
provides the necessary background for social decision."</TE>
<TE>   Still, university officials say there's no contradiction between
the university's obligations to the public and its sale, and
disclosure, to investors of specialized knowledge such as the
consumer index.</TE>
<TE>   "The research is enabled by the sponsors who fund it," Julie
Peterson, the university's vice president for media relations, said
in an e-mail statement. "Therefore, it seems appropriate that the
sponsors would have access to the research findings before they are
shared with the public more generally."</TE>
<TE>   University President Mary Sue Coleman didn't respond to repeated
phone calls and e-mails seeking comment about the fairness of the
sales policy.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after declining to answer questions from a reporter who
visited her office, Coleman said she was comfortable with the
university's position.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just not going to make her available for an interview,"
Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer surveys, the oldest in the country, have been
conducted since 1946 in Ann Arbor, Mich., the university's home.
Curtin employs four full-time researchers and 30 part-time workers
who telephone 500 households and ask questions about job prospects,
spending plans and personal finances in trying to gauge where the
economy is heading.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want a free, widely available survey should offer
alternative means of financing it, Curtin said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the institute guards the release of its news, the index
number still moves on newswires "within a minute" of the conference
call, Curtin said. "And I'm not talking a figurative minute -- I mean
a literal minute."</TE>
<TE>   The university doesn't let the news media subscribe to its survey,
but news services manage to listen to the conference calls and
distribute the information.</TE>
<TE>   That minute, however, is enough for traders to profit from bets
based on the conference call, usually held at 9:45 a.m. New York time
on the second and fourth Fridays of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "All our traders have to do is hit a button to put a bid or an
offer into the screens," said Stephen Stanley, senior economist at
RBS Greenwich Capital Markets Inc., which subscribes to the survey.
"If they have information that somebody on the other side of that
keyboard doesn't have, they can make a profitable trade in a matter
of a few seconds."</TE>
<TE>   The university's disclosure practices don't violate U.S.
securities laws, said Karl Groskaufmanis, a partner in Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, a Washington law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The information is getting into the market fairly quickly," he
said. "But the fairness issue is still there."</TE>
<TE>   Just how useful the Michigan survey is in divining the economy's
direction is an altogether different matter, according to some
economists.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in July that he
watches spending, not confidence, to judge consumer behavior. "Our
interest is actually what people do, not what they say," he said in
discussing the economy before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer confidence surveys are of minimal predictive value,"
said Alan Krueger, a Princeton University economist. "I wouldn't see
any economic harm if they were shut down if they couldn't raise funds
to release them in a more equitable and fair way."</TE>

<HD>The Next Wave? Surfing the Web at 35,000 Feet</HD>
<DH>Several airlines will test high-speed Net access to see how
much travelers are willing to pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Bergstein</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For many busy people, an airliner is one of the last places with
guaranteed down time, away from the tentacles of e-mail and requests
from the office.</LD>
<LD>   That's about to change.</LD>
<LD>   Several international carriers next year will begin offering
high-speed Internet access via satellite. For now, it's basically a
trial run so the airlines can figure out how much people are willing
to pay to get online with their own laptops at 35,000 feet.</LD>
<TE>   This toe-dipping comes as several companies stand ready to upgrade
airplanes with a range of improved communications systems, such as
giving passengers the means to send and receive e-mail and instant
messages at their seats.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. is set to debut its Connexion satellite broadband
service Jan. 15 on Lufthansa flights from Frankfurt, Germany, to
Washington-Dulles. Scandanavian Airlines System (SAS), British
Airways and Japan Airlines are slated to try it next.</TE>
<TE>   Lufthansa will offer the service free for three months; British
Airways plans to charge about $30 per flight.</TE>
<TE>   That price sounds about right to Rob Vollmer, 32, a principal in
Crosby-Vollmer International Communications, a Washington-based
public relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   Vollmer, who has flown 140,000 miles this year, does so much work
by e-mail that he sometimes feels compelled to surreptitiously check
messages during flights with a wireless hand-held device, though it's
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could do so legally for a fee, I'd jump at the opportunity,"
Vollmer said. "Going six to eight hours without the ability to send
or receive e-mail is a form of torture," he said, offering proof: He
once took an unnecessary flight from London to India because he
missed an e-mail saying that a meeting had been postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Connexion's service requires installing two antennas on the plane,
one to transmit data to satellites and one to receive data. A server
and routing system inside the plane relay signals to and from plug-in
ports at the seats or wireless networking cards in passengers'
laptops.</TE>
<TE>   The service promises speeds comparable to cable modems, with
downloads up to 1 megabit per second. Even if everyone on board
logged on at once, Connexion spokesman Terrance Scott said, the data
transfer rate would not be less than 56 kilobits per second,
comparable to dial-up.</TE>
<TE>   Connexion eventually could use voice-over-Internet technology to
let passengers make phone calls safely, Scott said. Mobile phones are
banned in flight out of fear they could disrupt navigational systems
and wreak havoc with cellular networks on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing won't disclose the cost of installing Connexion. But it is
considered far more expensive than simpler systems for planes that
store data on a server and periodically connect with ground networks
rather than maintaining a constant feed via satellite.</TE>
<TE>   One such option, JetConnect, a Verizon Communications Inc. system
that already is available on some Continental and United Airlines
flights, uses the same network as Verizon's Airfones, those expensive
handsets on seat backs.</TE>
<TE>   For $5.99 per flight, travelers who hook their computers to
JetConnect can play games, peruse certain Web pages that get updated
every 15 minutes and send and receive AOL, Yahoo and MSN instant
messages. Verizon plans to add e-mail in mid-2003.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Tenzing Communications Inc., which is backed by Boeing
rival Airbus, can provide e-mail access and short text messaging.
Cathay Pacific, Varig and Virgin Atlantic are customers;
Seattle-based Tenzing expects to sign several more in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Several airlines, notably American, Delta and United, said last
year that they would buy Connexion's service, but those plans
evaporated after the terrorist attacks when mere survivability became
paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some carriers are showing renewed interest in Internet
services in hopes they can generate incremental revenue, improve
customer loyalty and provide new perks in first and business class,
said Rob Brookler, spokesman for the World Airline Entertainment
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, several frequent fliers seem eager to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   Avi Steinlauf, a vice president at Edmunds.com, an autos Web site,
said he'd "easily pay up to $50 for broadband access on a
cross-country flight." Robert Brooker, head of ICLUBcentral Inc., a
Cambridge, Mass.-based software company, said $20 an hour "seems like
the right price point."</TE>
<TE>   Still, that sentiment might not be widespread. Tenzing is testing
real-time satellite Internet connections but expects the market to
lie in corporate jets rather than commercial aircraft, said Peter
Lemme, Tenzing's chief technical officer.</TE>
<TE>   Low-cost carrier JetBlue could offer Internet access relatively
easily by adapting equipment it uses to show live cable TV on flights
via satellite. But JetBlue isn't convinced the Web would be heavily
used.</TE>
<TE>   "People are much keener to watch `TV Land' than draft proposals or
write e-mails," JetBlue spokesman Gareth Edmondson-Jones said. "It's
always been very politically correct to say, 'Oh, I do all this work
on the plane,' but is that out of boredom? Wouldn't you rather have a
beer and watch ESPN?"</TE>

<HD>Educational Software Finds Itself at Back of Class for
Kids' Attention</HD>
<DH>With sales hurt by the Net and games, firms are turning to
other learning products.</DH>

<LD>A 7-year-old would rather:</LD>
<LD>   (a) blast aliens</LD>
<LD>   (b) rocket through space</LD>
<TE>   (c) learn multiplication</TE>
<TE>   Hint: The answer ain't (c).</TE>
<TE>   Though sales for the video game industry have hit record levels in
recent years, the market for children's educational software has
imploded.</TE>
<TE>   Once totaling half a billion dollars, children's educational
software sales in the United States shrank to $325 million last year.
This year, things have slowed even more. The volume of software sold
from January through October fell 28% compared with the same period
in 2001, according to market research firm NPD Techworld.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to the decline have been the spread of video games
and the rise of the Internet, both of which can offer more engrossing
experiences than most children's software can muster.</TE>
<TE>   A vicious price war has driven many companies out of business and
left survivors bleeding. Those that remained -- Knowledge Adventure,
Learning Co. and Broderbund -- have been purchased and pared back.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a giant forest fire that swept through the
educational software market," said Warren Buckleitner, editor of the
bimonthly Children's Software &amp; New Media Revue. "It's left some
opportunities, but it's also destroyed a number of brands. It's been
a very tough time."</TE>
<TE>   Not all is bleak. Industry watchers say the business is
reinventing itself by turning to other products that boast more
computing power than early PCs. For example, educational toys such as
Emeryville, Calif.-based LeapFrog Enterprises Inc.'s LeapPad are hot
sellers as holiday gifts this year. Veterans of the business also are
sneaking their wares onto the Internet and into game consoles.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot: Although packaged software as parents know it is
fading, the sector may again thrive in other, less obvious ways.</TE>
<TE>   The industry began in 1980, when educational psychologist Ann
Piestrup founded Learning Co. in a Portola Valley apartment using
grants from the National Institute of Education, the National Science
Foundation and the Apple Education Foundation. The result was "Reader
Rabbit," a series introduced in 1984 that ultimately sold more than
25 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time in a Palos Verdes schoolhouse, Jan Davidson
introduced her students to "Math Blaster," a software program that
she and a programmer created to run on the Apple II computer. It was
so successful that parents clamored to buy copies.</TE>
<TE>   So, in 1984 she founded Davidson &amp; Associates Inc. to publish and
sell her software.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, publishing meant putting floppies into sandwich
bags with labels on them," Davidson said.</TE>
<TE>   Little did she know that her company would help define the
children's educational software market and become an industry
powerhouse. In 1989, she recruited her husband, Bob, then a senior
executive of a major construction company. The two of them took the
company public in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, there was a lot of optimism," said Sarina Simon, who
worked with various publishers, including Burbank-based Walt Disney
Co.'s Disney Interactive. "Just about everyone you met was starting a
new business and developing new titles. People who got into the
industry were Peace Corps types who believed they could make
educational products that would be brought alive by technology."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, CUC International Inc., which later merged with HFS Inc.
to form Cendant Corp., acquired Davidson &amp; Associates for $1.15
billion as part of a consolidation wave that swept the industry. Also
in 1996, CUC gobbled up Bellevue, Wash.-based Sierra On-Line Inc. and
Knowledge Adventure, an educational software company founded by
entrepreneur Bill Gross in La Crescenta.</TE>
<TE>   Softkey International  had bought Learning Co. a year earlier. And
in 1998, it acquired Mindscape and Broderbund.</TE>
<TE>   A price war, which had been bubbling up during the consolidation
phase, broke out in full force in 1998 and 1999. Software titles that
had been sold in specialized computer shops for $50 started to be
sold for $20 or less in warehouse stores where customers demanded
rock-bottom prices.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1999, demand was exceedingly high because the rebates were so
high," said Rosemary Yates, who then worked at Mindscape and is
senior vice president of Riverdeep, a Dublin, Ireland-based
educational publisher. "Someone would buy a $99 product but get $90
off."</TE>
<TE>   The bruising price competition weeded out small publishers and
left big ones bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Learning Co., for example, was sold to El Segundo-based Mattel
Inc. in 1999 for $3.5 billion. Soon after, the company started to
hemorrhage $1 million a day and its failure ranked high among the
reasons that Mattel CEO Jill Barad was forced from the company in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel sold the unit to turnaround specialist Gores Technology
Group of Los Angeles, which eventually paid $27.3 million for the
company. After focusing on core brands, trimming costs and putting in
rigorous procedures for funding new projects, Gores sold the company
to Riverdeep in August for $60 million in debt and stock.</TE>
<TE>   The war had other casualties. Many of the innovators who had
helped shape the industry left.</TE>
<TE>   "The price points were absolutely brutal," said Ariella Lehrer,
chief executive of Hollywood-based Legacy Interactive, which
published its last educational title in 1999 and moved on to games.
"At $20, you couldn't afford to put the same amount of money into
development. The economics were just not feasible."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, video games began selling in bigger volume and
commanding ever higher prices. That meant game developers could
afford to spend millions on titles while educational developers had
to make do with tens, or at best hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
As a result, educational software often paled in comparison with
games.</TE>
<TE>   Kids flocked to games, particularly those for the PlayStation
introduced in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be a lot more innovation in software," said Mark
Schlichting, who developed "Living Books," a series published by
Broderbund that sold more than 3 million copies. "Now budgets are
down, and the quality is often not strong."</TE>
<TE>   Down too are the number of titles being published. Buckleitner,
whose publication tracks and reviews kids' software, estimates that
350 educational titles will be introduced this year, down 40% from
last year. By comparison, more than 1,200 games were published for
PCs and consoles this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those educational titles land in so-called software
junkyards, where they sell for as little as $4.99, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is at an all-time low right now," Buckleitner said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are signs that kids' educational software may be
staging a modest comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who left the industry in the late 1990s founded
companies that try to marry technology and learning. Former Davidson
executives John Sosoko and Brooke Abercrombie left in 1996 to launch
Neurosmith in Long Beach. They introduced their first product, Music
Blocks, in 1999. Designed to teach kids about music, the $69 toy has
more computational power than the $3,000 Apple II computer that
Davidson first used in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "With cheaper chips, you're seeing software people do what they've
always wanted to do -- use technology to make a difference,"
Abercrombie said.</TE>
<TE>   Schlichting, who left Broderbund in 1996, has started NoodleWorks
in Alameda. His software sits in a device called the NoodlePad, which
lets kids create and tell stories.</TE>
<TE>   And Simon has started a subscription-based educational Web site at
kidsedge.com with more than 100 learning activities.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, the magic of software was that it could
respond to the child. It could adjust to how quickly the child was
learning," Simon said. "I can do the same thing on the Internet. Only
now, I can give both the child and the parents much more feedback. So
you have a deeper, more dynamic involvement in the learning process."</TE>
<TE>   The surviving companies have found similar ways to cope.
Educational publishers are putting their classic titles on hand-held
devices, game consoles and outlets other than just PCs. In September,
for example, Scholastic Inc. put its 11-year-old "I Spy" PC software
franchise on Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy Advance hand-held console.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales generated at retail stores continue to fall for
Learning Co., sales from direct-mail catalogs are growing, and the
business is now profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "We see growth opportunities that will extend our brand into other
areas," said Yates, who estimates that sales of consumer children's
software will grow in the "high single digits" next year. "We don't
call ourselves just software companies anymore. We're looking to
multiple channels, so our outlook is very strong."</TE>

<HD>2 French Banks Said to Be Near Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French bank Credit Agricole and rival Credit Lyonnais are on the
verge of a $20-billion merger that would form one of the biggest
financial institutions in Europe, according to published reports.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, which could come as soon as today, would follow
a weekend of talks on creating a bank with more than $32.4 billion in
market value and a 28% share of France's market for retail banking.
Such a move would end a four-week tussle between Credit Agricole and
rival suitor BNP Paribas for control of Credit Lyonnais.</LD>
<LD>   Credit Agricole is set to offer about $57 a share in cash and
stock for Credit Lyonnais, the fourth-largest listed bank in France,
according to a Dow Jones Newswires report.</LD>
<TE>   Credit Agricole Chairman Rene Carron and Chief Executive Jean
Laurent spent much of the weekend in meetings in a bid to persuade
the farm bank's powerful regional executives to support the bid.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Agricole's board of directors, which met with regional
executives, Sunday gave a green light to the plan, Dow Jones
Newswires reported. The report said Credit Lyonnais directors also
met Sunday to discuss the move.</TE>
<TE>   Several attempts by Associated Press to reach a Credit Lyonnais
spokesman were not successful.</TE>
<TE>   Marie-Aude Dubanchet, a spokeswoman for Credit Agricole, declined
to comment about the merger plan to AP, but she acknowledged that the
company's board had met Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, BNP Paribas said it wouldn't stand in the way of a
friendly merger between its two rivals as long as it was acceptable
to Credit Lyonnais' shareholders and its 40,000 workers. BNP Paribas
has built up a 16.2% stake in Credit Lyonnais.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Agricole has been Credit Lyonnais' top shareholder for more
than three years, and it is expected to propose a plan that would see
large parts of their businesses merged. Credit Agricole currently
owns 17.4% of Credit Lyonnais.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Agricole has been in merger talks with Credit Lyonnais
since Credit Lyonnais was privatized in mid-1999, but the two sides
failed to come to an agreement -- most recently falling out over who
would take top management slots in a newly merged bank.</TE>
<TE>   Relations have thawed in recent weeks as Credit Lyonnais was faced
with a choice between negotiating a merger deal with Credit Agricole
or joining BNP Paribas.</TE>

<HD>Union's Play for Music Videos</HD>
<DH>Blue-collar labor group is said to be nearing a contract to
represent crews even as the number of productions is dropping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood's blue-collar trade union, long a power in film and
television production, is about to become a player in the music
business.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees are nearing a contract that would provide union benefits to
members who work on music video crews, according to people familiar
with the proposed deal.</LD>
<LD>   Talks between IATSE and the Music Video Production Assn., a Los
Angeles-based trade group, could result in an agreement as early as
this week. The contract would allow the union to negotiate wages and
provide pension and health benefits to music video crews for the
first time since MTV, now owned by Viacom Inc., turned the
mini-movies into a promotional power two decades ago.</LD>
<TE>   The IATSE organizing drive comes even as music video production --
hurt by weak record sales and a spate of filming in foreign locales
-- has been dropping for the first time in the medium's freewheeling
history. Many record executives and video producers fear that the
union campaign will jack up production costs just as they face
pressure to slash expenses amid an 11% drop in album sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a struggle enough to get the money onto the screen," said
Jim Gable, co-owner of Graying &amp; Balding Inc., which has filmed
videos for such acts as John Mayer and Josh Groban. "Any additional
labor costs could take away from that. You could see less special
effects, equipment. It'll be reflected in the finished product."</TE>
<TE>   IATSE officials declined to comment on the negotiations, which
have been underway since October.</TE>
<TE>   The union's push to organize video crews follows its successful
expansion in the last decade to cover TV commercial crews, low-budget
films and trade shows. Under President Thomas C. Short, IATSE has
increased its membership by about two-thirds during the last eight
years, to more than 100,000 members in the U.S. and Canada. An
estimated 25,000 people work on music videos, though many also work
on commercials and other productions.</TE>
<TE>   IATSE organizers shocked the music industry this summer when they
appeared on the Los Angeles set of a video for rap star LL Cool J's
"Luv U Better" and demanded that a producer sign a union contract.
When the producer refused, the organizers persuaded most crew members
to walk off the set, delaying the shoot for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Video producers agreed to discuss a possible deal rather than risk
additional shutdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides understand the economic climate of the music business
right now. And both sides know the importance of working together to
keep work in L.A.," said Sam Aslanian, a negotiator for the Music
Video Production Assn. and vice president of video production
powerhouse DNA Inc., which has handled videos for Justin Timberlake
and Jennifer Lopez. "We are hoping to come up with a contract that
works for the peculiar nature of music video production."</TE>
<TE>   The making of music videos has been heavily concentrated in
Southern California. But the total number of days spent shooting
music videos on the streets of Los Angeles has plummeted 18% this
year to 1,258. That follows a 22% drop last year -- the first since
at least 1993, the earliest year for which statistics are posted by
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., a film permitting
agency.</TE>
<TE>   The drop-off occurred at least in part because labels started
sending productions to Australia and other nations to lower costs.
Record executives said they expect to export more work even if a
union deal leaves production expenses at current levels.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard about this, I thought I was going to have to
get an apartment in Sydney," one record label video supervisor said
of the union campaign. "They're not out for blood. But that doesn't
mean I'm going to stay in America."</TE>
<TE>   Some label executives say that, in many ways, IATSE's organizing
effort comes too late.</TE>
<TE>   MTV has steadily trimmed its video playlist in favor of other
programming, while many labels this year have cut video budgets and
commissioned fewer shoots. For example, Universal's Interscope Geffen
A&amp;M label, home to Sheryl Crow and U2, has released 53 videos this
year, down from 70 a year earlier, according to the CVC Report, an
industry magazine. One record executive said his label had slashed
the average video budget this year by 50%, to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Labor experts said IATSE held off on claiming the music video
business until now largely because officials believed the nature of
the work made it impossible to organize workers. Crews flit from one
production house to the next, and video shoots typically run a day or
two.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, Hollywood unions have been scrambling to
shore up their pension and health funds with new sources of money to
make up for film and TV work that has been lost to Canada, Mexico and
other countries. Currently, music video crew members have no uniform
pension and health coverage, even though they may be receiving
benefits from work on other unionized productions such as
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "Had they done this four years ago, it would have been a lot more
successful," one label executive said of the contract talks. "We were
making million-dollar videos and they would've made a lot of money.
Now, I don't see the day when we make million-dollar videos coming
back."</TE>

and a movie studio.</LD>
<LD>   Applied Micro Circuits Corp., Conexant Corp. and Vitesse
Semiconductor Corp., all based in Southern California, are among the
computer chip makers to be booted from the index, which tracks the
biggest non-financial Nasdaq issues.</LD>
<LD>   Companies to be added include Ross Stores Inc., a Newark,
Calif.-based discount retailer; First Health Group Corp., an
Illinois-based provider of health benefits to large U.S. companies;
and Pixar Inc., the Emeryville, Calif.-based animation studio that
made "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<TE>   About $30 billion is invested in funds tied to the Nasdaq 100,
mostly through an exchange-traded fund known as the Triple-Q for its
stock symbol, QQQ.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has typically reshuffled the index's membership at the end
of each year, generally replacing stocks that no longer rank among
the 100 largest Nasdaq issues by market value (stock price multiplied
by number of shares outstanding).</TE>
<TE>   With the collapse of the technology sector since 2000, fewer tech
companies make the index's cutoff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real reflection of what's going on in the market," said
Mike Byrum, a money manager with Rydex Global Advisors, which
oversees $6 billion. "Tech has been diminishing and there have been
some other various industries creeping into the index."</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the companies to be dropped this year are chip-related.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a decrease in tech and an increase in industrial and
retail companies," said John Jacobs, chief executive of Nasdaq
Financial Products.</TE>
<TE>   As the index is currently configured, technology and
telecommunications shares account for 76% of its value, down from 89%
in March 2000, when the tech sector peaked.</TE>
<TE>   The reshuffling will lower computer-related stocks' weight in the
index by about 3.5 percentage points, based on an earlier estimate by
Nicholas Gulden, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, it's become less of a proxy" for technology
stocks, Gulden said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes will take effect at the opening of trading Dec. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Shares that are added to the index can get a lift, at least
temporarily, as they are purchased by the index funds that track
them. Likewise, deleted stocks may face downward pressure as index
funds sell them.</TE>
<TE>   The overhaul matches the biggest previous shake-up in the
17-year-old index. In 1999, there also were 15 changes, as Internet
stocks were rocketing in popularity and market value.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in the Triple-Q has averaged more than 90 million shares a
day this year, exceeding the 79.5-million average for shares of San
Jose-based Cisco Systems Inc., the most active stock of a single
company.</TE>
<TE>   The QQQs are "the instrument of choice for most institutional
investors seeking short-term technology exposure," Gulden said.</TE>
<TE>   But the reduction in technology shares' weighting in the index has
prompted some investors to stop trading the QQQs.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago, we traded the Qs and used them for hedging
purposes" as a proxy for computer-related stocks, said Dodge Dorland,
chief investment officer at Landor Investment Management. Now, "we
use it more as an indicator to identify the direction of tech
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp.; Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Intel Corp.; and San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. are the Nasdaq 100's
three biggest members, accounting for 23.2% of the index.</TE>
<TE>   Under new rules adopted in October, Nasdaq plans to change the
index's lineup more frequently. Starting in 2003, index members may
be removed throughout the year if their market value is less than
0.1% of the index at the end of two consecutive months.</TE>
<TE>   Besides San Diego-based Applied Micro Circuits, Newport
Beach-based Conexant and Camarillo-based Vitesse, the other stocks to
be removed from the index are:</TE>
<TE>   Abgenix Inc.; Andrx Group; Atmel Corp.; Charter Communications
Inc.; Cytyc Corp.; Integrated Device Technology Inc.; ImClone Systems
Inc.; I2 Technologies Inc.; PMC-Sierra Inc.; Protein Design Labs
Inc.; Rational Software Corp.; and Sepracor Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ross, First Health and Pixar, the stocks that will
be added are:</TE>
<TE>   American Power Conversion Corp.; Dentsply International Inc.;
Expeditors International of Washington Inc.; Fastenal Co.; Gentex
Corp.; Lamar Advertising Co.; Patterson-UTI Energy Inc.; Petsmart
Inc.; C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.; Ryanair Holdings; Henry Shein

<HD>Taiwan's Chunghwa Back on Auction Block</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taiwan's government today will try for the fifth time this year to
auction a stake in Chunghwa Telecom Co. to help plug a budget
deficit. Investors predict another flop.</LD>
<LD>   The problem: The government wants to sell 13.5% of the island's
biggest phone company at higher than market value.</LD>
<LD>   The government is seeking institutional or strategic investors to
buy 1.3 billion shares at a minimum price of $1.84 billion. That's
$1.42 a share, 1.7% more than the average price in the last six
months and 1.4% above the closing price on Dec. 13. At the last
auction on July 1, no bidders appeared.</LD>
<TE>   The government needs to sell Chunghwa and other state-owned assets
to help bridge an expected $8.37-billion budget deficit and refinance
record national debt.</TE>

<HD>Key Economic Indicators Expected</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors and others will be watching for a number of indicators on
the economic front this week, including the consumer price index, a
closely followed measure of inflation.</LD>
<LD>   The overall November CPI, which will be released Tuesday, is
expected to rise 0.1% from October. Core CPI, excluding volatile food
and energy, is forecast to rise 0.2%, according to economists polled
by Reuters.</LD>
<LD>   Housing starts also are on Tuesday's data calendar. Home
construction is expected to have risen in November.</LD>
<TE>   Construction starts of new homes rose 4.8% to a 1.68-million
annual rate, Commerce Department statistics will probably show</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, manufacturing numbers are expected to be stronger as
the U.S. economy builds strength heading into 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial production probably increased 0.2%, the first rise
since July, economists say the Federal Reserve is expected to report
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy,
have been driving the recovery. Their borrowing costs have declined
as Fed officials have kept the benchmark interest rate target at a
41-year low of 1.25% since Nov. 6. Personal incomes after taxes have
increased 6.8% since the end of last year. Americans are refinancing
their houses and are getting more bang for their buck because of low
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "For the consumer, what's not to like?" asked James Paulsen, who
oversees $110 billion as chief investment officer for Wells Capital
Management in Minneapolis. "They have rising real wages, they go to
the store and everything's on sale, their refi broker just saved them
$200 a month and the Fed just lowered rates."</TE>
<TE>   The economy, he said, is "going to improve quite a bit next year."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Conference Board will issue its index of leading
economic indicators, which probably rose in November by 0.6%, the
most in six months. The gauge is designed to project the direction of
the economy over the next three to six months and was unchanged in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Friday will see the final revision of the nation's gross domestic
product. Analysts forecast that the economy expanded at a 4% rate in
the third quarter. That would be the same as the government reported
last month.</TE>

<HD>Judge Postpones Auditor's Sentencing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has postponed the sentencing of Arthur Andersen's
former top Enron Corp. auditor for the third time.</LD>
<LD>   David B. Duncan, who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in
April for instructing his Enron audit staff to destroy unneeded
documents before the energy giant failed last year, will be sentenced
May 16, rather than Jan. 3.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in
Houston to postpone the sentencing so they could continue
interviewing Duncan as their investigation into Enron and Andersen
continues. Duncan's cooperation is a condition of his plea deal.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan had previously been scheduled to be sentenced in August and
then October before the January date was set.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's plea was the first to emerge from the Justice
Department's investigation of Enron's collapse and Andersen's role in
it. Andersen was convicted in June of obstruction after a six-week
trial that included 72 hours of jury deliberations spread over 10
days.</TE>

<HD>Prime Time for Earnings Outlooks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street is gearing up for "confession season," as companies use
the week before Christmas to detail their New Year's expectations.
But investors hope it won't spell a stocking full of coal for their
portfolios.</LD>
<LD>   It's prime time for companies to issue earnings outlooks, just
before the traditionally slow holiday week.</LD>
<LD>   It may not be Christmas cheer. Analysts expect fourth-quarter
earnings at companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to rise 14.9% from
the year-ago period, according to market researcher Thomson First
Call. That's down from expectations of a 19.9% climb at the beginning
of October.</LD>
<TE>   So far, about 1,272 companies have offered their outlooks for the
fourth quarter, according to Thomson First Call. Of that, about 43%
have warned they will miss analysts' targets, while about 330, or
26%, have forecast a better fourth quarter than Wall Street had
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   For the last week, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average and
the broader S&amp;P 500 each slipped 2.5%. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index dropped 4.2%.</TE>
<TE>   With little more than two weeks left in the year, the Dow is down
16%, Nasdaq is off 30% and the S&amp;P 500 is down 23%.</TE>
<TE>   Market watchers are keeping a close eye on four of Wall Street's
biggest banks -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Lehman
Bros. Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. -- which report fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings this week.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts expect the banks to post improved results. But
that's partly because their year-ago fiscal fourth quarter included a
four-day U.S. stock market shutdown after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<HD>Strike May Push Price of Crude Oil Above $30</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Failure to resolve the strike that has crippled Venezuela's oil
industry may push crude oil prices above $30, oil analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Prices rose 5.6% to $28.44 a barrel in New York last week.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez rejected the Bush administration's
call Friday for "early elections." Hundreds of thousands demonstrated
in Caracas over the weekend, demanding that Chavez resign or hold
elections by the end of March.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of war in Iraq if Saddam Hussein is shown to be
hiding weapons of mass destruction adds to concerns about a supply
crisis, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   The strikers have paralyzed oil exports by Venezuela, which was
shipping about 2.4 million barrels a day, half to the U.S., before
the strike began Dec. 2. Venezuela this year provided 13% of U.S. oil
imports.</TE>
<TE>   "The only region that could make up for the Venezuelan oil is the
Persian Gulf," said Sarah Emerson, managing director of Energy
Security Analysis Inc., a consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   It takes six to eight weeks for Persian Gulf cargoes to get to
North America versus a week from Venezuela, Emerson said.</TE>
<TE>   To make up for missing Venezuelan oil, other members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may be able to
boost daily output by 4.6 million barrels above last month's levels,
according to Bloomberg estimates of capacity available within 30
days.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts attribute most of the gain in oil prices of the
last two weeks to the Venezuelan strike, oil touched $30.83 on Oct.
1, its highest level in 19 months, on concern that a conflict with
Iraq was imminent. Prices dropped as low as $25.19 in mid-November as
that threat eased.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. refiners were counting on stable Venezuelan shipments should
a war in Iraq disrupt Persian Gulf exports.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline futures have risen 14% to 83.95 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange during the two-week strike. The closing
price Friday was the highest since Oct. 31. The futures were up 13%
last week, the biggest weekly gain since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Heating oil futures have risen 7.7% during the strike to 81.56
cents a gallon in New York, the highest closing price since Oct. 1.</TE>

<HD>Rawlings Shareholder Boosts Bid</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>LIVONIA, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Rawlings Sporting Goods' largest shareholder Sunday bumped up his
offer to acquire the company to $69.1 million, or $8.50 a share in
cash, hoping to gain the upper hand in a bidding war for the baseball
equipment maker.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Gilbert, who owns a nearly 15% stake in Rawlings, also said
he was removing his request for a diligence review of the company's
books to expedite a transaction.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Los Angeles-based ski and snowboard maker K2 Inc.
confirmed to The Times that it has been in talks since November to
acquire the 115-year-old Rawlings. Terms were not disclosed, but it
was believed to be an all-stock offer.</LD>
<TE>   Gilbert indicated in a statement that he was raising his previous
offer of $8 a share because he believes that K2 doesn't have the
financial wherewithal to enact measures needed to improve Rawlings'
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "As the company's largest shareholder, I am very concerned that
the company's contemplated merger with K2 will do nothing to effect
the necessary improvement measures, and in fact may exacerbate the
existing problems, because K2 is a company that is still attempting
to repair itself," Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither K2 nor Rawlings officials were available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fenton, Mo.-based Rawlings is one of the nation's oldest suppliers
of baseball gloves and equipment and is one of the most recognizable
brand names in sporting goods. But the company, which went public in
1994, has seen little growth.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings shares were unchanged Friday at $8.18 on Nasdaq. K2
shares closed at $9.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Shoppers Focus on Bargains</HD>
<DH>Worried retailers are pinning their hopes on a last-minute
surge to boost lackluster sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne D'Innocenzio</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With a week and a half until Christmas, shoppers jammed malls over
the weekend, snapping up bargains on clothing and electronics.</LD>
<LD>   Still, jitters about jobs and the economy damped sales,
frustrating merchants who had been counting on a big pickup following
lackluster shopping after the Thanksgiving weekend.</LD>
<LD>   That means there will be more pressure on retailers in the final
stretch to meet their already modest sales goals for the holiday
season.</LD>
<TE>   "This week is going to be a big battle to get consumers to spend,"
said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, based in
Charleston, S.C., noting that sales on Saturday and Sunday, though
solid, still fell short of expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers were being choosy with a focus on bargains.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still buying, but are more aware of prices," said
Amanda Loughry, a store manager at Pier 1 Imports in Towson, Md.</TE>
<TE>   She said small gifts already wrapped with netting and ribbon
marked down slightly to $10 and $5 were selling quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Merchants are finding themselves in the same spot they were a year
ago, dependent on late buying to lift sales in a sluggish season.
Retailers got a last-minute reprieve in 2001, but there is no
guarantee that will happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Michael P. Niemira, vice president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
believes that if the last-minute spending surge doesn't meet
expectations, sales will fall below the 2% same-store sales gain
expected for the November-December period. Same-store sales -- those
at stores open at least a year -- are considered the best indicator
of a retailer's health.</TE>
<TE>   Madison Riley, principal at retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon
Associates, already is lowering his estimate for the holiday season,
saying same-store sales gains will be in the 2% to 3% range, instead
of the 2% to 4% range.</TE>
<TE>   Major stores were scheduled to report their weekly results,
including sales from this weekend, today.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, online sales, which peaked Thursday at $288 million,
showed a less dramatic decline than expected. They rose 73% on
Saturday to $263 million from the same time a year ago, reported
ComScore Networks. The figures exclude travel sales, such as airline
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   At least one mall operator -- Taubman Centers Inc. -- reported a
strong uptick in sales.</TE>
<TE>   "We are definitely pleased with traffic and sales," said Karen
MacDonald, spokeswoman at Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based Taubman,
which operates 31 malls in 13 states, including the Beverly Center in
Los Angeles. A survey of about one-third of the company's mall
centers reported an increase of low to mid single digits this
weekend, compared with a year ago, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Williams, a company spokesman at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said,
"We are pleased with what we are seeing in the stores."</TE>
<TE>   The sluggish economy has damped sales even at Wal-Mart, which said
last week that same-store sales gain for December will be at the low
end of the company's 3% to 5% range.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Garofalo of Beachwood, N.J., who was shopping at the Ocean
County Mall in Toms River, N.J., said, "I'll rein in the spending"
until the recession passes.</TE>

<HD>Univision Deal Said to Be Close to U.S. Approval</HD>
<DH>A finding that Spanish-language TV, radio do not compete
for same audience may speed clearance for acquisition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds and Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department appeared poised to approve Univision
Communications Inc.'s planned $2-billion acquisition of Hispanic
Broadcasting Corp. after setting aside a key potential obstacle,
according to sources close to the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department antitrust officials have decided that
Spanish-language TV and Spanish-language radio stations don't compete
for the same audience and advertising dollars, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   But sources close to the situation stressed that the regulatory
review is not complete. Antitrust officials are still examining
Univision's ownership role in another Spanish-language media firm.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the finding could expedite clearance of the deal, legal
experts said. Univision executives told analysts last week that they
expected the transaction to close in the first quarter of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Univision and Hispanic Broadcasting officials declined to comment
on the review Sunday. A Justice Department spokesperson did not
return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Univision runs the nation's biggest
Spanish-language TV network. Dallas-based Hispanic Broadcasting owns
55 radio stations in the United States, making it the biggest
Spanish-language radio broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department finding that Spanish-language TV and
Spanish-language radio constituted a single market probably would
have nixed the deal. The concern would have been that the combined
company would have too large a share of the Spanish-language audience
and advertising dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals estimate the combined company would capture more than
two-thirds of all Spanish-language ad dollars in the top 10 U.S.
markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Univision contends that it is part of the overall media market
and jockeys for advertising dollars alongside such giants as Viacom
Inc. and Walt Disney Co., each of which owns television networks,
radio stations and other assets.</TE>
<TE>   Federal approval would allow Univision to become an even bigger
Spanish-language behemoth. The company, which controls more than 70%
of the U.S. Spanish-language TV market, has expanded into Internet
ventures and the music business.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also would be considered a victory for Clear Channel
Communications, the nation's biggest radio broadcaster. Clear Channel
would trade its 26% stake in Hispanic Broadcasting for an 8% share of
fast-growing Univision.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Clear Channel, in seeking federal approval to purchase
radio stations in other cases, has contended that radio and
television do compete against each other, saying its stations "face
vigorous competition for advertising revenues from all media."</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department's decision in the Univision review
keeps with its long-held view that radio and television compete for
different kinds of advertising, and thus are distinct markets.</TE>
<TE>   In reviewing Spanish-language media, "it is easier to make the
case that there's an objectionable consolidation," said Vincent
Pepper, a Washington communications attorney who has followed the
review. "For people who want to reach the Spanish-speaking audience,
there is a more-defined market. But I'm not surprised" by the Justice
Department decision, he said. "I don't think they have an appetite
for taking this one on."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the decision, sources said, the regulatory review is
continuing. One key issue that remains is Univision's 31% ownership
of Santa Monica-based Entravision Communications, which owns 38
Spanish-language radio stations that compete with Hispanic
Broadcasting's outlets in several markets, including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Univision probably will have to sell several radio stations, most
likely those in Los Angeles and Dallas, to win the approval of the
Federal Communications Commission, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Univision executives have said the company would convert its
voting stock in Entravision into nonvoting shares if it wins
regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed merger, announced in June, calls for Univision to
exchange 0.85 share for each of Hispanic Broadcasting's shares.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Univision shares fell 61 cents to $25.79. The shares
are down 30% over the last year. Hispanic Broadcasting shares closed
down 40 cents at $21.60, off about 10% this year. Both stocks trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Fish Farms' Ugly Underside</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That bargain hunk of salmon you're about to fork into is 50% higher
in fat than the fish you used to eat, but lower in healthful omega-3
fatty acids. It's probably got more PCBs and other toxins and gets
its rich coral hue from an artificial colorant that's been linked to
retinal damage in humans.</LD>
<LD>   Even more unappetizing, though, is what the salmon farming
industry is doing to the marine environment, especially on the
western coast of Canada, as Times reporter Kenneth R. Weiss revealed
in a recent story. Farms of domesticated Atlantic salmon pollute
pristine coastal waters, spread disease to wild fish and consume huge
amounts of seafood, and hundreds of thousands of their fish escape
from netted pens into the wild, where they endanger both ocean and
river wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   So what's so attractive about farm-raised salmon, aside from
synthetic rosiness? Low prices. Those prices, though, don't reflect
the actual cost of salmon farming. An independent inquiry last year
in Canada found that salmon farming was hurting the wild-fishing
industry and Indians who depend on a clean environment for foods
important to their diets.</LD>
<TE>   On top of that is the cost that the public will have to suffer if
massive eradication efforts are needed to cull domesticated salmon
from wild habitat. Already, escaped fish have produced young in
Canadian rivers where wild salmon spawn. Norway, the biggest salmon
producer, had to poison its rivers to kill parasites from farmed fish
that spread to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   An industry spokeswoman agreed that salmon farming had been an
environmental nightmare. Many farms are responding, she said, with
better pens, more efficient use of food and relocation to coastal
areas far from wild-salmon runs and marine mammal hangouts. She
didn't blame the customers who refused to buy farmed salmon because
of the damage the farms caused; the industry will have to reform to
gain their trust. Given the global nature of salmon farming, though,
and the dearth of regulations on a growing industry, such change will
come slowly, if not disastrously late -- unless consumers demand it.</TE>
<TE>   It won't require that consumers forswear salmon. All that's needed
is that they be smart and demanding. The necessary information can be
had with the help of three Web sites. The Monterey Bay Aquarium
offers a quick reference list of eco-safe and environmentally
unfriendly seafood choices at
www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_regional.asp. More specialized
lists are available from the National Audubon Society,
www.magazine.audubon.org/seafood/guide/, and the Marine Stewardship
Council, www.msc.org.  At these sites, salmon lovers will learn that
Alaskan wild salmon is a better environmental choice than farmed
salmon and that if the industry cleans up its act, farmed salmon will
make the A-list.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how consumer demand led the tuna industry to back off
from using nets that trapped dolphins? The public must be as vigilant
about incidental damage to marine and river wildlife from aquatic
farming.</TE>

<HD>Bolstering Arab Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a group of Arab intellectuals concluded this summer that their
nations were falling behind because of a lack of schools, political
freedom and opportunities for women, their report seemed to fall into
a wilderness of silence. Last week it turned out that Washington had
its ears open after all.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Friday said the United
States would "broaden its approach to the region" and help reform
economic, political and educational systems. The initial money he
promised -- $29 million -- isn't much by foreign aid standards and
the details of the program are sketchy, but the initiative is a good
one. There is no guarantee that providing schools for children and
jobs for adults will stop suicide bombings, but giving people the
hope of a better future is one way to undercut terrorist groups'
recruitment.</LD>
<LD>   The best prospect for Middle East peace remains an end to the
killing of Israelis and Palestinians, the establishment of a
Palestinian state and an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza. Powell will work on those problems this week, when he meets
with diplomats from other nations who are trying to bring the
Palestinians and Israelis together.</LD>
<TE>   Powell said the program for the Middle East would include
scholarships to keep girls in school and expand literacy for girls
and women. The United Nations-sponsored report by Arab scholars
concluded that the region was "largely depriving itself of the
creativity and productivity of half its citizens" because of high
illiteracy rates and fewer women in the workforce than any other
region in the world. The report said where education was available,
often only the better-off could afford it, increasing the gap between
rich and poor rather than offering a means of climbing the economic
and social ladder.</TE>
<TE>   An important part of Washington's new initiative should be helping
Middle Eastern nations carry out the reforms they deem necessary, not
imposing U.S. decisions. It also will be important to ensure that
money is spent as directed and to have benchmarks to determine which
programs work. The United States doles out more than $1 billion in
economic assistance to the Arab world each year, about two-thirds of
it to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Many Arab leaders fear Iraq and despise its leader, Saddam
Hussein. But they are concerned that a U.S.-led attack on Iraq could
provide ammunition to those who claim Washington is anti-Muslim. The
new program can undercut that belief, but, more important, it can
provide assistance for reforms that at least some in the Arab world
recognize as necessary to stop the region from continuing to dig
itself deeper in a hole. The initiative also should signal that
Washington wants autocratic governments in the region to pay more
attention to the political wishes of their citizens.</TE>

<HD>A Gain for Sri Lanka</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The suicide bombings and assassinations that have plagued Sri Lanka
for nearly two decades have so poisoned the air that neutral
locations are needed to discuss how to stop the killing. Norway has
played a key role in mediating between the Tamil terrorists and the
Sri Lankan government, and Oslo was chosen for talks this month that
centered on how to maintain the cease-fire that has worked well for a
year. The meetings produced an unexpected bonus: The terrorists gave
up their demands for independence.</LD>
<LD>   The minority Tamils on the beautiful island off the southern tip
of India long have claimed that the majority Sinhalese discriminate
against them. Nineteen years ago the Tamil Tigers demanded a separate
homeland and launched a civil war in which 64,000 people have been
killed -- this in a country of fewer than 20 million.</LD>
<LD>   Fighting was especially savage in the northeast, where rebels held
so much territory they established their own police stations and
courts. India sent troops in the 1980s in an unsuccessful attempt to
enforce a cease-fire. A Tamil suicide bomber who crossed into India
assassinated former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 as he
was campaigning for reelection.</LD>
<TE>   A Tiger negotiator said his group would have to explain to
followers why it had abandoned its demand for independence. But
giving up the impossible dream of a new nation and acceptance of a
"federal" state were important steps in making the cease-fire more
solid. So was the trip by Tamil leaders to Switzerland last week to
examine the Swiss government's relationship with the cantons.</TE>
<TE>   The Oslo talks were the third round in a year, resulting in what
should be a clear road map to ending the civil war. The Tigers claim
to have stopped recruiting children as soldiers or kidnapping them,
and the next talks, scheduled for Thailand in January, will include
human rights and possible constitutional changes to allow the Tamils
the autonomy both sides have agreed on.</TE>
<TE>   Washington considers the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization and
has helped Sri Lanka in the peace process by providing aid and
financing the clearing of land mines. Some three dozen foreign
nations gathered in Oslo in November to show support for the
cease-fire and promise additional funds to rebuild from the
devastation.</TE>
<TE>   Past attempts to end the bloodshed have failed, but both sides
appear sufficiently weary of the killing to give this cease-fire a
greater chance for success.</TE>

<LD>It is curious indeed that "Day of the Jewish Trojan" (Dec. 11)
makes no mention of Dr. Norman Topping, USC's president from 1958 to
'70. It was he who first reached out to the L.A. Jewish community
more than 40 years ago. Whatever real or imagined ethnic barriers
there were, that existed during the university's first 78 years, came
down. Through his efforts, USC elected its first Jewish member of the
board of trustees. Through his efforts, and his good relations with
the leadership of the Los Angeles Jewish community, Hebrew Union
College was invited in 1968 to move from small quarters in the
Hollywood Hills to property adjacent to the USC campus and to share
academic offerings. In 1975, the Jewish Federation Council of Greater
Los Angeles presented Topping the Judge Harry Hollzer Memorial Award
"for outstanding service and fostering goodwill and understanding
among religious and racial groups in the Los Angeles area." It was
also during Topping's administration that USC was accepted as a
member of the Assn. of American Universities, then consisting of the
nation's top 50 public and private universities.</LD>

<TE>   Why single out USC for anti-Jewish bias in the late 1940s and
1950s? Anti-Semitic quotas were quite the norm in colleges and
universities during these years. Contrary to the implication in your
article, USC represented the rule rather than the exception.</TE>

<HD>Turn to Sensible Use of Colorado River Water</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the controversy on Colorado River water ("Water Deal Talks
to Resume," Dec. 12): If both cities and the agriculture industry
acted more logically and practically, the water problems would be
much less severe.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix all sport luxurious hotels with
huge multiple pools, artificial rivers, lagoons and lakes and are
surrounded by water- intensive tropical landscaping. If these
establishments would design their surroundings with respect for their
arid or semiarid regions, many more acre-feet of water would be
available for food production, drinking and bathing. Farmers could
also help the situation by avoiding cultivation of water-intensive
crops such as alfalfa, rice and cotton.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Diamond</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The drama being played out in California in the ongoing water
battles between the Imperial Irrigation District, the federal
government and the cities on the coast is unnecessary. The amount of
Colorado River water by which California has been exceeding its
yearly allotment under the 1922 compact is about equal to the amount
of Colorado River water being wasted every year by Lake Powell. Most
people think of Lake Powell as a good thing that saves water. That is
untrue. In fact, Lake Powell is a monstrous, dripping faucet that
wastes huge amounts of water through evaporation and bank storage. At
least 770,000 acre-feet of water are removed from the river every
year at the lake. That is approximately equal to the water needs of
all of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The lost water is worth about $150 million, more than the value of
the electricity produced by Glen Canyon Dam. Keeping Lake Powell is
paying a huge subsidy to jet-skiers, at great cost. The people of San
Diego, Phoenix and Tucson must realize that the only way they can
hope to keep watering their lawns, golf courses and crops is by
draining Lake Powell. Draining that reservoir puts water in the river
-- a lot of water.</TE>

(Dec. 13). The time has come for Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer to demand that, first, we get our $9 billion back now -- the
courts be damned; second, that the infamous long-term "contracts"

and finally, that Ken Lay be brought to California and tried for his

<LD>Re "White House Including Political Appointees in Bonus Program,"
Dec. 5: "Good work is good work," White House press secretary Ari
Fleischer said, and that good work by the federal government's
employees, all of whom are paid by the taxpayers, should be rewarded.
All, it would seem, except for the ordinary, nonappointed personnel
who do the daily work but have had their raises limited to 3.1%
because of the "severe budget crunch." Conveniently for President
Bush and company, this edict came after the elections.</LD>

<LD>While the state legislators were in Hawaii feasting with fat cats
(Dec. 9) there was another "portly cat" that received attention (Dec.
10). Sen. Kitty is a feline with exquisite lobbying skills that has
been living near the steps of the state Capitol for 13 years. Her
life is memorialized in a book by Gov. Gray Davis' wife.</LD>
<LD>   All of Sen. Kitty's needs are taken care of. When she was injured,
excellent health care was at her beck and call. When threatened with
eviction from her three shelters in the shrubs, pressure from state
employees prevented this from happening. Unfortunately, the average
person does not have access to the upper reaches of the government.
It is too bad that the legislators and state officials can't spend as
much time and energy helping the people of the state of California.</LD>

<LD>Re "He's Humble in a Way That Only Godzilla Could Be," Commentary,
Dec. 12: Arianna Huffington's list of President Bush's un-humble acts
omits the most arrogant and dangerous behavior of all: his inexorable
march to war with Iraq. Even before his people had read one word of
Iraq's 12,000-page report, and notwithstanding Iraq's full
cooperation with the weapons inspectors, Bush ramped up his
accusatory rhetoric.</LD>
<LD>   That, combined with his steady buildup of troops and weapons in
the Persian Gulf over the last several months, reveals a
predetermined decision by Bush to attack Iraq. CIA Director George
Tenet announced that Saddam Hussein is not an imminent threat to us
but, if attacked, would become one. Bush has chosen to endanger our
troops and national security by starting a war in Iraq, whether the
U.N. Security Council agrees or not. What could be more arrogant?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nukes Part of Terror Policy" (Dec. 11) reveals a fearsome new
policy, one that threatens the health and safety of Americans. The
Bush administration now seeks to preemptively use nuclear weapons
against nonnuclear countries in an effort to destroy supposed caches
of chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   When the world's lone superpower announces it will use nuclear
weapons in a first strike against smaller nations, you can expect
growing resentment among other nations. World opinion is indeed
growing increasingly critical of America. The Pew Research Center
interview of 38,000 people earlier this month verified the fact.</TE>
<TE>   By building new "usable" nukes, this administration is actually
increasing the chance that these incredibly destructive weapons will
some day be used, either by us or by other nations that feel they
have to get their own weapons of mass destruction to counter our
threat. In the name of countering the proliferation of these weapons
we are encouraging their spread. This and the continuing danger that
the United States will adopt a principle of preemptive war will, as
former President Jimmy Carter said in accepting his Nobel Peace Prize
on Dec. 10, "set an example that can have catastrophic consequences."</TE>

<LD>What do you get when you mix political correctness, the LAUSD and 800
elementary school students? Eleven songs about snow! Celebrating the
winter season was the end result of my daughter's school's attempt at
what used to be called a Christmas show. As I sat in the auditorium
on an 80-degree, Southern California day, listening to an entire
student body sing about snowballs, I had to ask myself, "Is the
lowest common denominator of Los Angeles' collective humanity a
weather condition not even shared by the majority of us living in
this geography?" I guess the two songs about "giving" and "friends"
were nice, but are these virtues the result of an atmospheric
condition only available around the time of the winter solstice? Do
we sing songs on the vernal equinox?</LD>
<LD>   Call me old-fashioned, but how can songs that actually celebrate
the cultures of thousands of years of Western civilization really be
so offensive as to bring us to this point? We are witnessing the
nihilistic, Orwellian fruits of secularism carried under the banner
of tolerance. I suppose for constitutional reasons these faiths can't
be expressed in a public forum. If that is so, let's dispense with
this charade of a winter season celebration, bow to the secular
realization that snow is not a binding force for good and get on with
educating our kids about why Johnny has two daddies.</LD>

<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD deserves an A+ for the way it deals with cultural
diversity at the holiday season. My family and I have lived a lot of
places. When we lived in Iowa City, schools allowed holiday parties,
as long as they included no hint of religion -- no Santa-shaped
cookies, no menorah candles and no singing of "Silent Night." When we
moved to California, my kindergartner dressed as a dreidel in her
holiday program. Other children were dressed as Christmas trees and
as fruit and corn from the Kwanzaa harvest. This remains my fondest
holiday-program memory.</TE>
<TE>   Now we are in Virginia, where a state-mandated "In God We Trust"
plaque hangs in every school entrance and the daily pledge is
followed by a moment of silence. It's no surprise that Christianity
permeates the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   While Iowa City chose to steer clear of anything that could
potentially offend anyone, Virginia's single-minded focus does not
allow students to escape Christianity. The LAUSD has the best idea.
Let's learn about everyone's cultural background. Let's make the
world a bit smaller. Let's teach our kindergartners about dreidels
and corn stalks and Santa Claus. Gosh, I miss that.</TE>

<HD>Salman Raduyev, 35; Top Chechen Rebel Jailed by Russians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Salman Raduyev, the only leading Chechen guerrilla to be captured by
Russian forces, has died in prison, where he was serving a life
sentence, officials in Moscow said Sunday. He was 35.</LD>
<LD>   Raduyev was a maverick best known for a bloody hostage-taking raid
in the first Chechen war, in 1994-96, as leader of the "Lone Wolf"
band. He was convicted a year ago of terrorism, murder and
hostage-taking.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials said he had died Saturday of multiple
hemorrhages in a prison near the Urals city of Perm, about 750 miles
east of Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   "There can be no questions on the cause of his death," Yuri
Kalinin, deputy justice minister, said in comments on television. "I
have already been asked today whether he was beaten, killed. But this
is not even an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Raduyev was known for his belligerent Islamist rhetoric and
bravado, and his bushy red beard. His capture in March 2000 was
portrayed as a major victory for Moscow in the early stages of its
second campaign to defeat Chechen separatists.</TE>
<TE>   Though Raduyev played no role in the second Chechen war and was on
bad terms with many other guerrilla commanders, he was one of
Russia's most-wanted men after he led a raid on Kizlyar, a town just
outside Chechnya, in January 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A son-in-law of the late separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev,
Raduyev and his group took more than 2,000 people hostage at a
hospital in Kizlyar. Some 70 people died in a subsequent battle at
Pervomayskaya with Russian forces.</TE>
<TE>   During the region's three years of de facto independence, an
Islamic court handed him a prison sentence for inciting rebellion
against elected Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, but the Chechen
authorities never arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Raduyev had survived several assassination attempts. He kept his
face, scarred by the numerous attempts on his life, nearly covered by
a beard and sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when he was widely believed to have been killed, he
reappeared with his features so altered that reporters identified him
only by his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Raduyev was nicknamed "Titanic" after talk that his face had been
reconstructed in a foreign hospital with titanium implants.</TE>

<HD>Kay Rose, 80; First Female Sound Editor to Win an Academy
Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kay Rose, the first woman to win an Academy Award for sound editing
-- for her work on the 1984 film "The River" -- has died. She was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Rose died Wednesday in Burbank of multiple organ system failure,
said her daughter, sound editor and director Victoria Rose Sampson.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the Oscar presented 17 years ago, Rose's 54-year
effort to use sound to tell stories was recognized in March with a
career achievement award from the Cinema Audio Society. The Motion
Picture Sound Editors gave her a similar lifetime achievement award
in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   And in October, directors George Lucas and Steven Spielberg
endowed the Kay Rose Chair in the Art of Sound and Dialogue Editing
at the USC School of Cinema-Television. The chair is the first of its
kind in the country.</TE>
<TE>   When the endowment was presented Oct. 21, John Williams directed
the USC student orchestra in a surprise musical salute to Rose. The
sound editor, according to her daughter, declared the evening the
best night of her life.</TE>
<TE>   USC cinema Dean Elizabeth Daley praised the gift as a "landmark,"
explaining that it has been "so hard to get anyone to pay attention
to sound. We're the only school that teaches sound. And Steven and
George are the only guys who would pay this kind of money for sound."</TE>
<TE>   Although women are still rare in film sound departments, Rose
insisted that she never had much trouble getting into the club and
that men had been willing mentors.</TE>
<TE>   Her easy access had something to do with timing. After studying
film at Hunter College in her native New York, she became a civilian
film apprentice for the Army Signal Corps based in Astoria in New
York City in World War II. There she helped create such training
films as "How to Erect a Double Apron Barbed Wire Fence" and the John
Huston documentary "Report from the Aleutians."</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, she moved to Hollywood with letters of introduction from
several professionals with whom she had worked in the Signal Corps.
Nevertheless, she remained jobless and was down to her last $5 and
ready to ask her family for bus fare home when, as she told Daily
Variety in 1997, "I decided to take a streetcar to the Valley and
wound up at Universal.</TE>
<TE>   "I went up to the gate and asked the guards if I could call the
editorial department for a job as an assistant. They got hysterical
with laughter" at her job-seeking methods, she said, "but they let me
call anyway. The man on the phone asked if I was any good. I said
yes, and he said 'OK, you're hired!' "</TE>
<TE>   She found out later that she had placed her bold call only half an
hour after an editor had fought with and fired his assistant. Because
most young men were off fighting the war, no other assistants were
available.</TE>
<TE>   Rose got the job, but was a long way from the top.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked on some of the worst movies you've ever imagined,"
she said in an interview last year, "but they were low-budget
independent films and I learned to do all kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, she married film editor Sherman Rose and, with him,
produced what is now considered a sci-fi cult classic, the 1954
"Target Earth." They later divorced.</TE>
<TE>   She was sound effects editor for the 1957 film "I Was a Teenage
Frankenstein" and in charge of sound effects for two major Western
television series: "The Rifleman," starring Chuck Connors, from 1958
to 1963; and "The Big Valley," starring Barbara Stanwyck, from 1965
to 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Rose worked her way up to some of the best films, and found
herself in demand by the best directors -- Sydney Pollack, Peter
Bogdanovich, Robert Altman, Gene Kelly, Martin Scorcese, Alan Pakula,
Blake Edwards, Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand and Carl Reiner and,
with Mark Rydell, on "The River."</TE>
<TE>   Among Rose's sound editing credits are "Comes a Horseman," "The
Rose," "Ordinary People," "On Golden Pond," "California Split,"
"Crimes of the Heart," "The Milagro Beanfield War," "Black Rain,"
"Robocop 2," "Switch," "The Prince of Tides," "For the Boys," "Blake
Edwards' Son of the Pink Panther" and "Speed."</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the story rules," Rose said in a recent interview.
"Finding a balance between music and effects that supports the story
in the best way possible has always been my focus.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all a lot of fun.... I loved every minute of it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, Rose is survived by her sister,
Patricia Gaffney, and two granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at noon Wednesday in the Hall of Liberty, Forest
Lawn, Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial
contributions be made to the Kay Rose Chair at the USC School of
Cinema-Television Sound Department, or to Habitat for Humanity,
Providence/St. Joseph's Foundation or a charity of the donor's
choice.</TE>

<HD>Scandal-Scarred Politician Finds Haven in MTA Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was all set to become one of the most powerful politicians in
America, the speaker of the House of Representatives, but Louisiana
Republican congressman Bob Livingston quit on the same December day
in 1998 that his colleagues voted to impeach President Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of a magazine's scrutiny of his personal life,
Livingston's confession of marital infidelities left his political
career on the cutting-room floor of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal ...
almost.</LD>
<LD>   He has since founded a lobbying outfit named the Livingston Group,
which is in the indirect employ of Los Angeles' Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.</LD>
<TE>   The MTA board just voted a two-year contract with options for
another four years to spend $3 million with the big-noise Washington
lobbying-law firm Patton Boggs -- and the Livingston Group, starring
the ex-rep Livingston, is listed as one of Patton Boggs' three
subcontractors, designated federal lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as your fares helping to keep a former congressman off
the unemployment rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Top 10 Reasons Hahn Didn't Bag Any Pandas</TE>
<TE>   At the annual truce known as the L.A.-mayor-hosts-the-news-media
holiday party at the Getty Mansion, Jim Hahn offered his top 10
reasons why his Asia trip did not net him the pandas he'd hoped for
-- only the Miss Congeniality of the panda competition, a pair of
golden monkeys. Among the 10:</TE>
<TE>   * The Chinese government demanded the panda fly first class, and
City Controller Laura Chick said "No way."</TE>
<TE>   * The Chinese wanted to know how could they send a nice, cuddly
panda to a city that would treat Winona Ryder like that?</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. couldn't swing what China wanted in exchange -- two Laker
floor seats next to Jack Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   * Hahn wouldn't swap Police Chief Bill Bratton for a panda.</TE>
<TE>   * The burger gift certificates and autographed photos of Hahn
taken along as protocol gifts "set the wrong tone."</TE>
<TE>   * And -- not the No. 1 reason but a crowd-pleaser -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin was "upset that the San Fernando Valley wasn't
getting its fair share of city services."</TE>
<TE>   (Hahn didn't bring back any trophy pandas, but he may have won
over three political lap dogs: a trio of San Fernando Valley business
execs who paid their own way to fly with Hahn on his Asia trip, and
who wrote glowingly in the Daily News that, as they saw it, "every
corner of our city benefited from the time the mayor and city
departments invested in this rather grueling trip," which "struck the
right tone for the start of a [regional] marketing campaign" to sell
L.A. But it'll still have to be a campaign sans pandas.)</TE>
<TE>   State's 4th Governor Left Prospecting for Politics</TE>
<TE>   J. Neely Johnson was California's fourth governor, and in Dave
Doerr's book "California Tax Machine" and on the state's Web site,
Johnson's contributions are detailed thusly.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who came to California as a gold prospector, ended up in
politics. He once accused a newspaper editor of writing an insulting
article about him, grabbed the editor's nose and twisted it. The
editor drew a pistol, but was overcome by onlookers before he got off
a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson became governor at age 30, the youngest ever to get the
job, and was described after the vote tally as "the most startled man
in the state." Among his gubernatorial pinnacles: vetoing a bill
creating Del Norte County because it contained "bad spelling,
improper punctuation and erasures."</TE>
<TE>   Bubba's Call Negates Personal Cloture Rule</TE>
<TE>   As if there weren't already enough star power trying to stand in
the path of the huge Ahmanson Ranch housing project near Calabasas,
with Martin Sheen, Rob Reiner and Erin Brockovich saying no to
bulldozers and plumb lines....</TE>
<TE>   John Flynn, who chairs the Ventura County Board of Supervisors,
had pretty much decided to invoke his personal kind of cloture -- no
more chatting with lobbyists or colleagues before he was to cast his
vote on the project. But then ... Bubba rang.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn was en route to a hearing on the issue when his cell phone
rang, and on the other end was Bill Clinton. Flynn, a liberal
Democrat, immediately made an exception to his cloture rule: "I would
never ignore Clinton's call. That would be stupid."</TE>
<TE>   The ol' Clinton charm came right through the phone as the former
president nudged Flynn to put off a final vote on the project until
January, when a new, anti-Ahmanson supervisor is sworn in. Flynn
wouldn't say whether he'll support delaying the vote; the supes
resume their hearings tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   In the afterglow of chat, Flynn remembered, "He was just like a
high school chum. You almost felt like he had his arm around you" --
which, if Clinton had been standing there, he undoubtedly would have.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County GOP Gets Some Bad News</TE>
<TE>   Election year 2002 brought grim news for California Republicans,
even unto their stronghold, Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of voters by the Public Policy Institute of California
and UC Irvine found that, in spite of the GOP in ORA talking about
making inroads among Latino voters, Latinos were still twice as
likely as non-Latinos to like the job being done by the man the
Republicans love to hate, Gray Davis, the Democratic governor. They
were also twice as likely to support Davis' handling of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   When it came to judging President Bush, the ethnic differences
among Orange County voters all but disappeared: Nine in 10
Republicans, 60% of independents and about half of Democrats like the
job he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to the GOP in CA -- Accentuate the positive: Don't dump on
Davis; push Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * The L.A. City Council primary election is in March, and yet last
week's December mail brought a "re-elect council member Nick Pacheco"
flier loaded with endorsement names.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco has a bit of making-nice to do after a friend of his sent
out a mud-spattered mailer blasting Pacheco's biggest opponent,
Antonio Villaraigosa, for having white advisors and children out of
wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   On the endorsement list: Rep. Xavier Becerra, who's carped
publicly about the mailer, and who promised to pull his endorsement
of candidates practicing negative politics.</TE>
<TE>   * Ms. Magazine lists California Democrat and new House Minority
Leader Nancy Pelosi as one of its 2002 Women of the Year award
recipients; Rush Limbaugh, who got his start as a professional
palaverer on Sacramento radio, complained on his Web site that the
awards went to women because of their "reactions to men, not their
legitimate successes."</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh, in a rare burst of fellow-feeling toward Democrats of
the male persuasion, added that Pelosi had "stabbed Democrat men in
the back to get into power."</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn's kiss-and-make-up speech to the Valley
Industry and Commerce Assn. on the state of the San Fernando Valley
was introduced with Hahn's election night dance anthem "I Love LA."</TE>
<TE>   It was followed by the announcement that VICA's "business of the
year" award was going to Washington Mutual, the backers of Ahmanson
Ranch project -- which Hahn opposes.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I made a serious mistake. What I did was irrational and wrong."</TE>
<TE>   -- Newly sworn in Berkeley mayor and former Democratic Assemblyman
Tom Bates, apologizing for stealing about a thousand copies of the
Daily Californian, the issue of the UC Berkeley newspaper that
endorsed his opponent -- and whose apology was quoted, where else, in
the Daily Californian.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING?": Just ask "mini-he," the President
Bush doll, the first among a planned line of First Toys from an
Irvine company, TalkingPresidents.com Inc. The just-over-a-foot-tall
action figure has a repertoire of some Bush malapropisms among its 17
sound clips, such as, "We're working hard to put food on your
family," but more straightforward Bush quotes are also in the sound
mix: "Terrorism against our nation will not stand." The company
co-founders say they are "staunch Republicans'' who admire the 43rd
president. Still gift-shopping? Not for this Christmas: The Bush doll
is sold out and back-ordered into the new year. The company says it
soon will put out a line of former firsts -- a Ronald Reagan doll to
be followed by Clinton, Nixon, JFK and first George ("Read my lips")
Bush talking dolls.</TE>

<LD>Capitalizing on communal and anti-Muslim passions, hard-line Hindu
nationalists won elections in western India's riot-torn Gujarat
state.</LD>
<LD>   The Bharatiya Janata Party won 125 of 182 seats in the
legislature, an increase of eight seats.</LD>
<LD>   The victory appeared to vindicate an electoral strategy that
played heavily on Hindu anger toward Muslims after riots killed more
than 1,000 people this year, most of them Muslims. It also raised
fears among secular-minded Indians that the party will adopt a
similar approach in national elections in 2004.</LD>

<LD>Former U.S. President Clinton said his administration threatened to
destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities when the Asian nation was
developing weapons-grade plutonium in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   "They were planning to produce six to eight nuclear weapons per
year with plutonium extracted from power plants," he said in
Rotterdam. "We actually drew up plans to attack North Korea and to
destroy their reactors, and we told them we would attack" unless they
stopped.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea has said it will restart a reactor that could produce
weapons-grade plutonium.</LD>

<HD>Former Serb Leader's Admission of Guilt Alienates
Compatriots</HD>
<DH>As Biljana Plavsic's sentencing in The Hague begins,
Bosnian Serbs express the feeling that she has betrayed the cause of
her people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>Most ethnic Serbs here largely ignore the ongoing trials of accused
Balkan war criminals in The Hague, but they took notice when the
former president of the Serb part of Bosnia unexpectedly pleaded
guilty to crimes against humanity.</LD>
<LD>   Former President Biljana Plavsic says her admission of guilt for
her role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war is intended to encourage
reconciliation. But her sentencing hearing, which begins today and
will be the first public discussion of her involvement, seems likely
to have the opposite effect in Bosnia.</LD>
<LD>   She is the highest-ranking ethnic Serb to plead guilty before the
tribunal.</LD>
<TE>   Bosnia-Herzegovina consists of two parts: Republika Srpska, which
is overwhelmingly Serb and whose capital is Banja Luka, and the
Muslim-Croat Federation, with its capital in Sarajevo. Plavsic was
both a member of the presidency of the self-declared Serb Republic of
Bosnia during the war -- an entity that never received international
recognition -- and after the war was over, president of Republika
Srpska.</TE>
<TE>   Watching her change of heart from afar, Serbs say they feel one of
their leaders is betraying them and what they fought for.</TE>
<TE>   "She has nothing to admit guilt to," said Jelena Mijovic, 22, a
Bosnian Serb who is studying Serbian language and literature at Banja
Luka University. "She cannot admit guilt to what was the will of the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Mijovic took a long draw on her cigarette and shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so disappointed in her. Collectively, as a people, we have
pride that doesn't allow us to go back on what we have done in the
past."</TE>
<TE>   Plavsic has pleaded guilty to a single count of directing a course
of conduct by the Bosnian Serb armed forces that aimed to persecute
non-Serbs on racial and religious grounds and backed deportation and
killing to force them to leave areas of Bosnia where Serbs wanted to
live. She can be sentenced to life in prison, but at age 72 is
expected to receive a far lighter sentence.</TE>
<TE>   She was originally charged with two counts of genocide and five
counts of crimes against humanity, including persecution based on
ethnicity, religion and politics.</TE>
<TE>   She is one of just a handful of indicted war criminals charged
with genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The Bosnian war was the most brutal European conflict since World
War II -- between 100,000 and 200,000 people died and hundreds of
thousands more were displaced from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Although all three Bosnian ethnic groups -- Serbs, Muslims and
Croats -- slaughtered one another during the war, the Muslims lost
many times more people than either the Serbs or Croats.</TE>
<TE>   Plavsic, a biology professor by training, devoutly Orthodox and
anti-Communist, took up the Serb nationalist cause in 1990, joining
the party led by Radovan Karadzic, now the most wanted war criminal
in the Balkans. When Serbs declared themselves citizens of a separate
Bosnian Serb republic, she became a member of its presidency along
with Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   During the time she was in power, the Bosnian Serb army
perpetrated some of the most horrifying crimes of the war, including
the torture of Muslims in prison camps, the burning of women and
children while they were in their homes and mass murders.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "the Empress," Plavsic was famous for her extreme
nationalist and inflammatory rhetoric. She visited the front lines,
cheering on soldiers who were, in some cases, waging campaigns of
"ethnic cleansing." She described Muslims as "a genetic defect on the
Serbian body." She also famously said that if the Serbs lost half
their population in the fight for Greater Serbia, it would have been
worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Although handpicked by Karadzic after the war to succeed him as
president of Republika Srpska, she soon distanced herself from him
and formed her own political party that worked with the Western
powers. She was later defeated by a nationalist candidate.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, she was indicted by the Hague tribunal and pleaded not
guilty. She reversed her plea Oct. 2 of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond their disappointment, Bosnian Serbs reacted to her plea
change with scorn and fear for what it might mean for other Serbs
already in The Hague or not yet captured.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tribunal's rules, Plavsic can be required to testify in
other cases. When she changed her plea, her lawyer announced that she
had made no agreement to do so, but she can be compelled to testify,
said Jim Landale, a spokesman for the tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "Her plea might have consequences in the proceedings against
Karadzic, Milosevic and Krajisnik; we think that what she admitted to
now may not have to be proved in court in those other cases," said
Dejan Miletic, who heads the Republika Srpska Bureau for Cooperation
with The Hague, a government entity that focuses on defending Serb
tactics during the war. Momcilo Krajisnik, awaiting trial in The
Hague, was a powerful member of the Bosnian Serb government along
with Karadzic and Plavsic. Slobodan Milosevic, former president of
Serbia and of Yugoslavia, is currently on trial.</TE>
<TE>   People who knew Plavsic say she was a nationalist believer in the
Serb cause who convinced herself that she was doing what was in the
best interests of the Serb people -- both during the war and
afterward, when she distanced herself from Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   But when she was faced with the prospect of a long trial, forced
to confront the atrocities that were done in the name of Bosnian Serb
independence, and realized that while she had faded from the public
mind, Karadzic was still a beloved figure, she was filled with regret
and bitterness, and decided to make a last effort to make an impact,
these acquaintances say.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a true believer; at one time she started to think that
the Serbian people were endangered in Bosnia if it separated from
Yugoslavia ... and certainly she was present when decisions were
made, but those decisions never talked specifically about crimes,
camps and killings," said Zeljko Kopanja, editor of Nezavisne Novine,
which means Independent Gazette.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a victim of her own misconceptions ... and I think her
change is a consequence of her being disappointed in her own
destiny," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as for helping the reconciliation process, that is doubtful,
said Miodrag Zivanovic, a liberal philosophy professor at Banja Luka
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years ago, I too believed that holding war criminals
responsible would help with reconciliation, but now ... I can see
that for all this enormous job being done by the tribunal, the
effects will be minimal," Zivanovic said.</TE>

<HD>School's Walls Are Worth a Notice</HD>
<DH>At CalArts in Valencia, even the student posters and fliers
show special artistic merit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graphic design instructor Shelley Stepp sifts through a stack of
posters that have graced the hallways of the California Institute of
the Arts over the years, until she finds a personal favorite: a bold,
three-color silk-screen with snatches of orange and black against a
Rothko-esque field of mustard yellow.</LD>
<LD>   Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that the artwork is
actually a reward notice for a lost dog belonging to a CalArts
student.</LD>
<LD>   "Look," said Stepp, pointing to a scribbled line on one corner of
the poster, dating from the mid-1990s. "He actually signed it."</LD>
<TE>   At most colleges, hallways and bulletin boards are plastered with
informational posters and fliers announcing everything from Spanish
Club meetings to concerts or plays. They're usually mundane and
unimaginative.</TE>
<TE>   Not so at CalArts, Southern California's premiere school for
graphic and commercial design. It is a campus known for embracing the
tenets of conceptual art, which holds that an upturned urinal -- or a
lost-dog flier -- may ultimately be as significant as the Venus de
Milo.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, student creations are not always confined to gallery
space. Indeed, the hallways and bulletin boards in the school's
five-story main building also serve as an artistic testing ground as
well as a social and political sounding board, providing a glimpse
into the soul of the revered Valencia arts school.</TE>
<TE>   On one wall, a series of posters serves up oblique critiques of
the war on terror, with quotes from Kenneth M. Pollack, former
national security staffer, superimposed over photos of wolves hunting
wild boar. Elsewhere, another poster series approximates the style of
guerrilla artist Shepherd Fairey, endlessly reproducing a stylized
portrait of a popular teaching assistant.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, Stepp and other faculty members have been
saving the best of CalArts' hallway art, recognizing it as an
important record of the campus' history and the evolution of graphic
design.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators have given Stepp and Kary Arimoto-Mercer, the
assistant dean of the art school, a small grant that will allow them
to properly catalog the posters and fliers by establishing a digital
record for posterity.</TE>
<TE>   "The students are putting in all of this effort for something
that's very disposable, very ephemeral," said Stepp, who will begin
organizing the archive next year. "But we think it's worthy of saving
and protecting. It creates this really great history of the design
program here at CalArts."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, visitors to the main-floor lobby would have
noticed a 15-foot mural lamenting the demise of the campus bookstore,
a victim of declining profits. But students Gabi Mendoza and Jorge
Gonzalez treated the store more like a victim of a drive-by shooting:
their ghetto-style memorial, with its gangster-like gothic lettering,
was adorned with votive candles and marigolds, the traditional grave
decoration on the Mexican Day of the Dead.</TE>
<TE>   These days, much of the mundane communication among
administrators, faculty and students takes place over the Internet.
But CalArts students also use the wall to communicate with one
another, in some cases even carrying on a running dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Near the front entrance, drama major Brian Santa Maria posted a
lengthy "open letter" complaining about the school's rehearsal policy
and calling for the formation of a union for theater students. Within
hours, one of his colleagues had tacked up copies of an equally
lengthy rebuttal.</TE>
<TE>   Instructor Michael Worthington said one reason the hallways of
CalArts are rich with artistic and social commentary is that the
campus is self-contained.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Worthington said, is an intimate environment where
inhabitants can interact with graphic arts on a more personal level.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes the place of what we think of as a pedestrian street
culture," said Worthington, co-director of CalArts' graphic design
program. "There's nothing else to do here in Valencia. We're
trapped."</TE>
<TE>   Even the school's last newspaper, which surfaced from time to time
between 1999 and 2001, was printed as a large poster and tacked in
strategic locations around campus. Former editor Marc Herbst recalls
watching students gather around the paper when it was posted in the
halls.</TE>
<TE>   "From my point of view, it just seemed like a newspaper would work
best on the walls," said Herbst, who now publishes the Los
Angeles-based Journal of Aesthetics and Protest. "Since it's an
experimental school, I thought we might as well experiment with
form."</TE>
<TE>   The most visually arresting posters are produced by students in
the school's graphic design program. Sometimes they are pure
experiments meant to show off a newly designed typeface or test a
visual concept.</TE>
<TE>   CalArts administrators also let students design and produce most
of the official posters for campus events, such as concerts and
visiting-artist lectures.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, the student-designed posters are big hits --
creating another set of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The graphic design program is so strong here and the posters they
make are so gorgeous that they get [stolen] as soon as they're put
up," said Terence McFarland, CalArts' student council president.</TE>

<HD>Backers of Gun Controls Preparing To Fire Another Round of
Legislation</HD>

<LD>-It's fair to say that greater progress was made on gun control than
any other issue during Gov. Gray Davis' first term.</LD>
<LD>   The cautious governor's steps were measured, but -- prodded by a
more liberal Legislature -- his overall leap was huge.</LD>
<LD>   Topping the list: a tougher assault weapons ban, "Saturday night
special" safety standards, a one-per-month limit on handgun
purchases, handgun safety training and licensing, child-safety-lock
requirements, allowing consumers to sue gun makers for negligent
conduct.</LD>
<TE>   Gun zealots, led by the National Rifle Assn., fought Davis and
Democrats virtually every step, stubbornly refusing to compromise and
giving up more than they surely would have by negotiating. Digging in
against gun controls is a losing strategy in California.</TE>
<TE>   There are, by some estimates, 15 million firearms in the state;
27% of households have at least one gun, according to The Times Poll.
And people want these weapons controlled.</TE>
<TE>   In September, after four years of gun-law tightening, 51% of
voters polled by The Times said the laws should be even stricter.
Another 33% felt they were about right. Only 13% wanted them
loosened.</TE>
<TE>   The gun lobby clearly does not speak for all California gun
owners: 42% thought current laws were on the mark. Another 31%
favored tighter controls.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Gray Davis has signed more major gun laws than all the other
governors in the country combined," says Luis Tolley of the Brady
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "Each of the proposals is
groundbreaking. It sets the standard for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "But he shouldn't quit now. There still are an awful lot of kids
being killed by guns, and there's much more we need to do."</TE>
<TE>   Next year, firearms control advocates will focus on what the gun
lobby always has claimed it supports: keeping weapons away from bad
guys and going after their criminal misuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena), a gun-control crusader, last week
introduced a bill requiring that manufacturers record the unique
"ballistic fingerprint" of each firearm sold in California and
deliver it to the state Department of Justice. Using this DOJ data,
police presumably could trace bullets and cartridges back to the guns
used in crimes -- and to their owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it perfect? Of course not," says Scott. "But it's one more
tool in the arsenal of law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   The gun lobby opposes the concept as unproven science. The federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, however, is high on the
science.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer supports the concept, but wants
Washington to maintain a nationwide database. That's more likely to
nab killers, he reasons; besides, California is broke and would be
hard-pressed to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has a federal database bill that isn't
going anywhere while Republicans control Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "California ought to take the lead," Scott asserts.</TE>
<TE>   Another bill expected to be introduced in Sacramento would require
the state attorney general to keep records of long-gun sales, just as
he now does handguns. That means registration, historically a
fighting word for zealots, who fear the government first will take
names and then their guns.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's one of the ideas -- to confiscate guns from
ex-cons and misfits who legally aren't supposed to have them.</TE>
<TE>   The DOJ, under a bipartisan bill the NRA did support, has begun
cross-checking would-be gun buyers who flunk background checks
against previous handgun registrations. It has discovered and seized
hundreds of illegally possessed weapons, including one grenade
launcher.</TE>
<TE>   Many more illegally held firearms could be grabbed if the DOJ had
a database of long-gun registrations to check. "A law-abiding citizen
doesn't need to worry," says Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), the bill's probable author.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the next gun control agenda:</TE>
<TE>   * Making new pistols inoperable when the magazine is removed, even
if there's a bullet in the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   * Another attempt to ban sales of monster, armor-piercing,
.50-caliber sniper rifles, as they already have been in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some bills will pass next year, some in later years. But they will
pass -- as long as California keeps getting more urbanized, its
residents demand logical gun laws and Democrats control Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Special Election Faces Challenge</HD>
<DH>The courts will decide whether the voters or Gov. Davis
will choose a supervisor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four candidates so far are poised to run for a vacant seat on the
Orange County Board of Supervisors -- in an election that may never
be held.</LD>
<LD>   An Orange County Superior Court judge will decide Thursday whether
to block the county from holding a Jan. 28 special election to
replace Todd Spitzer, who was sworn in Dec. 2 to the state Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   A group of citizens, led by union firefighter chief Joe Kerr, is
challenging the creation of a new county charter passed by voters in
March that requires special elections to fill board vacancies.
Previously, the governor filled vacancies on the board by
appointment.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes are high, because the leading candidates are all
Republicans. If the charter is struck down, Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis would select the next supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Measure V is unconstitutional because its backers
failed to disclose the financial impact to voters of holding special
elections when vacancies occur -- as much as $500,000. Voters were
also not informed about Measure V's effect on how the county is
governed, and the proponents for the county charter failed to follow
seven of the eight state constitutional guidelines dictating how
counties may establish home rule, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V was proposed by Spitzer, who acknowledged his main goal
was to prevent Davis from appointing his successor. Spitzer said the
measure met all constitutional requirements, plus it leaves the
decision in the hands of voters.</TE>
<TE>   In a court hearing earlier this month, an attorney challenging the
measure said it was designed to boost the political fortunes of
former Assemblyman Bill Campbell, one of four announced candidates.
Campbell had to leave the Assembly because of term limits and is
being replaced by Spitzer. Friday, Spitzer endorsed Campbell, and his
critics believe Spitzer sponsored Measure V to help Campbell gain his
old seat.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could get Mr. Campbell to stipulate that this [charter] was
written for him, we could probably all go home," said attorney Tom
Umberg, a former assemblyman whose firm filed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's attorney told the judge last week that Campbell would
be harmed if an election weren't held because he has spent money on
the campaign. Judge Andrew Banks said he will allow Campbell to make
the argument in court but expressed skepticism about its relevance.</TE>
<TE>   "For lack of a more legalistic approach ... who cares if he spent
all that money if [the charter] is unconstitutional?" Banks said.
"Just because you've spent money doesn't make it constitutional."</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates for supervisor are former Tustin Councilman
Jim Potts; Robert Douglas of Orange, a reserve deputy sheriff; and
Douglas Boeckler, a supervising veterans representative from Orange.
Candidates have until today at 5 p.m. to file nomination papers.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Councilman Mike Alvarez withdrew from the race Friday,
saying the pressure to conduct such a swift campaign, along with the
pending legal challenge, created too many roadblocks. He also
believes Campbell's supervisorial campaign was orchestrated with help
from Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez noted that Campbell literature arrived in voters'
mailboxes just three days after Spitzer's sudden Nov. 19 resignation
from the board -- two weeks earlier than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Until Measure V was passed, Orange County was considered a
"general law county" that based much of its policies and procedures
on state law. With approval of Measure V, Orange County created a
charter that allows it to deviate from state law on certain issues
such as appointment of vacant seats on the Board of Supervisors.
Other counties have used charters to bring more sweeping changes to
local government, such as term limits and creation of new elected
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he will monitor the court case from Sacramento. He
argued that challengers are motivated by partisan politics, noting
that Kerr is a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to court because they're interested in the
niceties of how a charter was formed," Spitzer said. "They're
interested only in ensuring that the governor makes the appointment
and not the voters."</TE>

<HD>Daly Takes Pride in Hometown Victories</HD>
<DH>As Anaheim mayor, he was able to finish major projects on
his to-do list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the 10 years Tom Daly was mayor of Anaheim, his hometown went
through transformations and upgrades at a near breakneck pace. The
convention center was expanded. A new theme park opened. A
professional hockey team was born and a World Series won. The tangle
of streets around the resort district was streamlined, emerging as
neat and orderly as a Disneyland line.</LD>
<LD>   But Daly, 48, a hometown boy who once delivered the Anaheim
Bulletin and pitched for Anaheim High School, counts his mayoral
successes in the mundane: 20,000 more trees, six new parks, countless
utility poles and wires that have been buried under streets.</LD>
<LD>   He may have left for Harvard, where he studied government, but
when he was done, he came home. And that may explain why his moments
of pride are more likely to come at the neighborhood grocery store
than while sitting next to Michael Eisner, watching the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's when people come up to me and say, 'Tom, we're going to miss
you. You've been a good mayor,' " Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   By the measuring sticks used to gauge a city's health, the city is
better than when Daly was first elected to the City Council in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Major assets, such as the convention center and Edison
International Field, have been remodeled and renovated. Crime is
down. The general fund reserves are strong. Investment in tourism is
paying off, despite the economic hit after Sept. 11. Revenue from the
hotel bed tax, for example, doubled from $28.7 million in 1991-92 to
$57.7 million in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   Some said it was Daly's ability to balance big, headline-grabbing
projects while still drawing attention to downtown or West Anaheim
that made him effective.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Tom was a guy who understands that in Anaheim, we are
about big and small things," City Manager Dave Morgan said. "Tom
understood you have to do both and you have to do both well."</TE>
<TE>   Daly, for example, pushed to rebuild the blighted Jeffrey-Lynne
neighborhood, a high-crime, heavily Latino neighborhood community
behind Disneyland made up of apartment complexes with many different
property owners and landlords. The $55-million project was completed
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland Resort President Cynthia Harriss said that though Daly
supported Disney expansion and often helped the company gain momentum
for its projects, he made sure residents' needs were addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He exemplified, through his style and staff, the sensitivity that
Anaheim got uprooted for progress but did it in the easiest way one
could," Harriss said. "He balanced the fact that there are citizens
here who have lived here for generations."</TE>
<TE>   There are others who believe Daly didn't do nearly enough to
improve the city for residents, instead focusing on trying to hang
onto the Los Angeles Rams when they played in Anaheim, negotiating
the Angels' Disney deal, and developing the resort district.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to see him finally gone," said Anaheim resident Steve
White, one of Daly's critics. "His focus, as far as I'm concerned,
has been on tourism to the detriment of neighborhoods. I think it's
been totally lopsided during the entire time that Tom's been in
office."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's demographics changed dramatically during Daly's term.
The Latino population, for example, swelled from 31.4% to nearly 50%
in a 10-year stretch. That shift provided the backdrop for ongoing
disputes between the Latino community, city leaders and police.</TE>
<TE>   Latino activists still believe the presence of an INS agent at the
city jail has fostered a growing mistrust of police and government.</TE>
<TE>   Los Amigos of Orange County President Amin David said that Daly's
performance was lackluster and that he didn't act aggressively on
affordable housing as a step toward improving life for minorities and
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Once considered a rising Democratic star, Daly was the target of
occasional Republican jabs, including once in 1998 when he was
considering a run for the Orange County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans accused him of campaign finance violations, and he was
charged with a misdemeanor by a special prosecutor. A judge later
tossed out the charges, and many deemed the incident a politically
motivated scare tactic aimed at keeping him out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Daly will take over his new job as county clerk, an
elected post but one far less visible than serving as mayor of the
state's 10th largest city.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's been a case of 'we had great expectations and
he never made it.' It's not like that at all," said John Hanna,
former county Democratic chairman. "I think he has been a great
leader. And all politics is local, despite what some people might
think."</TE>
<TE>   Daly has spent his life in public service. When he was 8, he
walked door to door, helping his father hang doorknob fliers for Tom
Kuchel's state Senate campaign. His first county job was as an intern
for then-Supervisor Ralph Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Daly won't count out any future political runs. "I would never say
never," he said. But he added, "I really am a local-level politician
and I have a deep passion for Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Daly still has a list of tasks he didn't finish: improving
neighborhood identities, building a youth sports facility, continuing
to revitalize downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unfinished business, Daly can't help but look back
with pride on his city, his leadership. Not bad for a kid who used to
sneak away from home and ride his bike over to Anaheim Stadium to
watch the new ballpark take shape. Not bad to end his term with his
favorite team winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as good as it gets for a mayor who happens to be a big
fan," Daly said. "I have a good memory of problems solved, progress
pursued. The scoreboard reads pretty well."</TE>

<HD>Special Kids Get a Jump on the Future</HD>
<DH>Ojai district preschool brings disabled and nondisabled
children together at a young age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Half of the 14 children in this Ojai preschool have been diagnosed
with special needs -- anything from speech delays to autism to
epilepsy. The other kids are not disabled.</LD>
<LD>   But as the group danced and played and ate their snacks together,
and then sat in a circle and sang "The Wheels on the Bus," it was
difficult to tell which half was which.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the marvel of this thing," said Ojai Unified School
District Supt. Van Riley. "They're all just kids, having fun and
learning from each other."</LD>
<TE>   The preschool program, which began this fall, is one of a handful
in Ventura County providing the integration of disabled youngsters
into regular classrooms. While such a practice is quite common beyond
kindergarten, it remains an emerging trend among preschools
statewide, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming the norm," said Jarice Butterfield, director of
Ojai's special-education programs. "The big push right now is early
integration."</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that special-needs kids will develop at a faster
rate if they are surrounded by those who develop normally. And
children without disabilities can benefit by learning to be more
tolerant toward those who are different, teachers said.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's program has another twist: The preschool and day-care
service for those who are not disabled is specifically for the
children of Ojai teachers and staff members, and costs them just $15
a day.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the district will go one step further to offer day
care for up to eight infants, Riley said. That program will be much
pricier, at $700 a month, Butterfield said. But school district
employees will be able to apply for subsidies and grants through
tobacco tax funds.</TE>
<TE>   While school districts are required to provide free preschool to
disabled children, they don't have to do so for nondisabled kids.
That's partly why Riley began looking into providing day care for
employees' children last year. At the time, 10 teachers in the Ojai
district were on partial leaves or working part time because they
could not find or afford a high-quality, full-time child care
program, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The need exists throughout Ventura County, where children under 5
years old outnumber licensed child-care slots by a 2-1 ratio,
according to a state report released last summer. And, the study
found, the annual average cost for enrolling an infant in day care is
$8,690 -- equivalent to tuition for two years at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's program is perfect for Alexandra Zielsdorf, a kindergarten
teacher at Topa Topa Elementary in Ojai. Her 3-year-old son, Mark,
who is not disabled, attends the district-sponsored preschool two
days a week and loves it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's really important my son has exposure to diversity,"
she said. "I think he's getting a very well-rounded education being
there that he wouldn't get somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Preschool teacher Jennifer Fitzgerald said she has noticed
improvement among the special-needs students since the integration
program began in August. They are interacting more, she said, and
coming out of their shells more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   While few disagree that integration is good for special-needs
preschoolers, it can be difficult to pull off because the state lacks
widespread public preschool for nondisabled children, said Fran
Arner-Costello, assistant director of a countywide program that
coordinates special education among districts.</TE>
<TE>   "We really know the value of it, and we're trying to do it as much
as we can," she said, citing programs in Ventura, Camarillo, Thousand
Oaks and Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai began putting special-needs youngsters into private
preschools around town two years ago, using as a model a decade-old
program in Santa Barbara County. The move followed parent complaints
to the school district that their children were missing out on early
integration, Butterfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Those parents are now "thrilled with the new program," she said.</TE>

<HD>Differences Fade in Integrated Class</HD>
<DH>Ojai district preschool is one of a handful bringing
disabled and nondisabled children together at a young age, for the
benefit of both.</DH>

<LD>Half of the 14 children in this Ojai preschool have been diagnosed
with special needs -- anything from speech delays to autism to
epilepsy. The other kids are not disabled.</LD>
<LD>   But as the group danced and played and ate their snacks together,
and then sat in a circle and sang "The Wheels on the Bus," it was
difficult to tell which half was which.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the marvel of this thing," said Ojai Unified School
District Supt. Van Riley. "They're all just kids, having fun and
learning from each other."</LD>
<TE>   The preschool program, which began this fall, is one of a handful
in Ventura County providing the integration of disabled youngsters
into regular classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   While such a practice is quite common beyond kindergarten, it
remains an emerging trend among preschools statewide, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming the norm," said Jarice Butterfield, director of
Ojai's special-education programs. "The big push right now is early
integration."</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that special-needs kids will develop at a faster
rate if they are surrounded by those who develop normally.</TE>
<TE>   And children without disabilities can benefit by learning to be
more tolerant toward those who are different, teachers said.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's program has another twist: The preschool and day-care
service for those who are not disabled is specifically for the
children of Ojai teachers and staff members, and costs them just $15
a day.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the district will go one step further to offer day
care for up to eight infants, Riley said. That program will be much
pricier than the toddler day care, at $700 a month, Butterfield said.
But school district employees will be able to apply for subsidies and
grants through tobacco tax funds.</TE>
<TE>   While school districts are required to provide free preschool to
disabled children, they don't have to do so for nondisabled kids.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly why Riley began looking into providing day care for
employees' children last year. At the time, 10 teachers in the Ojai
district were on partial leaves or working part time because they
could not find or afford a high-quality, full-time child care
program, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The need exists throughout Ventura County, where children under 5
years old outnumber licensed child-care slots by a 2-1 ratio,
according to a state report released last summer. And, the study
found, the annual average cost for enrolling an infant in day care is
$8,690 -- equivalent to tuition for two years at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's program is perfect for Alexandra Zielsdorf, a kindergarten
teacher at Topa Topa Elementary in Ojai. Her 3-year-old son, Mark,
who is not disabled, attends the district-sponsored preschool two
days a week and loves it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's really important my son has exposure to diversity,"
she said. "I think he's getting a very well-rounded education being
there that he wouldn't get somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Preschool teacher Jennifer Fitzgerald said she has noticed
improvement among the special-needs students since the integration
program began in August. They are interacting more, she said, and
coming out of their shells more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   While few disagree that integration is good for special-needs
preschoolers, it can be difficult to pull off because the state lacks
widespread public preschool for nondisabled children, said Fran
Arner-Costello, assistant director of a countywide program that
coordinates special education among districts.</TE>
<TE>   "We really know the value of it, and we're trying to do it as much
as we can," she said, citing programs in Ventura, Camarillo, Thousand
Oaks and Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai began putting special-needs youngsters into private
preschools around town two years ago, using as a model a decade-old
program in Santa Barbara County. The move followed parent complaints
to the school district that their children were missing out on early
integration, Butterfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Those parents are now "thrilled with the new program," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai mother Holly Tibbles said Fitzgerald's integrated class is
the only one her 4-year-old son, Vincent, has responded to.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent has Klinefelter syndrome, which means he has
slow-developing social skills and can be overwhelmed easily.</TE>
<TE>   But because he talks a lot, he was frustrated in special education
classes that were not integrated with other talkative youngsters, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing else has ever really worked. Here, he loves it, and he
wants to go," Tibbles said. "It gives him a chance to be successful."</TE>

<HD>Law May Bar Davis' Plan for Fund Shift</HD>
<DH>Governor wants to move money from housing programs to help
solve state budget problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $500 million that Gov. Gray Davis proposes to shift from local
affordable-housing programs to the state budget may not be there for
him to take.</LD>
<LD>   And even if the money is there, critics say, taking it might be
illegal.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal to go after the housing money was unveiled this month
as part of Davis' plan to whittle down the state's projected
$21-billion-plus budget shortfall. Davis administration officials
suggested that the money has been sitting in bank accounts in cities
unwilling to use it to fund housing for the poor.</LD>
<TE>   It's actually more complicated than that.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is basing the $500-million figure on a state housing
report that is more than three years old. A more recent report from
the state controller's office indicated that all but $113 million of
that money has been earmarked to help pay for thousands of housing
units -- many of which are already being built.</TE>
<TE>   And any move by lawmakers to take the money -- budgeted or not --
and ship it out of cities could be unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "What the governor is proposing to do here is exactly 180 degrees
opposite of what the state Constitution requires," said Murray Kane,
a Los Angeles-based redevelopment attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Kane lays it out simply. The funds come from property-tax revenue
generated in local redevelopment districts. The state Constitution
says such revenues are not to be used anywhere but within the county
where they were generated.</TE>
<TE>   Others have the same reading.</TE>
<TE>   "There are significant questions as to whether the state can take
that money," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California
Budget Project, a research group that advocates for the poor.
"Nothing like that has ever been done before."</TE>
<TE>   Taking away the money could bring hundreds of projects to a halt.
State statistics show that Los Angeles, for example, stands to lose
more than one-third of its $71.3-million affordable-housing fund.</TE>
<TE>   But the Davis administration says this extraordinary budget crunch
calls for extraordinary measures.</TE>
<TE>   "It simply doesn't make sense to have those idle balances sit ...
and at the same time have other programs be cut," said state Finance
Director Timothy Gage.</TE>
<TE>   Officials suggest that they could dodge the constitutional issues
with some clever accounting. One possibility would be moving the
redevelopment money to schools -- thereby keeping it in the counties
where it was generated -- and then cutting school funding from the
state to local districts by the same amount.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still being determined precisely how the money will come
back to help" alleviate the shortfall, said Anita Gore, spokeswoman
for the finance department.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say any swapping scheme would amount to illegal
money-laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Not every affordable-housing advocate thinks the governor's
proposal is a bad idea. Some say it is about time to punish cities
that neglect to build housing for the poor that is required by state
redevelopment laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Should he do it? Sure," said Allen Baldwin, executive director of
Orange County Community Housing. "That money won't do housing much
good in places where the political will can't be mustered to build
the homes."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said there are communities where the money is being
misused, such as Lake Elsinore, which is using its affordable-housing
funds to help pay for a minor league baseball park. Another city
tried to use its funds to build a highway overpass.</TE>
<TE>   But threats of litigation are flying.</TE>
<TE>   "What the governor is proposing to do is absurd," said Ken
Emanuels, legislative advocate for the California Redevelopment Assn.
"There would be a number of lawsuits filed."</TE>
<TE>   Financial analysts are following the debate. They are already
warning that any attempt to take the money could get tied up in court
for years.</TE>
<TE>   The matter certainly is not as simple as the Davis administration
made it appear with the few sentences tacked onto the end of an
extensive budget-reduction proposal earlier in the month, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, bond-rating giant Standard and Poor's advised
investors in a report on California's fiscal problems that
redevelopment interests are "already mobilizing to fight" the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Others say it is fine if the governor wants to leap into the
constitutionally murky territory of trying to grab redevelopment
money, but they question the wisdom of going after the small portion
of those funds dedicated to low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) notes that tens of millions of
dollars in redevelopment money are spent every year subsidizing
shopping centers and "big box" stores in places where there already
is an overabundance of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are less in need of more strip malls than we are in need of
housing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials say they are not ruling out going
after the money that subsidizes those strip malls, and signaled in
their proposal that redevelopment agencies are in for another big hit
in January, when the governor submits his budget plan for 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is targeting the affordable-housing funds for
now, according to Gore, because that money is not being used.</TE>
<TE>   "That money is just sitting there," she said. "We have a budget
situation that doesn't allow us the luxury of that kind of money
going unspent."</TE>
<TE>   The administration bases such comments on the state housing report
from 1999 that determined that, at the end of the fiscal year, there
was $500 million in low-income housing money unused in cities
throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The controller's report last year that found there was only $113
million going unused showed that $401 million had been pledged to
various projects but contracts had not been signed.</TE>
<TE>   Housing officials in cities across the state say the
administration's attempt to shift money for which there is no
contract demonstrates ignorance of how subsidized housing works. They
say contracts with the developers are signed at the tail end of
planning -- or even after ground is broken -- when all other
financing is in order, and that can take years.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, they say, the agencies have to work like developers,
always keeping money on hand to invest in building opportunities as
they arise.</TE>
<TE>   An example is the city of Orange, which has been praised by the
state for its affordable-housing projects but also has about $2
million in housing money that has been unspent this year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange is using that money to cut deals with landowners and
builders to help create more than 300 units of affordable housing.
Under the Davis proposal, that money would disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "This is insane," said City Manager David Rudat. "We've been
praised by the state for our programs. Now they want to make it
impossible for us to do anything."</TE>

<HD>Homeless Gay Youths Find a Safe Haven</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roxy wears her dark hair in a bristling crew cut, her slight frame
swimming in baggy khaki pants and a loose sweater.</LD>
<LD>   As a teenager, her boyish look and open lesbianism didn't always
sit well with others. A Romanian immigrant whose mother had died,
Roxy feared she would be persecuted for her sexual orientation if she
returned to her native country.</LD>
<LD>   Young, gay and virtually homeless -- she'd been kicked out of her
sister's house -- Roxy is one of the hundreds of youths who turn up
each year at the Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Most are looking for food, a hot shower, maybe a change of
clothes. Some are drug-addicted or HIV-positive, in need of
counseling or medical care.</TE>
<TE>   More than a third of the estimated 15,000 homeless youths in the
metropolitan area identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or
transgender, said Dylan Gailey, the center's director of youth
services.</TE>
<TE>   Many drift to the streets of Hollywood and West Hollywood, drawn
by the promise of stardom or simply by a welcoming gay community.</TE>
<TE>   "They come with the dream of making it in Hollywood, and they
become prey to the porn industry or survival sex," Gailey said.
"We're providing a safe haven where these young people can be
nourished and supported ... so they can live healthy lives. They are
this community's future."</TE>
<TE>   The Gay &amp; Lesbian Center is one of more than 50 service
organizations in Southern California that benefited from last year's
Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The $15,000 granted to the center's youth services department
helped support the organization's Jeff Griffith Youth Center, a
drop-in facility on the border of Hollywood and West Hollywood that
provides meals, clothing and hygiene kits for homeless youths.</TE>
<TE>   The program helps needy young people without regard to sexual
orientation, Gailey said. Last year, 550 new clients visited the
drop-in center.</TE>
<TE>   The Gay &amp; Lesbian Center has a group home with room for 24 young
people. The Kruks/Tilsner Transitional Living Program combines basic
services such as food and shelter with counseling and art programs to
help young people prepare to live on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Now 21 and a student at Los Angeles City College, Roxy will soon
graduate from the 18-month program. She will leave with not only a
scholarship and new wire-rimmed glasses, both provided by the center,
but also with a legal claim to U.S. residency.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the center's legal department found a pro-bono
lawyer to handle Roxy's immigration case. She was recently granted
asylum, allowing her to live and work legally in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for this program, I'd be dead or starving or
somewhere on the streets," she said softly. "They got me back on my
feet."</TE>

<HD>Body Found in Buena Park May Be Kidnapped Guard's</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police on Sunday were trying to determine whether a body dumped and
set on fire in a Buena Park industrial complex is that of a Commerce
security guard who was kidnapped from work last week, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's officials completed an autopsy Sunday but were unable to
identify the body because they could not lift fingerprints from the
charred remains, officials said. Investigators today will review the
kidnap victim's dental records to see if they match, said Deputy
Cullen Ellingburgh of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The body was discovered about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, in flames
inside a trash bin in the 8400 block of Artesia Boulevard, said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Bill Spear. Firefighters found the
body after they extinguished the fire.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said they believe the body
may be that of Song Chea, 52, who was abducted Thursday as he guarded
the front gates of the Overnight Transportation Co. in Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Chea, who was unarmed, was kidnapped by two men who dragged him
into a van shortly before 4 a.m., Spear said. Police said the
kidnappers were working with a third man who was allowed inside the
gate by Chea shortly before he was abducted. The man tried to steal a
trailer but ran after he was spotted by employees, deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   They are searching for one of the kidnappers, described as a man
in his 30s, about 5 feet 10 and weighing 165 pounds. He has a lazy
right eye and was last seen in a brown passenger van with tan
stripes, gold-colored running boards and license plate number
28JT389. Anyone with information about the abduction or slaying is
asked to call detectives at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Looks at Way to Reduce Liquor Licenses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a town that averages 14 liquor-selling establishments per square
mile, a Santa Ana gas station owner who wants to sell beer and wine
may have come up with a unique way to decrease the number of places
that sell alcohol there.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Yamasaki has offered to buy two liquor licenses from
existing Santa Ana businesses and retire one. The catch: He wants to
transfer the other to his Arco AM-PM gas station on East Dyer Road.</LD>
<LD>   City officials are split on whether the idea is an empty gesture
that would be impossible to enforce or a stroke of brilliance that
would help Santa Ana reduce the number of alcohol-selling businesses
in town.</LD>
<TE>   "It sounds on face value like a good idea," said Joseph Edwards,
Santa Ana's planning director. "We have more than our fair share of
liquor licenses ... but we need to do more homework to see if it will
work."</TE>
<TE>   The city's Planning Commission rejected the idea, but the City
Council is scheduled to consider it Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has stimulated debate on whether it would be an
effective way to reduce liquor licenses in Santa Ana and other older
cities that began issuing liquor licenses long before laws were
adopted to prevent an over-concentration of alcohol-selling
establishments.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Santa Ana began scrutinizing liquor license
applications and took steps to close down some downtown bars. In
1997, the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control began
requiring cities to explain the approvals of licenses in areas deemed
to have an over-concentration of alcohol-selling permits -- a number
derived in part from census tract data.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's 14 licenses per square mile tops all Orange County
cities. Only Anaheim has more alcohol-selling outlets than Santa Ana
-- 481 to 379. However, Anaheim is nearly 50 square miles, almost
double the size of Santa Ana, and includes the hotels and
entertainment facilities around Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Latino Health Access, the Santa Ana-based nonprofit agency, is
among those fighting new licenses in the city. Research by the group
and UC Irvine showed there were more accidents involving alcohol at
North Main Street and East 1st Street in Santa Ana than at any other
intersection in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Yamasaki -- who is seeking a license in an area considered to be
over-concentrated -- has overcome some criticism because his plan is
tied to a reduction in licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members have expressed an interest in using
Yamasaki's idea as a model for other businesses wanting to land a
liquor license.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea. It would allow us to continue to reduce the
number of liquor licenses while getting the applicant what he wants,"
said Councilman Jose Solorio. "But we need to do this in a way that
we can enforce it."</TE>
<TE>   Others have their doubts.</TE>
<TE>   John Nicoletti, Anaheim's public information officer, said his
city approved a Mexican supermarket, Gigante, only after the store
bought an existing license and transferred it. But it might be hard
to find many license holders who want to sell, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said he is concerned that the people who sell the licenses
could turn around and buy new ones. Critics are also uncertain
whether the city has the power to require Yamasaki to buy the two
licenses as a condition for a liquor license at his gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Yamasaki declined to talk about his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Latino Health Access founder America Bracho is intrigued
by the idea, she said further debate is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "All liquor licenses are not made equal," said Alex Sanchez, a
Latino Health Access health promoter. "One license can be used to
sell a lot and another to sell a little. So the deal should depend on
how sales would be affected."</TE>
<TE>   Carl DeWing, spokesman for the Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control, said Yamasaki's proposal might work in Santa Ana but that in
other cities it might be too expensive because license prices vary.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Madre Looks to Past as It Invests in Downtown's
Future</HD>
<DH>A $1-million renovation project is getting rave reviews for
enhancing the city's quaint charm. Free wrapping paper is a hit with
shoppers too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sierra Madre has always been considered a bit of a Southern
California anomaly -- an old-fashioned town surrounded by suburbia, a
place devoid of stoplights and other signs of modernity.</LD>
<LD>   There is a Starbucks in town -- but here barristas greet customers
by name.</LD>
<LD>   So when the City Council considered how to spruce up the civic
center and woo shoppers away from nearby communities, Sierra Madre
used history as its guidebook. To prepare for its future, Sierra
Madre looked to its past.</LD>
<TE>   A $1-million renovation to Sierra Madre's downtown, centered on
the intersection of Sierra Madre Boulevard and Baldwin Avenue, has
been getting rave reviews from business owners and customers -- in
part because it reflects the city's personality.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always quaint," said Karen Keegan, owner of Savor the
Flavor, a specialty food store facing the intersection. "Now, it's
charming and quaint. It feels like going back in time, with class."</TE>
<TE>   A million dollars might not buy much for most city centers. But in
Sierra Madre -- all 2.93 square miles of it -- the transformation has
been remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty new traffic lamps along Sierra Madre Boulevard, with their
Doric column bases, recall the lanterns that illuminated the city in
the 1910s and '20s. Custom-designed benches and trash cans, crafted
of wood and wrought iron, feature a delicate pattern of leafs and
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The added "bow-outs" -- concrete planters butting out of the
sidewalks -- feature native plants and the same types of pepper and
sycamore trees planted throughout Sierra Madre.</TE>
<TE>   Although an outsider might suggest that Sierra Madre exuded charm
even before its transformation, Mayor Doug Hayes, a 30-year resident,
said there had been a worry that the downtown district lacked appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was looking pretty stodgy," he said. "It didn't have much
personality to it."</TE>
<TE>   The "beautification," Hayes said, "has that old-timey feel, which
is what we were trying to reach for."</TE>
<TE>   It also has afforded Sierra Madre a chance to do something
decidedly modern: bring more tax dollars to the city by driving
people into the stores and restaurants that line the civic center.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre, Hayes suggested, offers a refuge from the chaos of
mall shopping and the impersonality of online buying.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real thrust to go back and to buy things from the
community, especially to give to others as gifts," he said. "It makes
it special when it's from your hometown."</TE>
<TE>   To build upon that homespun, hometown appeal, the city designed a
special holiday wrapping paper and distributed it free to merchants.
The paper -- purple with wisteria flowers, the symbol of Sierra Madre
-- was introduced at a Dickensian holiday party that the city threw
in late November to coincide with the completion of the downtown
upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   And it has been a big hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it's purple, people are coming in, asking for it,"
said Savor the Flavor owner Keegan. "We have the red and green, but
nine times out of 10, they want the one that says Sierra Madre."</TE>
<TE>   The wrapping paper, combined with the civic improvements, have
helped create "a real sense of place," said City Manager Tammy Gates.
"It's made it the kind of place where people could park their cars,
and get out and walk.... We see people utilizing all the new benches
during the week and on the weekends."</TE>
<TE>   The only setback so far for the new downtown has been the pepper
tree controversy: a small brouhaha over the multi-trunked trees
chosen for many of the bow-outs. At a recent City Council meeting,
some merchants complained that tree branches would hide signs above
local businesses. Local papers carried stories about the trunks.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes dismissed the hubbub as just another aspect of small-town
life in Sierra Madre, population 10,000. "You can't blow your nose
here without having a controversy," he said. The city has promised to
trim the trees regularly to avoid any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Sperling, an employee at Leonora Moss, a florist and gift shop
along Baldwin Avenue, said she likes the changes, pepper trees and
all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely an improvement," she said. "It lends itself to
lingering in the downtown."</TE>
<TE>   But for Bruce Gill, a retired acting teacher, the city's subtle
changes were perhaps a little too subtle. As he sipped a Starbucks
atop a newly added wooden bench, he wondered what all the fuss was
about. "It hasn't changed at all," he said at first.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the bench he was sitting on, or the newly
landscaped bow-out nearby?</TE>
<TE>   Gill acquiesced a bit. "There are little things," he admitted.</TE>
<TE>   What he appreciated most, Gill said, was the freshly painted
crosswalk nearby.</TE>

<HD>Dairy Manure Pit Deaths Raise Warning Flag</HD>
<DH>Cal/OSHA increases inspections as industry, farmers put
more stress on safety measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>GUSTINE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The brothers shared the bond of their immigrant journey. There were
eight days spent shivering in a Tecate, Mexico, orchard, abandoned by
an unscrupulous guide. There was backbreaking work flipping sheets of
raisins in the Fresno heat. Then came the gentler apricot harvests
near Patterson. Next, the boost to higher pay at the concrete pipe
company, where they built and installed irrigation systems for farms
and dairies across the western San Joaquin Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Over the course of two decades, Sergio and Jose Ortiz together
inched toward the stable lives they had dreamed of in the rural
Mexican town of their youth. In his pocket, the burly Sergio carried
two Social Security cards: one fake, from his years as an illegal
immigrant, the other real, tucked proudly next to his green card.</LD>
<LD>   Today, those belongings bear the marks of his journey's end, a
death so horrific that Jose hides the truth from their frail mother
back home. Sergio's identification is stained with cow manure. The
$30 in bills that he carried on the day of his death in August are
discolored from the acids of animal urine. His watch is corroded. All
of these now rest in a makeshift shrine that Jose maintains in his
well-tended home in rural Patterson.</LD>
<TE>   Sergio Ortiz died in a stew of liquefied manure on the job in
Gustine, a modest dairy town south of Patterson on a narrow highway
that slices through cow country like a razor.</TE>
<TE>   His death came just 18 months after a similar incident claimed two
workers at another Gustine dairy farm. All were overcome by toxic
wastewater gases, then drowned, after climbing inside concrete
structures where manure slurry is pumped from vast waste lagoons.</TE>
<TE>   The spate of deaths has prompted an unusual self-examination by
the California dairy industry and representatives of companies such
as the one where Sergio worked. Most acknowledge that not enough has
been done to comply with state laws requiring better training for
workers and deployment of safety devices to combat deadly fumes in
confined spaces. Recent training sessions on the issue by the Western
United Dairymen, an industry group, have been packed.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, meanwhile,
has launched unprecedented inspection sweeps of the dairy industry,
which had largely fallen below the agency's radar. Since the first
two men, Jose Alatorre and Enrique Araiza, passed out and drowned
inside a manure pond pump pit in February 2001, Cal/OSHA has carried
out 166 inspections, 50% more than in the entire preceding decade.
The agency has levied nearly half a million dollars in fines for a
wide range of safety problems, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths, and the sudden scrutiny by regulators, have shaken the
state's 2,000 dairy farms, many of them struggling financially
because of low milk prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately it takes a bad event for us to wake up," said
Xavier Avila, president of the California Dairy Campaign, an
association of family-run dairies. "It is a hazard. Everybody knows
about it, and I think they just get sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, the tragedies have left a streak of grief, from the
fog-shrouded towns where the workers lived to the Mexican pueblos in
Guanajuato and Jalisco, where they lie buried.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother and I were always together. Without him, I feel like I
am missing my arms," said Jose Ortiz, 37, a soft-spoken man with
chiseled features. "One asks why. But there's no answer. There's no
remedy."</TE>
<TE>   Jose had left the irrigation company about three years ago for a
union-wage warehouse job that offered him and his family a better
future. Sergio, 42, planned to follow, once he improved his English.</TE>
<TE>   Turlock Irrigation Construction Co., Sergio Ortiz's employer,
remains under investigation by Cal/OSHA, an agency spokesman said.
The company had been hired by the Rego Dairy, where Ortiz died, to
replace a gate on its manure-pumping system.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier deaths of Alatorre and Araiza, employees of the Aguiar
Faria Dairy, resulted in more than $166,000 in OSHA fines, which that
dairy is appealing. The Merced County district attorney is also
investigating Aguiar Faria for possible criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Garner, Ortiz's boss, said he found out only after the fact
about the deadly gases that can rise from manure water.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot that day," said Garner, who is now trying to
craft a safety program for workers entering confined spaces, as
required by law. "Unfortunately, it was too late."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Larry Kazanjian said owners of the Aguiar Faria dairy
were "devastated" by the fatalities on their farm.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the dairy had not taken all the precautions
required by law, but said many small dairies are guilty of the same
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a small mom-and-pop dairy farm, like many in the Valley.
There's a level of sophistication that does not exist with many of
these farmers that they need to have a confined space safety
program," Kazanjian said. "Maybe now it will."</TE>
<TE>   Before the deaths, workers without safety equipment regularly
entered the concrete sump to unclog the pumping system, said Arsenio
Araiza, brother of one of the men who died at Aguiar Faria. After the
incident, Arsenio was asked to drain the open-air lagoon. Although he
says he never had to enter the confined area where gases can
accumulate, he nevertheless felt unsafe and quit last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Rules on the Books</TE>
<TE>   Cal/OSHA requires that workers be trained in confined-space
hazards; that the air be tested before and during entry; that
respiratory equipment be provided; that workers be lowered into the
space on a harness; and that a second worker remain outside at all
times to perform rescues.</TE>
<TE>   But few farmers appear to carry out such measures, the agency
said. A trend toward bigger operations, with more cows, often means
more maintenance is required to prevent corroded floodgates from
jamming and pumps from clogging with field detritus, said Bill
Krycia, Cal/OSHA's agricultural enforcement coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers must be warned against complacency because workers can
enter one of the concrete structures dozens of times without incident
before tragedy strikes, Krycia said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent deaths in Gustine were not the first to prove the
dangers of animal waste to farm workers. Dozens have died in similar
circumstances in regions where cold weather dictates that the manure
pits be enclosed. In 1989, five family members from three generations
all died in one Midwestern manure pit. After those deaths the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued an
alert. It renewed the warning in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In California, manure and water are gathered in open air lagoons
and often rerouted by irrigation systems to fertilize crops of
alfalfa, corn and winter forage. It is the system that delivers the
witch's brew to the fields that has claimed lives.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers, including Ray Souza of Turlock, think the answer is
keeping workers away from the gases entirely. Souza hires a
contractor who uses cranes to lift malfunctioning pumps from their
concrete housings for servicing. With that system, workers don't
enter areas that can fill with methane and hydrogen sulfide.</TE>
<TE>   Souza, past president of the Western United Dairymen, also helps
direct grants to farmers who participate in a pilot program to
convert captured methane to electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "At one time we looked at manure as a liability. Today it's a
resource," Souza said.</TE>
<TE>   The three deaths in Gustine bore remarkable similarities: In the
2001 incident, the 29-year-old Araiza climbed into a pump pit and
fainted from the fumes. When Alatorre, 22, went to his co-worker's
rescue, he passed out too and landed in the waste. Both drowned in
the stinking liquid -- Araiza with only a ChapStick, a pocketknife
and one dime in his pockets, Alatorre with eight pennies and a few
stray twigs. Both men had manure in their lungs. It was Alatorre's
first wedding anniversary, said his wife, Angelica Hernandez, 25.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a very unbecoming way to pass," said Merced County
Deputy Coroner Stephen Morris. "I thought after those two, 'that
won't happen again.' I figured everybody would be on board."</TE>
<TE>   But it did happen again, just a few miles down the road, when
Sergio Ortiz and his partner were sent to the Rego Dairy to replace
the gate on a manure flush pump. Ortiz passed out and his co-worker
tried to rescue him. He managed to lift Ortiz's head from the manure
water, but became dizzy and had to climb out, said Jose Ortiz and his
brother's boss, Garner.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Ortiz died, however, regulators were already moving in
on the industry, startled by the Aguiar Faria deaths and two other
deaths of dairy workers who suffocated under fallen hay bales.</TE>
<TE>   The manure deaths -- while much less common than deaths from farm
equipment, falls and livestock accidents -- prompted the worker
safety agency to refocus its 3-year-old agricultural health and
safety project. In the past, the project has concentrated on crop
farming, with a particular emphasis on punishing employers who failed
to provide adequate drinking water and toilets for field hands. Last
year, dairy farming joined the list.</TE>
<TE>   The inspections unveiled dozens of infractions for improper gear
for protecting eyes and hands, for hazardous machinery and for other
problems. Agency records dating back a dozen years also show deaths
from toxic manure fumes similar to the Gustine incidents in 1990 and
1999, in the Central Valley towns of Stevinson and Hanford.</TE>
<TE>   "We were having fatalities and we were just not getting out to
dairies....California is now the No. 1 dairy state. We're all very
proud of them. They have happy cows," Krycia said, referring to a
dairy marketing campaign. "Now we want safe and healthy workers."</TE>
<TE>   Averting Tragedy</TE>
<TE>   Heightened precautions could avert more tragedy, the families of
the three dead workers say, but they do little to ease the pain of
loss. Jose Ortiz feels his brother's absence every morning when he
peeks into his garage at Sergio's truck, a new white Nissan pickup
that he purchased, free and clear, with painstakingly saved cash.</TE>
<TE>   When Jose's twin boys ask yearningly for their uncle, he fibs that
Sergio has gone to Mexico for a visit. In January, Jose plans a trip
to Santa Rosalia, his family's home in the Mexican state of Jalisco,
to help build his brother's tombstone.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his mother, who stares from Jose's photo album with the
ruddy determination of a rural matron, remains in the dark. The
surviving siblings conferred with their father, a lanky campesino who
cooks chicharrones -- fried pork rinds -- outdoors on an open flame,
and decided to lie.</TE>
<TE>   First, they told their mother that Sergio had had an accident and
was hospitalized. Then, over the course of 20 days, they told her he
was getting worse, until finally he succumbed. They never gave her
the details.</TE>
<TE>   "Two men had already died, so they should have known," said Jose
Ortiz. "It could have been avoided."</TE>
<TE>   Like the families of the other two men, he has hired a lawyer. But
with some resignation, Jose Ortiz concluded: "I can only hope that it
won't happen to somebody else."</TE>

<HD>Marines Inoculate 5,000 Against Strep-A Spread</HD>
<DH>An 18-year-old recruit complains of a skin rash and hours
later is dead; authorities don't believe his case is tied to the
bacterial outbreak.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>On the day that 5,000 Marine recruits were being inoculated to stop
the spread of a potentially lethal bacteria, an 18-year-old recruit
died Sunday just hours after seeking medical attention for an ankle
rash. By the time Pvt. Miguel Zavala of Greenfield, Calif., died at
the Naval Regional Medical Center in Balboa Park, the rash had
covered much of his body, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Infectious disease experts at the medical center do not believe
Zavala's death is linked to the current outbreak of Group A
streptococcal bacteria, medical center spokesman Doug Sayers said.</LD>
<LD>   Sayers said officials will have a better idea of the cause of
death after an autopsy, planned today.</LD>
<TE>   Although streptococcal bacteria is most commonly reflected in a
sore throat and general aches, it can, in its most extreme form,
cause necrotizing fasciitis -- so-called flesh-eating bacteria -- or
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Those conditions are fatal in about 20% of patients, according to
statistics gathered by the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   One sign of the onset of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a
flat red rash over large parts of the body.</TE>
<TE>   The 5,000 recruits at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot -- one of two
recruit training centers for the Marine Corps -- were given
inoculations of antibiotics in response to an outbreak of Strep-A
bacteria last week. More than 60 recruits are still hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   "This can be the source of fatal pneumonia," said Navy Capt. J.D.
Malone, director of medical services at the center. "That's why we're
being so aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Zavala's death was the third at the recruit depot in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The other two fatalities came after strenuous training exercises
and are not thought to be linked to the Strep-A outbreak, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Recruits, young men from the Western half of the United States,
are given penicillin shots twice during training. The mass
inoculation Sunday was the first in 11 years, since the last large
outbreak of Strep A, a bacteria found to flourish among school
children and college students in close living quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to get a shot in your left butt cheek, all right?"
asked Navy corpsman Maricar Vergara.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, ma'am," came the shouted reply from two dozen wide-eyed
recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanliness Stressed</TE>
<TE>   Drill instructors stress the need for cleanliness. Indeed,
recruits are taught to wash before they are taught to fight. But
problems persist.</TE>
<TE>   "Recruits come in from all over the country and they bring
infections from all over the country," Malone said.</TE>
<TE>   Malone and Maj. Gen. Jan Huly, commanding officer of the depot,
were to address Zavala's death, the Strep-A outbreak and the other
two training deaths at a news conference today.</TE>
<TE>   Pvt. Neal Edwards, 18, of St. Clair, Mo., died Nov. 24 after
collapsing during training on an obstacle course. He played high
school football, was reportedly in top-notch health and hoped to
become a combat engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Pvt. Samuel J. Bruss, 19, of Kenosha, Wis., died Thursday after
survival training at the base swimming pool, where recruits were
taught to swim while dressed in full combat gear.</TE>
<TE>   Bruss was an avid outdoorsman and strong swimmer, according to his
family. He has an older brother in the Marines serving in the Persian
Gulf area.</TE>
<TE>   With 20,000 recruits a year completing basic training at the depot
adjacent to Lindbergh Field, there have been seven deaths since 1995,
including one suicide, two fatalities after the 1.5-mile run, and one
after the obstacle course.</TE>
<TE>   Before the development of antibiotics, Strep A was a scourge of
military training camps, leading to large-scale casualties in World
Wars I and II.</TE>
<TE>   To stop the spread of the bacteria, all recruits were marched to
the base medical facilities where doctors, nurses and corpsmen
administered throat swabs, examinations and the inoculations.
Recruits with potential allergic reactions were screened for
alternative treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It stings, sir," said Thomas Bonwell, 21 of Dublin, Ind., as he
rubbed his left buttock.</TE>
<TE>   Drill instructors, civilian food-handlers and others with close
contact with the recruits were also given the inoculations.</TE>
<TE>   Some recruits devised ways to reduce the discomfort. "I'm just not
going to look when they do it," said Andrew Woods, 19, of South
Roxana, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Others took the shot as just another challenge in the grueling
12-week testing process to see how badly they want to join an elite
fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   "I've wanted to be a Marine for a long time," said William Bake,
19, of College Corner, Ohio. "This is a small price to pay."</TE>

<HD>Developers' Pacts With Consultants Questioned</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Richard Fausset and Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reacting to disclosures that Newhall Land &amp; Farming destroyed
endangered plants on its property, environmental activists and some
planners are calling for restrictions on confidentiality agreements
that prevent environmental consultants from sharing information with
the public.</LD>
<LD>   The existence of suspected fields of San Fernando Valley
spineflowers, an endangered plant that lives on property that Newhall
Land wants to use for housing, was not revealed for two years after
the flowers were discovered. That was because the consulting
botanists who located them were required by Newhall Land to sign a
confidentiality agreement -- an increasingly common legal practice
that critics contend violates the spirit of state environmental laws.</LD>
<LD>   Such agreements are made possible by policies in Los Angeles
County and some other jurisdictions that allow developers to select
consultants to write environmental impact reports. The county
officials say that having the county directly control the consultants
would be too cumbersome.</LD>
<TE>   But some critics and planning experts say that allowing developers
to guide the writers of environmental impact reports -- rather than
insisting they work directly for the county -- essentially lets
builders police themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jan Chatten-Brown wants state lawmakers to bar the
practice but says there has been little interest in Sacramento.
"People have said, 'Where are the horror stories?' " she said. "Well,
here it is!"</TE>
<TE>   In May of 2000, the state Department of Fish and Game recommended
that Newhall Land search its 12,000 acres for the spineflower, which
had been believed extinct until it was rediscovered on another
development site in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The developer retained an environmental consultant to look for the
plants. The consultants found one stand of spineflowers, then located
several other fields spread throughout areas slated for high-density
housing. But Newhall Land did not send the samples from the other
fields to labs to confirm they were the protected plant. Instead, the
developer ordered its consultants to stop surveying and reminded them
they had signed a confidentiality agreement, court records and
company officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Fish and Game officers began investigating reports
that Newhall Land was underreporting and destroying spineflowers on
its site. The investigation was stymied when the biologists who
discovered the tiny plants refused to give officials any details of
their findings, citing the confidentiality statements they had signed
with the company, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   In environmental documents filed with the county Dec. 2, after a
search warrant served on the Newhall Land property and an
investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office,
the developer acknowledged the earlier discovery of other
spineflowers and the "unconfirmed" ones that the developer had never
tested. By that time, Newhall Land had plowed under what state
officials say were thousands of flowers in what the developer says
was a farming operation.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said the company makes all
its environmental consultants sign confidentiality statements. In the
case of the spineflower, she said, all the information became public
when the company released its revised environmental impact report
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that we do eventually becomes public," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, some say confidentiality agreements violate the spirit
of the law that governs development -- the California Environmental
Quality Act, which requires a public review of projects that could do
ecological harm.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Roberts, a former city planner and head of the state
clearinghouse in the Office of Planning Research, said she was
surprised that consultants would be required to sign confidentiality
agreements. "An important purpose of the CEQA process is to have all
of this information to be made public," Roberts said, stressing that
she was speaking generally, not addressing the Newhall Land case
specifically.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Chatten-Brown, who was co-counsel in a lawsuit that
forced the developer to rewrite parts of its environmental review,
said that "the confidentiality requirement is clearly [antithetical]
to the intent of CEQA."</TE>
<TE>   And Darryl Koutnik, head of the county's impact analysis division,
said the county tries to counter confidentiality agreements by
requiring all developers to include every consultant's report in
final environmental documents.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, confidentiality deals are "obviously a bad thing
as far as public disclosure. The company ... proposing the
information will then be able to control what gets put out and what
doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Koutnik said such agreements are increasing, which he attributed
to the rise in lawsuits attempting to block development. In recent
months, members of the California Native Plant Society have been
considering starting a certification program for botanists that would
include a code of ethics. Some are now wondering whether that code
should include a ban on confidentiality statements.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep reviewing environmental documents prepared by botanists
that are just incompetent, or they're committing fraud and twisting
the facts," said David Magney, a past president of the society who is
heading up the certification effort. "Then, when a company like
Newhall forces all of their biologists to sign confidentiality
statements, it makes things that much harder to track down."</TE>
<TE>   While some consultants fear losing business if they do not sign
confidentiality agreements, others, such as Santa Clarita biologist
Frank Hovore, refuse to sign them outright. At the Sacramento
consulting company Jones &amp; Stokes, confidentiality is fine for
surveys that are not part of the state environmental review process.
But staff attorney Ken Bogdan said that the company always fully
discloses its findings to government when it is preparing California
Environmental Quality Act reports.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County allows Newhall Land and other developers to
select and manage the consultants who file environmental documents.
Only after the documents are filed does the county's planning agency
double-check them.</TE>
<TE>   A few other large jurisdictions, the city of San Francisco for
one, use the same procedure, but most government agencies prefer to
have a direct relationship with consultants, planning experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that this favors the applicants," said
William Fulton, a former planning consultant who has written books on
development in Southern California. "And given that unincorporated
L.A. County has a reputation as a pro-development jurisdiction, it's
politically convenient."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials say they scrupulously fact-check the
assertions of developers' consultants. "Some consultants have worked
with us really well, and others have presented us with a very
difficult situation and have tended to resist some of the direction
they have been given," said Don Culbertson, administrator of the
county's planning division. "Until we have a document that we believe
represents a significant draft for public review, it doesn't go
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as the spineflower case illustrates, developers control the
information under Los Angeles County's procedures. Koutnik said
officials can do only so many inspections with the resources they
have. He is one of only two biologists on the planning department's
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "We would love to be able to have sufficient staffing to be able
to monitor those activities and keep abreast of them," Koutnik said.
"But we're so swamped with so many different cases across the county
that we simply don't have enough staff to keep up with the
activities."</TE>

<HD>Police Fatally Shoot Man Armed With Knives</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood police shot and killed a man early Sunday after he
repeatedly stabbed himself and then lunged at a woman with two
knives, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers went to the house on Market Street after authorities
received a 911 "hang up" call about 12:30 a.m., but the suspect had
apparently fled the home, said Inglewood police Lt. Eve Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The victim called 911 again at 7:15 a.m., and this time officers
found the man, armed with two knives, and threatening "to hurt
someone," Irvine said.</LD>
<TE>   Police heard screaming from inside the house, but the man blocked
the entry at the front door, Irvine said.</TE>
<TE>   The man ignored orders to drop his knives and began stabbing
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Officers fired at least one beanbag round to get him to stop, but
it proved ineffective and he continue to wound himself, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The man allowed an older woman and a child to leave the house, but
when the woman tried to leave, he "lunged at her in a threatening
manner," Irvine said. "At that time several officers shot the
suspect."</TE>
<TE>   The man was taken to a hospital where he died of his wounds. His
name was not released pending notification of family, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death.</TE>

<DH>Who gets to go behind the green door at Disneyland's
exclusive Club 33? People who've waited years to join and paid
thousands for the privilege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And you thought the wait for Splash Mountain was long.</LD>
<LD>   Try getting into Disneyland's Club 33, a private establishment
that has served gourmet meals to princes and presidents, pop stars
and politicians. The club is just now mailing membership invitations
to people who added their name to the waiting list in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The club's unobtrusive entrance, in Disneyland's New Orleans
Square, is a green door that stays locked. There are no signs
pointing the way, only a placard with the address: 33.</LD>
<TE>   Most Disneyland guests don't know Club 33 exists, or write it off
as another Disney urban legend.</TE>
<TE>   It's not in the phone book and doesn't appear on any Disneyland
map.</TE>
<TE>   But it is real, and so is the address -- 33 Royal St. -- even if
it is located somewhere between Adventureland and Critter Country.</TE>
<TE>   Although one popular myth has it that 33 is the number of initial
Disneyland investors, Club 33 got its name from the address, which
was required in order to obtain a liquor license from Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control.</TE>
<TE>   (It remains the only place at Disneyland to serve alcohol.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's the secrecy of it," said Anaheim resident Dale Mattson, who
has been on the waiting list for a year. "It really has the
reputation and aura of being a Prohibition speak-easy. I think that's
what appeals to people."</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Walt Disney, but opened in 1967 after his death, the
club was conceived as his private dining room where he could
entertain investors and business associates.</TE>
<TE>   Membership is capped at 450. Advancement on the waiting list
happens only when members resign or die. Club manager Jeff Plumb
swears there's no pass that jumps celebrities to the front of the
line.</TE>
<TE>   "We treat a celebrity like our other guests, and we treat our
guests like a VIP," says maitre d' Russell Trahan.</TE>
<TE>   Initiation fees -- depending on the corporate or individual
membership levels -- are about $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the annual dues: Disney officials will say only
that those run "in the thousands," but members say the annual cost is
about $3,000 to $6,000, depending on membership type.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a $45 minimum for every meal. Nonmembers can get in,
but they have to make reservations through a club member.</TE>
<TE>   Dues buy access to both Disneyland and Club 33, where meals
feature such dishes as pancetta-wrapped halibut on manila clam
linguine and porcini mushroom spinach and fontina ravioli.</TE>
<TE>   The food is prepared by executive chef Marcel St. Pierre, who was
trained at the Culinary Institute of America, and is offered with
wine pairings selected by three sommeliers from the club's extensive
cellar.</TE>
<TE>   At one time the club offered its own private-label wine. It was
discontinued, but Plumb said they hope to bring it back.</TE>
<TE>   The food is great, but that's not why member Kerry Rutkin, 50, of
Huntington Beach said he loves Club 33.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do I start?" gushed Rutkin, an eight-year member who waited
about three years to join. "I love the whole thing. I like the
exclusivity of it. I love calling up and talking to the people who
make the reservations. I love the atmosphere, the privacy, the
peacefulness. It's like you're not in Disneyland anymore."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most fun aspects, Rutkin said, is getting through the
door. Members are buzzed in, but only after their names are
double-checked.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's a giant line for Blue Bayou [a nearby restaurant],
people are dumbfounded," Rutkin said. "People grab you and say, 'Can
you get me in there?' A lot of people are dumbstruck that the door
actually opens."</TE>
<TE>   The few who pass through the doors enter a place decidedly
un-Disney. Sure, there are a few Disney touches -- Mickey-shaped
pasta and Mickey-shaped chocolates on the cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   But the elegant decor is more reminiscent of "Gone With the Wind"
than Cinderella's castle.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, an elevator -- modeled after one Walt Disney admired
at a Paris inn during the filming of "Bon Voyage!" -- transports
diners to the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   There's an oak telephone booth from "The Happiest Millionaire" and
a French-antique-style table, carved from a tree stump, that Disney's
wife bought while in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Servers like to point out the microphones in the chandeliers of
the smaller Trophy Room (capacity 33 diners), where Disney once hoped
to film people during their meals so their interactions could be
played back later as entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   He also planned to intersperse commentary from the animal
likenesses mounted on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Members might glimpse a celebrity. Elton John has been known to
frequent Club 33 (officials won't say whether he's a member or a
guest) and play the antique harpsichord.</TE>
<TE>   And, at the right time, you might spot fireworks through the
window or hear a saxophonist making his way through New Orleans
Square.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Gabour, who has worked at Club 33 for 28 years, likes to
tell of the time Prince Rainier of Monaco visited. The maitre d', to
the horror of the service staff, dropped a cup of coffee, spilling it
over the prince's white patent leather shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Rainier handled the situation with aplomb. "But sir, I did not
order coffee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plumb said the club has by-laws, though he prefers not to call
them rules.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to have a membership yanked, but a member would
have to do something "very, very, very bad." Disneyland frowns upon
people profiting from their membership.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations and exclusive Club 33 merchandise, available only at
the restaurant the day of a visit, should not be auctioned online,
according to the bylaws.</TE>
<TE>   Plumb said he once bid on an eBay item in an attempt to determine
the seller's identity, and Disney officials have been known to send
letters requesting that items not be sold.</TE>
<TE>   Few people, though, want to risk their prized membership because
they know there are dozens of Club 33 fans biding their time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little pricey," said Mattson, the nonmember. "But it's
worth every penny."</TE>
<TE>   At least that's what he hopes. He's still got three (he hopes)
years to wait.</TE>

<HD>City Hall Plays Santa</HD>
<DH>South Gate offers residents free trash pickup and chances
to win a house and TV. Four city officials face recall in January.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Gate's besieged leaders, one facing criminal charges and others
a recall election, seem to some residents these days to be trying to
be more like Santa Claus than the bearded fat man in the red suit who
rode in the city's annual Christmas parade Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   They have offered free trash service this month to every home.
They have unveiled a plan for some free medical care at a new health
clinic. One lucky resident will get a new television set in a lottery
being publicized by the city.</LD>
<LD>   And the biggest gift? A new two-story house for the lucky
ticket-holder in a free raffle. Thousands are expected to line up at
City Hall beginning today to get their raffle tickets.</LD>
<TE>   The council wants to give one resident in this working-class city
a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home to "realize the American dream," said
the city newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   The free trash service, the newsletter said, is the result of the
council's concern for the "economic hardship that families face this
holiday season."</TE>
<TE>   To critics, the giveaways are intended to sway voters in the
January recall election. Voters will be asked whether they want to
oust the city's perceived political boss, Treasurer Albert Robles,
and his three City Council allies: Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Vice
Mayor Raul Moriel and Councilwoman Maria Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   Robles is on trial, charged with threatening to kill public
officials, which he has denied. He was all smiles Sunday at the
Christmas parade as he rode down the city's main drag in a red, white
and blue convertible Cadillac, wishing thousands of residents a merry
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Hernandez, who was waving a recall sign, jeered as he rode
by. She criticized the council for using nearly $1 million of city
funds for Robles' criminal defense in the death-threats case and a
grand jury investigation into allegations of electoral fraud. He was
not charged in that case. "Robles and the council are trying to buy
the people," she said. "We want Albert Robles and his people out."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Mer, however, doubted that officials are trying to influence
voters. The factory worker and father of three plans to get raffle
tickets, but said the giveaways would not influence his vote.</TE>
<TE>   "If I won the house, I'd tell them thank you, but I wouldn't
necessarily vote for them," Mer said.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign controversy is nothing new in this community where the
political landscape includes alleged intimidation tactics, violence
and false campaign mailers. One council member was shot in the head,
the vans of a political activist who opposed the council majority
were firebombed and the city clerk was falsely labeled a drunk driver
in a campaign mailer.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing what might come next, the state Legislature took control
of the recall election from the city and gave it to Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   The targeted officials reject claims by recall supporters that
they are corrupt and have fought the recall effort for months in the
courts. State officials, maintaining that the leaders have
manipulated the electoral process, have promised to monitor the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But even with such scrutiny, some said, campaign shenanigans
haven't stopped.</TE>
<TE>   From today through early January, 35,000 people are expected to
descend on City Hall to get raffle tickets for the home giveaway. Any
resident older than 18 who isn't a homeowner is eligible for one
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will be picked at a special City Council meeting on
Jan. 6. Construction has not started on the $165,000 house, but the
city-owned site across from an elementary school is "waiting for the
dream house to be built!" the city newsletter promises.</TE>
<TE>   Raffle tickets for the television are being given to residents who
register to vote. The television is being provided by an area
businessman, but the raffle is being promoted with city funds.</TE>
<TE>   The health-care plan was unveiled earlier this month when the
council agreed to pay for rental space for a nonprofit medical
clinic, where, they said, some medical care will be provided free.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Jesus Marez has denied that the free trash removal
and giveaways are part of the council's campaign efforts.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the free-home idea came up in a talk with Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba and that the city's legal department determined
that it would not be an illegal gift of public funds.</TE>
<TE>   But others disagreed. Councilman Hector De La Torre, a Robles
critic, said the council is using taxpayer funds to hold "showy
events" and buy the public's goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to hide the fact that they're running the city
into the ground and the fact that Albert's on trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some in this largely Latino city of 96,000 said the giveaways
remind them of some Mexican political campaigns in which politicians
regularly treat residents to food baskets and free toys before big
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "They only do it for the elections," said Felix Perez, an
immigrant from Jalisco, Mexico. "Afterward they forget their
promises, and only work to benefit themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters have gathered 8,000 signatures, but they fear
that the council's recent moves will sway many voters. South Gate is
among the poorest cities in the county, they said, and many people
live paycheck to paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   One man even joked that his sentiments could change.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it would influence me, unless I'm the one who gets
lucky," Santiago Fregoso said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, whose trial enters its second week today, declined to
comment. He is charged with threatening two state legislators, a
political consultant and a South Gate police lieutenant. Ruvalcaba
also declined to comment. Other council members were not available
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their leaders' troubles, some still support them, saying
that they are happy with city services and that Robles shouldn't be
judged until his trial is over.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Manuel Zavala was impressed with the city's new trash
company because employees came to his backyard to help him throw out
an old sofa.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the council] is working good," said Zavala. "I know many
people are complaining about them, but I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   As the politicians rode down Tweedy Boulevard in separate cars
Sunday, they drew scattered applause and a few boos. When Robles' car
rolled by the reviewing stand, a Spanish-language announcer boomed
over the loudspeaker:</TE>
<TE>   "Here comes our city treasurer, Albert Robles. He's the one that
manages our money."</TE>
<TE>   A few people waved, some jeered, but the crowd's attention quickly
returned to the high school bands, Aztec dancers and sombrero-clad
cowboys riding horses that danced to Mexican ranchera music.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, who was that guy?" one young man asked another after Robles
passed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," said the man. "I think he was the mayor."</TE>

<LD>The city may soon build four publicly owned power plants under a
settlement reached with one of the companies accused of price-gouging
Californians during the 2000-01 energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The plants would be powered by natural gas-fired turbines supplied
free by Williams Energy Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., which agreed Friday to
pay the state of California about $150 million over eight years and
to reduce its 10-year, $4.3-billion contract with the state by about
$1.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The company also will provide the state with six
electric-generation turbines valued at $90 million. Four of them will
be in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the state agreed to drop all legal claims
alleging price-gouging by the company. It will continue to
investigate Williams' alleged role in manipulating natural gas
prices.</TE>

<HD>Harbor to Put Security to Test</HD>
<DH>New safeguards could offer valuable lessons to deter
terrorism. But the challenge will be to not disrupt flow of cargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are being
transformed into testing grounds for new devices and strategies
designed to deter terrorism, particularly the threat of a nuclear
bomb.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge, authorities say, is to balance the new safeguards
with the flow of commerce in the nation's busiest harbor complex,
where 15,000 tractor-trailer-sized cargo containers arrive from
around the world each day.</LD>
<LD>   "Given that uninspected containers are a logical entry vehicle for
a weapon of mass destruction, this is an important area for testing
new security technology," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), a member
of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. "The
lessons we learn from these systems will have broader applications
everywhere in the country."</LD>
<TE>   By the end of next year, authorities expect the waterfront to
bristle with video camera systems, motion sensors and radiation
detectors able to sniff out a nuclear bomb in a container on a train
traveling past at 30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicious cargo may be scrutinized at a $40-million inspection
center planned for Terminal Island and funded by a variety of revenue
sources, including state and federal counter-terrorism programs, as
well as the local ports, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Port Police, once a backwater agency dedicated to
keeping thieves and drug smugglers off the docks, will move into a
40,000-square-foot headquarters connected to video surveillance
cameras scanning operations between the Vincent Thomas Bridge and the
breakwater.</TE>
<TE>   The Homeland Security Department's Transportation Security
Administration and local authorities aim to fund a $35-million
credential system that will involve plastic identification cards
containing every port worker's holographic photograph, fingerprints,
signature, driver's license number and criminal background.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,500-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union has
long opposed credential systems if they include extensive criminal
background checks, arguing that they would amount to an unfair
invasion of privacy. Union officials Friday were reluctant to comment
on the current proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Experimental tamper-proof locks and other security systems will be
tested next year on Los Angeles-bound containers before they leave
Hong Kong's Modern Terminals under a program to be partly funded by
the U.S. Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Under that program, "the port will be working partners with
foreign port officials and terminal operators to establish new
protocols and technology prototypes for screening and securing
containers before they leave for Los Angeles," said Mayor James K.
Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to be at the forefront of security because only
when our ports are safe and secure can we do our best to expand
economic vitality."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the Long Beach Police Department has added boats to its
arsenal, and "no fishing" signs are going up wherever freight is
moved near the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   New Team Deployed</TE>
<TE>   Only a month ago, the Coast Guard stationed a new 72-member marine
safety and security team in San Pedro that is trained for
close-quarters battle at sea. It is ready for deployment anywhere on
the West Coast on 12 hours' notice.</TE>
<TE>   The team's mission is maritime homeland security, with a focus on
protecting the nation's 50 major ports. Its duties range from routine
harbor patrols to intercepting hijacked ships.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to sit by and let another Sept. 11 happen in this
water," Coast Guard Petty Officer Chuck Ashmore said as he boomed
across the harbor in one of the team's specially designed boats
powered by dual 225-horsepower engines and armed with two .60-caliber
machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, he pulled up alongside a dock where
commercial divers were working on the hull of a foreign freighter.
After team members eyeballed the operation and asked the divers for
proof of identification, Ashmore turned his boat around and sped off
to intercept a fishing hauler half a mile away that was cruising
uncomfortably close to an incoming oil tanker.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out here day and night," said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Keith
Smith, who is in charge of the team. "Are we successful? Hard to say.
We may never know whether someone changed their mind about trying
something horrible because they saw us go by."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the security enhancements are less visible to the public.
For example, the Coast Guard has, for the first time, begun
conducting port security probes with plainclothes officers.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. A surprise attack on a tanker, chemical
plant, refinery, bridge or rail system in the harbor, which has a
daily population of about 200,000 and handles about 43% of the
nation's annual sea trade, could have a catastrophic effect on the
local community and the global container industry.</TE>
<TE>   Holes in Security Net</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, authorities concede that the shoreline's security
net is full of holes.</TE>
<TE>   The 20 law enforcement, fire and health agencies that serve the
harbor could be better organized, and they have yet to agree on a
common radio frequency for communication. Federal grants for port
security measures have been less than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency officials acknowledge that there is a potential for
chaos in the event of a "worst-case scenario," such as the sinking of
a freighter at the entrance to either of the harbor's two shipping
lanes, a toxic cloud rising off a major conflagration at a chemical
plant or the detonation of a "dirty bomb" -- law enforcement jargon
for a conventional explosive used to spread radioactive material.</TE>
<TE>   The ports of both Los Angeles and Long Beach have contracted with
security giant Science Applications International Corp. of San Diego,
which designed the 2002 Winter Olympics safety command center, to
help develop a coordinated response to potential terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're jazzed about the future," said Coast Guard Capt. John
Holmes, whose jurisdiction includes the Southern California
coastline. "It's exciting to know that what we are doing here now may
well change the way cargo security is handled around the world."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, the focus is on preventing terrorists from
hiding a nuclear weapon in a cargo container.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that's the biggest threat to the port," said Los Angeles
Port Police Chief Noel Cunningham. "The Osama bin Ladens of this
world are trying to find ways to penetrate our defenses. If they feel
we're guarding the ports of entry, they'll go elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   With that goal in mind, the ports have contracted with Sandia
National Laboratories in New Mexico, which is developing relatively
low-cost radiation detectors that authorities want to test at key
locations in Singapore, the harbor complex and the 20-mile-long
Alameda Corridor rail line connecting the ports with train yards just
south of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Massey, an expert on maritime security at Sandia, has
applied for federal funding to conduct the experiments.</TE>
<TE>   "Once that federal funding is turned on," he said, "I'll have the
system on the ground and working before the end of 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Customs Service spokesman Dennis Murphy said, "Los

<TE>   In the meantime, "we should continue be worried about the ports,
which remain our greatest point of vulnerability," said Councilwoman
Janice Hahn, whose district includes the Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "While we've making big strides in the effort to prevent a weapon
of mass destruction from entering the port complex," she said, "they
haven't been fast enough."</TE>

<DH>Christmas parade brings truckers from afar and casts a
favorable light on Eureka's heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Gurnon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>EUREKA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Celebrating the holiday season in true Humboldt County style, about
60 logging, construction and transportation companies decorated their
trucks with miles of lights and braved a driving rain for this city's
annual Truckers Christmas Parade.</LD>
<LD>   The convoy of semis, logging trucks, construction rigs and
industrial vehicles of all kinds wound through the streets of Eureka
on Saturday night, some honking their horns to the rhythm of "Jingle
Bells," others made up like elaborate floats, complete with moving
reindeer, waving Santas and bobbing snowmen.</LD>
<LD>   From its inception in the early 1980s, the parade has been a
celebration, not only of the holidays, but also of Eureka's
blue-collar heritage.</LD>
<TE>   "It originated because the logging industry and transportation
industry are extremely important to our community," said Hugo
Papstein, co-owner with his wife of KEKA, a local country music radio
station that sponsors the parade. "All of our goods arrive here by
truck, pretty much."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the parade was just a ragtag bunch of truckers who
wanted to do something to shore up the region's low morale. The
logging industry was beginning to see its future, and it didn't look
good.</TE>
<TE>   "It was started to try to boost the spirits in Eureka," said Dale
Bridges, a former fire chief who now volunteers as a parade
coordinator. "A few guys just put lights on their trucks and started
driving through town honking their horns."</TE>
<TE>   As the years went by, non-truckers joined the act. This year's
participants included the Air Force, the local blood bank, an
elementary school and a steel drum band.</TE>
<TE>   Though the current slow economy may have affected participation --
there were about 85 entries last year -- many truckers said they were
doing fine. The construction industry, particularly the part of it
involved in renovations and remodels, is booming.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Evans drove his new $150,000 rig all the way from Medford,
Ore., for the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent all day yesterday getting this all dolled up," he said,
running his fingers along the polished edges of the 65-foot flatbed,
which was festooned with red lights. "It's pretty dressy."</TE>
<TE>   Other trucks were expected from as far away as Santa Rosa, about
four hours to the south.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid growing up in Eureka, Isaac Burgess watched the truckers
parade every year. The 23-year-old, who now delivers ice cream and
beer for Customer Truck Service, decorated one of his company's rigs
with nearly 16,000 lights for this year's parade.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the truckers said they go to the trouble because it's a
community event that makes people happy. Thousands of spectators
lined the route.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go along the route, you see the old people, the senior
citizens. They get a big ol' smile on their face; it makes you feel
you're doing your part," said Rob Walters, who drives a 10-wheeler
for Hensell Materials Inc. of Eureka. "This is a big thing for the
area."</TE>
<TE>   Locals aren't the only ones who appreciate the parade. James
Harring of San Francisco said he and a group of friends travel to the
North Coast each year for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "We make a weekend event out of it," he said. "It's just so
different.</TE>
<TE>   You'd never find this in the city. People I work with are, 'You're
gonna go where to see what?' "</TE>

<HD>Renowned Jazz Trumpeter Finds Harmony and Connection in
Piru</HD>
<DH>Wadada Leo Smith, who teaches at CalArts, says his destiny
is tied to that of Miles Davis, who lived near Malibu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little more than a decade ago, Ventura County could lay claim to
the great Miles Davis, who spent his last few years just this side of
the Ventura County line near Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis isn't the only renowned jazzman to settle here -- since
1993, Piru has been home to another trumpeter who's also
internationally known -- although in more esoteric circles.</LD>
<LD>   Wadada Leo Smith, who turns 61 this week, lives with his wife,
poet Harumi Makino Smith, in a house next door to percussionist and
fellow California Institute of the Arts instructor John Bergamo. A
small studio sits between them, awaiting musical activities.</LD>
<TE>   Smith was delighted when informed of the Miles Davis connection.
"Our destiny is hooked up," Smith said. "The artist I most dream
about, other than Duke Ellington, is Miles Davis. Because I was
initiated as a Sufi some years ago, I know what dreams are. That's
communication."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has long been interested in the spiritual paths of Islam,
Sufism and the Rastafarian life, hence the adopted name Wadada,
meaning "love."</TE>
<TE>   And Miles Davis' music and legacy have figured into Smith's
musical life in the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was the central figure in a well-received CD in 1998 called
"Yo Miles!" a tribute to Davis' "electric" period of the '70s. This
fall, Smith's Golden Quartet released an album on the Pi label, "The
Year of the Elephant," which includes a free-spirited acoustic
version of a suite called "Miles Star in 3 Parts." Also on "The Year
of the Elephant," Smith pays tribute to his adopted hometown with the
introspective ballad "Piru."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Quartet, with drummer Jack DeJohnette, bassist Malachi
Favors and pianist Anthony Davis is Smith's "dream ensemble,"
although scheduling concerts is a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, they played before an enthusiastic throng in New
York's Central Park, opening for Sonic Youth. Their first recording,
done in 2000, was one of an ongoing series of Smith's recordings for
the Tzadic label.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a faculty member at CalArts in Valencia since being granted
the Dizzy Gillespie chair in 1993, loves his new hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful town," Smith said. "You can walk from one end of
town to the other in 30 minutes, both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "The other beautiful thing is that it's semirural. Next door,
there are pigs and a bull used for studding. There are lots of trees.
We hear birds and bats. I was born in a small town, a little bit
bigger than this, but not much. I've always enjoyed living in small
towns."</TE>
<TE>   His journey began in his birthplace of Leland, Miss. He was lured
into music by his stepfather, Alex "Little Bill" Wallace, a
guitarist-singer "in the same tradition of the Delta bluesmen," Smith
said. "He was a very authentic player."</TE>
<TE>   Smith landed in Chicago in the '60s, in time to get involved in
the legendary Assn. for the Advancement of Creative Music, led by
pianist Richard Muhal Abrams. The organization's best-known group was
the Art Ensemble of Chicago, which featured bassist Favors, now in
Smith's Golden Quartet. Smith also met and performed with DeJohnette
in his Chicago days, after the drummer had played a show there with
Miles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "In that instant," Smith recalls of his first meeting with
DeJohnette, "I immediately said to myself, 'I would like to make
music with this man.' "</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his performing and recording work, Smith found a
parallel life in academia. After studying at the Sherwood Music
School in Chicago and at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, he began
teaching -- first at the University of New Haven, then the Creative
Music Studio in Woodstock, N.Y., then Bard College and now CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz and classical may be Smith's current genres, but his
inspiration began with the blues, he said. "I believe that the blues
is the foundation of American music," he said. "I believe that that
foundation can never change, because when the foundation changes,
everything else changes."</TE>
<TE>   For all of Smith's unstoppable creative momentum at the moment,
he's growing frustrated by what he perceives as a lack of recognition
for music outside the mainstream, such as his own. He also senses a
distorted perspective on the music of African American artists,
including a certain Santa Ynez Valley resident whose pictures have
been in the news lately.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Michael Jackson. Who has done more for American music
than Michael Jackson? Not many. Before he came out, everybody was
singing everybody else's songs. They worked in song factories.</TE>
<TE>   "But every time I see a mention of him on the tube, he's
denigrated. If I see anybody who's black and doing anything
important, they're belittled. It's a very strange planet right now."</TE>
<TE>   Smith's own musical work touches on the avant-garde jazz scene as
well as contemporary classical circles and occasional electric jazz
groups. It's very much an artistic existence in progress, based out
of beautiful Piru.</TE>
<TE>   And he sees his work -- and that of all artists -- as necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists nourish the society and give people the courage to not
only keep believing," he said, "but to actually understand realities
about their social system."</TE>

<HD>Pizza Magnate Has University Plan Cooking</HD>
<DH>Florida campus would be home to the nation's first new
Catholic campus in a generation. A 'spiritual military academy' is
the vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IMMOKALEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>On pool-table flat farmland where peppers, tomatoes and sod have been
grown, Thomas S. Monaghan, onetime fast-food magnate, is pursuing
what may be the last phase of his life's work: the saving of souls.</LD>
<LD>   "My No. 1 priority now is to help as many people get to heaven as
possible," said the 65-year-old founder of Domino's Pizza and former
owner of the Detroit Tigers. "I believe the best way to do that is
education."</LD>
<LD>   The result, if Monaghan's vision and an artist's conceptions are
translated into reality, will be the first new Roman Catholic
university in the United States in a generation, built from scratch
on what is now rich agricultural land near the Everglades of
southwestern Florida.</LD>
<TE>   Conceived at a time of unprecedented trial for the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States, Ave Maria University will not be your
typical Catholic institution of higher learning, Monaghan said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the bespectacled, quiet philanthropist envisions a
"spiritual military academy," built in the Frank Lloyd Wright style
and dispensing a rigorous, faith-centered and tradition-minded
education to as many as 5,000 committed Catholics. He is willing to
put up at least $220 million of his fortune to build it.</TE>
<TE>   According to Monaghan, polls indicate that many students who
graduate from existing Catholic colleges and universities leave with
their religious faith shakier than when they entered. Many of the
schools also have a reputation, warranted or not, as "party schools,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the Vatican, changes in demographics and the
decline in young men entering the priesthood, many Catholic
educational institutions in the United States have been forced in
recent years to ponder exactly what makes them "Catholic," said
Stephen Fowl, a professor at Loyola College in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The venerable Baltimore college is an eloquent example. Founded by
the Society of Jesus in 1852, it now has only 10 Jesuit priests on
its 250-member tenured faculty. "There are 28 Jesuit colleges and
universities, and not enough priests to staff them," Fowl said.
Although an Episcopalian, he is chairman of Loyola's theology
department.</TE>
<TE>   Since 2000, a majority of the country's 230 Catholic institutions
of higher learning have no longer been run by priests, in part
because there are not enough of them, said Michael James, assistant
executive director of the Assn. of Catholic Colleges and
Universities. "We're not seeing growth in the religious orders, in
[priestly] vocations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many colleges and universities affiliated with the church,
Monaghan said, "don't emphasize the spiritual enough." That is why he
wants to start a university from the ground up, rather than make a
gift to an established school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think only 10% of Catholics would be interested in our school,"
Monaghan said. "Those who make faith the center of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Monaghan has been a lodestone for conservative Catholic causes,
and he has drawn criticism for implying that church institutions he
does not endorse are somehow less holy. Monaghan's plan for a new
university "is certainly of a grandiose scale and vision, and will be
interesting to watch," James said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a joint venture, the Naples-based Barron Collier Cos., a
powerhouse landowner and developer in this corner of Florida, will
donate 750 acres for the university site, and it will be a partner in
developing a town, also to be called Ave Maria, that is to be built
around the school.</TE>
<TE>   The university's president-designate, Nicholas J. Healy Jr., a
Catholic layman and former attorney in maritime law, said it likely
will open in four years.</TE>
<TE>   A temporary campus is being built outside the city of Naples, and
it should begin accepting students in the autumn of 2003. Ave Maria
University will be coed, but the dorms will not.</TE>
<TE>   The university president said that rap music, heavy metal and
modern art that does not elevate the soul or adhere to the Catholic
aesthetic of promoting beauty and truth will have no place in Ave
Maria's curriculum. The university's name, Latin for "Hail Mary," is
the biblical greeting spoken by the archangel Gabriel when he
announced to Mary that she had been chosen to be the mother of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the same year that Monaghan sold Domino's for a reported
$1 billion, he opened a Catholic college in Ypsilanti, Mich. He
wanted to move it to Ann Arbor and expand it into a full-fledged
university, but he had to look for a new location after planners and
politicians turned down his request for a zoning change.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida site, about 10 miles southeast of this rural town, was
selected when the developer offered to donate the land. The Rev.
Joseph Fessio, a Jesuit who will be the university's chancellor,
deadpanned during a town meeting here last week that he saw a sign
from God in the choice. Immokalee, he said, is akin to a word for
Mary that he learned while in a French seminary: immaculee, or she
who is free of the blemish of sin.</TE>
<TE>   In this sleepy corner of Collier County, where many earn a meager
living by toiling in the fields or orange groves, the prospect of
having a university and all that it entails -- from expanded
employment opportunities to a football team -- has caused excitement.
At the town meeting, attended by Monaghan, Healy, Fessio and others
involved with the project, residents wondered aloud whether
Immokalee, population 22,000, might boom like the much larger South
Bend, Ind., home of Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make sure you don't get away. We're going to take
your car keys," Jim Coletta, who represents the Immokalee area on the
Collier County Commission, told Ave Maria's founders.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ranks of Catholics in the U.S. are increasing
steadily, the last Catholic university opened in this country was
Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Catholic population has grown by 10 million to 20
million, Fessio said, adding that "there is a growing percentage of
Hispanics in the population."</TE>
<TE>   "We think it is absolutely crucial to prepare them to take a
leadership role in our society," he said. "And this university, if
not at the center of the United States, is almost at the center of
the Americas."</TE>
<TE>   Monaghan also has bankrolled the Ave Maria School of Law in Ann
Arbor, Mich., Ave Maria College of the Americas in Nicaragua,
elementary schools in the Ann Arbor area and numerous other Catholic
endeavors from Central America to Austria, including an Internet
dating service for Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Placed in an orphanage at age 4, Monaghan wanted to be a priest as
a boy. From a single pizza parlor in Ypsilanti, Mich., Monaghan built
the world's largest pizza delivery company. Since selling Domino's,
he has made a public pledge to spend his fortune in propagating his
faith.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a dream of mine for many, many years: to create the
finest Catholic university in the world," Monaghan told the residents
of Immokalee. "I didn't say the biggest. I said the finest."</TE>

<HD>Number of Caesarean Deliveries at a High</HD>
<DH>Climbing 7% last year, nearly one-fourth of births were by
the surgical procedure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of women in the United States giving birth by caesarean
section has reached an all-time high, with nearly one-quarter of
babies now being delivered by the surgical procedure, according to
government statistics being released this week.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing a steady retreat from the "natural childbirth" trend,
the caesarean section rate jumped 7% in 2001, reaching 24.4% of all
live births -- the highest rate since the government started
collecting the statistics in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The reasons for the rise, and whether it's good or bad for women
and their babies, are the subject of an intense debate that has been
raging at medical conferences, in medical journals, in doctors'
offices and at birthing centers. It's an unusually emotional debate,
especially when it comes to women who want a "C-section" for their
first baby -- even when a regular delivery poses no obvious danger.</LD>
<TE>   "I think there is rationality on both sides of the debate," said
Judith Walzer Leavitt, a professor of medical history and women's
studies at the University of Wisconsin Medical School. "But there's
also some things that ... we might look on as less scientific -- like
training and experience, like religious beliefs and mind-sets, like
political issues of the day."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts see the surging caesarean rate as a welcome
development. Medical authorities in the 1980s and 1990s had
campaigned to reduce the number of such deliveries. Doctors
particularly targeted the practice of routinely performing caesareans
on any woman who had had one before. Repeat caesareans were derided
as often unnecessary, and as subjecting women to costly and
potentially dangerous surgery and a long recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But before long, problems began to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "Fetuses died. Mothers died. Mothers' uteruses ruptured," said
Michael F. Greene, director of maternal and fetal medicine at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "As the reports of these
disasters started to appear in the medical literature, obstetricians
became much more cautious."</TE>
<TE>   By 1996, the caesarean rate started creeping up. Last year, the
number of women who had vaginal deliveries after a previous C-section
plummeted 20%, dropping to a low of 16.5%, according to preliminary
data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The final
numbers, being released Wednesday, are not expected to vary
significantly.</TE>

<LD>Searchers were looking for a skier presumed trapped in an avalanche
near a Reno-area ski resort, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A Mt. Rose ski resort spokesman said the avalanche was triggered
after three skiers entered an out-of-bounds area just east of the
resort. Two skiers made it back to the lodge to report that a
25-year-old male friend was missing, the spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Washoe County sheriff's searchers joined resort ski patrol members
in a search for the man. But it was later called off because of
extreme avalanche danger. Rescuers plan to resume the search today if

<LD>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said he does
not plan to be inoculated with the smallpox vaccine, and he
recommends that other Cabinet members not request the inoculation
either.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush said that he will take the vaccine along with U.S.
military forces but that he was not recommending the risky
inoculation for most Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The vaccine, which will be free for those who want it, carries
rare but serious side effects. One or 2 out of every 1 million
patients will be killed by the vaccine, and 15 will face
life-threatening complications.</LD>

<HD>Punching Out at 15,000 Feet</HD>
<DH>A pilot has a lot to consider in those crucial seconds.
Eject too soon and your career could suffer. Go too late and you're
dead.</DH>
<SE>THE VERTICAL VISION / PART II: CAUSES</SE>
<AU>Kevin Sack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Odd as it may seem, the first thought that crossed Lt. Col. John W.
Capito's mind as he felt the initial lash of freezing rain at 15,000
feet was of the 8-year-old boy at the airfield.</LD>
<LD>   "Have you ever had to eject?" the youngster had asked as Capito
prepared to jet off in his AV-8B Harrier.</LD>
<LD>   "No, kid," the 39-year-old Marine told him. "That never really
happens."</LD>
<TE>   Capito knew better. Harrier pilots must always be prepared for an
unscheduled ride up the rails. Considering the plane's safety record,
some say they feel "spring-loaded to eject."</TE>
<TE>   It is rarely a simple call, or one afforded much time for
calculation. Reach down and pull the black-and-yellow rubberized
handle at the right moment and you float to earth with the
anticipation of free drinks at the officer's club. Pull it a second
late and your family faces a closed-casket funeral. Punch out before
it is clear that the plane is doomed and you can expect a lifetime of
second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   On March 31, 1985, Capito ejected into a battering storm over Long
Island Sound. His harrowing descent to the 38-degree water below
lasted nearly 20 minutes. While buffeted by gusting wind and
pea-sized hail, he had plenty of time to contemplate the causes and
consider the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   His odyssey began at the Naval Air Station at South Weymouth,
Mass., where the boy had posed his question. Capito was a Kentuckian,
the son of a Marine, and an experienced aviator. Before joining a
Harrier squadron in 1973, he had notched 130 missions in Vietnam in
the F-4 Phantom.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was second in command of the Harrier training squadron
at the Marine air base in Cherry Point, N.C. He had been tapped to
become the squadron's commander in three months.</TE>
<TE>   From the first time he saw it, Capito loved the pure power of the
plane. "You see a Harrier hover and then a few seconds later
accelerate at 400 knots and it's just impressive," he recalled. "It
was loud and smoky and fast, all the things you wanted in an
airplane."</TE>
<TE>   Like most Harrier pilots, Capito had survived several close calls.
Early in his career, he forgot to adjust the plane's thrust nozzles
when accelerating out of a hover and sank to 20 feet above ground
before recovering. In 1976, he flew his way out of an engine
vibration and landed safely. Two years later, he descended vertically
with inoperable landing gear.</TE>
<TE>   On that dreary March day in 1985, Capito was flying an AV-8B, the
new and improved version of the Harrier. Dozens of pilots had been
forced to eject from the earlier model, the AV-8A, but Capito would
become the first of 70 to bail out of the AV-8B. During preflight
checks, Capito noticed that a small door on one of the intakes was
sticking rather than flapping open as designed. He knocked it loose
shortly before takeoff, satisfying himself it would not pose a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The takeoff and climb were uneventful. But as Capito cruised up to
about 26,000 feet, he felt a thump and then the telltale trembling
that almost always announces an engine failure. "It was," he said,
"like being on a vibrating bed in a cheap motel."</TE>
<TE>   A compressor blade had cracked, probably from simple fatigue, an
alarmingly common occurrence with the Harrier. It had happened to
Capito three times before, and he had always managed to bring his
plane home.</TE>
<TE>   But this time the vibration was much worse. The blade fragments
had punctured a fuel cell and sliced through an electrical cable.</TE>
<TE>   "Flameout!" Capito radioed to his wingman as he attempted to
restart the engine. It would be his last transmission. His power had
vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Capito knew what he was going to have to do, and was not
particularly thrilled about it. He could see no more than 50 feet,
and he knew it would be cold and wet outside the cockpit. He wasn't
sure where he was. Near Hartford, Conn., maybe, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   Capito wanted to stay with the plane for a while, down to 5,000
feet if possible, so he could get under the weather. He fantasized
that his Harrier might fix itself. But at about 15,000 feet, smoke
started seeping into the cockpit. His decision was made for him. "If
I wait too long," he thought, "I'll burn up the parachute."</TE>
<TE>   He had checked his harness, his helmet, his oxygen mask, his
visor. He had tightened the seat restraints. He pulled the nose up to
trim his airspeed to about 230 mph. It was time. He sat back, head
flush against the headrest, feet on the rudder pedals, the position
recommended to protect the spine. He yanked the handle. He kept his
eyes wide open. This he did not want to miss.</TE>
<TE>   With a booming detonation, the canopy blew away and he felt the
rockets fire beneath his seat. As the seat propelled him out of the
aircraft, the concussive deceleration of his forward airspeed blew
his helmet and oxygen mask right off his head. "It was like somebody
just took a huge inflated baseball bat and hit me as hard as they
could," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still strapped in his seat, Capito tumbled backward in two
somersaults. After a freefall of perhaps five seconds, he felt the
reassuring tug of his parachute risers, saw the chute deploying and
felt the seat separating from his body.</TE>
<TE>   He was OK. He checked his watch, and then started obsessing about
the intake door. Had that caused the flameout? He worried that the
Marines would snatch away his command if his careless mistake had
destroyed a plane. But the sting of icy hail brought him back to the
present.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on," he told himself. "You're not out of this yet."</TE>
<TE>   He covered his bare head with his hands to fend off the hail.
Lightning pierced the distance. Updrafts and downdrafts fought for
his parachute. He thought he should have been falling about 1,000
feet a minute, but he could tell he wasn't. He was mostly moving
sideways.</TE>
<TE>   Capito focused on his training, mentally reviewing the procedures
for releasing his inflatable raft just before splashdown. "I can do
this!" he yelled into the wind.</TE>
<TE>   He wondered how far he was from shore. If he cut the right
parachute lines, he could steer toward land, but he couldn't remember
which lines.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he broke out of the clouds to discover a view that
was both breathtaking and eerie. He could see for miles around, and he
was alone. No choppers. No Coast Guard cutters. Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   As he approached the water, he pulled the handle that released and
inflated the raft and watched it plunk into the sound. He followed
right behind, unsnapping the parachute straps from his shoulders as
his feet touched the water. He plunged into the frigid sea and then
pulled the raft toward him with its lanyard. Weighted down by
survival gear, Capito threw himself into the raft, got tossed out by
a swell, and heaved himself in once more.</TE>
<TE>   The air temperature was 40 degrees, and the drenched pilot could
not stop shivering. He was no more than two or three miles from
shore, not far from Montauk Point at the eastern tip of Long Island.
But when he fired up flares, they barely seemed visible. And when he
dropped a dye marker, it sank like a rock.</TE>
<TE>   "I began to think I was going to be there for a while," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Capito, a Long Island pilot named John Duell and
his son, Todd, 17, heard that a plane had crashed into the sound and
took off in their single-engine Cessna. Todd spotted smoke from
Capito's flares and they summoned help.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen minutes later, a Coast Guard cutter arrived and pulled
Capito aboard. Hypothermia had set in. Another hour and he might have
been in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors at Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport warmed
Capito with blankets and fitted him with a neck brace as a
precaution.</TE>
<TE>   The Duells arrived with dry clothes and a premixed martini in a
glass covered with plastic wrap. Because it was a Sunday afternoon
and there were no motels nearby, the Duells invited the bedraggled
pilot to stay with them.</TE>
<TE>   After making sure Capito was comfortable, the Duells decided the
day's adventure should not get in the way of their traditional Sunday
night outing to Skipper's, a local seafood restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "John," Duell informed his house guest, "we're going out to have
our Sunday night lobster. You can stay here and make calls and rest."</TE>
<TE>   Capito ripped off his neck brace. "Steamed or broiled?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the Marines arrived to take Capito to his base.
A week later, he was back in a Harrier cockpit. After salvaging parts
of the engine, Marine investigators concluded that the intake door
had played no role in cracking the compressor blades. Capito got his
command.</TE>
<TE>   Now a developer in this Kansas City, Mo., suburb, Capito keeps one
of his plane's broken compressor blades mounted on a plaque like an
aviator's Oscar. Though he acknowledges the Harrier's problems, he
remains committed to the plane and to the community of pilots and
mechanics who have made it their lives.</TE>
<TE>   He will be 60 in three years. And on that birthday, John Capito
wants to go skydiving, this time on his own terms. In the dim light
of memory, his first ride down seems thrilling, even life-affirming.
Once he broke through the clouds, the serenity was overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to visit the quiet again," he said.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Bishop Richard G. Lennon, acting as overseer of Boston's troubled
Roman Catholic archdiocese, offered words of hope and reconciliation
Sunday as he celebrated Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.</LD>
<LD>   Lennon -- who was appointed "apostolic administrator" by Pope Paul
John II after the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law -- received a
standing ovation from more than 500 parishioners in the historic
cathedral. In a solemn homily, he tried to console those wounded by
clerical sexual abuse and the scandal that has roiled his church.</LD>
<LD>   "How many are brokenhearted, how many are captives of the crimes
and the sins of sexual abuse against minors?" Lennon asked. "How many
have had their freedom curtailed because of injustice?"</LD>
<TE>   As he spoke, scores of demonstrators paraded outside the cathedral
-- some demanding that Law and five other bishops who worked at
varying times in the archdiocese be sent to prison for their alleged
roles in covering up child abuse over the last 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   But other parishioners, even the most skeptical, seemed willing to
give Lennon a chance to clean up the scandal here that ignited a
nationwide furor over sexually abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot of goodwill," Marc Mastranadi, a retail analyst,
said of the archdiocese's temporary leader. "But I don't think he'll
have much of a honeymoon. People won't give him a long leash, not
after what's happened here in Boston."</TE>
<TE>   Law, 71, offered his resignation at the Vatican last week after 18
years at the helm of the nation's fourth-largest arch- diocese. He
had been under fire since January, when internal church documents
first suggested that he and other officials frequently sought to
minimize charges of abuse by moving priests from one parish to
another, where they then preyed on other children.</TE>
<TE>   The final blow leading to Law's departure was the release earlier
this month of documents suggesting cases of drug abuse by priests and
the molestation of girls studying to be nuns.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm stepping into a shower, after all this terrible
news and the stigma over the church," said Nancy Higgins as she
hurried up the steps into the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Lennon] has an opportunity to speak out, and this can be a
cleansing moment. But I never lost my faith."</TE>
<TE>   Lennon's remarks "might signal a new spirit in the church, and
that's important," said Laura Breault, a member of the activist group
Speak Truth to Power. "But he can't get past the fact that many of
these priests are criminals. If you or I did what they have been
accused of doing, we'd be in jail. Nothing a new man says can change
that reality."</TE>
<TE>   From the minute Lennon began celebrating Mass, worshipers seemed
to lean forward, straining to hear his comments. At the same time,
there was intense curiosity about Law, who returned Saturday to the
United States but whose whereabouts and immediate plans are unknown.
In an interview with the Boston Globe, he said: "I have no hatred"
for the lay critics and media coverage that laid bare clerical
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   With Law's legendary career seemingly at an end, all eyes turned
Sunday to Lennon.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to listen to Bishop Lennon and give him a chance to heal
this community," said Martha Rowland of Newton, Mass., who has been a
key player in Voice of the Faithful -- a grass-roots lay group formed
in the wake of the abuse scandal. "What is the alternative? At some
point, all the recriminations, all the divisiveness have to end."</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old Lennon echoed that theme Sunday, stressing that he
was as much a partner of parishioners as he was their spiritual
leader.</TE>
<TE>   He will serve until a permanent successor to Law is named.</TE>
<TE>   "For you I am a bishop, but with you I am a Christian," he said,
speaking slowly and deliberately. "The former is a duty, a title. But
the latter is a state of grace."</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the South Boston parish's ethnically mixed
congregation -- including Irish, Italian, Latino and African American
worshipers -- quietly nodded as Lennon spoke. Although he became a
bishop only last year, he was trying to reach out and build bridges
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Lennon squarely addressed the events that have buffeted the
archdiocese, causing many to question the church's integrity. The
news in recent days "has produced a combination of responses,"
including "dismay, disappointment, frustration and, for some, a loss
of trust in the hierarchy, a profound sense of sadness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking note of the church's critics, he said archdiocesan
officials need to listen to these voices more carefully in the
future. But he refrained from addressing several issues, such as the
possibility that the archdiocese might file for bankruptcy to
minimize payments in legal settlements with more than 500 alleged
abuse victims. Nor did Lennon discuss a grand jury that is probing
the scandal and reportedly has subpoenaed Law.</TE>
<TE>   He concluded his comments by referring to a letter written by St.
Paul to the Thessalonians, suggesting it had powerful relevance to an
archdiocese that needs to examine its soul, preserve the integrity of
the church and avoid future scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Test everything, retain what is good, and refrain from evil," St.
Paul wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless you," said Maria Reyes, clutching her two young
children and whispering fervently in Lennon's ear: "I support the
church now more than ever. I want to believe. Do what has to be
done."</TE>

<HD>Fewer Inmates on Death Row in 2001; Decline Is First Since
1976</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of death-row prisoners dropped last year for the first
time since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976,
the Justice Department reported Sunday. The decline was part of a
trend that has seen fewer people sentenced to die in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The death-row population fell from 3,601 in 2000 to 3,581 in 2001,
the first year-to-year decrease in 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's total of 155 was the lowest number sentenced to die
and put on death row since 1973. It was the third straight year of
declines.</LD>
<TE>   The number of death sentences imposed last year compares with 303
in 1998 and 319 in 1996, according to the Bureau of Justice
Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-six people were executed last year, compared with 85 the
year before.</TE>
<TE>   Through Dec. 11 of this year, 68 people have been executed.</TE>
<TE>   Death-penalty experts say juries and prosecutors appear to be
exercising greater care in using the death penalty, particularly
considering recent cases in which DNA evidence has proved that people
were wrongly convicted.</TE>
<TE>   More prosecutors also appear to be accepting plea bargains in
which a defendant accepts a sentence of life without parole.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more selective use of the death penalty going on," said
Richard Dieter, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty
Information Center, a capital-punishment research group. "The key
issue, which is disturbing to people, is that they've seen inmates
who may have been close to execution walk off from death row."</TE>
<TE>   The government figures show that 63 men and three women were put
to death last year, all by injection.</TE>
<TE>   The racial breakdown was 48 whites, 17 blacks and one American
Indian.</TE>
<TE>   A death-row inmate is most likely to have previous felony
convictions, never been married and have no more than a high-school
education, the statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% have attended college.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma executed the most people in 2001, with 18, followed by 17
put to death in Texas and seven in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   In all, executions were carried out last year by 15 of the 38
states that have a death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government executed two men, Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh and drug lord and murderer Juan Raul Garza.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary statistics for this year show that Texas has conducted
33 of the 68 executions nationwide.</TE>

<HD>Murder Charges Dismissed in Baltimore After Problems Arise</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Murder charges against 34 people were dropped in the last 19 months
because evidence didn't support the charges, a review of Baltimore
police records showed.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the dropped cases involved claims of self-defense, later
proved to be valid, and two cases involved armed robbers who were
slain by their victims, the Baltimore Sun reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In one case, detectives charged a man who died a year before the
murder occurred. A witness in the case identified the gunman in a
photo lineup, and police said checks of the suspect's arrest record
did not show that he had died. Police learned their suspect was dead
when they called his sister to find him.</LD>
<TE>   Another man was charged with a West Baltimore shooting that
occurred while he was in prison. Two eyewitnesses had picked him from
a photo lineup. Police pulled back the arrest warrant when a third
witness blamed someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Martin O'Malley said that the Police Department was working
to produce more solid homicide cases.</TE>

<HD>Church Insured for $90 Million</HD>
<DH>Policies could avert Boston Archdiocese bankruptcy.
Carriers have balked at paying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Boston Archdiocese has at least $90 million in insurance to pay
claims of approximately 500 alleged victims of clergy sexual abuse,
according to a published report.</LD>
<LD>   The figure would bolster the arguments by lawyers for the alleged
victims that the archdiocese could pay the claims without resorting
to bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   An archdiocese spokesman said Sunday that bankruptcy is still
being considered.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something among other ways of trying to come to a resolution
of all this," the Rev. Christopher Coyne said, "but we have not said
it is no longer a consideration."</TE>
<TE>   The $90-million figure was reported Sunday in the Boston Globe,
citing attorneys and others involved in determining the amount of
coverage available. The archdiocese's principal lawyers previously
estimated that $25 million to $45 million would be available to pay
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Kemper and Travelers, the archdiocese's two insurers during the
years most of the abuse took place, balked at paying claims, partly
on grounds the archdiocese broke its contracts by moving dangerous
priests to new parishes.</TE>
<TE>   J. Owen Todd, who is Boston Cardinal Bernard Law's personal
attorney, told a judge last month he would seek a court order to
force Kemper and Travelers to honor the policies.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for alleged victims have until Friday to specify the
amount of their claims against the archdiocese, which have been
estimated at $100 million.</TE>

<HD>Abuse Scandal 'Haunts' New Hampshire Bishop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Bishop John McCormack told parishioners Sunday that he is haunted by
his part in the church sex scandal, and for the first time apparently
questioned whether it could affect his future as leader of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Manchester.</LD>
<LD>   "These days my past haunts my present and clouds my future with
you in New Hampshire," he said at the opening of Mass at St. Joseph
Cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   McCormack, who became bishop of New Hampshire in 1998, has been
dogged for nearly a year by accusations that he failed to protect
children from sexually abusive priests while he served in the Boston
Archdiocese as a top deputy to Cardinal Bernard Law. Law resigned as
archbishop Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, McCormack averted unprecedented criminal charges
against the diocese of endangering children by moving abusive priests
from parish to parish. As part of an agreement with state
prosecutors, McCormack acknowledged that the church had harmed
children by such moves.</TE>
<TE>   However, McCormack tempered the remark by adding that the best way
he can help alleged victims is "to serve and lead the church in New
Hampshire well."</TE>

<KH>Ronald Brownstein / WASHINGTON OUTLOOK</KH>
<HD>Lott's Fate Could Depend on How Southern Republicans View
Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most immediate problem for Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) is that his
career provides barrels of fuel for the firestorm he ignited with his
praise of Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Over his career, Lott helped lead the fight to restore the
citizenship of Jefferson Davis (the president of the Confederacy
during the Civil War), opposed a national holiday honoring the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and voted against extension of the Voting
Rights Act. He might explain any of those decisions individually;
collectively, they suggest a longtime tendency to play with matches
on race.</LD>
<LD>   That history provides a context for interpreting Lott's insistence
at Thurmond's recent 100th birthday party that America wouldn't "have
had all these problems" if the nation had followed Mississippi's
example in voting for Thurmond when he ran for president on a
segregationist platform.</LD>
<TE>   It's difficult to imagine that Lott literally believes the nation,
or even the South, would have been better off if segregation somehow
survived. The death of Jim Crow made possible the birth of the modern
South; only after segregation fell did the South rise from endemic
poverty and economic isolation.</TE>
<TE>   The migration, outside investment and economic development that
has transformed Southern life over the last 40 years could never have
occurred if the region was still marked by the stain of
state-sponsored discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   In that way, the gleaming office towers of Charlotte, N.C., the
new factories built by BMW and other international companies along
the Interstate 85 corridor in South Carolina and the bustling
cosmopolitan prosperity of Atlanta and Dallas are all testament to
how much the white South has benefited from the civil rights
revolution. Without racial integration, the South never would have
achieved economic integration. Surely, Lott understands that.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lott has said things similar enough, often enough, to suggest
that he sees value in signaling sympathy for the fading few who do
still believe that the South would have been better off if
segregation somehow had survived. Lott made almost identical remarks
about Thurmond in 1980. He maintained a longtime relationship with
the Council of Conservative Citizens, an extremist white group. His
first political job was as an aide to a segregationist Democratic
congressman. And there is that peculiar passion for restoring the
good name of Jefferson Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of his latest remarks, all of these decisions
will be seen in a different light. Already, Time magazine has
reported that Lott, as a University of Mississippi student, fought to
prevent any chapter in his fraternity from admitting blacks. A week
ago that would have been viewed as ancient history. Now it's suddenly
relevant. It's a signal that this fire can burn for a very long time.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's fellow Republicans will decide how much heat they want to
take. President Bush last week gave Lott a hand and a shove: The
White House said the president believed Lott should remain as Senate
majority leader when the GOP takes control of the chamber in January.
But Bush also condemned Lott's remarks sharply enough to encourage
those hoping to force Lott out.</TE>
<TE>   In his struggle to retain his position, Lott has two principal
assets. One is the natural tendency of either party to rally around a
leader condemned by the other. The more the Congressional Black
Caucus or the big-city editorial pages call for Lott to step aside,
the more many conservatives will insist that Republicans can't let
their critics pick their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's second line of defense is the primacy of the South in the
modern Republican coalition. The 11 states of the old Confederacy,
plus Oklahoma and Kentucky, provide the GOP's margin of majority in
the House and the Senate; rebuking such a prominent local son could
ruffle feathers across a region that has become the foundation of
Republican political strength.</TE>
<TE>   Or, intriguingly, maybe not. It's possible that if this
controversy burns long enough, other Southern Republicans may come to
view Lott as an albatross -- a throwback to morally tainted
strategies they have almost entirely outgrown.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to integration and the civil rights laws was the point
of the wedge that allowed Republicans, a generation ago, to shatter
Democratic dominance of the South. As late as 1980, Ronald Reagan
opened his general election campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., the
place where three young civil rights workers were murdered in 1964,
by declaring his belief in states rights -- code for which his
audience needed no translation.</TE>
<TE>   But such appeals to race have faded to the margins of Southern
politics. No one has run a campaign stressing opposition to
affirmative action since Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) more than a decade
ago. Even crime and welfare, second-generation issues with racial
overtones, have receded since Bill Clinton led the Democrats to the
center on both fronts in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In the South, as elsewhere, race still intermittently flares -- as
in this year's dispute over the Confederate flag in Georgia or
periodic Democratic charges that Republicans are trying to suppress
black voting. But Republicans are long past the day when they need to
manipulate white racial resentments, either overtly or covertly, to
win in the South.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Southern political allegiance doesn't divide
along racial lines. African Americans still vote overwhelmingly
Democratic in every Southern state. And Southern whites vote so
strongly Republican that Democrats almost everywhere consider it a
triumph to win 40% of them.</TE>
<TE>   But the ties that bind Republicans to most whites in the region
are conservative views on taxes, national defense and social issues
such as guns and abortion, not nostalgia for Jim Crow. If anything,
comments like Lott's now probably risk losing the GOP more votes
among suburban Southern moderates than they might gain in the
backwoods, Emory University political scientist Merle Black notes.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the choice facing Lott's fellow Southern Republicans. Not
many Northern Republican senators can relish reappointing as majority
leader a man they are unlikely to ever again feel comfortable
inviting into their states. But Lott's position probably won't be
endangered unless some of his fellow Southerners also see his
old-style insinuations as a threat to the new coalitions they are
trying to build.</TE>

<HD>Transit Strike Looms in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Walkout would leave 7 million commuters looking for new
modes of transportation. Talks go past deadline after progress is
made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Millions of commuters were making alternative plans to get to work or
school today as the nation's largest mass transit system prepared for
a strike for the first time in 22 years.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations between New York officials and the 34,000-member
transit workers union continued past a midnight EST deadline without
a work stoppage after the union announced that enough progress had
been made on noneconomic issues to "stop the clock."</LD>
<LD>   "We will negotiate as long as there is progress being made,"
Secretary-Treasurer Ed Watt said.</LD>
<TE>   However, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told residents
earlier Sunday that they should "make plans assuming that there is a
strike."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg himself bought a $500 mountain bike Friday and said he
would use it to get to City Hall this morning if there was a strike.
"Nobody's going to shut down New York," the mayor vowed.</TE>
<TE>   But with 7 million commuters using the subways and buses daily,
legions of workers were expected to be stranded or stalled. Taxis
were preparing to pick up multiple fares, and several dozen "group
ride" stands were being set up around the city. Scores of ferries
were being added to take commuters from Brooklyn and New Jersey
across the East and Hudson rivers. Some large businesses reserved
blocks of hotel rooms so their workers would not have to commute at
all.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a strike had institutions and businesses, large
and small, scrambling to keep operations as normal as possible. For
huge Bellevue Hospital, that meant hiring private buses to carry
employees from the outlying boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and the
Bronx, while also stopping every 10 blocks in Manhattan to pick up
more workers. "We have nurses, aides -- thousands of employees -- we
can't do without," one hospital administrator said. "And most don't
live right in the city."</TE>
<TE>   On the other end of the scale was lawyer Paul Feinstein, who
practices alone at a midtown Manhattan office and has to worry only
about himself and an assistant who lives in Brooklyn. "She may be
able to stay with her boyfriend in the Village and hitchhike up to
the office," Feinstein said Sunday. "And if I have to get to court,
I'm not above hitchhiking either. You just stick out your thumb and
hope someone's going your way. Or I may drive down at 4 a.m. and
sleep in my car -- and hope they fine those idiots [at the union] $1
million a day."</TE>
<TE>   Strikes by public unions are illegal here, and workers face fines
of two days' pay for every day they are off the job. In addition, a
Brooklyn judge who issued an injunction against a strike Friday,
saying it would have an "enormous, debilitating and destructive"
impact on the city, could levy additional fines against the union.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders of the Transport Workers Union say they are skeptical
of claims by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that a
$1-billion deficit makes it impossible to offer any raises for the
first year of a new contract -- and only productivity raises the two
years after that. The union originally had asked for 24% raises over
three years, then reduced its demand to 6% raises each of the next
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Although union leaders complained throughout the weekend that the
MTA was refusing to make realistic offers on pocketbook issues, union
President Roger Toussaint said he had not given up hope. But,
Toussaint added, the city was "pushing transport workers to the
brink" by failing to put "any serious proposal" on the table.</TE>
<TE>   When union officials emerged from talks at midnight, they
suggested that although there was still a stalemate on money
questions, there had been progress on other issues "of dignity and
respect for our members," an apparent reference to union requests for
easing of disciplinary procedures it says are overly punitive.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations were being conducted around the clock at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel alongside Grand Central Station, a hub for commuter
trains from New York's northern suburbs -- which will continue to run
if there is a bus and subway strike.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no person capable of riding in on a white horse with a
bag of money to resolve this contract," Gov. George Pataki said at a
Sunday news conference, rejecting calls for him to intervene in the
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Transit workers and supporters rallied outside the hotel,
meanwhile, chanting: "No benefits, no work."</TE>
<TE>   City officials have said that a 50-cent hike in subway and bus
fares -- now $1.50 a ride for those without monthly passes -- may be
necessary just to reduce MTA deficits. A strike could cost the city
up to $350 million a day in police overtime costs and lost business
and taxes, according to the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a strike this morning, city officials said, the start
of classes at New York City schools will be delayed for two hours to
give the students more time to get there.</TE>
<TE>   Some New Yorkers said getting to work is especially crucial this
time of year because of the increase of business -- and expenses --
during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time you need money," said Kate Hobson, 32, who works
as a waitress on the affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan but lives
in more affordable Astoria, Queens. Her solution? She took a subway
in Sunday and was planning to stay with her parents, who live in
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise it's a 50-block walk over the 59th Street Bridge,"
Hobson said.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no such easy answer for her friend, also an Astoria
resident, who was worried about how she would get her father home
from a Manhattan hospital -- he was scheduled to be released today
after treatment for a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an emergency order that would mandate carpooling and the
establishment of staging areas outside the city for commuters to pair
up, roadways are expected to be gridlocked if there is a strike.
"There's nothing good that can come of this," Hobson said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many New Yorkers apparently were not ready to take emergency
measures until a strike becomes a reality.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grand Hyatt Hotel, there were still rooms available for
tonight. Farther uptown, the famous Plaza Hotel on 5th Avenue also
reported no barrage of calls from people looking for a place to stay
close to work. "We've not had a flood of requests," a reservation
agent said.</TE>

<HD>African National Congress Meets in Cradle of Apartheid</HD>
<DH>Choice of venue shows a changed South Africa. Party gathers
to elect leaders and set agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>STELLENBOSCH, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, this oak-shaded university town in the heart of
South Africa's wine country was the intellectual cradle of the
Afrikaner white nationalist movement.</LD>
<LD>   Among the many national leaders who graduated from the
Afrikaans-speaking University of Stellenbosch was Prime Minister
Hendrik Verwoerd, who in the 1960s forced black people to live in
reservation-style "homelands." A bust of Stellenbosch graduate and
former Prime Minister Daniel Francois Malan -- who coined the term
"apartheid" -- is on display in the university's D.F. Malan Memorial
Center.</LD>
<LD>   This is where the ruling African National Congress will meet today
to elect its party leadership and outline its national strategy for
the next five years. Poverty, economic restructuring and political
consolidation will top the list of priorities for the five-day
conference.</LD>
<TE>   But the ANC's choice of venue is proof of the sweeping
transformation of this society in the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa is a majority-rule nation now, with an emergent black
middle class and several wide-ranging affirmative action programs
aimed at diversifying industry's ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The country that worked to disrupt the stability of post-colonial
governments throughout sub-Saharan Africa under Verwoerd and other
leaders is now the region's No. 1 peace broker. Although it has been
criticized for its support of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe,
South Africa is playing an important role as a mediator in several
countries, including Rwanda, Congo and the Ivory Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most impressive is the nation's relatively stable economy.
After a long period of divestment and negative growth under the
apartheid regime, capital is coming back. The country now has a
smaller proportion of debt than many European nations. Its gross
national product increased an average of 2.7% annually over the last
decade and is expected to hit 3.3% this year. The currency, the rand,
is depressed -- but in the last two months it has surged against the
dollar.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent speech before business leaders, President Thabo Mbeki
recalled the fears of investors and citizens who worried that the
transition from apartheid to majority rule that began a decade ago
might result in "the country collapsing as a result of a terrible
racial conflagration."</TE>
<TE>   "We are proud to say that, contrary to what some expected, South
Africa is today one of the most stable countries in the world, with
an entrenched and properly functioning democratic system," Mbeki
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, daunting and chronic problems plague this nation of 43
million:</TE>
<TE>   * One out of 10 South Africans has the human immunodeficiency
virus that causes AIDS, and Mbeki -- who once rejected HIV's
lethality, though he later moderated his views -- has yet to offer a
comprehensive plan to deal with the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   * The nation's violent crime rate is among the world's worst and
is routinely cited as an obstacle to foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   * More than a third of South Africans have no jobs. One-fifth
don't have access to clean water, and half don't have adequate
housing. Statistics South Africa, the government's information
clearinghouse, recently released a study showing that the gap between
rich and poor has widened since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, there's a large number of people who are just
falling off the edges," said Paul Graham, executive director of the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa. "According to polls, only 9%
of South Africans think the government is doing a good job -- that's
not very good."</TE>
<TE>   However, if South Africans are less than happy with their
government, that dissatisfaction hasn't yet shown up at the ballot
box. The ANC routinely sweeps elections at every level.</TE>
<TE>   The ANC elite is even cracking down on allies and factions within
the party. Last month, the leadership foiled an alleged attempt by
liberal ANC operatives in Eastern Cape province to sideline more
conservative members. Mbeki disbanded the province's troublesome
leadership council and scaled back the number of delegates it would
be able to send to Stellenbosch.</TE>
<TE>   Many here say that the ANC, which began as a liberation movement
and rose to power under former President Nelson Mandela, has lost its
populist roots. In recent months, Mbeki's administration has moved to
consolidate the party's power by squelching debate on issues such as
privatization of the telecommunications and energy industries, which
were nationalized under apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   Iraj Abedian, a senior economist for Standard Bank in
Johannesburg, said the ANC has a hard decision to make between
frugality and investment in infrastructure. Abedian praised the
government's conservative spending policies but said he is concerned
that it is not doing enough to re-integrate the victims of apartheid
into society.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody notices unemployment, but that's just the symptom," he
said. "The challenge for this government is to train the millions of
25- to 40-year-olds who have no skills because they were fighting
apartheid when they should have been in schools and colleges."</TE>

<HD>Defiant Chavez Rules Out Early Vote</HD>
<DH>Venezuelan leader vows to outlast strike but says he might
consider resigning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>In the strongest terms yet, a defiant President Hugo Chavez on Sunday
ruled out early elections as a solution to this country's deepening
political crisis and vowed to outlast a nationwide strike that has
crippled oil production.</LD>
<LD>   During a three-hour interview with four U.S. reporters that lasted
until early Sunday, Chavez said that even a constitutional amendment
could not force him to leave before his term ends in 2007, because it
could not be applied retroactively.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time Chavez had publicly rejected the idea of an
amendment that could cut short his term, and seemed to quash hopes
for a solution to the two-week-old strike through early elections --
an idea recently promoted by U.S. and opposition leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "It would violate Venezuelan national law," said Chavez, who was
briefly ousted by a coup in April. "There are no retroactive laws."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also said for the first time since the strike began Dec. 2
that he might consider resigning -- but only if the opposition
succeeded in generating anarchy in Venezuela that left him unable to
govern.</TE>
<TE>   "Resignation is a voluntary act," he said. "If I realize that I
have failed, the president could resign, but not if they put a gun to
his head. That's an option that is there, but of course I would fight
with all the force that I have."</TE>
<TE>   The strike pits the leftist president against a determined
opposition coalition that seeks his resignation or early elections,
saying he has driven the country into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   His opponents, including businesses, unions, media groups and
opposition politicians, have managed to cripple oil production, which
accounts for half of government revenue and most foreign currency.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez insisted, as he long has, that the solution to the
country's crisis is for the opposition to wait until August to seek a
constitutionally permissible referendum on his rule.</TE>
<TE>   He said the eight-month delay would allow for a new national
council to supervise elections, to replace one believed by both sides
to be ineffective. It would also give the opposition time to gather
its forces and present an alternative to his "Bolivarian revolution,"
which aims to alleviate the country's widespread poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "The logical response is this: Why not wait until August? You
don't have to change anything," Chavez said. "This is the most
logical thing, but they don't act logically."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unfolding crisis, Chavez seemed relaxed during the
late-night interview in a small garden courtyard inside the
presidential palace, drinking coffee and smoking four Belmont Extra
Smooth cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   His vow to battle the strike was a theme throughout the interview,
leaving no doubt that he will do everything constitutionally possible
to fight for his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "We are under attack. This is a kind of economic war. But we are
reacting," he said, speaking near where he triumphantly returned to
power with the support of loyal troops 48 hours after the April 11
coup.</TE>
<TE>   He portrayed a determined struggle by his government and loyal
workers in the previous 13 days to get the country's massive
petroleum production system working and ensure an uninterrupted
supply of food.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted that the strike had nearly resulted in food and gas
shortages last week, but detailed how the government was importing
both in order to stave off further problems.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was determined to wait out his opponents, many of them
from the upper and middle classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people are people who are able to endure," he said. "Our
people, especially the poor, have resisted hunger and misery for
decades."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said the government was regaining control over the
paralyzed state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, which
has provided about 12% of U.S. oil supplies this year.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had found replacement workers and managers to restart a
production chain stalled everywhere from oil wells to refineries to
gas trucks to massive tankers.</TE>
<TE>   He said four tankers with 2 million barrels of oil had been sent
abroad in the previous three days. Normally, the country exports 2.4
million barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline shortages, he said, had forced the nation to contact
state oil companies in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil about the
possibility of buying gas. Chavez said the country had already
purchased gas from a refinery in the Virgin Islands that it co-owns
with New York-based Amerada Hess Corp. He also said he would pay to
import workers to maintain gas production, but only as a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, soldiers in the west stormed a tanker in Lake Maracaibo
carrying gasoline for domestic use and replaced its striking crew.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Western Hemisphere's largest refinery, the Paraguana
refinery complex, remained shut down Sunday after the replacement
manager suffered a heart attack Friday. And Chavez estimated it would
be 12 days or more until the country's other two large refineries
return to full capacity.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that pro-Chavez oil workers had uncovered numerous
cases of sabotage, ranging from computer hackers breaking into
company networks to vandalized valves to the theft of truck keys.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is not in an economic crisis," he insisted, saying
recent economic indicators pointed to an improvement in the soaring
inflation and unemployment rates. "We have the strength to resist as
long as necessary to recover our production of petroleum and
gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have denied many of Chavez's claims and continued to say
Sunday that the bulk of oil production in Venezuela was shut down.
They called it impossible to run PDVSA without the company's 46,000
workers, 90% of whom are on strike.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one oil expert said he believed Chavez might be able
to run the company with a skeleton crew for as long as two months,
although the resulting economic damage would be catastrophic for the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Espinasa, a consultant with the Inter-American Development
Bank who was once PDVSA's chief economist, said he envisioned a
scenario in which Chavez could maintain minimum production levels
with as few as 15,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The country would get much poorer, but Chavez would remain in
power," said Espinasa, a Chavez foe. "He would hold on to power and
keep his support base -- the poorest of the poor, who can't get any
poorer."</TE>
<TE>   As to food supplies, Chavez said the Venezuelan government had
already used state funds to stock up on food in case of a continued
crisis. He said the government had purchased milk and meat from
Colombia and rice from the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he said, the government had not had to tap into about $15
billion in foreign currency reserves, but he said this was a
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the benefits of free trade," he said, laughing.
Chavez has long been opposed to free trade policies, insisting that
Latin American countries find a different way to compete in the
global market.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also downplayed fears of a military uprising. Several
officers accused of participating in the April coup have declared
themselves in "civil disobedience" and have taken over an upscale
plaza in eastern Caracas, the capital. Three protesters were killed
by a gunman there during the first week of the strike, energizing the
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez, who shook up the military in the months after the
April coup, said there had been few signs that officers were ready to
rebel. He said he was most worried about the influence of news
broadcasts from the four major television stations, all decidedly
anti-Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have big worries, but yes, I have worries because of the
psychological campaign" from the media, he said, noting that he was
striving to maintain contact with top commanders.</TE>
<TE>   As Chavez spoke, the distant thump of music floated into the
courtyard. It was gaita, a traditional Christmas music, being played
at a rally of his backers.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters' dedication, he said, was greater than the
opposition's.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something above everything else," he said, explaining
why he would eventually beat his opponents. "We are right. We are not
perfect. But we are on the right path.</TE>
<TE>   "I say this because I feel it. We are on the same path as Christ."</TE>

<DH>A cadre of Israeli attorneys specializing in human rights
has emerged. Many clients are Palestinians, and they rarely win in
court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Leah Tzemel was well on her way to losing another case before the
Israeli Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The judges listened tolerantly, but they clearly believed that
Tzemel's Palestinian clients knew more than they admitted of their
brother's attempts to blow up Jews. Spectators in the courtroom had
no doubts whatsoever.</LD>
<LD>   "Murderers! Murderers!" screamed the mother of a boy killed in a
suicide bombing late last year. And more to the immediate point:
"Take away the ugly face of Leah Tzemel!"</LD>
<TE>   For three decades, Tzemel, an Israeli Jew, has been representing
Palestinians in Israeli courts. The people she defends have ranged
from terror suspects to refugees to the hapless and sometimes
unwitting families of murdering militants.</TE>
<TE>   Her work and her extreme-left politics make Tzemel one of the most
despised women in Israel. She has been accused of treason, physically
attacked and called a "Palestinian-loving whore."</TE>
<TE>   Despite it all, she continues to fight what is essentially a
losing battle and, in her view, defends the fundamental rights of
even those her nation considers the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel, 57, was the pioneer. Today, a cadre of Israeli attorneys
has emerged to specialize in human rights and represent Palestinians.
Human rights work has gained a modicum of prestige and respect, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be the 'lawyer of Satan.' Now I'm a 'human rights
defender,' " Tzemel said. She didn't change, she says, Israel did.
But in the current atmosphere of war, she and other attorneys worry
they will once again be regarded as the devil's accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   That Tzemel and her colleagues do the work they do is a testament
to Israel's democracy. That the work is increasingly difficult
testifies to an erosion in basic democratic values.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years of conflict, a horrific spate of suicide
bombings targeting Jews has created a climate of fear and hate that
leaves many Israelis believing that human rights and due process for
Palestinians are a luxury the country can ill afford.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the caseload for Tzemel and attorneys like her is
full of controversial issues and questions of international law: home
demolitions, deportations, alleged torture of prisoners,
assassinations. They rarely, if ever, win a case.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli troops in
just the last six months of conflict, swelling the population in
military prisons and makeshift jail cells. It keeps the attorneys
very busy.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new generation following in Tzemel's footsteps is
Michael Sfard. The Jerusalem-born 30-year-old attorney comes from an
activist family and would describe his politics as leftist. But he
also served enthusiastically in the army and is willing to perform
reserve duty -- as long as it's not in the occupied territories. Many
of his clients are Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Sfard remembers the abuse heaped on Tzemel as he was growing up
and credits her with helping to shatter taboos. For instance, she
years ago challenged army officers and security agents in a country
that traditionally reveres them.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of guts," he said. "Back then, defending a
Palestinian meant only one thing: You were associated with the enemy
and against Israel. Today, there's a little more skepticism toward
security arguments."</TE>
<TE>   Sfard, who studied international human rights law in London, is
working on a class-action case challenging the government's policy of
hunting and killing suspected Palestinian militants without the
benefit of trial or legal proceedings. So far, about 70 suspects --
and about 50 bystanders -- have been killed in such attacks,
according to Israeli human rights organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Another in this new crop is Shamai Leibowitz, grandson of renowned
scientist and philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz, who was both leftist
and an Orthodox Jew. The younger Leibowitz recently joined the
defense team of Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the Palestinian Fatah
movement accused by Israel of ordering attacks that killed 26 people.
Wearing a kippa, or yarmulke, Leibowitz argued in a district court in
October that Barghouti was a "freedom fighter" not unlike Moses.</TE>
<TE>   That comment got him thrown out of his synagogue and showered with
death threats. Bodyguards helped him escape from a crowd of angry
spectators at the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Israeli attorneys who represent Palestinians these
days are more mainstream than Tzemel. Shlomo Lecker, for example,
will not represent Palestinians accused of violent acts. Instead, he
focuses on pure human rights cases, and in the last two years has
been involved in defending Palestinians from radical Jewish settlers
in the Hebron area of the West Bank who want to evict them from their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lecker has been an attorney for many years, human rights
work has gradually taken over his practice. Among even the closest of
his friends, he finds it harder and harder to explain what he is
doing and why. People tend to be obsessed with the traumatic events
of the last two years and forget the background of occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "The climate is less supportive," he said. "There is less
interest, less involvement, less empathy."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, it is next to impossible for Lecker to travel to his
clients in the West Bank, because the Israeli government now bars its
citizens from Palestinian areas. Instead, Lecker said, he has a
"virtual law practice," in which most business is conducted by
e-mails, faxes, digital photography and maps, and telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel will represent just about any Palestinian, but on rare
occasions she draws a line. She declined the case of four East
Jerusalem Arabs accused of orchestrating bomb attacks that killed 35
people, including seven at Jerusalem's Hebrew University on July 31.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dead was Daphna Spruch, 61, who for more than a decade
was Tzemel's companion in a weekly feminist support circle.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the [Palestinians'] families that I might not be able to
give them the best defense," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, though, she believes that everyone is entitled to
representation.</TE>
<TE>   A court recently appointed her to defend Nasser abu Hmeid, a top
commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade militia based in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, against charges of murder and belonging to a
terrorist organization. She also represented him a decade ago in an
earlier conflict; he was sentenced at that time to nine life terms
for killing collaborators but was later released as part of a deal.</TE>
<TE>   In Tzemel's most recent Supreme Court appearances, she tried to
help the families of such men.</TE>
<TE>   The brother and sister of Ali Ajouri were fighting the
government's precedent-setting, much-criticized decision to deport
them from their West Bank homes to the Gaza Strip. Israel charged
that Ajouri was responsible for several suicide attacks. Soldiers
tracked him down and killed him in August near the West Bank town of
Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel argued that people cannot be punished for the sins of their
brother; the state said families provide the support network that
enables terrorists. Tzemel lost the case, and the two were deported
in September.</TE>
<TE>   In a recess during the hearing, relatives of victims charged the
defendants, expressing their outrage that the Palestinians had been
given their day in court. One, Miri Avitan, confronted Tzemel,
blocking her on the stairs of the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you defend the murderers of my son?" shouted Avitan,
whose 15-year-old boy, Assaf, was killed with friends in a suicide
bombing on Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall on Dec. 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel remained calm. "Let's sit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sit!" Avitan cried, in her hand an album with
pictures of slain Israeli children. "They were celebrating their
birthday. What was their crime?"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Tzemel countered: "Ask yourself one question. What makes
children, the age of your son, blow themselves up in the middle of a
bunch of people?"</TE>
<TE>   Avitan did not seem to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't stand a chance," she said of her son. "Nobody asked him
if he had a last request."</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel ended the exchange, turning on her high heels and marching
back to the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview later, a tearful Avitan said she was appalled that
the state wastes its money on trials for Palestinian suspects and
grants them recourse to an extended appeals process.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel "has a long record of defending such monsters, such
creatures that were raised to become bombs, while still in their
mothers' wombs," Avitan said.</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel falls on the opposite side of the argument, believing that
Palestinians, especially, deserve an advocate in a judicial system
that relies heavily on the secret testimony of spy agencies and
clandestine collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   "You play against the evidence, against the prejudice and the
hatreds and the racism -- of the prosecutors, the judges, everybody,"
Tzemel said in an interview at her 90-year-old home in Jerusalem's
bohemian Nahalot neighborhood. "I think I'm quite a successful
lawyer. It's just that my cases are generally unwinnable."</TE>
<TE>   Tzemel, the mother of two grown children, is barely 5 feet tall,
short-tempered, tireless and passionate. She favors lots of jewelry
and mascara, and speaks in a gravelly voice that she does not
hesitate to raise against Supreme Court justices, government
prosecutors -- or her own tiny staff.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Israeli system, cases can go to the Supreme Court on the
first appeal of any lower court or military court ruling.
Consequently, attorneys like Tzemel end up before the highest judges
in the land with frequency.</TE>
<TE>   In the sleek, calming halls of the Supreme Court building, an
architectural gem carved 10 years ago from indigenous limestone into
striking geometrical shapes, a certain decorum is maintained despite
the diversity of the visitors. Arab women in head scarves wait on
benches not far from kippa-wearing men: relatives of the accused,
relatives of the victims. Army generals and secret agents are also
not uncommon participants in the doings of the court.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, at Tzemel's office in traditionally Arab East
Jerusalem, there is a steady commotion. The phone rings constantly,
Tzemel calls out to her assistants sans intercom, coffee cups are
scattered on the waiting-area table. An aide shuffles in with the
latest petitions filed that morning at the Supreme Court; she carries
them in an old plastic shopping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Born in the mixed Jewish and Arab city of Haifa to European
immigrants whose families perished in the Holocaust, Tzemel became
disillusioned with Zionism after the 1967 Middle East War, when
Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, as well
as the Golan Heights and the now-returned Sinai peninsula. Giddy like
most other Israelis with the stunning victory, Tzemel assumed the
army would quickly pull back and peace would reign. Instead, Israel's
long occupation began.</TE>
<TE>   She also became disillusioned as she read accounts of Arab
villagers being forced from their homes by the Israeli army during
the 1967 war and during Israel's 1948 war for independence.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, she joined the Matzpen, a Trotskyite Communist
political organization, and the Black Panthers, a radical protest
movement that denounced discrimination against Mizrahi Jews from
Middle Eastern or North African countries.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally began to ask the right questions ... about our
existence, about Zionism, about all the Zionist myths," Tzemel said.
"After years of sitting on the fence, I finally jumped over."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their strong beliefs, Tzemel, Sfard and other like-minded
attorneys sometimes wonder whether they are doing more harm than
good. Are they accomplices of a system that grants the appearance of
justice without truly making it available? Are they allowing Israeli
society to pay lip service to respect for human rights?</TE>
<TE>   "I love this place, and I still feel I make a difference, a very
small one," Tzemel said. But at some point, she said, the mere act of
going to court will be misleading and futile, and create a false
sense of fair play.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, I will not do this anymore," she said.</TE>

<HD>Group Planned 3-Pronged Attack on Jerusalem Targets, Court
Told</HD>
<DH>Three Palestinians held in alleged plot hoped to hit
Sharon's residence, down a copter and bomb traffic-clogged roads,
prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Three Palestinian militants planned to attack Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's residence, shoot down a helicopter on its way to the Israeli
parliament and trigger powerful remote-controlled bombs along
Jerusalem roadways during rush hour, a court here was told Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The details of the alleged plots, unveiled as the men were
indicted in Jerusalem District Court on terror charges, pointed to
what could prove to be a new level of audacity, sophistication and
inventiveness on the part of their group, Islamic Jihad, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Islamic Jihad has carried out dozens of deadly attacks against
Israelis during more than 26 months of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Most of those attacks have been suicide bombings and shootings whose
tactics and planning were markedly similar. Some landmark Israeli
markets and particular bus routes have been the targets of repeated
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged plots by the three men, however, appeared to show a
greater ambition to carry off a "mega-attack" that would either cause
a very large number of casualties or strike at an institution of
great symbolic importance to Israelis, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were arrested two weeks ago, but details about their case
were not disclosed until their court appearance Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the three men -- Hader abu Hamed, Omar Attrash and
Ziad Attrash -- possessed a quantity of explosives and mortar shells.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors told the court that the three had been observing the
flight path of helicopters landing at Israel's parliament, or
Knesset, and had found a house in the tranquil, affluent Jerusalem
neighborhood of Rehavia from which they believed a copter could be
shot down.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the cell also had made a careful study of
Jerusalem traffic patterns, noting that construction projects were
causing heavy congestion that left many cars packed closely on
roadways approaching Jerusalem from the north.</TE>
<TE>   The three intended to detonate plastic explosives during morning
rush hour that would be timed to trap as many commuters as possible
in a conflagration, prosecutors and court documents said.</TE>
<TE>   For a possible strike against Sharon's official residence -- also
in Rehavia -- the men had been watching the comings and goings of the
prime minister's security detail, the court was told. They had picked
a dumpster near the residence as a potential place to plant
explosives timed to go off as the guards drove past, prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants have staged nearly 90 suicide bombings since
the outbreak of the current intifada in September 2000. Israel says
hundreds of others have been foiled. Authorities also cope with
dozens of "red-hot" alerts -- intelligence warnings on imminent
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a not atypical day, police and troops arrested two
Islamic Jihad activists at a checkpoint on the outskirts of
Jerusalem. Officials described the men as a would-be suicide bomber
and his handler, who had hoped to carry out an attack in the city
center as the workweek was getting underway.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate court case, judges handed down long sentences to
four convicted masterminds of eight major bombings that killed more
than 35 people.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the attacks were particularly traumatic for Israelis.
They included a bomb planted in a crowded cafeteria at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University, which had been one of the few public places where
Arabs and Jews mingled freely, and a suicide blast at a trendy
Jerusalem cafe called Moment, only a stone's throw from Sharon's
residence. The cafe has since reopened, with a small shrine to the
victims at its entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The shortest sentence handed down to any of the four was 60 years;
the others received multiple life terms. The Palestinian men said
they were carrying out a Koranic call to jihad; the judges wrote that
the attackers deserved to "rot in jail until the end of their days."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Sunday, Israel's Cabinet reiterated the government's
pledge to prevent Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from traveling to
Bethlehem for this year's Christmas observances. Arafat for months
has been confined to his battered headquarters in the West Bank city
of Ramallah, 12 miles away. The Palestinian Authority president was
prevented from traveling to Bethlehem last Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, a Muslim, once presided over the holiday observances with
gusto. After Palestinians won administrative control of Bethlehem in
1995, a moderately successful drive was launched to attract tourists
and pilgrims to the city for the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Christmas celebrations are expected to be muted and to
draw only small crowds. Israel says its troops will maintain a tight
grip on the city but will allow in worshipers and pilgrims. Soldiers
moved into the city three weeks ago after a suicide bomber from the
Bethlehem area staged an attack in Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Moscow Denounces Iraq for Canceling Deal</HD>
<DH>Government expresses conviction that Baghdad scrapped oil
contract as punishment for Russia's support of U.N. weapons
inspections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily Sunday to Iraq's
cancellation of a $3.7-billion deal with this country's biggest oil
company, describing the move as an unfriendly step.</LD>
<LD>   News of the Iraqi decision broke Wednesday, just before three days
of Russian holidays, and Sunday, the first working day here since
then, brought the first official response. The comments suggested
that Moscow may be hardening its attitude toward the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, which has failed to pay back any of its
$7-billion Soviet-era oil debt to Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow has been one of Baghdad's strongest international
supporters -- both because of that debt and because of Russian oil
interests in Iraq -- but the Kremlin supported the tough U.N.
resolution insisting on the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   However, Russia has staunchly opposed U.S. military action against
Iraq, arguing that the return of the U.N. inspectors provides the
basis for a peaceful resolution of the current tensions and
eventually an end to sanctions against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Sunday in Moscow, Iraq's ambassador to
Russia, Abbas Khalaf, made clear that the decision to cancel the 1997
deal to develop the West Qurnah field had come from the top. But he
denied that it had any political motive.</TE>
<TE>   The reason was simply the failure by Russia's Lukoil to develop
the field, Khalaf said, dismissing the company's argument that it was
impossible to sink money into the project with U.N. sanctions in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Khalaf said other Russian oil companies have been drilling wells
under the provisions of the United Nations' "oil-for-food" program,
which allows Baghdad to trade oil for essential goods. As Iraq's
biggest trading partner and the power that helped develop its oil
industry in the Soviet era, Russia has been the main beneficiary of
trade under that program.</TE>
<TE>   Russian oil companies sold a billion barrels of Iraqi oil, worth
$15 billion, between December 1996 and May 29 of this year, Khalaf
said.</TE>
<TE>   But a tough statement Sunday from the Russian Foreign Ministry not
only condemned the cancellation but suggested that the Kremlin is
convinced it was a political move to punish Moscow for supporting the
strong U.N. resolution on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "This step is not in keeping with the friendly nature of
Russian-Iraqi relations and the level of bilateral cooperation in
various areas," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is strange that this move was made at a time when Russia is
trying to relieve the tension surrounding Iraq and is trying to find
a peaceful political solution to the Iraq decision together with
other countries," it said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a single Russian company can violate the sanctions regime.
Moscow hopes that the situation involving Lukoil and the Iraqi Oil
Ministry will be settled by negotiation."</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad's move appeared calculated to manipulate Russia into
continuing its support for the regime or face losing its foothold in
Iraq's oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia may already be considering the possibility of an Iraq
without Hussein. President Bush indicated last month that Russia's
interests in Iraq would be taken into consideration if Hussein's
regime was dislodged.</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. officials have argued that Moscow cannot hope to regain
a single dollar of its debt from Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on Russian television Sunday, Lukoil President
Vagit Alekperov insisted that Russia had met its contractual
obligations under the canceled deal. He said the decision to void the
contract was political.</TE>
<TE>   "[Our] company all these years has understood the provisions of
the contract and fulfilled our obligations. But we didn't go as far
as violating the sanctions applied today toward Iraq," he said. "Of
course, this irritated the Iraqi side. But such a stormy reaction,
especially in the current period -- which is difficult both for Iraq
and for our relations -- came as a complete surprise to us."</TE>
<TE>   Other Lukoil spokesmen said Iraq's move had not damaged the
company but described it as illegal and threatened action at the
International Court of Justice in Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Mikhail Mikhailov said in a telephone interview with The
Times that the final decision on breaking the contract must be made
in the Geneva court.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the whole thing can be quite positively resolved in
consultations between the ministries involved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the disputed contract, Lukoil holds a 68.5% stake in
developing the 15-billion-barrel West Qurnah field. Two other Russian
companies, Zarubezhneft and Mashinoimport, each have a 3.25% stake,
while Iraq's Oil Ministry has 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Khalaf said Sunday that the cancellation applied only
to Lukoil and not to the others, which are developing oil fields
elsewhere in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Lukoil did not make any investments. They simply signed the
contract and went away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are scores of Russian companies that are working within
this regime," Khalaf said. "There are hundreds of oil fields that
operate in Iraq now, and Iraq within the sanctions framework exports
2 million barrels a day."</TE>

<HD>Sexual Predator Is Stalking Los Feliz-Area Schoolgirls</HD>
<DH>Seventeen assaults have been reported since '95. Police
issue warning that the pace is accelerating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki and Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A potbellied, flat-faced man wearing a beanie has sexually assaulted
17 schoolgirls in Los Feliz and nearby neighborhoods since 1995,
evading arrest despite a pattern of consistent and often brazen
behavior, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The victims, most of them students at Franklin and Marshall high
schools, have ranged in age from 11 to 17. Three have been raped; 13
have been groped or fondled, or broke free after being grabbed; and
one was forced to perform oral sex, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent victim, a 17-year-old Marshall High senior, was
dragged beneath the Hyperion Avenue Bridge and raped on the morning
of Nov. 21 as she walked to a gym before school.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I was already dead," she said in an interview. "First
thing I thought was, 'OK, this morning was the last morning I will
see my mom.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, on the verge of tears as she listened to her daughter
recount the attack, complained that police and school officials
haven't done enough to apprehend the attacker. She questioned why
they hadn't deployed cameras and guards, even volunteer retirees to
patrol the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we waiting until somebody gets killed?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Other parents and students expressed similar concerns as news of
the latest attack spread. Police said that although they have
circulated a composite sketch and the attacks have often been in the
same places, the sporadic timing has frustrated their best efforts.
School officials said they have repeatedly warned parents and
students about the danger, most recently the day after the November
rape.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the assaults have occurred during daylight, either before
8 a.m., when students are on their way to school, or from 3 to 5
p.m., after school.</TE>
<TE>   The first six attacks -- from April 1995 to January 1998 --
occurred on a single, 350-yard stretch of Hyperion Avenue in Los
Feliz, a few blocks northeast of Marshall High.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until the fifth attack, and first rape, in July 1997
that police concluded from victims' descriptions that they were
dealing with a single assailant, said Det. Gregory Stone, a Los
Angeles Police Department rape investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, "we've had extra patrols, extra officers, in the areas
for weeks at a time," he said. But he said officers could be deployed
only "for so long before you have other community needs that have to
be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Before last year, the assaults had been reported at intervals of
two months to more than a year. But in 2001, the pace accelerated:
There were eight attacks, four in a two-month stretch, including two
on the same day in March. This year, there have been three more.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first rape, police, community groups and school
officials have been distributing fliers with sketches of the man, who
is described as a heavy-set Latino, 35 to 50 years old, with large,
fleshy hands, a "potato-shaped" nose and a pot belly. He is usually
unshaven, has a strong body odor and wears a beanie or knit cap,
authorities said. They said he typically jogs up to the victims from
behind and frequently tries to drag them to more secluded spots.</TE>
<TE>   In all, nine attacks have occurred on or near the Hyperion Bridge
on a common route to Marshall. Eight of the victims in those nine
attacks were Marshall students, and two of them were raped, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The other attacks have been more spread out, including three
assaults on Franklin High students walking to or from school, as well
as one rape. Others occurred in the nearby neighborhoods of Atwater
Village, Highland Park, Montecito Heights and Silver Lake. Police
believe the rape of a private school student in Cypress Park also may
be connected to the same suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent rape victim said she was walking across the
Hyperion Bridge just after sunrise, taking the same route she has
taken to school every day for four years. Seeing a shadow behind her,
she turned around and saw a man jogging toward her. He grabbed her
and asked for money. She gave him $5. "I told him, 'Please let me
go,' " she said. "Then he took me down the hill."</TE>
<TE>   He put a beanie over her face. "I screamed," she recalled. "He
said, 'If you scream one more time, I will break your neck.' So I
tried to calm myself and him down. I told him, 'You don't know what
you are doing to me. You're going to hurt me for life.' He said, 'No,
I'm not.' And I knew then things would change forever."</TE>
<TE>   The teenager said she was given morning-after pills by a doctor,
but remains worried that she may contract a sexually transmitted
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will ever be over for me," she said. "It might
be less bad, but I don't think I will ever get over it."</TE>
<TE>   The Times is withholding her name because the paper does not
identify alleged victims of sexual assaults.</TE>
<TE>   The latest assault heightened concerns among Marshall students,
some of whom had been only vaguely aware of the danger. "I haven't
even seen a sketch of that guy," said Valerie Gomez, 16. "Cameras
would help. But they should have done that a long time ago. It seems
like they don't care."</TE>
<TE>   One parent, Margarita Zelaya, who was waiting for her 14-year-old
daughter to get out of school, said she is too afraid to allow her
daughter to walk home. "The school needs more adults outside watching
the children," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Morley, director of school services at Marshall High, said
the school is doing all it can. Marshall and Franklin high schools
have sent letters home to parents, warning them to have students walk
in groups and to remain cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than to be vigilant to parents, there isn't much more the
school can do," Morley said. "It is a police problem; it's not a
problem the school can solve.... We don't have the resources to put
people on the streets, like crossing guards, when we have [thousands
of] students in a year-round school."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is frustrated that the assailant remains at large, said
Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents District 4,
where most of the attacks have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked closely with the community, the school, the LAPD and
special section detectives on this case," he said. "It's very
unfortunate that this situation has taken place a number of times."</TE>
<TE>   Police asked anyone with information about the assaults to call
Stone at (213) 763-5061.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Now Can Turn Focus to the Future</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Democratic Party and those vying to lead it back into the White
House have all probably gained as a result of Al Gore's decision to
step aside in 2004, most analysts agree.</LD>
<LD>   His withdrawal, they said, will banish the ghosts of the last
disputed election and offer Democrats a chance to focus on the
future, which comes as a huge relief to many in the party.</LD>
<LD>   While hard-core partisans continue to question the legitimacy of
President Bush's election, "as of today, most Americans, and
particularly swing voters, believe the 2000 election is over and
don't want it re-fought," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Regardless of what issues Gore and Bush wrestled over -- if, in
fact, there had been a rematch in 2004 -- "inevitably there'd be a
sense among the public the race was just a rehash of a decision
people thought they'd already made," said Mellman, who is close to
several possible presidential contestants but so far remains neutral
in the budding contest.</TE>
<TE>   Voters, Mellman added, "want to make a new decision, a fresh
decision."</TE>
<TE>   With Gore taking his leave, one of several new, comparatively
fresh Democratic faces now will have a chance to emerge over the next
12 months. Had the former vice president run, he undoubtedly would
have controlled the agenda, much of the dialogue and the pacing of
the race.</TE>
<TE>   "If Gore had remained in the field, the entire race would have
been seen through the prism of Gore," said Chris Lehane, a key Gore
strategist in the 2000 campaign. "A presidential nominating process
is a marathon. With Gore in, he would have begun that marathon with a
decent start, which may not have been insurmountable but would have
been a challenge for everyone to overcome. Now everyone starts in the
same place."</TE>
<TE>   It was just more than two years ago that Gore won the popular vote
in one of the nation's closest, most bitterly fought presidential
elections. He lost the White House when the U.S. Supreme Court
awarded Florida's disputed electoral votes to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Some Gore partisans felt he deserved a rematch, given the
cliff-hanging outcome in 2000. But to others, he increasingly seemed
like a candidate whose time had passed, especially in the aftermath
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have just changed so dramatically that the nature of the
debate has to be different from the last election," said Peverill
Squire, a political scientist at the University of Iowa and a
front-row observer of the event that will formally launch the 2004
contest, the Iowa caucuses.</TE>
<TE>   "National security will be more prominent than it was. We're now
running deficits, rather than surpluses. Our Medicare and Social
Security problems will be of even larger concern than they have been,
just because the retirement of the baby boomers will be four years
closer," Squire continued. "We need to talk about all these things in
a different way, and it would have been hard for Gore to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president said as much himself in the "60 Minutes"
interview on CBS in which he revealed his long-awaited decision. "I
think a campaign that would have been a rematch between myself and
President Bush would inevitably involve a focus on the past that
would, in some measure, distract from the focus on the future that I
think all campaigns have to be about," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   With the former vice president gone from the field, the Democratic
contest now promises to be the most competitive since 1992, when
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton emerged from a scrum of candidates who
were little known and, save for Clinton, now mostly forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the lineup of Democrats jockeying for the 2004
nomination lists several with impressive pedigrees, including the
party's 2000 vice presidential nominee, Connecticut Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman; the outgoing Democratic leader in the House, Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, and the current favorite of many insiders, Sen.
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Each benefits from Gore's withdrawal, in ways both tangible and
intangible. In fact, every one of the roughly half a dozen potential
candidates running or thinking of running woke up in better shape
today than they were in on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the biggest beneficiary is Lieberman. He said for months
that he would not run if Gore did -- all the while laying the
groundwork for a 2004 bid. He declined comment Sunday concerning
Gore's decision, but his entry into the contest is now considered a
certainty.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont Gov. Howard Dean entered the contest months ago, and Kerry
recently formed an exploratory committee as the first step toward his
official entry. Gephardt is expected to declare his candidacy
sometime next month, and New York-based political activist the Rev.
Al Sharpton has said he plans to run. Sens. John Edwards of North
Carolina, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Christopher J. Dodd of
Connecticut also are weighing White House bids.</TE>
<TE>   Other names will likely bubble up over the next few weeks and
months -- like that of former NATO commander Wesley K. Clark -- as
gossip and speculation inevitably fill the sudden vacuum. "It's part
of the natural rhythm: One big name comes off the board and people
look around for another to fill it," Lehane said. "Everyone is always
looking for the perfect candidate, as if there is such a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Gauging the nascent Democratic field at this stage -- more than a
year before the first ballots are cast -- is necessarily a
speculative endeavor. But with Gore removed from consideration, a
rough hierarchy has emerged, consisting of Lieberman, Kerry and
Gephardt.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman enjoys residual name recognition from his well-regarded
vice presidential run. But many believe that, as leader of the
party's moderate-to-conservative wing, he is too far out of step with
the left-leaning Democrats who dominate the party's intramural
contests.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt is also widely known, having been a national figure since
he ran for president in 1988. But to some in the party, that makes
him a bit shopworn.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry had emerged in the last few weeks as the leading alternative
to Gore, thanks to the odd alchemy of insider chatter and favorable
press coverage that substitutes for the lack of more solid
measurements at this early stage of the race. The timing is
fortuitous; with the midterm elections over, now is when the party's
best fund-raisers and savviest strategists begin choosing up sides.</TE>
<TE>   The danger for Kerry, as one party strategist put it, is "his head
is now very much above the trench. He becomes the No. 1 target for
other people running, for the press, for the Bush White House and the
rest of the Republican attack apparatus."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Sunday, Kerry said he respected the
"difficult and personal decision" that Gore made and welcomed his
pledge to help fight to unseat Bush and uphold "the principles we
share."</TE>
<TE>   The nature of that fight will become far more clear over roughly
the next year. Public opinion polling over the last several decades
has shown that a president's vulnerability -- or lack thereof --
becomes clear at roughly the three-quarter mark of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democrats look to have a solid field at this point," said Ed
Sarpolus, a nonpartisan pollster in the perennial battleground state
of Michigan. "But we really won't know whether it's strong enough to
take on Bush for quite a while."</TE>

<HD>Gore Decides He Won't Run for President</HD>
<DH>A race isn't 'the right thing' for him, he says, but he
still wants to help defeat Bush in 2004. The move opens the field for
other Democrats.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore said Sunday that he will not run for
the White House again, removing the prospect of a rematch with
President Bush that some Democrats believed was his due, but others
had dreaded.</LD>
<LD>   "I've decided that I will not be a candidate for president in
2004," Gore declared on CBS' "60 Minutes," breaking his nearly
two-year-long cogitation with a vow to work against Bush's
reelection.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old Gore -- who served as vice president to President
Clinton for eight years before making his own run for the White House
in 2000 -- said Sunday, "I personally have the energy and drive and
ambition to make another campaign, but I don't think that it's the
right thing for me to do.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to contribute to ending the current administration. I
think the current policies have to be changed. I think that my best
way of contributing to that result may not be as a candidate this
time around," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   His decision clears the way for a spirited contest for the
Democratic Party's mantle to challenge Bush in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Among those likely to run are Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut, Gore's running mate two years ago who made history by
becoming the country's first Jewish major-party candidate for
national office. Other hopefuls could include Sens. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and John Edwards of North
Carolina, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Vermont Gov.
Howard Dean. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York political activist,
also has said he plans to run.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman has said repeatedly that he would not seek the
Democratic presidential nomination were Gore to run, but that he
would probably do so if Gore did not.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the senator said Lieberman would refrain from
comment Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's decision forecloses the possibility of a bitter replay of
the 2000 campaign, which ended in a virtual tie, with Gore winning
the popular vote but with Bush prevailing after the Supreme Court, by
a 5-4 vote, halted a controversial recount in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Gore] was clearly the front-runner for the nomination," said
Bill Carrick, a Gephardt advisor. "Now you've got a classic race
that's just wide open."</TE>
<TE>   Gore's decision will disappoint a lot of rank-and-file voters, who
felt he had been robbed in one of the closest elections in history.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, Clinton said: "Al Gore was the best vice
president America ever had. He would have been a fine president had
history taken a different course two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   To insiders, only the timing of the decision was a surprise, as
Gore had said he would confer with his family over the holidays
before making any announcement. His recent policy pronouncements and
public criticisms of Bush during a nationwide book tour led many to
believe that he would run. But others thought that his heart just
wasn't in it.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the former vice president's ardent supporters -- as well
as key strategists and party officials around the country who worked
tirelessly for him two years ago -- walked away from the 2000 debacle
angry at Gore for having run what they regarded as an inept campaign.</TE>
<TE>   They felt he should have routed Bush, as the nation was at peace
and the economy still appeared strong. And so in recent months many
of Gore's onetime loyalists have signed on with other prospective
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's support among elected Democratic officials also had
weakened, sometimes in glaring ways.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, at a private gathering that preceded the recent
memorial service in Minneapolis for Sen. Paul Wellstone, many
Democrats all but shunned Gore -- "as if he had leprosy," said one
Democratic senator who was there.</TE>
<TE>   In that same room, he said, Clinton was virtually mobbed by
admirers.</TE>
<TE>   Another harbinger of Gore's decision came during an October
gathering of the extended Gore family in Carthage, Tenn., to
celebrate the 90th birthday of the vice president's mother.
Throughout the weekend, according to one person who was present, not
a word about politics was spoken.</TE>
<TE>   In his CBS interview, Gore acknowledged that some Democrats were
not eager to see him run again.</TE>
<TE>   "The last campaign was an extremely difficult one," he said. "I
think that there are a lot of people within the Democratic Party who
felt exhausted by that, who felt like, 'OK, I don't wanna go through
that again.' And I'm frankly sensitive to that feeling."</TE>
<TE>   While Gore's decision no doubt heartened some Democrats, it
probably came as a disappointment of sorts to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by Bush's high personal popularity -- still registering in
opinion polls at more than 60% -- Karl Rove, the president's chief
political strategist, has been itching privately for a Bush-Gore
rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Sunday night if he was surprised by Gore's announcement,
Rove said, "Yes and no."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be a fool's errand, but he's probably figured
it out."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's popularity soared after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and he now holds
an almost 20-percentage-point lead over Gore in polls that examined
another contest between the two.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's inauguration, Gore all but vanished from public view.
But it seemed like he couldn't win for losing.</TE>
<TE>   He set out to give Bush some space to launch his presidency, but
many of his die-hard supporters lambasted him for not standing up for
his beliefs by challenging Bush's actions.</TE>
<TE>   And then, just as Gore was beginning to reemerge, 9/11 struck and
profoundly altered the landscape, virtually freezing all political
activities.</TE>
<TE>   As a private citizen, Gore taught at Columbia University and then
at Fisk University and Middle Tennessee State University -- where he
also set about mending fences after losing the state to Bush. Had
Gore carried his own state, Florida's outcome would have been moot.</TE>
<TE>   Gore and his wife, Tipper, also co-wrote a book about families,
"Joined at the Heart," just released and panned by some critics as
pedantic.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Gore also has served as vice chairman of
Metropolitan West Financial, a Los Angeles-based financial services
holding company, providing advice on biotechnology and information
technology.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his home-state political fence-mending, the Gores
bought a house in Nashville -- a white house.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, it was the first house of their own. The Carthage
farm they own once belonged to his parents; their Arlington, Va.,
house was inherited from Tipper Gore's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Friends say the Gores have relished decorating the Nashville house
and seemed to truly enjoy their new -- and far more private -- life.</TE>
<TE>   They also both treasured having more time to spend with their two
grandchildren, Gore friends said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of day, he was just very, very happy with his life,"
one said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Gore came to believe that he could still shape public
policy and influence political debate from outside the arena. His
recent speeches on Iraq, health care and the economy all drew
considerable news media attention.</TE>
<TE>   "He still will have a platform to impact things that he cares
deeply about, and he doesn't have to run for president," one former
top Gore aide said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Gore displayed one familiar trait: a penchant for
springing surprises on people -- even those close to him.</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president's decision, and the timing of his
announcement, surprised even Frank Hunger, Gore's brother-in-law and
perhaps best friend. Hunger said he had no idea that Gore had made a
decision one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   Gore had been scheduled in the coming days to consult "a long list
of people" to discuss his political future, one Gore insider said
Sunday night. "I don't know what accelerated the decision," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Gore was in New York over the weekend and hosted "Saturday Night
Live," where he donned a wig and in jest pretended to be Trent Lott,
the beleaguered incoming Senate majority leader now defending his
post against charges that his remarks at a birthday party for
100-year-old Strom Thurmond were racially intolerant.</TE>
<TE>   In his CBS interview, Gore acknowledged that, in passing up a bid
in 2004, he may never again run for the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, never say never. But I make this decision in the
full knowledge and awareness that if I don't run this time ... that's
probably the last opportunity I'll ever have to run for president."</TE>
<TE>   But Gore indicated he would not be looking back.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to closure on this. I don't think it's the right thing
for me to be a candidate in 2004."</TE>

<HD>A Staggering Abundance of Crash-Causing Glitches</HD>
<DH>What ails the Harrier? The list goes on and on. And even
when everything is working properly, the plane is a bear to fly.</DH>

<DL>CHERRY POINT, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The pigeons in the hangar had worn out their welcome.</LD>
<LD>   So late one night, three Marine maintenance workers launched an
artillery assault on the squatters in the rafters. Armed with
slingshots and ball bearings, they fired round after round, unfazed
by the $28-million Harrier attack jet parked nearby.</LD>
<LD>   They bagged one bird before being told to knock it off.
The Marines then searched the hangar, inspected the plane and thought
they had found all the bearings.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, having flown the Harrier to Ohio, Capt. Stephen E.
Brooks had just taken off for home when the engine shuddered with a
thunderous crack. Finding himself powerless 150 feet above a busy
interstate, he pointed the nose toward a cornfield and pulled the
ejection handle. He walked away with scrapes, bruises and a medal for
steering his plane away from a strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation into the October 1997 crash determined that a
foreign object had shaken loose during takeoff and ricocheted through
the whirring engine, reducing compressor blades to shrapnel. A
metallurgical analysis confirmed what was widely assumed: A dent in
one of the damaged blades matched the ball bearings like a
fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   Harrier pilots have encountered a mind-bending array of
calamities, some unfathomable in their recklessness, others
dispiriting in their predictability. In the 31 years the Marines have
flown the plane, just about anything that could go wrong has gone
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, engines have flamed out, compressor blades have
cracked, control sticks have jammed, wing flaps have frozen, nose
wheels have veered off runways. A widely respected pilot and a flight
surgeon lost their lives when the acrylic canopy over their cockpit
imploded.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can think of a situation, it's happened," said Durward
Savage, a retired Harrier pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials knew about defects in the flaps and ejection
system for years before fixing them, while planes crashed and pilots
died. Problems with the plane's engine persisted as the Marines and
the manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, engaged in finger-pointing over who
was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier's mechanical breakdowns have been compounded by
maintenance lapses that have helped make it the most accident-prone
airplane in the U.S. arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   The corps has been devoted for decades to creating an aviation
fleet that can take off and land vertically, with the Harrier as its
prototype. The plane can rise like a helicopter, hover in precarious
balance and then roar off toward the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   But the Marines' Icarus-like pursuit of vertical flight has
strained the limits of the plane, its pilots, maintenance crews and
budget, trumping the corps' renowned can-do resourcefulness.</TE>
<TE>   They have cut corners to save time and money. Rather than spending
millions on engine testing, for example, they have let pilots
discover the plane's failings at 15,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a revolutionary airplane with an underdeveloped engine
program and we put it in the fleet," said Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden
Jr., recently retired commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. "We
let the fleet figure out what the problems were and we killed
people."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 45 Marines have died in 143 noncombat accidents since the
corps first bought the Harrier from the British in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps officials say they have never knowingly allowed an
unsafe aircraft to fly. The current chief of Marine aviation, Lt.
Gen. Michael A. Hough, said safety improvements on the Harrier have
always been a top priority. But he said it often took years to
design, test and implement such changes.</TE>
<TE>   "And you can't down your fleet and say, 'Well, we'll take a little
pause here for about three or four years, boys, and get back to you
later,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Marines have never deferred safety-related fixes
because they lacked funding. But he is contradicted by predecessors,
other Marine officers, accident records and official reports.</TE>
<TE>   When asked which problems he would have addressed with more money,
retired Lt. Gen. Harold W. Blot, a former head of Marine aviation,
hardly knew where to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "there was a nose wheel steering issue. There was
an inlet guide vane issue. There was the flap impingement issue."</TE>
<TE>   Under the best circumstances, flying the Harrier is a formidable
task. In an era of advanced avionics, with computers doing much of
the flying, it still requires considerable manual dexterity (known
among pilots as "monkey skills") and mental focus ("headwork").</TE>
<TE>   Charles E. Myers Jr., a former director for air warfare in the
Pentagon, likens the allure to riding "the nastiest horse in the
rodeo."</TE>
<TE>   While a conventional jet has one way to take off and one way to
land, the Harrier pilot must master four basic methods for each. In
addition to handling the throttle, control stick and rudder pedals,
he also must maneuver the four rotating nozzles that allow the plane
to ascend and descend on powerful blasts of hot air.</TE>
<TE>   While flying vertically, he must pay close attention to wind
direction. Add the challenges of operating at night or from a moving
ship and the task becomes daunting.</TE>
<TE>   Retired pilot Brooks, whose plane was damaged in the pigeon hunt,
compares it to "speeding your car 90 mph through a crowded shopping
mall parking lot while playing the hardest X-Box video game
imaginable and talking on your cell phone."</TE>
<TE>   Proficiency in the Harrier cockpit requires, at minimum, 15 to 20
hours in the air each month, according to the Marines. But the
plane's frequent groundings -- there have been 31 in the last 12
years alone -- mean pilots often have to make do with simulators. As
recently as 2000, they averaged 8.2 flight hours a month; that has
since increased to 13 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The downtime has contributed to numerous accidents caused by pilot
error. But in some instances, pilots have been assigned posthumous
blame even when inadequate training or mechanical problems were
significant factors.</TE>
<TE>   The aviators risked their lives every day but did not always get
the support they deserved, said retired Maj. Gen. Michael D. Ryan, a
former Marine wing commander who is now executive vice president of
government business for Rolls-Royce North America Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "These pilots were young guys, hard chargers, superheroes," he
said, "who were working for leadership that sometimes didn't provide
them with what they needed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Flap Problems</TE>
<TE>   From the time the Marines first discovered a dangerous flaw in the
Harrier's wing flaps, nearly eight years passed, three planes crashed
and two pilots died. Only then did the Marines and their Navy
counterparts decide to completely redesign the problem part. It took
another eight years to find the money and do the work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, as 1st Lt. Edward C. Jasiewicz was trying to land his
Harrier at the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, the flaps
suddenly froze, pitching the nose forward and prompting the pilot to
eject to safety.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation focused on the electronic device that controls
movement of the flaps, which help provide the plane with lift. The
report noted that the failure rate for the device, known as a flap
electronic controller, had been nearly three times higher than
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, another flap failure forced 1st Lt. Kerry D. Dale
to eject only 33 feet above the ground as his plane plunged into a
stand of Carolina pines and exploded into bits.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a light body bag," said his father, Jim P. Dale.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation found that moisture had seeped into the flap
controller and shorted it out.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines took steps to reduce the problem, like coating the
circuitry with waterproofing, while the airframe manufacturer,
McDonnell Douglas Corp., explored longer-term solutions.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, pilots were expected to fly their way out of
trouble by following directions in their flight manuals, according to
officials from the Naval Air Systems Command, which oversees Marine
aircraft safety.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Maj. Woody F. Gilliland managed to land his plane after
the flaps seized up at more than 20,000 feet. Again, the
investigation identified moisture as the culprit, according to
Gilliland.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Capt. William P. Delaney had just taken off from
Cherry Point in a light rain when the flaps on his Harrier jammed.
Delaney ejected just before his plane smacked the runway, broke apart
and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   The parachuting pilot descended into the fireball and was killed.</TE>
<TE>   The crash investigation found that two wires to the flap
controller had broken, cited moisture as a "contributing factor" and
again recommended a complete redesign of the controller box.</TE>
<TE>   Determining that their previous "Band-Aid" fixes had not been
sufficient, the Marines and the company then decided to redesign the
box, said Vince L. Higbee, Harrier program manager for Boeing Co.,
which bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   It took another two years for the Marines to find the
money, Higbee said, adding that such a period was "not atypical" for
military procurement.</TE>
<TE>   It was only last year, 15 years after the Jasiewicz crash, that
the company completed delivery of the newly designed parts to the
Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   The design changes rerouted the flow of moist air around the
controller box and programmed the flaps so that they automatically
override mistakes made by pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The cost was $21 million. There have been no reported flap-related
accidents since.</TE>
<TE>   "It took Billy's accident for the Pentagon to get the money to fix
that system," said William Delaney, the pilot's father. "Had they
spent the money, they would have saved his life. He would still be
here."</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, the Naval Air Systems Command said the
true nature of the flaps problem wasn't understood until the Delaney
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Higbee said each decision was based on the information available
at the time. "In hindsight," he said, "you would have done something
different."</TE>
<TE>   The slowness in dealing with the flaps reflects a pattern of
deferred repairs to critical Harrier components.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ejection System</TE>
<TE>   The ejection system killed three pilots between 1990 and 1998 and
seriously injured several others before the Marines made
modifications, records show.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 report of the Harrier Review Panel, a Marine Corps
commission, said that while the ejection seat had worked at least 94%
of the time since 1985, it also suffered from "known deficiencies."</TE>
<TE>   The report cited concerns with the seat's computerized selection
of ejection speeds and with an apparent design flaw that sometimes
caused the harness straps to slap forcefully against the pilot's
helmet. Because the Harrier operates so close to the ground when
flying vertically, its ejection seat is especially fast-opening and
therefore especially violent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Navy declined for at least 10 years to pay for a
recommended steering mechanism that would have given parachuting
pilots greater maneuverability. All other Navy and Marine aircraft
have such a system.</TE>
<TE>   The ejection seat manufacturer had proposed testing a four-line
release system in the Harrier parachute as far back as 1988. But the
Naval Air Systems Command responded that there were "no funds
available," according to an internal document.</TE>
<TE>   The systems command found the money after a prominent Marine pilot
was killed in 1998 while ejecting from a Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   But the parachutes were not equipped with the new system in time
to save Col. Kevin E. Leffler, who ejected into high winds over Death
Valley National Park in 1999. With little control over his descent,
Leffler dropped into a canyon and died when his head struck a
boulder.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps investigation concluded that a four-line release
steering system "might have saved the pilot's life." It has since
been provided as part of a $7-million package of parachute
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Engine Trouble</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier's single Rolls-Royce engine has been a persistent
source of trouble, playing a role in more than half of all Harrier
accidents between 1980 and 2001, according to a Times analysis of the
Naval Safety Center's aviation database. Even after the Marines
swapped out the Harrier's original AV-8A model for the improved
AV-8B, the new engine proved to be five times less reliable than the
engine in the F/A-18 Hornet, according to a 1992 audit by the Defense
Department's inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole 20 years I was there, they were always doing engine
modifications but they could just never fix it," said Clinton M.
Higginbotham, a retired Marine Corps major who spent much of his
career maintaining the Harrier. "It was just a bad engine from
Rolls-Royce."</TE>
<TE>   The company has paid to correct two design defects. But
Rolls-Royce officials said other engine problems stem from the
failure by the Marines and the Naval Air Systems Command to make
engineering changes recommended by the company or to invest enough in
testing and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   When Capt. Daniel J. Gilkey had to bail out of his Harrier at
17,000 feet over the California desert in June 2000, the engine part
that failed had been marked for modification years earlier by Rolls.
The same part had malfunctioned in at least four other Harriers.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of funding for the AV-8 has always been substantially
less than other combat aircraft," said Colin H. Green, president of
Rolls-Royce's Defence Aerospace division.</TE>
<TE>   Since a meeting two years ago between the Marine Corps commandant
and the Rolls-Royce chairman, cooperation has improved and both have
dedicated additional resources to the engine, officials on both sides
say. After Gilkey's crash, the Naval Air Systems Command grounded 101
Harriers while working with Rolls-Royce to make modifications the
company had recommended previously, said Ryan, the Rolls executive.
The planes remained out of service for at least six weeks and some
did not return to the air for close to a year.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the only time engine problems compromised Marine
readiness. In 1991, the new night attack version of the Harrier was
held out of the Persian Gulf War after a nonfatal crash revealed that
the engine casing flexed at high speeds, creating friction that
caused fires. The corps and the Naval Air Systems Command had chosen
not to subject the new engine to expensive preflight testing.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it just drove us crazy," said retired Col. Ronald V. Deloney,
who led the squadron that had to stay home. "We watched the war on
CNN."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Money Problems</TE>
<TE>   Many Marine leaders maintain that money for the Harrier has always
been scarce.</TE>
<TE>   Some blame the Navy, which controls the corps' aviation budget.
They say the Navy has been tightfisted because the Harrier is flown
only by the Marines. And several retired generals said the Navy,
which is largely defined by its aircraft carriers, has felt
threatened by the Harrier's ability to launch from assault ships with
shorter decks.</TE>
<TE>   But former Navy secretaries said they never intentionally
shortchanged the plane and that the Marines set their own budgetary
priorities. The Harrier, said Sean O'Keefe, who was Navy secretary
during the first Bush administration, simply "proved to be more
expensive, harder to maintain, harder to operate and required a lot
more care and feeding than other tactical aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Rear Adm. Robert H. Gormley said Navy leaders were "very
resentful" that the corps poured money into a plane that never seemed
to outpace its problems. "They just didn't see what the return was
for these dollars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the review panel concluded that the AV-8B's risk was
"uniquely high" and recommended more than 50 fixes and upgrades. The
Marine Corps and Navy committed $133 million over six years to make
the improvements. About a third of the money had been spent as of
late last year and, as of Oct. 2, 29 of the panel's recommended
improvements had been completed, the Marines said. Another 19 are
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Now, said Lt. Col. R.E. Claypool, who commands a Harrier squadron
in Yuma, Ariz., "we've got our arms around the engine."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Marine Commandant Charles C. Krulak, who convened the
review panel, called the new and improved Harrier "an ass-kicking
machine."</TE>
<TE>   That same machine crashed three times this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deadly Fixes</TE>
<TE>   On his first day as a Marine mechanic, Larry Stoneroad strolled
out on the tarmac at Cherry Point to marvel at a hovering Harrier.
His awe quickly turned to horror as the plane rolled over and slammed
to the ground, fatally injuring the pilot. "I thought, 'Oh, my gosh!
How many of these am I going to see?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneroad saw enough that he retired in 1999, after 25 years,
without ever accepting a pilot's offer to take a spin in one of the
very planes he maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd seen too many of them go down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marine mechanics have long faced the unenviable task of ensuring
the Harrier's safety. The plane's inaccessible engine and myriad
breakdowns are challenge enough. But many also have tackled their
jobs with inadequate training and support, under tremendous pressure
to keep the planes flying.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneroad's longevity made him something of an oddity among
Harrier mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   Gunnery Sgt. John Higginbotham, a senior Harrier mechanic at
Cherry Point, said it was not so long ago that, with just three years
under his belt, he was the most experienced mechanic in his squadron.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, where maintenance-related mistakes are relatively
rare, some Harrier mechanics have worked on the plane for more years
than their American counterparts have been alive.</TE>
<TE>   Some Marine leaders acknowledge that the Harrier, quite simply, is
often too complex for the recent high school graduates who typically
maintain it.</TE>
<TE>   "We had regular guys fixing them, not engineers," said retired Lt.
Gen. Charles H. Pitman, a former chief of Marine aviation, "and so we
found that some of the problems were caused by us doing something we
shouldn't have done."</TE>
<TE>   For instance:</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance workers installed the wrong size washer in Col.
Leffler's plane, which led to an engine fire that forced his ejection
over Death Valley in 1999, investigation reports show.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines knew the wrong washers had been installed in some
planes.  Three years before Leffler's accident, the same mistake had
caused two nonfatal crashes. The Naval Air Systems Command ordered
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   But military officials did not believe all Harrier
engines contained the bad part. And with some Harriers deployed overseas,
they did not want to ground the entire fleet, according to an
internal maintenance bulletin. Leffler's plane was among those
exempted.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the critical consequences of this decision," the
investigators wrote, "it would have made more sense to inspect all
engines."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, a TAV-8A, the first-generation two-seat training model of
the Harrier, crashed after the plane's control stick jammed during a
vertical takeoff. Capt. Paul L. Spargo Jr. ejected too late, dying
instantly as he slammed into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators discovered that loose parts under the floorboard had
caused the problem. Mechanics discarded the parts six years earlier,
after using the cockpit to test experimental equipment while the
plane was sidelined by an earlier crash. With the parts undetected,
the plane was returned to service.</TE>
<TE>   Just six days before Spargo's crash, another pilot reported that
the control stick was binding. Mechanics could not replicate the
problem on the ground and cleared the plane for flight.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was shocked that something like this would happen,"
said Newton A. Collyar, the squadron operations officer at the time.
"Somebody really dropped the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Richard F. Davis died in 1975 when his AV-8A rolled on its
side and crashed as he attempted a vertical takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators discovered that a maintenance worker had left a
flashlight in the engine bay, the equivalent of stitching up a
patient with a scalpel still inside. The flashlight created "a severe
loose article hazard condition" that could have caused the accident,
the investigation report said.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Davis Kennedy, the pilot's widow, did not know about the
flashlight until The Times contacted her last summer. She had been
told only that there was a fire.</TE>
<TE>   "After all these years, to think it might have been human error,"
she said. "It rips me apart."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortcomings</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance workers were surprisingly frank about their
shortcomings in a survey by the Harrier Review Panel for its 1998
report.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-three percent said they were undertrained. Seven in 10 said
they did not have enough equipment or spare parts. Sixty percent said
they had seen a colleague do something wrong or dangerous and 35%
said they had been forced to do so themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneroad recalled several instances when higher-ranking Marines
overrode his objections and signed off on planes he considered
unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd just say, 'We need the airplane,' " he said. In those
cases, Stoneroad said he would quietly warn the pilot during
preflight checks: "Did you see that I didn't sign off on it? You just
be prepared if anything happens." The pilots invariably would fly
anyway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Lee Schram, the Harrier coordinator for the Marine Corps
and a former Harrier squadron maintenance officer, said he had never
heard of a Marine mechanic being asked to do something improper. He
said a series of checks ensures that "safety is stressed at all
levels."</TE>
<TE>   At times, Harrier mechanics have worked exhausting hours that only
increased the chances they would make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going home till it's done," said Harold Bunch, 25, a
Harrier mechanic who left the corps earlier this year. "So if you see
ways to cut corners without putting a pilot in danger, you do it. Of
course, people have different judgments. There's a lot of gray areas
when it comes to safety."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the Harrier's unique design, maintaining the aircraft
is a time-consuming chore.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve the plane's balance while hovering, its engine is
located in the middle of the fuselage. It can be removed for repair
only by taking off the wings, a gargantuan task requiring the
disconnection of various controls, hydraulic lines and wires.</TE>
<TE>   On average, it takes 550 man-hours to remove and replace the
engine, the Marines say. It takes nine hours to perform the same work
on the twin-engine F/A-18 flown by the Navy and Marines and 10 hours
on the Air Force's single-engine F-16 Fighting Falcon.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier required about 25 hours of maintenance for every hour
of flight in 2002, two to five times the hours needed for various
models of the F/A-18. The Harrier's cost per flight hour, a figure
that includes maintenance, was $5,351 in 2001. For the Marines'
F/A-18C it was $3,871.</TE>
<TE>   The demands on time and money can create a disincentive to perform
heavy maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Marines do not regularly schedule the Harrier
engine for major overhauls, as is done with most military aircraft.
They order major repairs only when a problem is found or near the end
of the engine's life expectancy. The savings are considerable. But
the money has not always been available for the rigorous testing
needed to forecast when various parts will wear out.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines also scrimp on spare parts, causing mechanics to
cannibalize components from one plane to keep others in the air.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, planes often fly with known ailments, or "gripes,"
that are not considered serious enough to warrant immediate repair.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, the retired general now with Rolls-Royce, said it was common
in the mid-1990s for Harriers to fly with 40 or 50 outstanding
gripes, and sometimes with more than 100. Shortly after becoming a
wing commander, he prohibited planes from flying with more than 10, a
limit soon applied to all Marine aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it wasn't a healthy airplane," he said. "The
can-do message is great, but we shouldn't be stretching it to encourage
people to do things like that."</TE>
<TE>   The money generated by the Harrier Review Panel report has paid
for some maintenance improvements. It has provided financial
incentives for experienced mechanics to reenlist and has purchased
better equipment. Among the measures not approved was money to allow
mechanics to remove engine sections, or modules, for repair without
removing the entire engine.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, maintenance problems have continued.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Capt. Michael R. Brunnschweiler ejected over
California after his Harrier lost hydraulic power and began tumbling
through the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Among several errors, investigators found that mechanics had
improperly connected a hose that feeds hot air from the engine to the
Harrier's 25-millimeter Gatling gun.</TE>
<TE>   "The hot air leaks out right on the ammunition and it heats up and
goes boom," Brunnschweiler explained. As he ejected, his parachute
deployed with too much slack in the harness and a metal fitting
slapped him in the head.</TE>
<TE>   He lost sight in his left eye, fractured his skull and dislocated
his right shoulder. After six surgeries, he gave up any hope of
returning to the cockpit and took a medical retirement this year at
age 31.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm bummed, definitely," Brunnschweiler said. "All I ever wanted
to do was fly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pilot Blame</TE>
<TE>   In their final conversation, 1st Lt. Earle J. Anderson told his
brother, Richard, that if he ever crashed in a Harrier, the Marine
Corps would first bury him and then blame him.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trained to believe -- and we want to believe -- that the
aircraft will not let us down," Anderson explained that night. "So
whenever something happens, it's almost always attributed to pilot
error, so the rest of us can continue to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, on Jan. 26, 1990, Anderson's Harrier
plummeted from 35,800 feet to 22,300 feet in 24 seconds, entered a
deck of clouds and disappeared into the sea near Japan. There were no
radio transmissions and the Marines never found the plane or the
pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a dearth of physical evidence, Marine investigators
decided the most likely cause was pilot error, a bitter pill for
Anderson's grieving survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was not the only Harrier pilot to predict before dying
that he would be faulted for the plane's failures. They have had good
reason:</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Dale W. Mulkey died in 1996 after bombs aboard his AV-8B
detonated, sending it into a meteoric freefall.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines discovered that ordnance officers had committed a
series of mistakes, the most serious of which was arming the bombs
with expired fuses, making them six times more sensitive to
electrostatic effects. Even so, investigators initially blamed
Mulkey, claiming he was diving too steeply and slowly when he
released his bombs during a practice run.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-ranking officials later removed the pilot error finding and
substituted harsh language blaming the ordnance handlers "for
recklessness and lack of attention to detail."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Marine investigators attributed Kerry Dale's fatal crash
to pilot error because he failed to safely land his AV-8B after the
flaps froze. The flaps malfunctioned moments after takeoff and, with
only seconds to react, he inadvertently sent the plane into a dive.
Investigators dismissed the flap failure as only a "contributing
factor."</TE>
<TE>   1st Lt. Charles E. Simpson was blamed for the 1982 crash that took
his life because he mishandled an emergency landing in a plane with a
faulty external fuel tank.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel did not transfer properly from one tank to another,
creating an imbalance of 1,600 pounds on one side of the plane that
"forced the pilot to perform a high-workload landing," investigators
wrote. The fuel tank problem had been reported after a previous flight
but not fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of blaming pilots in such cases is misdirected, said
retired Maj. Gen. Paul Fratarangelo, a former Marine wing commander.</TE>
<TE>   "When an airplane demands more than a highly trained and skilled
pilot can deliver in an emergency situation, you fix the problem by
redesigning the airplane, not by assigning pilot error," Fratarangelo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots also have been faulted when investigators could not come up
with other explanations.</TE>
<TE>   In Anderson's case, unable to examine either his body or the
wreckage, they developed an elaborate scenario based largely on
supposition: The pilot lost consciousness after becoming so "task
saturated" that he failed to notice his cockpit was losing pressure.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of speculative conclusion would never be acceptable to
civilian agencies like the National Transportation Safety Board, said
Edward L. Monhollen, a former Army pilot and veteran aviation
accident investigator.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it borderline irresponsible to state a cause when so many
other possibilities exist," Monhollen said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason investigators resort to guesswork is that the Marines
have chosen, for financial reasons, not to equip the Harrier with a
flight data recorder strong enough to withstand all crashes. Even
when the plane's data storage unit does survive, it can be difficult
and time-consuming to download, and sometimes provides virtually no
clues.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier Review Panel concluded that pilots had caused a
quarter of the major accidents involving the AV-8B. But a mind-set
persists among Marine Corps leaders that pilots are responsible for
the vast majority of accidents. Retired Lt. Gen. Thomas H. Miller, a
founding father of the Harrier program, put the figure as high as
"80% to 90%."
   Some familiar with the program said there seemed to be
a particular eagerness to blame the pilot when he was no longer
available to explain or defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The big joke was that if the pilot lived, it was
mechanical error," said Clinton Higginbotham, the retired maintenance
officer. "If the pilot died, it was pilot error."</TE>
<TE>   The official cause of a major accident is determined after an
internal investigation's findings are reviewed and approved up the
line.</TE>
<TE>   Marine aviation chief Hough reacted indignantly to the notion that
pilots have been blamed unjustifiably.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the service 40 years," he said. "I've never heard
that in my life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Short on Hours</TE>
<TE>   Investigators looking into the 1981 crash of a Harrier flown by
1st Lt. David S. Noble made a disturbing discovery. He had flown just
7.5 hours in the previous 30 days -- half what the Marines say is
needed to fly the Harrier safely.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators suggested the lack of flying time may have
"reduced his awareness" of proper procedures. But they still held
Noble responsible for the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're flying every day, you're not afraid of anything," said
Noble, who survived his ejection but saw his career shattered. "But
if you're down for a few weeks, you forget stuff.... You're stressed
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Studies have found that inexperienced Harrier pilots are more
likely to be involved in pilot error accidents than inexperienced
pilots of other combat planes. Yet flight logs and crash
investigation reports show that Harrier pilots struggle to accumulate
anywhere near the flight time they need.</TE>
<TE>   One Marine who died in a crash blamed on pilot error flew as
little as two hours some months, according to his logbook. His widow,
who declined to be identified, once said he told her he "scared
himself" because of his lack of flying time.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Lt. Col. John W. Capito, a former Harrier squadron
commander, interviewed young pilots for the Harrier Review Panel and
learned that many were flying just four to five hours a month right
out of flight school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to fly a Cessna, much less a Harrier," Capito
said. "These guys were getting a third of the flight time they needed
and then people were wondering why they get in accidents."</TE>
<TE>   Within the tightknit fraternity of Harrier pilots -- there are
about 350 today -- the procession of flag-draped coffins and 21-gun
salutes has taken a toll. Wives have learned to live with the dread
that strangers in uniform may come knocking on their door at any
time.</TE>
<TE>   Family members spend the rest of their lives wondering whether it
was the plane or the pilot. They ask themselves how the Harrier could
have vanquished so many men who seemed so indestructible.</TE>
<TE>   Col. John H. Ditto, the highest-ranking pilot ever to die in a
Harrier, had 4,900 hours of flight time in his 24 years as a Marine,
including two tours in Vietnam. But Ditto's planes were the A-4
Skyhawk and the F-8 Crusader, and nothing he experienced in those
cockpits prepared him for the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, having been tapped to become a group commander, he
chose to learn to fly the jump jet because several AV-8A squadrons would
fall under him. On Jan. 19, with only 13.7 hours of flight time in
the Harrier, he lost control during a vertical takeoff and ejected
straight into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine Corps investigation concluded that Ditto stayed with his
plane too long and noted his "limited experience."</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Susan Page, said Ditto described the Harrier as "a bear
of an airplane." Even now, she feels heartbroken for his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you mention his name to anybody, they will say he was one of
the best sticks in the Marine Corps," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to think that there was something wrong with that
airplane, love to think that in that heap of metal, maybe they missed
something wrong with it."</TE>

<HD>GOP Fissure Opens in Senate Over Lott's Leadership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A top Republican on Sunday called for a new election for Senate
majority leader -- a fissure within the GOP ranks that seriously
threatens Sen. Trent Lott's hold on the job.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) became the first lawmaker to break
ranks since Lott (R-Miss.) made comments that seemed to endorse
segregation. Even President Bush rebuked the fellow Republican.
Nickles, the Senate GOP whip, said Lott was so weakened by the
controversy that he doubted his ability to "enact our agenda."</LD>
<LD>   Lott was selected last month to be majority leader when the
Republicans take control of the Senate in January. However, the
withering criticism he has endured over his remark praising the 1948
presidential campaign of then-segregationist Strom Thurmond has
raised questions about whether the GOP can afford politically for him
to remain in that important post.</LD>
<TE>   Lott has apologized repeatedly, and he said at a news conference
Friday that he has no plans to give up his post. He is to appear
tonight on the Black Entertainment Television network to again convey
his regrets.</TE>
<TE>   In publicly questioning whether Lott has become a liability for
the GOP, Nickles may have opened the door for other Senate
Republicans to ask whether the Mississippian should remain their
leader.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Sens. John W. Warner of Virginia and Charles Hagel of Nebraska
said Sunday that their colleagues should meet to consider Lott's
future to try to put the controversy behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "The buck stops not with one senator or a handful of senators, but
it's all 51 [Republican senators] ... deciding on what steps we
should take," Warner said in an interview. "It may be at that meeting
that we decide to give him another chance."</TE>
<TE>   Hagel said his colleagues must either "reconfirm their confidence"
in Lott's leadership or select a new leader. "In the interest of the
Republican Party, the president's agenda and the nation, this issue
must be resolved quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate reaction from Lott on Sunday, but his
supporters dismissed Nickles' comments as coming from a longtime Lott
rival who has coveted the majority leader job for himself. Lott's
allies also doubted that Nickles could muster the votes to topple
Lott.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe that Trent Lott has lost the confidence of the
Republican Caucus," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) told CNN's "Late
Edition." "I think he accurately said that he shouldn't have to
resign for being called something that he is not."</TE>
<TE>   "He made a terrible mistake," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the
incoming GOP whip, said on ABC's "This Week." "He's apologized, at
last count, on four different occasions, and it seems to me that we
ought to accept his apology and move on."</TE>
<TE>   Before a new leadership election could be called, five GOP
senators would have to make the request, said an aide to Sen. Rick
Santorum (R-Pa.), the conference chairman. The entire 51-member
conference then would vote on whether to hold a new election. Any
vote on a new leader would be a secret ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there are five senators right now who believe that
Sen. Lott's apologies should not be accepted," McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Santorum also defended Lott. "I know Trent Lott," he said on NBC's
"Meet the Press." "One of the reasons I think that Republican
senators will line up behind him -- and many Democrats too -- is
because they know this man.... This man is not anything like what
some are depicting him to be. This is ... someone who believes all
men are created equal -- not just under the Constitution, but more
importantly in the eyes of our creator."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued by his office, Nickles said that Lott has
apologized "and rightly so."</TE>
<TE>   "However, this is bigger than any single senator now," he said,
adding that he is concerned that Lott has "weakened to the point that
it may jeopardize his ability to enact our agenda and speak to all
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   "There are several outstanding senators who are more than capable
of effective leadership," Nickles added. "I hope we have an
opportunity to choose."</TE>
<TE>   Nickles aide Brook Simmons said that his boss spoke out because
"someone [within the Senate GOP ranks] had to say publicly what many
are saying privately."</TE>
<TE>   Nickles called White House political director Karl Rove on
Saturday to give him a heads up on his statement and phoned Lott on
Sunday morning. The White House had no official reaction to Nickles'
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Lott set off the furor when, at retiring Sen. Thurmond's 100th
birthday party, he said the country "wouldn't have had all these
problems" if the South Carolina Republican had won his segregationist
campaign for president in 1948. Reports of Lott's past opposition to
extending the Voting Rights Act and to making Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday a national holiday also have become part of the
debate.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of Lott suggested that he must do more to make amends.
"He's also got to apologize for a lifetime ... spent in opposition to
civil rights," NAACP board Chairman Julian Bond said on CNN. "Is this
the guy they want presenting the face of the Republican Party to the
American people?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he should go on a trip with us to visit some of the
historic sites of the civil rights movement," Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.)
said on "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats have talked about introducing a resolution
censuring Lott for his comments. But McConnell said that if such a
resolution is introduced, it should be amended to address racially
insensitive comments made by Democrats as well. Republicans privately
note that Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) used a derogatory racial term
in a television interview a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell also scoffed at speculation that if Lott is forced out
of his leadership post, he would resign his Senate seat, paving the
way for Mississippi's Democratic governor to appoint a replacement --
a move that would leave 50 Republicans, 49 Democrats and one
independent in the Senate, effectively negating the GOP majority.</TE>
<TE>   John J. Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College, said that Nickles' comments could spell the end of Lott's
leadership position. "If this were an episode of 'ER,' it would be
the scene where the lines on the monitor start to go flat," he said.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Wins as Gardner Digs In Late</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Luke Walton was in street clothes, nursing an injured ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Gardner struggled with his shooting for the second game in a
row.</LD>
<LD>   Somehow, Arizona is still No. 1 after a 73-70 victory over No. 8
Texas on Sunday in front of 14,577 at McKale Center.</LD>
<TE>   No Arizona defender could stay in front of slippery Texas point
guard T.J. Ford for long, as he darted through the lane almost at
will.</TE>
<TE>   But Gardner -- only briefly lured into the one-on-one showdown
everyone wanted to see -- had his team three points ahead at the end.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied with a little more than two minutes to play
when Gardner -- who made only three of his other 12 shots -- had
back-to-back baskets for a 69-65 lead the Wildcats never let go.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, that's a senior. Unbelievable," forward Rick Anderson said.
"I really can't explain those shots.... That's just a clutch player.
He didn't hit a lot of shots in the first half, but that doesn't
matter because he hit the ones down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   The first, with 2:07 left, was a falling-down jumper for a 67-65
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ford lost the ball out of bounds at the other end, and Gardner
drove the lane, then pulled up short for an easy jumper and a 69-65
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Ford tried to go baseline on Gardner and was called for
charging, and even though Gardner missed two of four free throws down
the stretch, he had done the biggest part.</TE>
<TE>   Texas still had a chance to tie with a three-pointer on the final
possession, but Ford missed, and Brandon Mouton failed to get beyond
the three-point line for his follow attempt, another miss.</TE>
<TE>   The score in the point-guard duel was Ford, 13 points and nine
assists; Gardner, 13 points, seven assists, eight rebounds and one
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to make it into a one-on-one matchup with T.J.
Ford," said Gardner, who had missed nine of 10 shots in his previous
game against San Diego State. "I trusted my team to come through....
He is a great player and he played really hard, but I've got to give
the most credit to my team for playing hard enough to get the win."</TE>
<TE>   Let Ford leave with the title of best point guard in the game:
Gardner and Arizona left with a 5-0 record. Texas is 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson nodded his approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I could kind of see [the temptation to go one-on-one with Ford,]"
he said. "But Jason is such a leader -- and he's a couple of years
ahead of T.J. in experience."</TE>
<TE>   James Thomas, the Longhorns' powerful center, led Texas with 20
points and 12 rebounds, his fifth double-double of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But Texas, previously ranked as high as No. 2, has to come to
terms with two losses in the past eight days after losing to Notre
Dame Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we should be the No. 1-ranked team in the country, but
we haven't finished two games in the last four minutes," Texas Coach
Rick Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona is No. 1, despite some shaky play at times and a young
rotation that featured two freshmen Sunday, forward Andre Iguodala
and guard Hassan Adams, from Westchester High.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats got by, but with Walton out, the offense lost its
nerve center.</TE>
<TE>   "When Luke plays, Jason doesn't have to do so much dribbling,"
said Salim Stoudamire, who came off the bench to lead Arizona with 14
points, making four of eight three-pointers and doing a better job
than anyone else who tried guarding Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "Luke's so versatile. That's why he's so important to our
basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   Walton, not Gardner, led Arizona with 18 assists before Sunday's
game. The Wildcats are focused on Walton returning before their
showdown with Oregon Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We need him, plain and simple," Anderson said. There's nothing
else to say."</TE>
<TE>   For at least one day, they survived a top-10 team without him.</TE>

<LD>The hot-stove league finally heated up Sunday after a cold start as
many clubs made moves, including a four-team trade and major
free-agent signing that highlighted a dizzying day at the baseball
winter meetings.</LD>
<LD>   The Arizona Diamondbacks, Cincinnati Reds, Oakland Athletics and
Toronto Blue Jays completed a deal that could help the Diamondbacks
hold off the Dodgers in the National League West next season. Arizona
acquired the starter it wanted to bolster a rotation that includes
Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, getting right-hander Elmer Dessens
from the Reds for first baseman Erubiel Durazo.</LD>
<LD>   Cincinnati sent the left-handed-batting Durazo to Oakland for
middle infielder Felipe Lopez, whom the Athletics got from Toronto
for a player to be named after today's Rule 5 draft.</LD>
<TE>   Dessens was 7-8 with a 3.03 earned run average in 30 starts and is
30-35 with a 4.29 ERA in four-plus seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We see him as a solid No. 3 starter, and his acquisition creates
a lot of flexibility for us," Arizona General Manager Joe Garagiola
Jr. said. "It takes a lot of pressure off the whole staff."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland General Manager Billy Beane finally acquired Durazo after
pursuing him for three years, the Reds accomplished their objective
of trimming payroll and the Blue Jays are expected to receive a
pitching prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the guy we wanted," Beane said of Durazo, expected to be
Oakland's full-time designated hitter. "It's almost comical. Durazo
has almost been my Holy Grail for three years. He's our type of guy."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giants got things rolling in the free-agent
market, signing infielder Edgardo Alfonzo, which added another twist
to infielder Jeff Kent's strange ride that could still end in San
Francisco. Meanwhile, the Montreal Expos moved closer to completing
payroll-trimming trades, creating a ripple-effect of transactions as
teams drop out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a process and these things take time," Montreal General
Manager Omar Minaya said. "I've met with 20-something teams and we're
not done."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were not as active as their NL West competitors, but
did sign middle infielder Quilvio Veras, who last played in the major
leagues for the Atlanta Braves in 2001, to a minor league contract
for $500,000, and were working to acquire Florida Marlin outfielder
Abraham Nunez for a prospect, baseball officials said. The Dodgers
signed Veras as an insurance policy for top prospect Joe Thurston,
expected to start at second base, and believe Nunez could provide
outfield depth.</TE>
<TE>   And, in an intriguing development, Dodger General Manager Dan
Evans and Texas GM John Hart have discussed parameters of a deal that
would send All-Star outfielder Juan Gonzalez to the Dodgers.
Right-hander Andy Ashby is believed to be the centerpiece of a
multiplayer package the Rangers would receive in exchange for
Gonzalez, a two-time American League MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gonzalez was limited to 70 games last season because of
hand injuries, he might be a good fit for the Dodgers because of his
relatively cost-effective contract and history of strong production.
The right-handed-batting Gonzalez could provide balance in the
batting order, helping overburdened left-handed-batting slugger Shawn
Green.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is scheduled to receive $12 million, of which $4.5
million is deferred with 2% compound interest, in the final year of a
two-year deal. Ashby is under contract for $8 million in 2003, and
has an $8.5-million option for 2004 that will vest if he pitches at
least 168 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers probably would move Green from right field to first
base to accommodate Gonzalez if he agreed to waive his-no trade
clause. Ashby also has a limited no-trade clause.</TE>
<TE>   Free agent Cliff Floyd, considered unlikely to sign with the
Dodgers because of their luxury-tax concerns, apparently is on the
verge of accepting arbitration and returning to the Boston Red Sox
for a one-year contract. The Red Sox also acquired Jeremy Giambi,
sending pitching prospect Josh Hancock to the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Evans also has had two meetings with the agent for free-agent
first baseman Fred McGriff, but has not discussed contract terms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just waiting to see what happens right now," McGriff said
from his home in Tampa, Fla. The Giants had a day of mixed emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonzo, an All-Star in 2000 with the New York Mets, received a
four-year, $26-million contract to join the Giants, continuing the
off-season makeover of the NL champions that soon might include the
departure of Kent. Unable to reach an agreement with the 2000 NL MVP
after another lengthy negotiating session Sunday, the Giants
finalized an agreement with Alfonzo to replace David Bell, who signed
with the Philadelphia Phillies, redirecting dollars that could have
gone to signing Kent.</TE>
<TE>   Although already over budget with the signing of Alfonzo, the
Giants plan to continue discussions with Kent's agent, Jeff Klein,
about a multiyear contract, and Kent has until Thursday to accept
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Kent had a salary of $6 million last season and could receive more
than $12 million in arbitration, causing further payroll problems for
the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Club officials believe Kent won't accept arbitration, which they
offered to receive draft picks as compensation if he signs with
another team, but the current climate isn't favorable for high-priced
free agents. With a projected opening-day payroll of about $74
million, the Giants would move to trade two or three players if Kent
determines that returning to San Francisco on a one-year deal is his
best option.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything's possible right now," Sabean said. "We knew that going
in when we offered it to him."</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, the New York Mets traded shortstop Rey Ordonez, a
three-time Gold Glove winner, to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for two
players to be named.</TE>

<KH>BUFFALO 20, SAN DIEGO 13</KH>
<HD>Flutie Not Up to His Old Tricks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The Buffalo Bills were prepared for anything -- even Doug Flutie.</LD>
<LD>   Travis Henry ran for 144 yards and two touchdowns, including a
26-yard game-deciding run with 52 seconds remaining, sparking the
Bills to a 20-13 victory over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Bills also got a poised effort from their defense, thwarting
any emotional boost the Chargers hoped to get from Flutie's first
appearance of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Flutie, who spent three seasons with the Bills before being
released in February 2001, received a mixed reaction of boos and
cheers when he entered the game in place of starter Drew Brees with
eight minutes remaining. Even though he set up Steve Christie's
53-yard field goal that tied the score, 13-13, on his first
possession, Flutie was unable to complete the comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "When Flutie came in, I knew we had to stay in our lanes because
he can make things happen," Bill linebacker London Fletcher said. "It
forced us to be disciplined on the back end."</TE>
<TE>   Flutie, who completed three of 11 passes for 64 yards, managed
only one scoring drive on three possessions. The game ended on
Buffalo's 37 when Flutie failed to complete two passes into the end
zone in the final 11 seconds, the last one tipped away by cornerback
Antoine Winfield.</TE>
<TE>   It was a big turnaround from the last time Flutie faced his former
team a year ago. He scored the winning touchdown with 70 seconds
remaining in San Diego's 27-24 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's victory kept the Bills (7-7) barely alive in the playoff
hunt. San Diego (8-6) has lost five of its last seven and faces a
crucial test when it plays at AFC West rival Kansas City next
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who hinted days earlier that
Flutie might get a chance to play, doused any potential quarterback
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "We will address one issue right at the outset," Schottenheimer
said. "Drew Brees is our starting quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer said it was a gut instinct that led him to go with
Flutie. And when Flutie passed to Curtis Conway for a 47-yard gain on
his first play, Schottenheimer said, "I thought, 'Gee, maybe there is
magic in this guy.'</TE>
<TE>   "At the outset of this season, we talked about that scenario
unfolding at some point in time, and today was that day.
Unfortunately, we didn't get the results."</TE>

<LD>   Pepperdine (3-3) vs. Richmond (3-2) at Palo Alto, 4:30, KPLS (830,
delayed 7 p.m.) -- Pepperdine opens play in the four-team Stanford
Invitational after losing to fifth-ranked Oregon, 105-90, Saturday
night in Malibu. The Waves had the lead early in the second half
before foul trouble, turnovers and a late Oregon surge did them in.
The return of forward Glen McGowan from a knee injury gave the Waves
a lift, but he played only 12 minutes before fouling out.
Pepperdine's poor post play has resulted in the team's being
outrebounded in five of six games. The Waves could have problems
matching up with Eric Zwayer, Richmond's 6-foot-9, 250-pound center.
Forward Mike Skrocki leads the balanced Spiders with a 14-point
average. Stanford plays Montana in the other first-round game.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola Marymount (5-3) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (1-5), 7,
KXLU-FM (88.9) -- Loyola remained unbeaten at home with a 76-68
victory over Long Beach State on Saturday, but the Lions are 1-3 on
the road. They should be able to improve that record against one of
the Big West Conference's weaker teams. Sophomore point guard Charles
Brown continued his strong play against Long Beach, getting career
bests of 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.</LD>

<LD>Sean Keeler of the Des Moines Register on Carson Palmer's beating out
Brad Banks for the Heisman Trophy:</LD>
<LD>   "Just when you thought there was no way Iowa would see payback
from Notre Dame for that bowl championship series snub, along comes
Carson Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   "Now Palmer had a stupendous season, throwing for 3,639 yards and
32 touchdowns. He is, hands down, the best senior drop-back passer at
the major college level. He's Drew Bledsoe II. The man could start
for the Chicago Bears right now. Not saying he'd want to. Just that
he could.</LD>
<TE>   "None of this was what put Palmer over the top when the Heisman
voting was revealed Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one game. One night. One opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It helped me, no question,' Palmer said. 'I think that if Brad
would have still been playing when I played against Notre Dame, I
think he might have won it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Dan Marino is the NFL's all-time leader in yards
passing (61,361) and touchdown passes (420). Who is the leader in
passing efficiency?</TE>
<TE>   Fashion critic: Former NFL receiver Michael Irvin, who once was a
Cowboy, usually dresses in something resembling pajamas. This was
particularly the case with a blue jump suit he wore on Fox Sports
Net's "Best Damn Sports Show Period" last week.</TE>
<TE>   Said ventriloquist Jeff Dunham's grumpy sidekick, Walter: "You
look like you're going to Michael Jackson's sleepover again."</TE>
<TE>   Hangers-on haven: "Instead of a ritzy hotel, the U.S. Olympic
basketball team of NBA players will stay in the Athletes Village for
the 2004 Olympic Games in Greece," wrote Steve Rosenbloom of the
Chicago Tribune. "Apparently Athens officials also agreed to build a
Posse Village."</TE>
<TE>   His scoop: The Miami Dolphins' Ricky Williams, on why he started
his Web site, www.run-ricky-run.com: "My fans didn't have a realistic
view of who I was as a person and an athlete. I thought that if I
didn't have to go through the media and they can get it straight from
me, they'd get a better picture of Ricky."</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side: "The mayor of New York City is telling New
Yorkers to prepare for the worst in anticipation of a transit
strike," comedian Jerry Perisho told the San Francisco Chronicle. "It
will really be a blessing in disguise. The strike will make it
virtually impossible to get to a Knick game."</TE>
<TE>   Tough task: An ESPN.com contest asks fans to pick the winners of
all the bowl games. Says Chronicle reader Janice Hough: "I think the
contest would be difficult enough just asking fans to name all the
bowl games."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Steve Young, with an efficiency rating of 96.8. Joe
Montana is second at 92.3 and Marino third at 86.4.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: When the Washington men's basketball program was
first accused of NCAA recruiting violations, Athletic Director
Barbara Hedges said opposing coaches should follow "protocol" and
call her first if they see Husky players breaking rules.</TE>
<TE>   Noted John Blanchette of the Spokane Spokesman-Review:
"Apparently, the next time we see a convenience store being jacked
up, we're supposed to call the robber's parents."</TE>

<HD>Worst Case Is Avoided</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>With the seconds ticking down and another opponent driving in a close
game, the Denver Broncos were expecting the worst.</LD>
<LD>   After three consecutive close losses -- two in overtime -- who
could blame them?</LD>
<LD>   But this time it had a different ending.</LD>
<TE>   Clinton Portis overcame two first-half fumbles and tied a team
record with four touchdowns and the Broncos held on to beat the
Kansas City Chiefs, 31-24, Sunday to keep their playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Denver (8-6) was the only AFC West team to win Sunday, moving into
second place with San Diego, one game behind division-leading
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos dominated the Chiefs (7-7) early, but allowed 17
points in the fourth quarter and avoided overtime when Trent Green's
pass into the end zone was incomplete as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "As the game was winding down, I was saying, 'Not another overtime
game. I can't take another overtime game,' " Bronco defensive tackle
Lional Dalton said.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos, one of the AFC's best teams after opening the season
7-3, had put their playoff hopes in jeopardy with four losses in five
games. The three losses in a row were by a combined 12 points and
Denver appeared headed toward another heartbreaker against Kansas
City.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs took over at their 39 with 1:50 left and drove to
Denver's 15 with 25 seconds left. But a leg-whip penalty on John Tait
moved the Chiefs back to the 25, then Green failed on a pass attempt
with five seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City had one final shot, but Tyrone Poole knocked down
Green's pass.</TE>
<TE>   The loss all but assured the Chiefs would miss the playoffs for
the fifth year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "This was big," said Green, who was 18 for 42 for 310 yards. "Once
they flashed it up on the scoreboard that the other teams had lost,
and knowing we play those two teams the next couple of weeks, it was
very costly."Kansas City's Priest Holmes had 161 yards in 18 carries
-- his fifth consecutive 100-yard game -- but limped off to the
locker room with a hip injury early in the fourth quarter. He also
remained four touchdowns behind Marshall Faulk's NFL record of 26.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers tied several franchise records for success
and maintained a share of the NFL's best record.</LD>
<LD>   Barely.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Gramatica's 38-yard field goal with 3:04 left was decisive
for the Buccaneers in a 23-20 victory over the Detroit Lions on
Sunday as an expected blowout turned into a close battle.</LD>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (11-3) clinched a playoff berth for the fourth
consecutive season and tied franchise records for wins and road
victories (five), but had to hold off numerous comeback attempts from
the Lions (3-11).</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers survived as Detroit's Jason Hanson was short on a
57-yard field goal with 1:51 left.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't our best game, but I'm not disappointed about being
11-3," Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay has won five of six, and Sunday's win, coupled with
losses by New Orleans and Atlanta, gave them a two-game lead in the
NFC South.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Brad Johnson said, however, that the Super Bowl is the
ultimate goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys who have won some special awards, and some that may
make the Hall of Fame," Johnson said. "But we do not have one player
on this team that has won a Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions have lost six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit was without rookie quarterback Joey Harrington after its
first drive. He was taken to a hospital for tests and observation
with an irregular heartbeat. He was kept overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Backup Mike McMahon created some excitement. McMahon, who lost his
starting job to Harrington after the second game of the season, was
10 for 21 for 158 yards, with one touchdown passing and one rushing,
plus an interception.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was 24 for 41 for 253 yards without a touchdown or an
interception. Mike Alstott and Michael Pittman combined for 93 yards
rushing and two touchdowns.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers got home early Sunday feeling pretty good about
themselves after completing a four-game trip to New Orleans, Dallas,
San Antonio and Houston with a break-even record. All things
considered, it could have been worse.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the Hornets have lost once at home -- to the Clippers
-- after winning 11 in a row in their new hometown. The Mavericks are
11-0 at home, having knocked off the Clippers to keep alive their
home winning streak. The Spurs are 8-3 in their new home, the SBC
Center, which includes a win over the Clippers. The Rockets are 8-2
on their home court, their seven-game winning streak ended by the
Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   "There aren't going to be many teams who play those four teams and
end up 2-2," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "When you look at the
home records of those four teams, to come away 2-2 has got to be a
real satisfying trip."</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers are one of only six teams this season to play Dallas,
San Antonio and Houston -- the Texas Triangle -- on the same trip.</TE>
<TE>   "A few years back, all three Texas teams were not playing well at
the same time," forward Elton Brand said. "The Texas Triangle is
tough. And they're three different teams: a post-up team [San
Antonio], a guard-oriented team [Houston] and a run-up-and-down team
[Dallas], so it's hard to get prepared for each team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150), KTNQ (1020, Spanish).</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 28, CLEVELAND 23</KH>
<HD>Harrison Is Check Mate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Peyton Manning called audibles on four plays that all turned into
Indianapolis touchdowns. Twice, the Colt quarterback checked off to
plays he knew would work.</LD>
<LD>   The ones to Marvin Harrison.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison broke an NFL record and probably Cleveland's playoff
hopes Sunday, with his two touchdown receptions in the second half
helping the Colts rally for a 28-23 victory over the Browns.</LD>
<TE>   "He is unbelievable," Colt Coach Tony Dungy said. "He was geared
up all week and ready to go. He is amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts (9-5) trailed, 16-0, at halftime before storming back
with a no-huddle offense and Harrison, who finished with nine catches
for 172 yards and set a league record for receptions in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's sixth catch -- on a fourth-down play in the third
quarter -- moved him past Herman Moore, who caught 123 passes for
Detroit in 1995. Harrison has 127 receptions for 1,566 yards this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I just catch them, I don't count them," said Harrison, who has
hooked up with Manning for 57 career touchdowns. "Peyton and I were
on the same page. I just keep catching them. We needed to win. We
don't win, records don't mean much."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's performance and a big stop by Indianapolis' defense in
the final seconds held off the Browns, whose latest comeback came up
five yards short.</TE>
<TE>   Out of timeouts, quarterback Tim Couch moved Cleveland (7-7) to
the Colt 10 with 1:23 left, but the Browns couldn't score the
go-ahead touchdown as Couch's fourth-down pass from the five-yard
line went off Andre' Davis' hands.</TE>
<TE>   James Mungro, filling in for Edgerrin James, had two touchdown
runs as the first-place Colts moved one-half game ahead of Tennessee
in the AFC South. The Titans play host to New England tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Couch, playing the biggest game of his four-year career, was 21
for 35 for 287 yards and two touchdowns. He was equal to Manning, his
close friend, but doesn't have a receiver in Harrison's class.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison felt he let the Colts down last week in a loss at
Tennessee when he dropped a pass in the end zone, but atoned with his
ninth 100-yard game this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was going to come up with a big day," Dungy said.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and

<LD>   What: "Sweet Redemption: How Gary Williams and Maryland Beat Death
and Despair to Win the NCAA Basketball Championship."</LD>
<LD>   Authors: Gary Williams and David A. Vise.</LD>
<TE>   Price: $24.95 (Sports Publishing)</TE>
<TE>   This quickie book on Williams covers his growing up to coaching
Maryland to last season's NCAA men's basketball title over Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of glossed-over read that appeals to young kids and
hard-core Terrapin fans but has trouble connecting beyond a regional
audience.</TE>
<TE>   The main problem is neither Williams nor Vise wants to delve past
the surface of the coach's trials and triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has a much richer story to reveal, but there are little
more than broad tidbits about growing up in Collingswood, N.J.,
suffering through his parents' divorce, and how basketball got him
through high school and college at the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   You also are pulled into other personal scenarios -- how coaching
came between Williams and his first wife, Diane; how their divorce
deeply affected his daughter, Kristin, to the point of estrangement.
How torn Williams was about leaving Ohio State to coach at his alma
mater and how he fought to get the Terrapin basketball program
respectability after the 1986 death of Len Bias and the forced
departure of coach Bob Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the book is one-sided on Williams' achievements as
a coach instead of balancing its story with the events that shaped
him as a person.</TE>
<TE>   After sifting through 250 pages, you'll finish the book feeling
you know as little about Gary Williams the man as when you started.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Caught in Miami Vise</HD>
<DH>Dolphin defense contains NFL's No. 1 offense and harasses
Gannon to distraction in 23-17 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>It could have been uglier. Miami Dolphin defensive end Jason Taylor
came within a wisp of sacking Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon three
times in the first three plays.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Taylor got him twice -- and pried the ball loose both
times.</LD>
<LD>   "I had him on the first play and I just missed him," Taylor said.
"I went for the ball instead of grabbing him."</LD>
<TE>   Well, nobody's perfect. But the Dolphin defense looked awfully
good Sunday, limiting Oakland's No. 1-ranked offense to one first
down in the first 26 minutes, then safeguarding a six-point lead down
the stretch for a 23-17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was the home finale for the Dolphins (9-5), who remain in first
place in the AFC East but have yet to secure a playoff berth. Then
again, no AFC team has clinched. The Raiders (9-5) are still alone
atop the AFC West, thanks to San Diego's loss at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   That was of little consolation to the Raiders, who were riding a
five-game winning streak, and whose quarterback had thrown for at
least 300 yards 10 times this season, an NFL record.</TE>
<TE>   Hurried and harassed all day, Gannon never got into a groove
against the Dolphins. He shortened his drops, put too much heat on
his close-range passes and underthrew Jerry Rice on Oakland's last
offensive play -- resulting in a one-handed interception by Patrick
Surtain with 1 minute 43 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how I caught it, it was time to make a play," Surtain
said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was making them all day. He had three of Miami's five
sacks, increasing his total to a league-leading 17. He made Barry
Sims, normally a very capable left tackle, look as agile as a potted
palm.</TE>
<TE>   "He's elusive and he's a slippery guy," Sims said. "He's got a lot
of good moves, so if you try to shut down one move, he'll turn to
another one. He's a hard guy to defend. He was up on his game today,
and apparently I wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, Gannon's in-helmet headset went on the
fritz. So he not only had to worry about executing the plays, but
hearing them.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to run over a lot of times and read Marc's lips," he said,
referring to offensive coordinator Marc Trestman. "We called a couple
of plays on our own. It was definitely a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Miami quarterback Jay Fiedler, facing a Raider defense that was
without injured starting cornerbacks Charles Woodson and Tory James,
completed 21 of 32 passes for 237 yards and a touchdown. Ricky
Williams rushed for 101 yards in 27 carries, recording his fifth
consecutive 100-yard game and ninth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But the day belonged to Miami's defense, which limited the Raiders
to one touchdown and Gannon to 204 yards passing, 119 fewer than his
average.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a guy who is probably going to break the
single-season passing record and two guys [Rice and Tim Brown] with
1,000 career catches on your team, to hold those guys to one
touchdown is a phenomenal feeling," Surtain said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders were never too far behind. Miami led by two touchdowns
in the first half, but Oakland chipped away with three field goals by
Sebastian Janikowski.</TE>
<TE>   And the tide looked to be turning when Gannon hit Jerry Porter for
a 20-yard touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, then
found Porter again for a two-point conversion that trimmed the
deficit to 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins answered with a drive to the Oakland 22, but Olindo
Mare was wide right on a 40-yard field goal attempt with 8:53
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland couldn't move the ball on its next possession, but neither
could Miami, and the Dolphins were forced to punt with 4:59
remaining. Back to return was Brown, who took over special-teams
duties normally handled by Woodson.</TE>
<TE>   Brown fielded the punt, started his return by cutting across the
field, and was nailed by Trent Gamble. The ball popped free and was
recovered at the Oakland 39 by Miami's Ed Perry.</TE>
<TE>   A disheartened Brown lay face-down on the turf for a few moments,
his pride hurting worse than anything. He's the leading punt returner
in Raider history, and losing his grip has never been a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to protect the ball," he said. "The return was set, then I
saw the white helmet."</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins burned another two minutes off the clock, moving into
position for a 41-yard field goal and setting the stage for Oakland's
last-gasp drive.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays into that final possession, Gannon heaved the long
pass for Rice that was snared by Surtain. The interception wasn't the
best one-handed catch of the day, however. That was made by receiver
Cris Carter -- the only other member of the 1,000-reception club --
who split a pair of Raider defenders and used his right hand to reel
in a five-yard touchdown pass from Fiedler in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got some of the best hands in football," Fiedler said of
Carter, who gave up his TV gig in October to sign with the Dolphins.
"As they say, he just catches touchdowns."</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, Fiedler tested Oakland's secondary with deep passes,
throwing a 40-yard pass to Chris Chambers on Miami's opening play.
That's not necessarily the style of the Dolphins, whose "Miami Pound
Machine" offense tends to rely more on short passes and the steady
running of Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was surprised by the air-it-out approach, Raider
defensive tackle Sam Adams didn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah," he said. "With our two starting cornerbacks out, what would
you do?"</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere was flashing a picture of
himself as a wide-eyed 7-year boy, sitting on a net next to a
yet-to-be-famous Mario Lemieux, after Sunday's game.</LD>
<LD>   On it, Lemieux had written in French, "Good luck."</LD>
<LD>   Luck had little to do with the Ducks' 5-0 victory over the

<TE>   His third consecutive shutout pushed him to 200 minutes 15 seconds
since giving up a fluke goal to Chicago's Alexei Zhamnov on Dec. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been big shutout goalie," Giguere said. "It's
flattering to set the record. On the other hand, I think you should
put whole team in there. They have made it much easier on me. I made
the first save and they took away the rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, tied for second in the NHL with four shutouts, saw only
19 shots on goal Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere is 5-1-1 with a 1.48 goals-against average in his last
seven games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Cullen and Mike Leclerc both set career highs with four
points. Cullen had four assists. Leclerc had a goal and three
assists.... Mighty Duck officials have decided not to recall rookie
forward Alexei Smirnov. Smirnov will remain at minor league
Cincinnati through this week.</TE>

<DH>Giguere posts his third consecutive shutout in 5-0 win.
Penguins' power play is smothered and the bounces go Anaheim's way.</DH>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Things are going so well for the Mighty Ducks these days, goals are
falling from the sky.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Leclerc's innocent flick of the puck in the second period
ricocheted off the glass behind the net, rolled off the top of the
net, then glanced off Pittsburgh goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin's glove
and plopped into the net.</LD>
<LD>   If there was a Kodak moment that showed the different directions
these two teams had, that was it.</LD>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Penguins had enough issues to deal with after the
Ducks' 5-0 victory at the Arrowhead Pond on Sunday. They didn't need
blind puck luck adding to their woes.</TE>
<TE>   Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere set two franchise records:
three consecutive shutouts and consecutive minutes without allowing a
goal.</TE>
<TE>   The line of Andy McDonald (two goals), Matt Cullen (four assists)
and Leclerc (one goal, three assists) put on an offensive exhibition,
each with numbers very much like the guy many of the announced 16,542
paid to see: Mario Lemieux.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember us playing this well when it really meant
something, as far as fighting for the playoffs," Cullen said. "We
really believe in what we're doing right now; that drives us, gives
us a lot confidence. That's something we haven't had in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' fourth consecutive victory certainly gave them the look
of a legitimate playoff contender. They're four games over .500 for
the first time since December 1999. They reached the first 20 games
in the race, raced past Thanksgiving still in contention and are now
approaching Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are all milestones, landmarks, as you go along through the
year," Cullen said. "These are big games for our playoff hopes."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lemieux was smothered, which ended his 13-game point
streak. The vaunted Penguin power play, which was tops in the NHL,
was scoreless in three opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out pretty hard, trying to get themselves some
momentum," Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first 10 minutes, there was no doubt who was the better
team."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere wasn't overworked, but he did stop early chances. The
Penguins had two power play chances in the first 12 minutes. They got
only one shot out of it. That set the tone.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere's goal-less streak stands at 200 minutes 15 seconds. The
Ducks made things easy on him, with a 47-19 shot advantage. The
Penguins had only three during a 25-minute stretch in the first and
second periods.</TE>
<TE>   "There were 10 minutes left in the game and they had 12 shots,"
Leclerc said. "We were playing a team with a power play over 30%,
with Mario Lemieux, Alexei Kovalev. You had to figure you're playing
a pretty solid game."</TE>
<TE>   The defense was sharp, yet the offense was hardly lacking.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Carney gave the Ducks the lead, when he charged the net and
chipped in a pass from Paul Kariya 10:17 into the game. Then Cullen
and Leclerc heated up.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora was there to backhand in a rebound off a Cullen shot
for a 2-0 lead with 53 seconds left in the first period. McDonald
buried a pass from Cullen on a two-on-one two minutes into the second
period and the rout was on. Leclerc, who was playing his second game
since returning from a knee injury, then dropped in his impossible
shot for a 4-0 lead at 13:34 of the period.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty good at pool," Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cullen: "Does he even get a shot for that?"</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc, Cullen and McDonald made a nice tic-tac-toe connection,
with McDonald redirecting the puck past Aubin for a 5-0 lead 8:14
into the third period.</TE>

<LD>It's the most wonderful time of the year, unless your bowl-bound
school is reeling after four consecutive defeats (Minnesota), binding
up emotional wounds with an interim coach (UCLA) or just cut a
severance check to its chased-out-of-town defensive coordinator
(Nebraska).</LD>
<LD>   This week marks the start of a 28 bowl-game glut that spans from
Tuesday's New Orleans Bowl to the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl, so gather
around the midfield corporate logo and celebrate a joyous time when
coaches and players are rewarded for fantastic seasons.</LD>
<LD>   For example, the Independence Bowl this year features two schools
that are a combined one game over .500.</LD>
<TE>   And one would be hard-pressed to find a more uplifting story than
Las Vegas Bowl participant UCLA, which ended up fourth in the Pac-10
after being picked to finish sixth. Unfortunately, the coach who
exceeded expectations could not attend the arrival news conference
because he was fired last week.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe bowls are really about making money, big green gobs
of it, and if you happen to pair two schools with winning records,
that's fine too.</TE>
<TE>   With 56 of 117 Division I-A schools qualifying this year, bowl
season has become the most open invitational since Woodstock. Over
the next two weeks, 28 champions will be crowned, meaning 28 trophies
next year will appear on 28 media guide covers.</TE>
<TE>   So strap it up, boys, and have a ball -- no, have a bowl. For the
record, 36 of the 56 bowl teams have four or more losses. If you put
a three-defeat maximum cap on participants, 13 bowl games would be
wiped out. As always, viewer discretion is advised, so we've whittled
the must-see list to a precious few:</TE>
<TE>   GMAC (Wednesday): Louisville (7-5) vs. Marshall (10-2). Story
line: Two preseason Heisman Trophy candidates, quarterbacks Dave
Ragone and Byron Leftwich, get knocked to Mobile, Ala., in what could
be a shootout that tops triple-digit points.</TE>
<TE>   * Las Vegas (Dec. 25): UCLA (7-5) vs. New Mexico (7-6). Story
line: NCAA panel convenes at Caesars Palace to discuss how the
organization can combat the evils of gambling. Featured speaker: Bob
Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   * Motor City (Dec. 26): Toledo (9-4) vs. Boston College (8-4).
Story line: Thanks to UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, it's now
the only bowl game involving a Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   * Independence (Dec. 27): Nebraska (7-6) vs. Mississippi (6-6).
Story line: Nebraskans would rather vote solely Democratic than
witness, perhaps, the last pillar fall in a dynasty. At stake is the
Cornhuskers' major college record of 40 consecutive winning seasons.
Don't look for a staff shakeup after the game -- the staff shakeup
came before the game.</TE>
<TE>   * Seattle (Dec. 30): Wake Forest (6-6) vs. Oregon (7-5). Story
line: Oregon arranges bowl swap with Silicon Valley so its fans can
infiltrate the homeland of bitter rival Washington. Bowl package
includes a sunset "Taunt and Toast" boat cruise past Rick Neuheisel's
house on Lake Washington.</TE>
<TE>   * Cotton (Jan. 1): Texas (10-2) vs. Louisiana State (8-4). Story
line: Otherwise known as the Lee Corso Bowl. Before the season, the
ESPN football analyst and Carmen Miranda impersonator predicted these
teams would meet in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship.
Corso missed by only six losses, four for LSU and two for Texas, but
that's why he gets the big bucks.</TE>
<TE>   * Rose Bowl presented by PlayStation2 (Jan. 1): Washington State
(10-2) vs. Oklahoma (11-2). Story line: Kids make believe and play an
Iowa vs. USC Rose Bowl on their game pads.</TE>
<TE>   * Rose Bowl presented by the Orange Bowl (Jan. 2): Iowa (11-1) vs.
USC (10-2). The best Granddaddy game in years is shipped 3,000 miles
east and now officially features Heisman finalists No. 1 and No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   * Fiesta Bowl (Jan. 3): Miami (12-0) vs. Ohio State (13-0). Story
line: Bad news for the Buckeyes. Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee, the
top two players on the nation's best team, got snubbed in balloting
for every postseason award and couldn't even muster, combined, more
Heisman Trophy votes than Carson Palmer received. There is nothing
more frightening than a team on a 34-game winning streak with
something to prove.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Touch That Dial</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's next football movie, "The Dysfunction Boys," is targeted
for a fall 2003 release. The project will chronicle the Crimson
Tide's exasperating search for a football coach after Dennis
Franchione's unpardonable departure to Texas A&amp;M, concluding with the
out-of-left-field hiring of actor Tom Berenger, "the closest thing
we'll get to Coach Bryant since Gary Busey," one former player says.</TE>
<TE>   We learn in the film Alabama was floored by Franchione's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches don't leave Alabama for Texas A&amp;M," one Alabama booster
huffs. "Coaches leave Texas A&amp;M for Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   This was a reference, of course, to the legendary Paul "Bear"
Bryant, who left Texas A&amp;M for Alabama after the 1957 season and
coached the Crimson Tide to six national titles in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he could leave Texas A&amp;M with seven years left on his
contract, Bryant said at the time, "Mama called."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he could leave Alabama with seven years left on his
contract, Franchione responds in the film, "Money called."</TE>
<TE>   Among the inside moments revealed is an Alabama athletic
department member's response when Mike Riley asks how long he has to
consider the school's generous $1.3-million-per-season offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Ya'll got five minutes," the official says.</TE>
<TE>   Another Alabama fan says he can't believe Riley would turn down an
Alabama offer to consider a job at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA?" the guys says. "Red Sanders hasn't put out a decent squad
in years."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the ESPN project, an Alabama trustee faints when
told the school might hire a 56-year-old coach from Pullman, Wash.
Alabama settles on Berenger after he survives a brutal West Texas
training camp in which 10 prospective coaching candidates are
interrogated about Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Sample question: What was name of Coach Bryant's wife?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Mary Harmon.</TE>

<HD>Eagles Protecting Their Home Turf</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Philadelphia Eagles are two victories away from having home-field
advantage at Veterans Stadium -- something that teams such as Green
Bay and Tampa Bay don't want to see.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles clinched the NFC East by beating Washington, 34-21,
Sunday. With victories in road games against the Dallas Cowboys and
the New York Giants, they will be home for every playoff game they
play.</LD>
<LD>   "If you go around the league and ask people where they don't want
to play, this is at the top of the list," Coach Andy Reid said.</LD>
<TE>   A.J. Feeley, who began the season as the third-string quarterback,
threw two touchdown passes as Philadelphia (11-3) won its fourth in a
row without quarterback Donovan McNabb, who broke his right ankle
Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   This one was played in swirling winds. Along with the reputation
for bad turf and noisy crowds, the crumbling Vet is a nightmare for
visiting teams.</TE>
<TE>   But the ultimate goal -- getting to the Super Bowl for the first
time since the 1980 season -- may not be so easy. They likely will
need McNabb to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way this team plays," Washington Coach Steve Spurrier
said of Philadelphia. "They don't play giveaway. They get a lot of
loose balls. We're not as alert as the Eagle team."</TE>
<TE>   That was obvious from the start for the Redskins (5-9).</TE>
<TE>   On the second play from scrimmage, Stephen Davis broke loose
toward midfield but had the ball knocked away by Brian Dawkins, and
Michael Lewis recovered for Philadelphia. Davis separated his right
shoulder on the play and is likely out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   That turnover didn't lead to a score but two other Washington
fumbles did.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The New York Giants are right back in the wild-card playoff race.</LD>
<LD>   Tiki Barber scored on a one-yard run and set up another touchdown
with a 60-yard run in a season-best 21-point first quarter for the
Giants in their 37-7 victory over the Cowboys on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants (8-6) picked up a game on New Orleans (9-5) and Atlanta
(8-5-1) in the wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   "This game was huge," Barber said. "Our playoff hopes are still
alive. We have to win out, otherwise all the talk about sneaking into
the playoffs is null and void."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants got plenty of help just minutes before the opening
kickoff against Dallas (5-9).</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota defeated New Orleans, 32-31, on a two-point conversion
in the closing seconds of regulation. Seattle then beat Atlanta,
30-27, in overtime after the Falcons missed a potential game-winning
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Coach Jim Fassel told his team immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in time when you set your goals, you better be able
to grab the carrot when it's sitting right there," Fassel said.</TE>
<TE>   New York has the toughest schedule remaining, playing at
Indianapolis (9-5) and at home against Philadelphia (11-3). The
Eagles won the NFC East on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta will play Detroit (3-11) at home and at Cleveland (7-7).
New Orleans will play at Cincinnati (1-13) and at home against
Carolina (5-9).</TE>
<TE>   Mike Barrow led a Giant defense that limited Dallas to 241 total
yards, forced three turnovers and held Chad Hutchinson to 16 for 40
passing for 161 yards.</TE>

<HD>Bayakoa Is Won by Starrer Again</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood Park can't run the Bayakoa Stakes too often for Starrer, a
4-year-old filly who won the race for the second time Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In between, Starrer was blanked in five starts, three of them won
by Azeri, the Breeders' Cup Distaff winner and horse-of-the-year
favorite.</LD>
<LD>   "I've seen enough of Azeri," said John Shirreffs, who began
training Starrer this year after David Hofmans had saddled her for
the Bayakoa win last year. Shirreffs' Manistique is the only other
horse to win the Bayakoa in consecutive years.</LD>
<TE>   In an 18-race career, Starrer has won only twice besides her
double in the Bayakoa. The other wins came last year, in the Santa
Paula at Santa Anita and the Princess at Hollywood. Jockey Jerry
Bailey won with Starrer in last year's Bayakoa; Pat Valenzuela, who
has ridden owner George Krikorian's filly the last three races, was
aboard Sunday, and needed a hole to open up on the turn for home in
order to move up from fifth place in a field of six.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just picking my spots," Valenzuela said. "When I asked her
at the head of the lane, she accelerated. If I had to come around, I
could have done that. But I waited for the hole and took the shortcut
home."</TE>
<TE>   Running 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 3/5 -- compared to 1:42 2/5 a year
ago, and the fastest Bayakoa since Golden Klair set the stakes record
with 1:41 3/5 in 1993 --Starrer paid $4 as the favorite. She carried
high weight of 118 pounds and earned $90,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cee's Elegance finished second, a length in front of Angel Gift.</TE>

<TE>   The 8-year-old California-bred, arguably the greatest runner at
870 yards in quarter-horse history, was ridden by Alex Bautista and
the win in the Grade I -- which had its purse increased to $200,000
this year, making it the richest race run at the distance -- pushed
his career earnings to over $500,000. Sign Of Lanty has won 28 of 65
races.</TE>

<HD>Hart's Winning Streak Comes to Devilish End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The third-longest unbeaten streak in California high school football,
which wowed Newhall Hart High fans and countless others throughout
the Southland for more than two years, has perished after a bout with
the Mission Viejo Diablos' defense. It was 35 games long.</LD>
<LD>   The streak included two Southern Section Division III titles and
three Foothill League championships. The Indians' streak included a
tie with Division I champion Los Alamitos to open the season and
victories over City Section champion Lake Balboa Birmingham and
Division IV champion Ventura St. Bonaventure.</LD>
<LD>   Only Concord De La Salle, owner of a national-record 138-game
winning streak, and Los Gatos, 38-0-1 in the last three seasons, had
longer unbeaten streaks before Hart's run ended Saturday at Edison
Field during a 10-6 loss to Mission Viejo in the Division II
championship.</LD>
<TE>   Hart's streak is survived by Coach Mike Herrington and 22
underclassmen, including quarterback Sean Norton and receivers Ryan
Wolfe and Kevin Ciccone.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo, winner of 28 consecutive games, has assumed Hart's
spot in third place. And Diablo Coach Bob Johnson won't settle for
less than first.</TE>
<TE>   "We want De La Salle next year!" Johnson exclaimed Saturday as he
walked off Edison Field after his team's second consecutive section
title.</TE>
<TE>   Only one problem, coach.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle would be booked through 2004 if Spartan Athletic
Director Terry Eidson can solidify one game against a team from Ohio
during the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   "The good teams coming up always want to play you," Eidson said by
phone Sunday. "Usually, it's too late. I set my schedule at least two
years in advance."</TE>
<TE>   Eidson is certainly familiar with Mission Viejo. His niece, Ericka
Gil, is a Diablo cheerleader who last year dated a lineman from the
team. Eidson, De La Salle's defensive coordinator, watched film of
Mission Viejo last season while preparing for a game against Santa
Ana Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   There's little doubt De La Salle-Mission Viejo would be a hot
ticket -- in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With its 41-14 dismantling of Mater Dei in the Division I title
game, Los Alamitos could also lay claim to the Serra League title.</TE>
<TE>   The Griffins finished 4-0 against teams from the Serra League,
with victories over Bellflower St. John Bosco, La Puente Bishop Amat,
Los Angeles Loyola and the Monarchs.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco, the official Serra League champion, finished 5-1
against league teams after suffering a 38-8 loss to Loyola during a
rematch in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos pulled off a similar feat in 1993 when it won the
Division II title, completing a 4-0 run against Sunset League teams
as a member of the Empire League. The Griffins joined the Sunset
League the following fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly may not have reached the championship game, but a
couple of its former players did -- and made considerable impact.</TE>
<TE>   DeAnthony Hicks, a backup junior quarterback for last year's
Division I champions, scored the winning two-point conversion for
Corona Centennial during its 57-55, triple-overtime victory over
Riverside North in the Division V championship.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial went for two points because its kicker, Adam Alvarez,
was injured on the successful point-after attempt during the second
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Junior defensive back Randy Estes, who spent last year at Poly,
registered a game-high 13 tackles and returned an interception 26
yards for Los Alamitos during its defeat of Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His school had just beaten back an emotional rally by Manhattan
Beach Mira Costa in the Division III championship game, but Sherman
Oaks Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney answered questions as calmly as
ever, as a celebration erupted around him.</TE>
<TE>   After fielding a couple of questions, Rooney had one of his own.
"How many yards did Mira Costa running back Michael Okwo get?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer brought a brief smile to the face of the conservative
coach. Okwo had rushed for 139 yards without a touchdown during Notre
Dame's 20-17 victory at El Camino College.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed a little silly to consider it a victory to "hold" an
opponent to 139 yards rushing, but it was a statistical strength for
Notre Dame (14-0), which won the battle of unbeatens to snare its
first title since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Okwo, considering USC and Stanford, among other schools, had been
crushing opponents all season, coming into the game with 2,342 yards
rushing and 30 touchdowns in 235 carries.</TE>
<TE>   But against Notre Dame, Okwo had six yards rushing in the second
quarter and fumbled at the Notre Dame 16 midway through the third
quarter as the Mustangs tried to cut into a 20-3 deficit. Okwo had
only two carries in the fourth quarter as Mira Costa, still trailing
by 17, had to go to the air for its two late touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Harwell, a junior defensive end for Hacienda Heights Los
Altos, went into his team's 27-10 Division VI victory over Santa Ana
Foothill with an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was to shut them out," Harwell said, "but we came up
short."</TE>
<TE>   It was Los Altos' only shortcoming. That, and maybe failing to
make a dent in the ego of at least one particular opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill quarterback Don Poole, who was sacked four times while he
wasn't on the sidelines nursing a hip pointer, somehow wasn't as
impressed as everyone else with the Los Altos defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just like any other team, no better than we were," said
Poole, who passed for 2,792 yards and 20 touchdowns this season,
including the 36 yards during his five-for-14 performance Friday.
"Every loss, it's us beating ourselves. We have more weapons, they
just got the job done, we didn't. They're better competition than
most, but they're not overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Said Los Altos Coach Greg Gano: "Our defense has been super all
year, but I didn't expect to hold Foothill to 10 points."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   West Covina South Hills Coach Steve Bogan had high praise for
Walnut quarterback Daniel Al-Gattas after the Huskies' 36-8 victory
in the Division VII final. And Al-Gattas' talent made South Hills'
defensive performance all the more impressive.</TE>
<TE>   "It may well be the best defensive performance of the season,
because Al-Gattas is the player of the year in this division in my
book," Bogan said. "He's a heck of an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Gattas was sacked nine times by eight players, but only his
remarkable athleticism prevented the number from being even higher.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed or scrambled 20 times for 29 yards -- after having
rushed for 628 yards and nine touchdowns this season.</TE>
<TE>   South Hills (11-3) closed the season with a seven-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The kicking game -- or lack thereof -- played a pivotal role in La
Habra's 27-21 victory over Garden Grove Pacifica in the Division IX
title game.</TE>
<TE>   When La Habra's first drive of the game stalled on fourth down
just outside the Pacifica one-yard line, Highlander assistant coaches
implored Coach Frank Mazzotta to send in the field-goal unit. But
Mazzotta opted to go for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   When running back Sean Findling bowled into the end zone for the
first of his three touchdowns, the decision turned out to be a good
one. Kicker Trent Sakioka, who converted 43 point-after kicks on the
year, missed the extra point.</TE>
<TE>   And when La Habra scored its second touchdown, only a few minutes
later, Sakioka missed that point-after try too.</TE>
<TE>   Later, with five seconds left in the first half, Pacifica faced a
fourth down at the La Habra 26-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Gladden, who finished the season with 10 field goals, sent
his 43-yard attempt into the right upright.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondent Eric Maddy and Times staff writers Mike Bresnahan,
Martin Henderson and Paul McLeod contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Bengals Go Down for Count</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>So, how would the NFL's worst team blow this one? More goal-line
follies? A left-handed pass, perhaps? Maybe a fumble or interception?</LD>
<LD>   Nope. This time, the Cincinnati Bengals flunked math.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Bengals couldn't get the right number of players on
the field for a punt return, the Jacksonville Jaguars got the second
chance they needed for a 29-15 victory Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   A crowd of about 30,000, the smallest at Paul Brown Stadium,
watched Mark Brunell throw a season-high three touchdown passes, the
last one set up by Cincinnati's inability to count.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a major error," Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau said. "We've
got coaches counting, we've got players counting, and we still can't
count to 11."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to hold a third-quarter lead, the Bengals (1-13) left 12
men on the field when Jacksonville (6-8) punted into the end zone.
The Jaguars accepted the penalty, which set up fourth and one, and
sent the offense back onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Mack ran eight yards for the first down, and the Jaguars
faced a fourth-and-six situation four plays later. They went for it
again, and Jimmy Smith ran past Jeff Burris and hauled in Brunell's
pass for a 26-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It put the Jaguars ahead to stay and set the Bengals on their way
to tying a franchise record for losses in a season.</TE>
<TE>   "It always comes down to: We shoot ourselves in the foot," safety
Cory Hall said. ''You put 12 men on the field -- that's high school,
that's college, that's peewee. Every team does it, but when we do it,
it's usually at a critical part of the game. It's mind-boggling. It
seems like it only happens to us."</TE>

<KH>CHICAGO 20, NEW YORK JETS 13</KH>
<HD>Bears Trip Up Chrebet's Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Wayne Chrebet and the New York Jets couldn't hurdle the banged-up
Chicago Bears.</LD>
<LD>   Stumbling when they needed a victory to enhance their playoff
chances, the Jets didn't look like the feisty team that had players
fighting each other in practice three days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran Chris Chandler gave Chicago's erratic offense some
stability and the Bears gave up only one touchdown to beat the Jets,
20-13.</LD>
<TE>   "It just stinks all around. I feel horrible," said Chrebet, who
caught a pass as the game approached its final minute, only to fumble
as he hurdled Chicago's Larry Whigham and Mike Green.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Roosevelt Williams recovered at the Bear 14 with 1:10
left and the Jets didn't get the ball back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something I sit around and think about doing. That was
my natural reaction. It's not the smartest thing to do. But if it
works, we tie it up," Chrebet said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good head of steam going. I thought, 'If I could slice
and get through there.... ' Next thing I know, I'm higher in the air,
I'm face-first on the ground and I didn't know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago (4-10) got touchdown runs from rookie Adrian Peterson and
ex-Jet Leon Johnson. Paul Edinger kicked two field goals, a 53-yarder
and then a 48-yarder into the wind with 2:38 left.</TE>
<TE>   And Chandler, making his sixth start with Jim Miller sidelined for
the season because of a knee injury, completed 22 of 27 passes for
177 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Morton returned the second-half kickoff 97 yards for an
apparent New York touchdown, but it was called back for holding.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets (7-7) then moved in for their only touchdown as Chad
Pennington passed to Laveranues Coles for a 13-yard gain and Curtis
Martin broke off a 35-yard run, setting up Pennington's five-yard
touchdown toss to Chrebet.</TE>
<TE>   Pennington insisted that Thursday's combative practice session
that featured three fights had little, if any, bearing on Sunday's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team, the players didn't put too much into that. It didn't
have anything to do with us losing this game," Pennington said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us are disappointed. No excuses, no explanations. Chicago
just beat us and that's very frustrating for us."</TE>
<TE>   Martin gained 127 yards in 21 carries, leaving him 95 yards short
of 1,000 this season.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Kings won four of five games against San Jose last season, yet
finished four points behind the champion Sharks in the Pacific
Division. This season, they have dominated the Dallas Stars in two
shutout victories, yet started Sunday trailing the division-leading
Stars by 10 points.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a matter of consistency," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said
of the Kings' pursuit of their first division title since 1991. "We
have to play the same way every night. That's what those teams do,
but we haven't learned to do that, for whatever reason, over the past
couple years. When we come up against weaker teams, we seem to
struggle, whether it's a mental thing, not being prepared, feeling
too good about ourselves....</LD>
<LD>   "We've risen to the occasion when we've needed to, but milking the
cow and kicking over the bucket, we seem to do that pretty
regularly."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze was put on injured reserve after suffering a
concussion late in the third period of Saturday night's 3-2 overtime
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Rookie Jared Aulin, acquired in
the February 2001 trade that sent Rob Blake to the Colorado
Avalanche, was recalled from the Kings' American Hockey League team
at Manchester, N.H., arrived about three hours before the game,
skated in the warmups and then was scratched.... Eric Rasmussen was
sidelined because of back spasms and Brad Chartrand returned to the
lineup after sitting out four games.... With their 3-0 victories last
week at Nashville and Dallas, the Kings posted consecutive road
shutouts for the first time in club history.</TE>

<HD>Referees Rule Over Kings</HD>
<DH>Questionable goal is allowed to stand and is the difference
in game as L.A.'s three-game winning streak comes to an end with 2-1
loss to Phoenix.</DH>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Long after Sunday's game had ended and the bitter taste in their
mouths had turned sour, the Kings gathered in front of a television
to watch replays of the Phoenix Coyotes' winning goal.</LD>
<LD>   Said Coach Andy Murray of the goal credited to Branko Radivojevic
with 7:03 to play: "We still have not seen where the puck went into
the net."</LD>
<LD>   They probably never will.</LD>
<TE>   Though replays from all angles were inconclusive, the disputed
goal stood, giving the Coyotes a 2-1 victory and ending the Kings'
three-game winning streak in front of an announced 11,819 at America
West Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, after trailing from the game's sixth minute into the
third period, had tied the score on a goal by Adam Deadmarsh with
14:55 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their second game in two nights after a 3-2 overtime
victory Saturday over the Pittsburgh Penguins, they were positioned
to leave with at least a tie.</TE>
<TE>   But Radivojevic, camped in front of the net, took a pass from
behind the net by Daniel Briere and jammed the puck toward the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "After that," King defenseman Mattias Norstrom said, "it's
anybody's guess."</TE>
<TE>   The puck wound up pinned between the ice and goaltender Jamie
Storr, who sat on top of it and, in the scrum that followed, was
pushed deeper into the goal mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Briere, Radivojevic and the late-arriving Claude Lemieux, who
continued to swipe at the puck, raised their arms in celebration.</TE>
<TE>   While one referee ruled it a goal, the other waved it off.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Warren Zevon's celebratory "Werewolves of London" blared
over the loudspeakers and -- belatedly, it seemed -- the goal lamp
shined red.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the final ruling, after a quick review of the same
inconclusive replays the Kings would later analyze to their great
frustration: Goal, Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Cue the music again.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just one of those calls," said Storr, who faced 24 shots,
also giving up a first-period goal by Mike Johnson. "I mean, everyone
makes mistakes. We make a lot of mistakes as players, and the
officials are bound to make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, however, Storr said, "Whether it was a goal or
not, I have no idea. If it went in, [that's] great. If it didn't,
someone made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   While he extricated himself from the net, Storr said the puck was
pinned under his left thigh. After he scooted forward, he looked down
and saw it between his legs, about a foot in front of the goal line.
Of course, he had moved it there.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it had ever crossed the goal line, nobody could say for
sure, but after having six goals disallowed in their last three
games, maybe the Coyotes deserved a break. They're last in the
Pacific Division, their No. 1 goaltender, Sean Burke, has been
sidelined for two months because of a high ankle sprain and they had
won only two of their last 13 games before Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   They held the Kings scoreless into the third period, goaltender
Brian Boucher stopping 22 shots in one of his best efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh was in the right place at the right time to score his
13th goal and fourth in five games, a wild shot by Norstrom bouncing
perfectly off the end boards and right onto Deadmarsh's stick in
front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we've been playing defensively, one goal at times can
give us a point," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "But to win you've got to get more than one and we lost tonight
because we didn't get more than one."</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes did, or so it was ruled, anyway.</TE>

<LD>Phil Jackson fears the Lakers' recent poor play is connected to their
interpersonal relationships, the byplay of which has found itself
more often than not in the morning newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   While one would believe they'd overcome such issues in seasons
past, when snits became championships, perhaps the division of high-
and low-profile players is too great a weight.</LD>
<LD>   "I think they're a little mentally fatigued, from their
extracurricular work last week," he said. "I think it carried some
concern and I think they are looking over their shoulders right now.
So, we're talking about relaxing and playing basketball.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not about people getting along with each other. This is
about performance on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   So far, little has worked. Not Kobe Bryant carrying the load. Not
Shaquille O'Neal returning to do some, or most, of the lifting
himself. They are 10-15, even with Sunday night's win over the
Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   They lost when they all got along, and lost again when they
didn't, and Tuesday night in Minneapolis they'll play the first of
six games in six different cities, as grim a stretch as they'll have
all season.</TE>
<TE>   There is a weight to bear. The Lakers live with their own
aspirations, and their public's, what Jackson called a sense of
entitlement that asserts the Lakers win every game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just having a hard time," he said. "We have to make it OK
before it'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, laughing, on any regrets so far: "Just signing a
three-year contract, as opposed to a five-year contract."</TE>
<TE>   It was a joke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will be married in late December.... After practice, the
Lakers leave today on a four-game, six-day trip through Minnesota,
New Jersey, Philadelphia and Toronto.... Derek Fisher's six rebounds
were a season high.</TE>

<HD>Is Latest Start Fresh, or False?</HD>
<DH>Lakers' effort is marginally better in 107-84 win over
Magic, but McGrady's second-half absence and L.A.'s track record
leave ample room for doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Then, they all breathed a little.</LD>
<LD>   The Laker season got this much better -- a 107-84 win against the
Orlando Magic -- on Sunday night at Staples Center, before it got any
worse.</LD>
<LD>   They are 10-15, a record they're learning to live with in a season
where every previous reason for optimism has been nothing more than a
false alarm.</LD>
<TE>   They'll go out this afternoon on a four-game trip through crunchy
walks from the bus to the gym, through four chilled cities, knowing
little more about their game than that it must improve, very soon.</TE>
<TE>   If their determination and shooting percentage and defensive
attitude progressed only an inch against the mercurial Magic, their
luck leaped by a foot.</TE>
<TE>   Because, while Shaquille O'Neal had 30 points and 14 rebounds and
Derek Fisher had 19 points, Magic swingman Tracy McGrady scored 21
points in the first half and none in the second, thanks to a bruised
back that had him limping through the corridors afterward. And, guard
Mike Miller had the flu. And, Grant Hill's foot got sore.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, still smoldering over something or other, declined
comment, as has become his custom.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Lakers were guarded, drifting away somewhere
between content with the victory and unsure what was next -- growth
or regression.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this isn't going to be one game, one week or one moment
that turns this around," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were less interested in the details than they were the
outcome, a near wire-to-wire victory in which the Magic played
without McGrady for all but a couple minutes in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven seconds into the fourth quarter, McGrady returned,
the Magic down 13. Less than two minutes later, McGrady, having run
delicately for a few possessions, left for good, the deficit then 15.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had reached for a rebound and, upon returning to the
floor, "somebody had their elbow right in my back."</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a result, and for a night, the Lakers got the foot off
their necks. They won after losing two in a row and six of 10. They
won after a painful week among themselves, when egos were tweaked and
feelings bent.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's done. Or waiting out behind the next two-game losing
streak. There's no measuring anymore. None of them dare.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," Brian Shaw said. "Not until we string a few together."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, another night, another mismatch at center, O'Neal
against Shawn Kemp or Andrew DeClerq, this Olumide Oyedeji or that,
didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal made 12 of 17 field-goal attempts, and his 14 rebounds were
within one of his season high, in 36 minutes. He missed his first
three free throws and made his next six, then sat beside the other
starters with more than half of the fourth quarter left.</TE>
<TE>   Beside Robert Horry, who iced his knees. Beside Rick Fox, who
grinned easily. Beside Kobe Bryant, the sleeve on his left leg pushed
down around his ankle. Beside Fisher, whose 15 points led them all at
halftime, whose 19 came on 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had an uneven game -- Phil Jackson called it "strange" --
given 21 points and eight assists but six-for-15 shooting and eight
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   They had pushed the lead toward 20, and then given the ball to the
second unit, a blowout at Staples for the first time since anyone
could recall.</TE>
<TE>   "A win," Fox said with a sigh and a laugh. "Double digits. Our
10th win. We got out of the single digits. I wouldn't say, 'Merry
Christmas,' to our fans yet, but it's a nice way to leave here."</TE>
<TE>   With three of the Magic's preeminent players ailing, the Lakers
played perhaps as they should have. They held the Magic to 34.5%
shooting, they outrebounded the Magic, 52-36, and they blocked 10
shots. O'Neal was all-powerful, and they even made seven of 15
threes.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a much more aggressive game tonight," Jackson said. "We
got to loose balls and were aggressive on the boards and in the lane.
We had to work on our defense a little bit, we looked flat a few
times, but I was pleased with the effort. I think we have something
to build on, hopefully.... We have to come back and make it work,
repeat the effort."</TE>
<TE>   They'll be happy simply to repeat the result. The details, they'll
deal with later.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking for that one game that turns that switch on," Fox said,
"we gave up on that.... We're in for a long haul here."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Pistons' reserves bailed out the starters.</LD>
<LD>   Zeljko Rebraca scored a season-high 21 points, and Detroit got 58
points from its backups to rally from an early 15-point deficit and
beat the New Jersey Nets, 101-91, Sunday at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   Corliss Williamson scored 17 points for Detroit in a matchup of
last season's Eastern Conference division champions.</LD>
<TE>   The Piston starters were grateful for the performance of the
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what our bench does for us," Ben Wallace said. "They give
us a chance to win every night by scoring so many points."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit has won 15 times in New Jersey's last 16 visits to the
Palace. The Pistons are 8-1 overall against the Nets in the last
three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 107, New Orleans 92 -- Chris Webber had 28 points,
eight rebounds and seven assists, and the Kings extended their home
unbeaten streak to 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings beat the Hornets for the fifth consecutive time at Arco
Arena and won for the eighth time in 11 games overall.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 107, Philadelphia 97 -- Jermaine O'Neal had 24 points and
16 rebounds at Indianapolis, and the Pacers extended their Eastern
Conference-leading record to 18-5.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson led the 76ers with 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 95, Toronto 82 -- Michael Jordan tied a career-low with
two points, but Jerry Stackhouse had 28 points to lead the Wizards at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 39, had nine assists and eight rebounds, and matched his
season high by playing 40 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Japan's Shigeki Maruyama and Toshimitsu Izawa shot a six-under-par
66 and won the World Cup at Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, when the U.S.
team of Phil Mickelson and David Toms made double bogey on the last
hole.</TE>
<TE>   Japan won the two-man event with a score of 36 under. The U.S.
team, which shot par or better through the first 17 holes of the

<TE>   South Korea, which shot six under, and England, which shot four
under, tied for third place at 30 under. Defending champion South

<TE>   Toms then pulled a six-iron left of the green. The ball skipped
along the edge of the green before rolling into a rock-filled hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson took a drop. His fourth shot ran about 15 feet past the

<HD>Turco Spearheads Dallas' Teamwork</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Stars' latest victory was a team effort.</LD>
<LD>   Marty Turco stopped 17 shots for his fifth shutout this season,
and Dallas got goals from five players in a 5-0 victory over the
Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "We were pretty solid all around," Coach Dave Tippett said. "We
were strong in every area, and Marty made some saves when he needed
to."</LD>
<TE>   Pierre Turgeon had a goal and an assist, and Sergei Zubov, Aaron
Downey, Darryl Sydor and Jere Lehtinen also scored for the Stars, who
ended Chicago's four-game unbeaten streak.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for the team, with the emphasis on team," Tippett said.
"It's nice to have everyone contribute and feel like they're helping
out."</TE>
<TE>   It was the 10th shutout of Turco's career, and tied him with
Toronto's Ed Belfour for the league lead. He is 9-2-2 in his last 13
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Its a good feeling, not just for me and the 'D' but for the whole
team," Turco said. "The way we got the win is what excites me the
most. We made it look easy."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Carolina 1 -- Dwayne Roloson stopped 33 shots at St.
Paul, Minn., and just missed his second shutout this season.</TE>
<TE>   Roloson, Minnesota's backup goaltender, was headed for his ninth
career shutout until Ron Francis scored with 7:07 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Roloson, who turned away six shots after Francis' goal, is
unbeaten in his last eight starts (5-0-3).</TE>
<TE>   "I've just been trying to keep our guys in games and give
ourselves a chance to win," Roloson said. "Fortunately, we've gotten
some timely goals."</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Ronning and Filip Kuba scored in the first period.
Afterward, Minnesota was outshot, 30-9.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Vancouver 3 -- Sami Salo scored a power-play goal with
4:51 left in regulation and host Vancouver rallied for a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Markus Naslund scored his league-leading 21st goal and had an
assist for the Canucks, who had to rally despite taking two leads in
the first period.</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 20, SAN FRANCISCO 14</KH>
<HD>Favre Still Has 49ers' Number</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Brett Favre fought through the biting winds and whipping rain one
last time to shake Steve Mariucci's hand in the middle of Candlestick
Park.</LD>
<LD>   "That one could have gone either way," Favre told his former
quarterback coach in Green Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, after a rain-soaked 20-14 victory over San Francisco, the
Packers are 9-1 against the 49ers when Favre is their quarterback.</LD>
<TE>   Favre completed 25 of 33 passes for 201 yards in a steady downpour
-- and with memories of Terrell Owens' famed 1999 game-winning catch
reverberating in the stadium, the Green Bay defense stopped the last
49er drive at the Packer 11-yard line with 22 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "I had confidence in our defense, but man, I was also pretty
confident they could score," said Favre.</TE>
<TE>   Ahman Green ran for 90 yards and a touchdown, and Donald Driver
caught a touchdown pass as the Packers (11-3) scored 17 points in the
second half while holding San Francisco (9-5) scoreless in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay earned the home-field advantage in any playoff meeting
between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   After Ryan Longwell's 28-yard field goal made it 20-14 with 4:41
left, Garcia drove the 49ers from their 26 to the 11 before throwing
three incompletions.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need to come out here and win this game to prove that
we're a playoff team," Garcia said. "It's not like we got blown out
of the water or anything. It came down to a few plays."</TE>
<TE>   Owens caught eight passes for 75 yards and a touchdown -- which he
punctuated with a pompom-waving celebration -- but the 49er offense
struggled, getting 263 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in my next life, I'm going to be cheerleader," Owens
said. "After I cross the end zone, I'm in my own little zone, my own
little world."</TE>
<TE>   Mariucci said of Owens' celebration: "I love seeing Terrell
celebrating in the end zone. Nobody does it better."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer knew everything was different a few moments after he
walked out of a Manhattan hotel Sunday morning and slipped inside a
stretch limousine.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you going to want makeup?" asked a production assistant for
the "NFL Today" show on CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer, who won the 68th Heisman Trophy the night before, shot a
quizzical look at his father, Bill, then shrugged his shoulders and
said, "I guess so."</LD>
<TE>   That's how Day 1 of life after the Heisman began for Palmer, the
fifth USC player and the first Trojan quarterback to win the award
presented annually to the nation's most outstanding college football
player. Tonight, Palmer will be the guest of honor at a $600-a-plate,
black-tie dinner at the New York Hilton sponsored by the Downtown
Athletic Club of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely getting to the point where I realize that I'm in
for some serious changes," said Palmer, who will turn 23 on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of onlookers ringed the outdoor set at CBS headquarters
when Palmer appeared for a live interview with Jim Nantz, Dan Marino,
Deion Sanders and Boomer Esiason on "NFL Today." When the segment was
done, Palmer mugged with the trophy and courteously filled every
autograph and photo request as he made his way back to the limo.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see Deion's shoes?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a quick lunch of chicken parmigiana and chocolate milk at a
nearby pizza shop, Palmer recounted the previous 15 hours as a series
of surreal events.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning it was a shock," Palmer said. "Looking at the trophy with
my name on it was crazy. Going out last night and celebrating was
great. Then, to wake up and go do the interview with those guys -- it
keeps getting better and better."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, however, said he was beginning to grow weary of the
attention.</TE>
<TE>   His father predicted as much on Saturday night, shortly after his
son won the Heisman over Iowa quarterback Brad Banks, Penn State
running back Larry Johnson, Miami running back Willis McGahee and
Hurricane quarterback Ken Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   "He would rather be anonymous than on the stage, but unfortunately
you don't get those choices if you're successful. That's just what we
do to people," Bill Palmer said. "He doesn't seek that, so he'll
worry about that in time. But other [Heisman winners] have been
through it and they have survived."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who has passed for 3,639 yards and 32 touchdowns this
season, will complete his USC career Jan. 2 when the fifth-ranked
Trojans play third-ranked Iowa in the Orange Bowl. A solid
performance against the Hawkeyes could solidify Palmer's status as
the potential No. 1 pick in the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Esiason, who led the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl in 1989,
addressed the speculation during Palmer's television appearance. The
lowly Bengals are expected to have the No. 1 pick.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever been to Cincinnati?" Esiason asked while handing a
tiger-striped Bengal helmet to Palmer. "Guess what, son. You're
going!"</TE>
<TE>   Palmer laughed along with Esiason. Later, he downplayed
conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know. I don't know. I don't think anybody knows," he
said. "There is still a lot of football that needs to be played and I
still have a lot of work I need to do. A lot of areas need to get
better before I start worrying about being the No. 1 guy in the draft
or anything like that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like the whole Heisman thing. It's so far out there,
the chances are so slim it could ever happen to you. I'm definitely
not banking on it or thinking about that."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Palmer is deciding where he will keep his Heisman Trophy
-- "probably at my parents' house" -- and what he will say in a short
speech tonight at the dinner in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   USC President Steven Sample, Trojan Coach Pete Carroll, offensive
coordinator Norm Chow and quarterback coach Steve Sarkisian are among
those scheduled to arrive from Los Angeles this afternoon to join
Athletic Director Mike Garrett and other athletic department
officials who will be among the crowd saluting Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett, who won the Heisman Trophy at USC in 1965, said Palmer's
victory reflected the Trojans' return to prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning this year and going to a BCS bowl makes us a national
power. Carson is icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer is looking forward to returning home Tuesday, sharing the
Heisman Trophy with teammates and practicing for the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shaking my head and saying, 'Wow. I can't believe this is
happening to me,' " he said. "When I jump on that plane [to go home]
and have free time to really enjoy and think back on all the great
things I've had the opportunity to do, I think I'm going to realize
what's going on and how special and how amazing this has been."</TE>

<LD>It's an odd and curious universe the three best pass catchers in
football have created for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Two of them -- Terrell Owens, who can't get enough attention, and
Randy Moss, who just wants you to get out of his face -- live in
their own little worlds.</LD>
<LD>   The third, Marvin Harrison, is as reliable as the setting sun, the
difference between night and day for the Indianapolis Colts, even if
he's taken for granted on a daily basis.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday, all three were spotted in their standard operational
modes. While Owens finally came clean with what we sensed all along
-- he's his own biggest cheerleader -- and Moss re-emerged from
hibernation to spark his monthly Minnesota victory, Harrison was
quietly breaking the NFL single-season reception record on his way to
hammering it into oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know that in 14 games in 2002, Harrison has caught more
passes than anyone previously managed in any 16-game season?</TE>
<TE>   Do you know that Harrison, with 1,524 receiving yards in 2001 plus
1,566 and counting in 2002, is the first man in league history to log
consecutive 1,500-yard seasons?</TE>
<TE>   Do you know what Harrison had to say after catching nine passes
for 172 yards in the Colts' 28-23 victory over Cleveland and breaking
Herman Moore's seven-year-old single-season record?</TE>
<TE>   "I just catch them. I don't count them."</TE>
<TE>   Which might explain why Harrison has caught more footballs in a
season than Owens or Moss or Jerry Rice or Cris Carter yet flies
considerably lower on the publicity radar.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison has 127 receptions in 14 games this season, which is four
more than Moore's record of 123 in 1995. He is averaging a little
more than nine catches a game in 2002, putting him on pace for a
season total of 145. "He's got two games left," Colt quarterback
Peyton Manning said, "and maybe he'll try to set it forever."</TE>
<TE>   But he's sorely lacking in the crucial career-enhancing
departments of self-promotion and self-styled moodiness. Harrison
doesn't have the fan club Owens has built (acting president, serving
a lifetime term: Terrell Owens) or the mysterious, mercurial aura of
Moss, who frightened the Vikings into ruining another season in their
desperate attempt to "keep Randy happy," although no one on the
planet is really sure what that requires.</TE>
<TE>   Owens lost an important game Sunday, at home, 20-14, to the Green
Bay Packers, which could mean bad things for the San Francisco 49ers
if they win their first-round playoff game only to find themselves
staring at a second-rounder at Lambeau Field or Veterans Stadium. Yet
there was Owens in the back of the end zone during the game, grabbing
pompoms from a 49er cheerleader and waving them in honor of his
favorite athlete: himself.</TE>
<TE>   Moss had been MIA for so long, the Vikings were thinking about
printing bumper stickers: "Land of 10,000 Lakes and No Moss." On
paper, the "Randy Ratio," Viking Coach Mike Tice's elaborate plan
designed to send 40% of Daunte Culpepper's passes into Moss' private
atmosphere, might have looked like a good idea -- or at least
kindling to create a fire to warm those frozen brain cells.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, all it did was tip Tice's hand to each of the Vikings'
first 14 opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of them walked away with victories.</TE>
<TE>   With the Vikings' playoff hopes extinguished long ago, with Moss
having nothing or no one to play for except himself, the New Orleans
Saints were defeated by an unexpected blast from the past. Inside the
Superdome, Moss freed himself for 11 catches for 113 yards and two
touchdowns -- his first multi-touchdown performance this season --
including the game-winner in a 32-31 victory.</TE>
<TE>   With five seconds left, Culpepper connected with Moss for a
13-yard touchdown, pulling the Vikings to within a point at 31-30.
With nothing to lose except another game, Tice opted for the
two-point try, dropping Culpepper into shotgun formation.</TE>
<TE>   In typical Viking fashion, Culpepper dropped the ball. Then he
picked it up. And dropped it again. Inside of passing or pitching the
football, Culpepper appeared to be dribbling it.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans, still getting re-acclimated with basketball, didn't
seem to know how to react. By the time the Saints figured out what
was going on, Culpepper was gone -- up the middle through the
bamboozled defensive line and into the end zone for the winning
two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   After 16 consecutive road defeats, the Vikings had finally won a
game away from the Metrodome -- a game against a playoff contender,
no less. It would not have been possible without Moss.</TE>
<TE>   "Moss is the money man," Culpepper said, and that's the problem.
Priceless or not worth a plugged nickel -- from week to week, the
Vikings never can be sure what they're getting with Moss.</TE>
<TE>   The season has hit mid-December. With only two more weeks to play
and a dwindling number of playoff berths still there for the
grabbing, receivers are playing decisive roles -- for better or
worse.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Jets watched their postseason bid all but slip away
when Wayne Chrebet took a late pass from Chad Pennington and tried to
turn a team-wide rally into a one-man superhero rescue. Chrebet had
the ball inside the Chicago 15-yard line when he tried to hurdle two
defenders instead of settling for a first down and a few more cracks
at the score-tying touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Knocked head over heels, Chrebet lost the ball on the way down,
Bear cornerback Roosevelt Williams recovered at his 14 with 1:10 to
play and the Jets lost a must-win game, 20-13, to fall to 7-7 and two
games out of first place in the AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the smartest thing to do," Chrebet later acknowledged,
and no one in the Jet locker room was arguing with him. "But if it
works, it ties it up."</TE>
<TE>   The only way it would have worked is if Chrebet had a boarding
pass and his baggage stored in the overhead bin. But it gets intense
out there on NFL playing fields. Such an environment is not always
conducive to quick, clear-headed thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Which might explain what Owens was doing dancing with those
cheerleader pompoms. Or maybe not.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the Green Bay Packer locker room sits a man in every sense of the
word, a man of strength and integrity, of caring and depth, a man who
became a new father and a grieving son on the same day.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in front of a locker sits a man who values his religion
and his family, his education and the idea that a man must earn his
salary and should never take a minute off when he is on the job.</LD>
<LD>   And, his teammates say, a special man. "What Kabeer has shown us,
is something very special," teammate Vonnie Holiday said. "He is an
unusual man."</LD>
<TE>   Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila and his wife, Eileen, welcomed their first
child, a son, into their family two weeks ago. Later that day, having
barely sunk into the exhausted sleep of supreme happiness,
Gbaja-Biamila was awakened by a phone call from Los Angeles. The news
was horrific. His mother, Bola, a vibrant, 53-year-old with seven
children, had been killed in a car crash.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a mile from her South Central home, Bola lost control of
the car and hit a tree. The car burst into flames. The family still
is not sure what caused her to lose control. Did Bola suffer some
sort of medical problem? Was there trouble with the car?</TE>
<TE>   Right now it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Since the funeral, Gbaja-Biamila, a defensive end, has played two
football games.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, only four days after he returned from Los Angeles, at
a time his teammates and coaches didn't expect Gbaja-Biamila to play,
at a time they would have supported his need to grieve and to focus
on himself, Gbaja-Biamila played and played well against Minnesota.
He had six tackles, a sack and a forced fumble. His relentless
pressure on Viking quarterback Daunte Culpepper in the fourth quarter
helped the Packers come back from a nine-point deficit to win.</TE>
<TE>   And Sunday, here, where the rain had made a lake out of the
parking lots and a swamp out of 3Com Park, Gbaja-Biamila played
again.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have the extravagant numbers of a week earlier because
the conditions weren't conducive to flamboyant plays.</TE>
<TE>   Others can find a way to behave extravagantly.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Owens caught a touchdown pass in a game his San Francisco
49ers would lose, 20-14. He grabbed a bedraggled cheerleader's gold
pompoms and shook them while moving his hips.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Owens was mocking the rain-soaked young woman or
celebrating his greatness or taunting the Green Bay defense or maybe
a little of all of that, his look-at-me, aren't-I-great behavior cast
a dreary day in a depressing light.</TE>
<TE>   Gbaja-Biamila, who had 13 1/2 sacks last year and has 10 this
year, is not given to extraordinary behaviors designed to make
himself stand out.</TE>
<TE>   "If I make a play, isn't that what I'm supposed to do?"
Gbaja-Biamila said. "My mother and I had great conversations about
our religion and about what it means to be a Christian and in our
faith, we treasured humbleness."</TE>
<TE>   It was hard for Gbaja-Biamila to speak of his mother on this day.
She was to have come from Los Angeles to San Francisco to see her son
play. Then her plan was to fly to Green Bay to see her new grandson,
Abdul Rasheed.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm just trying to enjoy the gift God gave me in this
new child," Gbaja-Biamila said. "But it's still hard. I can't fool
myself. What happened on that single day, it's going to affect me for
a long time. But I know I'm going to be able to carry on because I
know that's what my mom would want of me, and I know God is going to
give me strength. God says he wouldn't give us anything we couldn't
handle and I'm really hanging my hat on that."</TE>
<TE>   Gbaja-Biamila, the son of Nigerian parents, grew up in South
Central and went to Crenshaw High. He was a National Football
Foundation Hall of Fame scholar-athlete in high school. He was one of
40 student-owners of a project that allowed teenagers to run a
natural food company called "Food From the 'Hood," which offered
South Central organic produce in neighborhood markets. For his
efforts, Gbaja-Biamila had his picture on the cover of Newsweek. He
remains active with the project and comes home in the summer to work
out with Crenshaw athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "My family taught us values," Gbaja-Biamila said.</TE>
<TE>   When he is asked who he admires most, or who his role model is,
Gbaja-Biamila answers simply, "Jesus of Nazareth."</TE>
<TE>   Gbaja-Biamila was a three-year starter at San Diego State, but he
wasn't drafted until the fifth round by Green Bay in 2000. The
Packers cut him in the preseason but re-signed him to the practice
squad. Gbaja-Biamila, 6 feet 4 and 255 pounds, had his breakout
season last year when he became the first Packer since Reggie White
to have a double-digit sack total.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing unusual about how or why Gbaja-Biamila has
played over the last two weeks, he said. "I'm a professional and I
should act like one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Acting like a professional seems to have different meanings for
different professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Waving a cheerleader's pompoms is one way. Learning to be a
father, having to mourn a mother, always being a good teammate is
another.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rasheed Gbaja-Biamila won't have far to look to find his
role model.</TE>

<KH>ST. LOUIS 30, ARIZONA 28</KH>
<HD>Bulger Perfect Quarterback for Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Marc Bulger is still the St. Louis Rams' good-luck charm.</LD>
<LD>   The former third-string quarterback returned from a sprained index
finger and threw two touchdown passes, and Jeff Wilkins kicked a
26-yard field goal with 20 seconds left that lifted the Rams over the
Arizona Cardinals, 30-28, Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Sidelined for three games, Bulger came back and improved to 6-0 as
the starter for the Rams, who are 0-6 with last season's NFL most
valuable player, Kurt Warner.</LD>
<TE>   But Bulger also threw two interceptions and struggled in the
second half as the Rams (6-8) barely snapped a three-game losing
streak that chased the defending NFC champions out of playoff
contention.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a little rusty," Ram Coach Mike Martz said. "He made some
throws that he doesn't usually make, and he needs to be a little bit
more disciplined than he was at some times in the second half. But he
made plays and that's what makes him so special."</TE>
<TE>   Bulger was concentrating on the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I made some big mistakes and put my team in some bad
situations," said Bulger, who was 24 for 40 passing for 319 yards.
"But anytime you win, all of those feelings go away."</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Shipp scored three touchdowns and Jake Plummer's one-yard
touchdown pass to Steve Bush gave the Cardinals, down by 17 points at
halftime, a 28-27 lead with 7:56 to go.</TE>
<TE>   Plummer, 17 of 27 passing for 258 yards with two touchdowns and an
interception, came close to his 22nd come-from-behind victory in six
seasons, including all five victories this year for the Cardinals
(5-9).</TE>
<TE>   Plummer produced two first downs before giving the Rams back the
ball with 1:51 to go and no timeouts remaining. Bulger delivered,
moving the Rams 72 yards in five plays over 1:31, the biggest a
58-yard pass play to Torry Holt on the first play.</TE>

<HD>Ravens Still Have Hope</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Jeff Blake and Matt Stover helped the Baltimore Ravens keep their
faint playoff hopes alive.</LD>
<LD>   Blake threw two touchdown passes and Stover kicked three field
goals, the last with 6:48 to play, as the Ravens beat the Houston
Texans, 23-19, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to do what it takes and we came out and did it today,"
Blake said.</LD>
<TE>   The Ravens (7-7) have games remaining against two AFC North teams.
They play host to Cleveland (7-7) on Sunday and end the regular
season Dec. 29 at Pittsburgh (8-5-1).</TE>
<TE>   "We went on the road in a playoff hunt and executed what you have
to do to win a game," Coach Brian Billick said. "They did an
outstanding job. I like the way they answered some situations. It
bodes well for this team now and in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens led, 13-7, at halftime on Stover's two kicks of 22
yards each, and Blake's 26-yard touchdown pass play to Travis Taylor
and Blake's 11-yard touchdown pass play to Chester Taylor with 3:33
left in the third quarter made it 20-7. Blake, who wasn't sacked,
completed 18 of 30 passes for 228 yards, with no interceptions. The
Texans (4-10) got a little momentum back when Avion Black returned a
punt 76 yards for a touchdown with four seconds left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's David Carr was sacked twice, leaving him two sacks short
of the NFL record of 72 set by Randall Cunningham in 1986. Carr
completed 19 of 34 passes for 196 yards, with two interceptions.</TE>

<KH>SEATTLE 30, ATLANTA 24 (OT)</KH>
<HD>No Feely-Good Falcon Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Michael Vick came through, then Shaun Alexander did him one better to
win the game for Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   After Atlanta's Jay Feely missed a 36-yard field goal in overtime,
Alexander ran 27 yards for a touchdown, giving the Seahawks a 30-24
victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I have to shoulder this burden," Feely said. "That's my job, to
make field goals."</LD>
<TE>   Vick, who did little right through 3 1/2 quarters, led the Falcons
tie the score with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Trevor Gaylor with 17
seconds left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   He then drove his team to the 18 in the overtime to set up Feely's
try.</TE>
<TE>   But the kick sailed wide right, and the Seahawks (5-9) made
Atlanta pay.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Hasselbeck completed a 21-yard pass to Koren Robinson on
third-and-six, and Alexander did the rest. On second down, he broke
through the middle and easily outran the defense to hand the Falcons
(8-5-1) their second consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Mack Strong, who is probably the best fullback in the NFL, hit
the linebacker and gave me a good angle, and I had the easy part,"
Alexander said. "I just had to run."</TE>
<TE>   It was the 22nd overtime game of the season, breaking the record
set in 1995, and no team has contributed more than the Falcons --
1-2-1 in four overtime games.</TE>
<TE>   There has been at least one overtime game in 12 of the 15 weeks
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had bad luck in overtime this year," Falcon linebacker
Keith Brooking said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of opportunities to win the game and didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Vick completed 21 of 38 passes for 240 yards, and ran for 40 yards
in 13 carries. He injured his throwing hand in the second quarter,
hitting a helmet on his follow-through, but stayed in the game. Until
the final drive of regulation, Vick had completed 12 of 24 passes for
117 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck was 22 of 31 for 298 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel Matt is getting into the comfort zone," Robinson said.
"It's his offense now and we are rolling with him."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons are still in the chase for one of two NFC wild-card
berths, a half-game behind New Orleans (9-5) and half-game ahead of
the New York Giants (8-6).</TE>

<HD>Harrington Gets a Scare During Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Houston Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit Lion rookie quarterback Joey Harrington left Sunday's game
against Tampa Bay at Pontiac, Mich., because of an irregular
heartbeat and was taken to the hospital for tests and observation.</LD>
<LD>   He was to stay overnight at Henry Ford Hospital as a precaution.</LD>
<LD>   "Joey Harrington is doing fine right now," said internist Keith
Burch, a Lion team physician.</LD>
<TE>   "I suspect that if we find nothing through the work-up, that he'll
maybe miss one game and be back, and then maybe even play in the next
game, depending on what they find," Burch said. "He could miss the
remainder because there are only two left. That's a possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Irregular heartbeats could be a sign of a larger problem, and a
few players during the last 11 NFL seasons have had to sit out games
because of heart arrhythmia.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1991, Joe Walter, a guard with the Cincinnati Bengals, was
held out of a game against Oakland. He played one more season before
retiring.</TE>
<TE>   * Kansas City defensive end Derrick Thomas was removed from a 1991
game against the Raiders. He died of a heart attack in 2000, 16 days
after being paralyzed from the chest down in a car crash.</TE>
<TE>   * Defensive end Alfred Williams had problems twice. He underwent
two surgeries with Cincinnati before the 1992 season to correct a
defect that caused an irregular beat, then was held out of practice
in 1997 by Denver after developing arrhythmia while lifting weights.
Williams retired during the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston Oiler wide receiver Haywood Jeffires was held out of a
practice in 1993 after his heart rate was irregular and rose to 170.
He didn't miss a game that season and retired during the 1997 season
with 535 receptions.</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh guard Will Wolford was hospitalized in 1996 but
returned the next day and didn't miss a game that season. Wolford
retired after the 1998 season.</TE>
<TE>   * Simeon Rice missed a practice while with Arizona in 1999, but
played the next week and set a record with Tampa Bay this season with
multiple sacks in five consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Harrington played on one possession, and threw one
incomplete pass, before leaving in the second quarter after he
started to feel ill.</TE>
<TE>   "Joey Harrington had an irregular heartbeat that returned to a
normal rhythm before he left [Ford Field]," Kyle Anderson, a team
orthopedist, said. "Because Joey had no previous history of an
irregular heartbeat, we had to make sure we took precautionary
measures."</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, the No. 3 overall pick from Oregon, started his 12th
straight game for the Lions. He began Sunday's game completing just
more than 50% of his passes, with 2,294 yards, 12 touchdowns and 16
interceptions.</TE>

<HD>Morelia, Toluca Advance</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of Mexico's most attack-minded teams, Morelia and Toluca, both
featuring Argentine coaches, have advanced to the Mexican league's
two-game championship final, to be played Wednesday and Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Morelia, coached by Ruben Omar Romano, clinched its place Sunday
afternoon despite a 2-1 loss to UNAM in Mexico City.</LD>
<LD>   The Monarcas had won the first game of the series, 4-0, at home
and although the Pumas, coached by former Mexico striker Hugo
Sanchez, cut into the deficit with goals from Uruguayans Mariano
Lemos and Alvaro Gonzalez, Adolfo Bautista scored for Morelia to
assure it a 5-2 aggregate victory.</LD>
<TE>   In the other semifinal series, Toluca's Red Devils coached by
Alberto Jorge, completed a sweep of Santos Laguna with a 2-1 home
victory Saturday night to go along with an earlier 5-3 success on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca's Paraguayan striker, Jose Cardozo, netted both goals,
extending his scoring streak to 15 games and increasing his season
goal total to 35.</TE>
<TE>   Trio Fired</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that their teams reached the Mexican championship
quarterfinals, the coaches of Cruz Azul, Guadalajara and UAG have
been fired by their clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Trejo's dismissal by Cruz Azul was the most surprising.
He had not only taken the team to the last eight but had also
qualified it for next season's Copa Libertadores, a tournament in
which he led Cruz Azul to the final in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Trejo's failure to make proper use of Uruguayan striker Sebastian
Abreu was one reason cited for his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Also shown the door were Peruvian Coach Julio Cesar Uribe, who was
fired by Chivas, and Daniel Guzman, who was dismissed by the Tecos of
UAG.</TE>
<TE>   Santos Wins Title</TE>
<TE>   Led by 18-year-old striker Robinho, who scored one goal and set up
two more, Santos won its first Brazilian title since the formation of
a national championship in 1971 when it defeated three-time winner
Corinthians, 3-2, in Sao Paulo to complete a two-game sweep of the
championship series, 5-2, on aggregate.</TE>
<TE>   The team, coached by former Brazil national team coach Emerson
Leao and with an average age of only 23, has been the revelation of
the Brazilian season, with Robinho and 17-year-old Diego hailed as
the country's two great hopes for future World Cup success.</TE>
<TE>   Both players could be featured on Brazil's team for the 2004
Athens Olympic Games. On Sunday, Ricardo Gomes, a defender on
Brazil's 1990 World Cup team, was appointed coach of Brazil's Olympic
squad.</TE>
<TE>   Zamalek Is Champion</TE>
<TE>   Zamalek of Egypt won the African Champions League title for the
fifth time by defeating Raja Casablanca of Morocco, 1-0, in front of
70,000 in Cairo in the second leg of the final.</TE>
<TE>   The teams had tied the first leg, 0-0, in Casablanca, but
midfielder Tamer Abdelhamid's long-range goal in injury time at the
end of the first half was enough to separate the clubs in an
ill-tempered game that degenerated into a bench-clearing brawl at the
final whistle.</TE>
<TE>   Zamalek also was African champion in 1984, 1986, 1993 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Costly Cola</TE>
<TE>   As if being beaten in the African final was not bad enough for
Raja Casablanca, the Moroccan club Sunday was fined the maximum
penalty of $15,000 by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and
also might lose $750,000 in tournament prize money for wearing a
Coca-Cola logo on its uniforms in the first leg of the final in
Casablanca despite the fact that the Champions League is sponsored by
Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from CAF said Raja Casablanca had been told not to wear
the rival logo. They said Raja Casablanca's share of the marketing
and television revenue from the competition is being withheld pending
a possible claim for compensation.</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 30, CAROLINA 14</KH>
<HD>Steelers Put Themselves in Good Position</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Only a week after their season seemed in jeopardy, the Pittsburgh
Steelers find themselves in familiar late-season position: in first
place, and in control.</LD>
<LD>   The Steelers (8-5-1) -- doomed by turnovers in last week's
humiliating loss to Houston -- turned two Carolina fumbles into
Jerome Bettis touchdown runs to beat Carolina, 30-14, Sunday and
seize control of the AFC North.</LD>
<LD>   The victory, only their third in six games, boosted the Steelers'
division lead to 1 1/2 games over Cleveland, a 28-23 loser to
Indianapolis. The Steelers can lose the division only if they drop
their final two and either the Browns (7-7) or Baltimore (7-7) win
two in a row.</LD>
<TE>   "We went into it thinking we can't lose another game, we can't
afford it," linebacker Kendrell Bell said. "We need a three-game
winning streak to carry us into the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers forced four turnovers -- Carolina (5-9) has two or
more turnovers in seven consecutive games -- to give a big lift to
the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do that against a playoff caliber team in their place,"
Panther Coach John Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh didn't score a touchdown without help after its opening
possession, when Tommy Maddox led a 77-yard drive ended by his
11-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress. Burress made six catches
for 120 yards after dropping a half-dozen passes against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Said Burress: "I know people were looking to me and how I would
respond, so I said, 'Don't go out and try to do anything special,
just be me and let the game come to me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Maddox, aware he might be benched if his turnover problems
persisted, threw an interception that led to Rodney Peete's six-yard
touchdown pass to running back Dee Brown. But he was effective
otherwise, completing 20 of 33 passes for 209 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "They got turnovers and gave their offense a short field," Panther
cornerback Terry Cousin said.</TE>

<HD>Riley Gets First Look From UCLA</HD>
<DH>Saint assistant will meet with chancellor today but says
other prospects for Bruin coaching job to be interviewed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Riley will meet today with Chancellor Albert Carnesale to talk
about the UCLA football coaching job, but the New Orleans Saint
assistant does not expect an imminent decision.</LD>
<LD>   Considered the top candidate to replace the fired Bob Toledo,
Riley said that he expects to return to New Orleans later today with
the job still open.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing will happen," he said moments after his flight arrived in
Los Angeles Sunday night. Of interviewing with Carnesale, Riley said:
"I'm not the only guy coming in. I'm just the first guy."</LD>
<TE>   Many people close to the coaching search believe that, ultimately,
Riley will be the guy. UCLA began courting him last Monday, just
hours after Athletic Director Dan Guerrero fired Toledo, the Bruin
coach of seven years. Guerrero and assistant athletic director Bob
Field flew to New Orleans last Monday evening and conducted a
four-hour interview with Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obviously interested in it," Riley said. "They are taking
their time, and that's the smart way to handle it. [The time frame]
could be short, and it could be long."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Dorrell, a Denver Bronco assistant who has the backing of
many former Bruin players, and Kansas City Chief assistant Greg
Robinson were interviewed Saturday by Guerrero and Field.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of those talks, Guerrero asked Dorrell and
Robinson about their availability today. They are the only candidates
besides Riley believed to have been interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Mike Price belatedly joined the picture for
a short time. UCLA requested -- and received -- permission to
interview him Friday, but by Saturday afternoon Price told his team
he was not interested.</TE>
<TE>   That is not the case with Riley, 49, regardless of how long it
takes UCLA to make a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obviously interested in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riley turned down a lucrative long-term offer Thursday from
Alabama, his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   "That decision was made independent of this one," he said. "It had
nothing to do with UCLA and what they wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Riley's wife and two children have lived in Southern California
since he was an assistant at USC from 1993-96 and currently live in
Solana Beach near San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said UCLA is prepared to make a contract offer to Riley
worth $700,000 to $800,000, plus incentives. The deal is thought to
be for six or seven years and would include a rollover clause,
meaning that another year is added to the deal every year the coach
is retained.</TE>
<TE>   A potential sticking point is the $750,000 owed him by the San
Diego Chargers for the last year of a five-year guaranteed deal he
signed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired after going 14-34 in three seasons and the Chargers
do not have to pay him if he takes another head coaching job.
However, UCLA is unlikely to add even a portion of that amount to his
deal.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, Riley would seem an unattractive candidate. He had
only a 22-48 record as a head coach with the Chargers and for two
seasons at Oregon State, although he did win two Canadian Football
League Grey Cup titles as coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</TE>
<TE>   But he is regarded as a strong tactician on offense and has a
reputation for connecting with young players.</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't hurt that Riley has had a long relationship with
Field, who has emerged as Guerrero's most trusted football advisor.
Field was a young assistant at Alabama when Riley played there in the
early 1970s and the two men have remained in contact.</TE>
<TE>   Field, a longtime former UCLA assistant nudged from his defensive
coordinator position by Toledo after the 2000 season, is familiar
with all the top candidates. He was a UCLA assistant along with
Robinson under Terry Donahue in the 1980s -- a period when Dorrell
was a standout receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, sources said, also has the strong backing of Bobby
Beathard, a respected former NFL general manager who hired Riley with
the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   Beathard's son, Jeff, played under Riley in Winnipeg. Guerrero, in
his first year as athletic director, considers it a plus that Riley
does not have strong ties to UCLA, sources said. Dorrell has the
backing of many players from the Bruin glory days in the 1980s, but
such strong support from one segment of alumni might make Guerrero
wary.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third time in two years that Riley has been close to a
Pacific 10 Conference coaching position. Two years ago USC tried to
hire him to replace Paul Hackett, but the Chargers would not release
him from his contract. Last year he was a finalist for the Stanford
opening that went to Buddy Teevens.</TE>
<TE>   He is a serious candidate again, and he'll discover more in his
meeting with Carnesale. While he waited for his wife, Dee, to pick
him up outside the airline terminal Sunday, Riley shrugged off the
uncertainty. "I don't even know where we are staying tonight," he
said. "She'll pick me up and take me there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman and linebacker Marcus Reese were named
co-most valuable players at the UCLA football team banquet Sunday at
the Beverly Hills Hilton.</TE>

<HD>Another Title for UCLA</HD>

<LD>Persistence paid off for the UCLA men's soccer team, and it resulted
in its fourth NCAA championship.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Lopez scored off a free kick with 1:02 remaining to give the
Bruins a 1-0 victory over Stanford and their first national title
since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (18-3-3) finished the season with six consecutive victories,
but the final one was the hardest. The high-scoring Bruins managed
only two shots on goal in the match but beat their Pacific 10
Conference rival for the third time this season before 8,498 at
Southern Methodist's Ford Stadium in Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "Wow, it's like am I dreaming or am I really here?" defender
Leonard Griffin said. "We always talked about this, and now it's
happened."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA won both Pac-10 matches between the teams this season, 1-0.
Sunday's match was another defensive struggle.</TE>
<TE>   There were few good scoring chances; Bruin goalie Zach Wells and
Cardinal keeper Robby Fulton each made only one save.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton couldn't stop the last opportunity. After UCLA drew a foul
along the left side, midfielder Ryan Futagaki took a free kick
outside the penalty box.</TE>
<TE>   The left-footed Futagaki sent a pass toward the middle as players
loaded up inside the box. Lopez, a sophomore defender, made a run to
the back edge and beat Stanford's Seyi Abolaji to the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Normally a right-footed shot, Lopez got his left foot on the ball
and put it cleanly past Fulton to the right corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get at least a yard and a half of space to get that
shot and I made my move," said Lopez, who scored three of his four
goals in the playoffs. "The ball had some spin on it and I just put
my foot on the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (18-5-2) nearly took the lead in the sixth minute. Wells
got caught out of position on a corner kick and Taylor Graham sent a
header toward the goal. UCLA midfielder Jimmy Frazelle blocked the
ball at the goal line and cleared it.</TE>
<TE>   Futagaki nearly put the Bruins up in the 31st minute when he
rocketed a free kick off the left post from 25 yards out.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford controlled most of the action in the first half. The UCLA
back row of Griffin, Scot Thompson and Tony Lawson cut off forwards
Matt Janusz and Roger Levesque each time they got the ball inside the
Bruin box.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it was going to be difficult because they're very, very
big and good on set pieces," UCLA Coach Tom Fitzgerald said. "It was
a real challenge but our guys stepped up and didn't get them very
many opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Futagaki said the offensive push in the last five minutes was
decisive.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coaches told us it was going to be a battle until the end,"
he said. "We were going to get fatigued but we could never give up.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we showed it in the end."</TE>

<HD>Vikings Finally Snap 'Two' It</HD>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Daunte Culpepper was joyous: Even when he made a mistake he made
good.</LD>
<LD>   Culpepper fumbled the snap on a two-point conversion with five
seconds left, picked up the ball and still managed to lunge into the
end zone, lifting the Minnesota Vikings to a 32-31 victory against
the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The joy that came into my body, I can't put into words,"
Culpepper said after the Vikings (4-10) ended a 16-game losing streak
on the road as he accounted for four touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   The Saints (9-5) could have clinched a playoff spot with a
victory, but fell two games behind Tampa Bay in the NFC South.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to leave a bad taste in our mouths," Saint quarterback
Aaron Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which had lost six of 10 when leading or tied in the
fourth quarter, was trailing, 31-24, with 5:21 left.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper drove the Vikings 73 yards before connecting with a
double-teamed Randy Moss for a 13-yard touchdown to pull the Vikings
within 31-30. Minnesota eschewed an extra-point kick to force
overtime, and Culpepper's conversion gave Minnesota its first road
win since Thanksgiving Day 2000, when it beat Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't a monkey on our backs," said Viking defensive end
Lance Johnstone.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a gorilla. Every game has been close and to be able to
finish the game on the road was big."</TE>
<TE>   Tice said in the middle of the winning drive "I told the coaches
to have your two-point play ready.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a question we would go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper completed 26 of 36 passes for 312 yards and two
touchdowns. Culpepper was also the game's leading rusher with 73
yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Moss caught 11 passes for 113 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Moss is the money man," Culpepper said. "In the clutch you've got
to go to him."</TE>
<TE>   The inability to stop Minnesota in the closing seconds was
especially troubling, Saint Coach Jim Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two plays were probably the most disappointing of the
game," Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Moss doubled, we had a guy inside-outside and still got
beat."</TE>
<TE>   Deuce McAllister, playing on a sprained ankle, rushed for 69 yards
in 18 carries for the Saints. He had a 78-yard touchdown run
nullified by a holding call.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to put another touchdown on the board," McAllister
said. "We should have in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   The Saints trailed, 24-20, at halftime.</TE>
