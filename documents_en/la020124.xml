<LD>The Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. awards Tuesday night were a more
emotional experience than one might expect. About 200 critics and
publicists gathered at the Casa del Mar in Santa Monica for the
ceremony. Right away, film association member Henry Sheehan took a
swipe at the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. for eating during
screenings. He told the crowd: "I don't know how many movies I've
been to where I thought 'Phillippe, do you have any mints?' was part
of the dialogue!"</LD>
<LD>   Kate Winslet, who won best supporting actress for "Iris," nearly
wept while thanking her agents. Then, Jeffrey Katzenberg, whose film
"Shrek" won best animation, noted the surrealism in being given
awards by critics. "Who's more freaked out now? You or me?" he joked.
Soon after, another honoree, legendary Disney animator Joe Grant,
told the crowd: "In defiance of Mr. Katzenberg, I hope everyone goes
to see 'Monsters, Inc.'"</LD>
<LD>   Sissy Spacek, who won best actress for "In the Bedroom," told the
story of how she realized she wanted to be an actress at age 6 while
watching the Cokettes, a group of baton-twirlers in Coke, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Then, Denzel Washington surprised the crowd by suggesting
straight-faced that his award for best actor in "Training Day" should
have been presented before Spacek's. "Is that sexist or something?"
he asked. After Washington left the stage, the association's
president, Jean Oppenheimer, took the podium and sniped back: "That
was a real electric performance."</TE>
<TE>   Director David Lynch's avant-garde antics earned huge laughs from
the crowd. He was awarded best director for "Mulholland Drive."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you for creating so much buzz for my movie," Lynch said.
"This is the sound of the buzz you created." With that, Lynch held a
small tape recorder up to the microphone, filling the room with a
cacophony of noise. He shut off the recorder and said, "I'm glad none
of us are normal ... I'm fighting a strong desire to talk about
nuclear fission."</TE>
<TE>   The evening ended on a somber note when director Todd Field
appeared to choke back emotion while accepting the best picture award
for "In the Bedroom." Producer Graham Leader stepped in and
succinctly summarized the powerful pull the film has had on
post-Sept. 11 audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "It is simply about the value of human life," he said. "I think
that is why it has struck a nerve with people today."</TE>

<TE>   Bening as Mentor</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by men in suits, Annette Bening stood underneath the
20-foot Roy Lichtenstein painting depicting climbers in Creative
Artists Agency's lobby Tuesday night on Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Her agent, Kevin Huvane, sauntered over for a peck on the cheek
and a hug. But Bening hadn't come to schmooze with her rep. Despite
the setting, this cocktail party was all about charity.</TE>
<TE>   The Fulfillment Fund, which provides mentors and scholarships for
disadvantaged students, was celebrating its 25th year, and Bening had
just been introduced as its spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The fund appealed to her, she said, because it offers emotional
support and encouragement to those in need. "The Fulfillment Fund is
relationships at work," Bening said. "Someone who's there for you on
the tough days."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, her mentors included her parents and women for whom
she baby-sat. "I had women friends that I looked up to," she said,
"actresses that I wanted to be like."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of students in the mentoring program huddled in the
corner, looking shyly at the bustle surrounding Bening. Nearby,
student Lisandro Gonzales and his mentor, Nelson Handel, chatted with
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, who attends Cal State Monterey, met Handel five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never been to the museum, and he would take me," Lisandro
said, adding that Handel helped with homework and applications for
the business administration degree he now pursues. Today, said
Gonzales, "he's one of my closest friends."</TE>
<TE>   Handel said the idea of becoming a mentor scared him at first. "I
didn't know if I was man enough," he joked. But, the freelance writer
faced his fears and began volunteering. "Imagination is really
powerful," Handel said.</TE>
<TE>   These students "just need a vision of what's possible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sex Does Sell</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a circus at the Barnes &amp; Noble on the Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica on Tuesday night, as Kim Cattrall, of "Sex
and the City,'' signed copies of her book which (not surprisingly)
tackles the subject of sex.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred people stood in a line, snaking around the book
aisles, with some fans waiting several hours. Although the bookstore
had discouraged fans from bringing memorabilia to sign, one man had
sneaked in a mannequin to be autographed. (Cattrall starred in the
1987 Pygmalion comedy "Mannequin.") Other fans had brought 'Star
Trek' posters for her to sign. (Yes, Cattrall did star as Lt. Valeris
in "Star Trek VI.")</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, Cattrall and her husband, Mark Levinson, signed
their new book: "Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm'' (Warner
Books).</TE>
<TE>   Jan Lindstrom, a spokeswoman for the bookstore, said the book was
sold out even before the signing.</TE>

<HD>What a Name-Brand Dropper: This Fiction Reads Like a
Catalog</HD>
<DH>PEN PALS By Olivia Goldsmith; Dutton; 368 pages; $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA MARX</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her earlier books, Olivia Goldsmith has shown what jolly good fun
it is to be a mistreated ex-wife, a mistreated newlywed, a mistreated
mistress and a mistreated author (respectively, "The First Wives
Club," "Young Wives," "Switcheroo" and "The Bestseller"). Now she
writes about the joys of being a mistreated prisoner.</LD>
<LD>   "Pen Pals" is the story of Jennifer Spence, a Wall Street trader
who agrees to take the heat for her boss and stand trial for fraud
and insider trading. She naively believes her lawyer, who is also her
fiance, when he says she will never be convicted. (Goldsmith Rule No.
1: Men are, with a few exceptions, unmitigated jerks. The rule's
corollary: Women are absurdly gullible.)</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer is sent to Jennings Correctional Facility for women, an
institution that reminded me of the overnight camp I went to as a
kid--bad food, communal showers, inspected packages and a lot of fun.
At Jennings she meets a bunch of delightful, spunky, heart-of-gold
women, each with exactly one idiosyncrasy.</LD>
<TE>   This is not a book of complex characterizations. One woman speaks
in sunny cliches; another steals everything in sight. Jennifer
eventually becomes tight with these women, and together they make the
world a better place and reap a few rewards. (Goldsmith Rule No. 2:
Oppressed women always bond with each other, and as a result, every
member of the sisterhood becomes more emotionally realized, not to
mention richer.)</TE>
<TE>   Rule No. 3: Describe people by giving endless inventories of the
products they favor. We know that Jennifer before imprisonment is
arrogant and spoiled because she "loved the Pratesi sheets on her
bed, the silk Kirmans on her floor, and she loved every piece of
Armani, Prada, Gucci and Ferragamo that she kept neatly in her
Biedermeier armoire."</TE>
<TE>   We also know because Goldsmith spells it out for us: "When she'd
been sent to Jennings she had been a selfish, narrow young woman....
Her judgment, her values, her goals and her viewpoints had all been
questionable. Prison had set her free."</TE>
<TE>   Free, but still with a fondness for brand names. As she enters New
York City's Balthazar ("still the hottest restaurant in the city"),
she looks down at her feet. "Her foot," we learn, "was beautifully
covered in the new Otto Tootsie Plohound shoes." (A foot covered in
shoes? Ow!)</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the litany of merchandise in "Pen Pals" makes the book
read like a catalog (an alternate title could be: "Attention,
Shoppers!"). But product-placement writing is tricky. Designed to
lend an au courant air, it often accomplishes the opposite because
what is hot one day is cold the next.</TE>
<TE>   The references to the "overheated market" and Jennifer's condo in
Manhattan's "best" neighborhood, TriBeCa (where, post-Sept. 11, real
estate has become virtually free), make the book seem like a
contemporary historical novel, if there is such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a subtle book. But it is a dramatic story set in an
interesting milieu. And if you are on a plane, you might want to read
it before it comes out as a movie (Tom Wolfe meets Disney).</TE>

<DH>Climbing roses, bearing a bounty of colorful blooms, rise
up and fan out where space is tight.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you've finally run out of room for rose bushes, simply look up
at that tree overhead; or out along a wall or fence. This is where an
increasing number of gardeners are finding places for roses of the
climbing kind.</LD>
<LD>   In Pasadena, Richard Tjoe can look up at a majestic climbing rose
planted against his chimney, or he can look out at it though a
second-story window.</LD>
<LD>   The explosively colored 'Fourth of July,' fanned out on a bare
wall, is the first thing you see driving up to Patrick Anderson's
Fallbrook home. There wasn't enough space in the narrow strip between
house and driveway for even a miniature rose, but there was plenty of
room on the wall. Climbing roses need very little ground in which to
grow.</LD>
<TE>   Gardeners also are discovering that true climbing roses are
tougher and need less care than rose bushes. "I think it's in the
bloodlines," said rose breeder Tom Carruth of Weeks Wholesale Rose
Grower in Upland.</TE>
<TE>   He has developed quite a string of new climbers, including the
wild, award-winning 'Fourth of July' and the only slightly tamer
'Berries 'n' Cream.' His newest climber, introduced this winter, is
'Spice So Nice', which has peachy-pink blooms and a sweet juniper
smell.</TE>
<TE>   True climbers like Carruth's, or other favorites such as 'Joseph's
Coat,' 'Blaze' and 'Don Juan,' have a naturally clambering forebear
in their lineage.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted that climbing roses do not cling like ivy, nor
do they twine like morning glories. They simply make very long stems
that lean on others, needing some kind of support. They use their
sometimes wicked thorns (which often curve backward like the barbs on
fishhooks) to grab and snag unsuspecting branches and unprotected
arms.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, my children, now grown, had to free me from the
vicious thorns of a climbing 'Belle Portugaise' that had me pinned to
the roof like a hide left out to dry. I no longer found her quite so
belle and, in a pique, hacked her to the ground the next day.</TE>
<TE>   But climbing roses are so vigorous, said hybridizer Carruth, that
they "bounce right back" even after being eaten by insects or smitten
by disease. Some, such as the tried-and-true, multicolored 'Joseph's
Coat,' aren't affected by either.</TE>
<TE>   "It has absolutely no problems," according to Del Mar landscape
designer Linda Chisari. She never has to spray--"I think the aphids
are scared of the thorns"--and it blooms and blooms and blooms, with
outrageous flowers colored red, orange and yellow.</TE>
<TE>   A good, modern climber will cycle four or five times each season,
though Chisari thinks that 'Joseph's Coat' is never out of bloom.
Anderson's 'Fourth of July' bloomed all year, even for Christmas, and
a few flowers remain on it now.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of climbers are actually evergreen vines, such as the
deservedly famous Lady Banks'  rose. And though it flowers only once
in spring, the sheets of flowers last for several weeks. A
spectacular one regularly thrills visitors to the historic El Molino
Viejo structure on Old Mill Road in San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Carruth has been working with climbers because he feels that no
other category of roses produces as many "flowers per square inch."
He also thinks that natural, genetic climbers aren't getting the
attention they deserve from breeders. Compared with the hundreds of
recent hybrid tea bushes, there have been only a handful of new
climbers, if you don't count what are called "climbing sports."</TE>
<TE>   Climbing sports, such as 'Climbing Peace' or 'Climbing Queen
Elizabeth,' are mutations of popular rose varieties that tend to
climb. Unfortunately, many of these do not tend to bloom, at least in
California, according to Carruth and others. While 'Queen Elizabeth'
does fine, 'Cl. Queen Elizabeth' seldom flowers.</TE>
<TE>   One big exception is the climbing sport of the popular and
foolproof 'Iceberg,' which never fails to bloom or get rave reviews
from home gardeners and designers such as Chisari, who said, "It's
just so easy." She keeps one trained on the lamppost in her
frontyard, even though it needs a lot of restraint, since it would
like to grow to about 15 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   Garden designer Julie Heinsheimer includes it on her list of
favorites, though it is probably the most ordinary rose she grows on
her 21/2 acres of garden in Rolling Hills, where there's room for new
and old climbers. She favors some old-timers such as her favorite,
'Mme. Alfred Carriere,' which she has used to cleverly disguise a
dead crape myrtle in the middle of her vegetable garden, by training
it up into the exanimate canopy.</TE>
<TE>   In her garden, roses climb many trees. The big single flowers of
'Sally Holmes' burst from an apricot, and there are roses in the
olive trees and on the palms.</TE>
<TE>   Despite my tangle with that 'Belle Portugaise,' climbing roses
still dominate my frontyard. I've found kinds with which I can
coexist, including the lovely noisette named 'Crepescule,' which slow
dances with a small eucalyptus, raining peachy petals onto the
vegetable beds below, and the very restrained 'Dortmund,' which has
grown tidily over my front entry for nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the near-wild, older climbers get quite large, and at this
time of year, pruning them becomes a challenge. "I've never quite
figured out how," admitted Heinsheimer, so she takes a chainsaw
(really) to some, roughly shaping them into big tree shapes. Others
can be pruned more delicately by simply getting rid of a few older
canes while being sure to tie up the new.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mostly a process of shaping," said Carruth, "not pruning."
He adds that you want to encourage as much horizontal growth as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   This is why climbers tend to be so floriferous. Horizontal
branches make more flowers, and climbers have less "apical
dominance," which means that they aren't so obsessed with growing up
and, therefore, make more horizontal flowering stems.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to grow climbers, according to Carruth, is to fan
canes out against a wall or fence. "You'll get the most flowers that
way." You can cover a lot of wall or fence since climbers such as
'Sally Holmes' will easily grow to 37 feet across (from tip to tip)
and even modern climbers, such as 'All Ablaze' or 'Fourth of July,'
will cover an area 10 to 15 feet across. It's not uncommon to see the
entire plant covered with flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Many climbers are available without soil at nurseries during this
January and February bare-root season. So if you can't find space for
another hybrid tea bush, see if there might be a spot for a climbing
kind.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The selection of deciduous fruit trees and grapes and berries is the
greatest now, when they are also sold bare root. When shopping for a
variety of apple, apricot, peach, plum or nectarine, be sure it is
one that will produce fruit in our climate. Many won't in areas with
mild winters.</LD>
<LD>   Prune deciduous trees in your yard now. Apples and apricots need
the least aggressive pruning, just enough to encourage new growth
that will keep fruit coming in the years ahead. Do not prune off the
short branches called spurs, which actually produce the fruit.
Peaches and nectarines need quite a bit of pruning, and plums fall in
between.</LD>
<LD>   After pruning, it's important to apply one of the nonpoisonous
dormant sprays that contain an oil to smother pests and a natural
fungicide to kill diseases. Use fixed copper or lime sulfur sprays on
peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl.</LD>
<TE>   It is one of the best times to plant California natives and
perennials and most trees and shrubs (including camellias coming into
bloom) that won't be harmed by sudden frost. Wait for warmer weather
to plant citrus and bougainvilleas.</TE>

<LD>The Science of Football</LD>
<LD>   Hello, sports fans! This is Coach Tommy Touchdown, here to tell
you all about the science behind the game of football. What's that,
you ask--there's science in football? Yes, more than you think.</LD>
<LD>   For example, what happens when you throw a football? Science
happens. To keep a football moving forward, you need what's called
inertia, the tendency of things that are moving to keep moving, and
of things at rest to remain at rest--like when you're lying on your
couch watching football on TV.</LD>
<TE>   But if all a football did was to coast forward, nobody would be
able to catch it. Luckily, gravity, friction and air resistance help
bend the ball's path into a downward arc toward the Earth, and
hopefully into the hands of a receiver. Touchdown!</TE>
<TE>   Know what else affects the flight of a football? It's all around
us: air. When you throw a football, the nose of the football is
higher than the tail. Gravity pushes the football downward, and the
air responds by pushing upward on the ball. This is called action and
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." That's
Newton's third law of physics, and that's what's happening here. The
upward push partly balances the ball's weight so it falls less
quickly and stays in the air longer.</TE>
<TE>   Whew! Bet you never knew there was so much science in football!
You can learn even more fun science facts about football, basketball,
hockey and figure skating when you watch "The Science of Sports" show
every weekend through February at Discovery Science Center. For more

<LD>Regarding "Book Sparks, in a Word, Controversy" (Jan. 11): [The
n-word] is more than just a word. It is a powerful and useful
linguistic indictment of the evil dehumanization and contempt that
infested the society that coined it.</LD>
<LD>   HAROLD WASHINGTON</LD>
<LD>   Camarillo</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that all the research and soul-searching that goes
into finding some greater meaning of the word is an effort to find
something other than the simple truth, which is: It is absolutely no
different from all the thousands of other nicknames given to each and
every variation of human being on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that separates it is the sensitivity to it, and
that, frankly, has nothing to do with the word itself, but rather
some underlying self-esteem problem. I don't take it personally when
a name is pinned upon my race; why does the black community seem to
do so?</TE>

<LD>In "Mere Real Estate It Is Not" (Jan. 13), hopefully Barry Sloane was
trying to be clever with his comment that "the great unwashed out
there are very happy in their tedious houses that I would slash my
wrists if I had to live in" and is not as elitist as he sounds. I,
along with the majority of Southern Californians who cannot afford to
be one of his clients, thought his remark to be quite insensitive and
wish he could be forced to live out the rest of his days in just such
a place, without sharp instruments.</LD>

<TE>   The "great unwashed" are the everyday people of society who cannot
afford million-dollar homes. People are happy in their "tedious
homes" because they are theirs; they are what they could afford. A
snob like Barry Sloane might want to take that into consideration
before he goes spouting off again. The "great unwashed" can read just
as well as the wealthy!</TE>

<LD>"So Bad It's Good" (Jan. 16) about "outsider music" reminds me of the
Portsmouth Symphonia, whose brief shining moment came in the 1970s in
the United Kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Far and away the worst symphony orchestra ever to have recorded,
its music would fill the concert halls of England with fans. A
full-size orchestra of extremely untalented musicians, they would
attempt bravura pieces such as Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" and
Rossini's "William Tell Overture" at breakneck speed.</LD>
<LD>   I don't know how much they rehearsed, but it wouldn't make any
difference to the quality of their performances. One reviewer noted
that at the end of a piece, the brass section was several bars out of
sync with the rest of the band. They may have been performing from a
genuine love of music, but the audiences loved them for their
delicious awfulness. Even the Taliban would have had a hard time
resisting them.</LD>

<LD>Regarding Sandy Banks' Jan. 15 column ("Inspiring Tears as Well as
Cheers"): I have been on our local school board for 16 years. Many
more parents are concerned at board meetings about cheerleaders than
about math, science or language skills, which may explain why the
latter three are so poorly done. The media coverage for the former,
rather than the latter, contributes to this.</LD>
<LD>   Cheerleading was started so girls would have some activity while
boys had their sports. Now girls have as many sports, so the original
need for cheerleader activities has passed, with their expense, time
and problems.</LD>

<HD>Town Faces Legacy of an Infamous Son</HD>
<DH>A museum exhibit reveals a community's quiet yet enduring
sympathy for Joseph McCarthy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>APPLETON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>His mother doted on him. His older brother bullied him. By 14 he had
his own chicken farm, and by the time he was 19, it had failed. It
wasn't until age 20 that he started high school; classmates voted him
"Most Lovable Man." He was a judge at 30 and a U.S. senator before
40.</LD>
<LD>   Although the early life of Joseph McCarthy was a politician's
dream, he died in 1957 at age 48, felled by hepatitis and liquor and
the certainty of history's harsh judgment. Brandishing a list of
names, he seared himself into the national memory with his zealous
investigations of communist penetration of the government. Those
probes failed, and McCarthy lives on today as an epithet, a synonym
for reckless attacks and dishonest smears. Here, in his hometown,
even his name seemed forgotten, so rarely was it uttered.</LD>
<LD>   McCarthy goes unmentioned in local tourist guides, which dwell
instead on Harry Houdini and Edna Ferber, even though they spent most
of their lives far from Wisconsin. No buildings or bridges are named
for McCarthy. No signs mark the farmhouse where he was born and
raised. Nor is the cemetery where he is buried listed in the phone
book.</LD>
<TE>   But this year, for the first time, the town is facing the legacy
of its most infamous native son head-on. In the first comprehensive
museum exhibit on his life anywhere, McCarthy, the last major
American politician born in a log cabin, is being revived not just as
a historical villain but as the star of a classic bootstraps-up tale.</TE>
<TE>   "Joseph McCarthy: A Modern Tragedy," which opened to the public
Saturday at the Outagamie Museum in this town of 70,000, has
attracted considerable attention. The local newspaper has assigned a
reporter to produce a series of stories on McCarthy's life and the
new exhibit. Groups of McCarthy defenders have raised their profiles.
Politicians, long wary of invoking McCarthy, discuss him publicly.
America's McCarthy scholars, nearly all of whom have advised the
exhibit's curator, are looking anew at the senator's roots.</TE>
<TE>   In raising McCarthy's profile, the exhibit has revealed that, far
from being forgotten by his hometown, McCarthy remains the object of
quiet but enduring sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a coming-out party for McCarthy. Before this in
Appleton, it was almost as if the guy never existed," said Jerald
Podair, a historian at Lawrence University here. "In Appleton, it's
one of the most relevant exhibits that's ever been put on. And you
learn that if he had been just a regular senator, he'd be an American
success story."</TE>
<TE>   In making that case, the exhibit is cautious. There is a warning
posted at the door ("This exhibit includes strong language and
discussions which some viewers might find disturbing"--a reference to
the subject and a few coarse words in museum quotes.) And the
curators have included a bulletin board to give visitors a chance to
air complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The overall presentation is so evenhanded it may upset those who
see McCarthy as an irredeemably evil figure. While taking note of
what it calls McCarthy's "reckless" behavior and "character flaws,"
it emphasizes that his anti-communist crusades were grounded in the
Cold War fears fanned by communist victories in China and Korea. And
the exhibit texts invoke post-Sept. 11 concerns in appealing for
understanding of the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again Americans are weighing issues of national security and
individual rights," said Kim Louagie, the Outagamie Museum curator
who first conceived the exhibit three years ago. "McCarthy wrestled
with the same issues."</TE>
<TE>   But while texts, pictures and an audiotape from his investigations
are on display, the balance of the exhibit is devoted to humanizing a
man who has been demonized for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "They have made this exhibit into a personal tragedy about his
life rather than a national tragedy about politics, and that is
probably about right," said David Oshinsky, a Rutgers University
professor and author of the 1983 biography "A Conspiracy So Immense:
The World of Joe McCarthy." "His was a story of a local boy who hit
the national scene--and really screwed up."</TE>
<TE>   "I think this exhibit will make it easier to talk about him," said
Sally Mielke, chairwoman of the Outagamie County Board of
Supervisors. Her husband had met McCarthy. "I don't think you can
simply say he was just evil--no one who knew him believes that. I
think he had a touch of truth but went too far. Since 9/11, people
are remembering we have to be watchful, even paranoid. And like
McCarthy did, we all have to decide for ourselves how far we should
go to protect the country."</TE>
<TE>   Joe McCarthy usually made a good first impression. Cody Splitt,
now a county supervisor in Appleton, remembers watching him descend a
staircase at a hotel in Madison during his 1946 Senate campaign.
Broad-shouldered and handsome, he was the only man in the room not
wearing a tie. Impressed, Splitt, then a law student at the
University of Wisconsin, befriended him and volunteered in the
campaign, handing out matchbooks with McCarthy's name.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a charming Irishman," said Splitt. "People think his
appeal was anti-communism, but that's not why anyone voted for him.
He could talk to the common man because he was one of them."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit makes that appeal clear. On display are blown-up
family pictures and a wood slab from the granary into which McCarthy
carved his initials at age 13. His boxing gloves from his Marquette
University team are here. Letters from his high school principal
marvel at the drive of a young man who managed to complete four years
of study in one. "Joe was the irresistible force who overcame the
immovable object," the principal wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, however, does not hesitate to point out McCarthy's
many lies. There are "McCarthy for Judge" postcards that he used in a
successful campaign to unseat an aging incumbent; McCarthy told
voters his 66-year-old opponent was 73. The exhibit also includes a
medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, that McCarthy got by
exaggerating his combat experience, and a letter of recommendation he
solicited from Adm. Chester Nimitz under a forged signature. Nearby
is his military trunk and the helmet he wore for pictures showing him
in the back of a plane. "Tailgunner Joe" became his nickname, even
though he was an intelligence officer.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit offers few artifacts from McCarthy's career in
Washington. There are books, correspondence and a brush (given to him
by a brush company owner who wanted communists swept away), but
little else.</TE>
<TE>   One exhibit room is devoted to the 1954 nationally televised
hearings on McCarthy's charges that the Army was protecting communist
sympathizers. The Army--through its hired lawyer, Joe
Welch--counterattacked and exposed McCarthy's cruel tactics, famously
asking, "Have you no decency, sir?" The room notes McCarthy's
subsequent censure by his colleagues in 1954, the end of his
political relevance. But it feels sparse next to the clutter of the
biographical displays.</TE>
<TE>   After the senator died, some 30,000 people filed through St.
Mary's Catholic Church here to view the body. The mayor asked public
offices, schools and businesses to close. Most did.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph shows residents of the nearby town of Little Chute
lined up five deep along the road to watch McCarthy's funeral
procession. There is a reprint of a Wisconsin State Senate resolution
praising McCarthy, and an excerpt from a pastor's speech at his
memorial service: "McCarthy saw danger to his country and clothed in
the shining armor of zeal and love and holding within his hands the
sword of truth marched forward into battle with the cry of his lips."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Kornely, the son of McCarthy's sister Olive, was 12 when his
Uncle Joe died. His family, never close, didn't talk much about its
famous kinsman, and Appleton's schools and libraries offered little.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after his death, Outagamie County dedicated a 250-pound
bronze bust of McCarthy, rendered at twice life size, in the lobby of
its courthouse downtown. The bust was the first and last public
monument to McCarthy. Six years ago, Lawrence University tried to put
together a symposium on McCarthy but couldn't find a donor to sponsor
it.</TE>
<TE>   "People here hate controversy, so no one would bring him up," said
Cliff Sanderfoot, a longtime member of the county board.</TE>
<TE>   There were minor exceptions. Leftists tracked down McCarthy's
grave, on a bluff above the Fox River, just to dance on it. A group
of McCarthy supporters based in Milwaukee, known as the McCarthy
Educational Foundation, began holding an annual memorial service at
his grave each May. Between 40 and 100 people attend. A Jesuit
priest, Cletus Healy, says the rosary on the dead senator's behalf,
and the group adjourns to a nearby restaurant for dinner and
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a martyr," said Earl Denny, a retired salesman who is the
foundation's soft-spoken leader. The group sends McCarthy's books to
university libraries, campaigns for a Joe McCarthy national monument
and demands an investigation into his death. (They suggest he was
murdered.) "Joe McCarthy gave his life for the truth," said Healy,
84, who runs a Catholic bookstore in a Milwaukee suburb.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1980s, the desire to forget McCarthy had grown to the
point that some politicians tried to have the courthouse bust
removed. But the removal efforts--in 1986 and 1991--attracted
unwanted publicity for the town and were quickly voted down.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the Cold War sparked new scholarship regarding
McCarthy. Declassified American intelligence cables and Soviet files
made clear the degree to which communists had penetrated the U.S.
government after World War II. Some scholars have argued that
McCarthy might have been right about communist penetration, even if
his specific charges were wrong and his tactics despicable.</TE>
<TE>   But this renewed interest in McCarthy drew little notice in his
hometown. One by one, McCarthy's personal ties to Appleton eroded.
Friends and contemporaries died. His daughter, adopted in 1957
shortly before his death, reportedly lives in the Washington, D.C.,
area. (She did not respond to entreaties from the museum.) His wife
and his siblings are dead. Kornely, the senator's nephew, believes he
is the closest living relative in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Kornely, though uncomfortable with the subject of his uncle,
thinks historians have been too hard on McCarthy, and he sees the
term "McCarthyism" as a slur against his hard-working family. But he
is no fan of McCarthy's right-wing defenders either.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a human being--no saint and no sinner," said Kornely,
president of an insurance agency here. "He achieved a lot. And he did
a number of things wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Kornely attended a Rotary Club luncheon where the
speaker was Louagie, curator of Outagamie Museum. Raised and educated
in Canada, Louagie decided shortly after she arrived in Appleton in
1999 that she would curate a McCarthy exhibit. And she was undeterred
by the local aversion to discussing McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   Kornely, who was impressed by Louagie's commitment, invited her to
his home. Soon Kornely was digging family pictures and his uncle's
military trunk out of the basement.</TE>
<TE>   Louagie persuaded the county board to donate the heroically sized
McCarthy bust, which she planned to use as the exhibit's centerpiece.
Anticipation grew. The local newspaper, the Post-Crescent, ran daily
stories, examining nearly every piece of the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, recognizing the publicity bonanza, won't stop with
just an exhibit, which runs through January 2004. There is a virtual
tour of the McCarthy displays on the Internet at www.foxvalleyhisto
ry.org/mccarthy.</TE>
<TE>   The Outagamie County Historical Society is also planning a
McCarthy film series showing "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and
other movies born of the McCarthy period. And it is organizing a
McCarthy book club to read texts that McCarthy attacked, such as
Dashiell Hammett's "Red Harvest" and Lillian Hellman's "Scoundrel
Time."</TE>
<TE>   A preview on Friday night attracted nearly 100 people, who sipped
wine and snacked on hors d'oeuvres as they viewed the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd included local politicians, historians and several
people who, like County Supervisor Splitt, had met McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   "It showed him in his complexity," said Podair, the Lawrence
University scholar, approvingly. "And he obviously was a complex
guy."</TE>

<DH>Rug designers say they find a creative outlet in blending
patterns, colors and textures into a stunning array of artworks
suitable for display on floors or wall spaces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Area rugs let you put the best art in the house on the floor. At
least, that's the opinion of Los Angeles interior designer Mark Enos,
who uses them extensively. Since many houses today have wood floors
or other hard surfaces, plush rugs provide much-needed soft oases.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, they create a focus and give a space an intimacy. They're
something to gather around," Enos says.</LD>
<LD>   Two L.A.-based rug designers, Denis Colomb and Shari Cornish, are
making artworks for the floor. Colomb was inspired by the Arts and
Crafts movement; his geometric designs use squares and circles as
well as wide bands of color.</LD>
<TE>   "I like the ancestral idea of carrying on a tradition, but I add
my own palette of colors," says Colomb. "I'm very inspired by Asia,
which is one reason why I like to live here. Here we face Asia, while
in New York we faced Europe. I think that makes for an interesting
cross-culture look. But, no matter what I design, I always look for
balance. I started my first rug collection in 1996, in felt," says
Colomb, who moved here just over a year ago from New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, in 1998, I started working with Tibetan weavers in Nepal,
who took my felt designs and turned them into hand-woven wool rugs.
Today all my rugs are made in Nepal of 100% wool."</TE>
<TE>   Colomb's first rug, "Neptune," done in 1998, used the blue-gray
color of his Burmese cat, for which it is named. Other early rugs,
with names like "Manhattan" and "Paris," have palettes of dark blue,
gray, beige, black and cream.</TE>
<TE>   Some have bold stripes of color, others are Zen-like, with cream
circles encased in cream squares in an ocean of chocolate. Circles
sometimes refer to Paris' Tuileries Gardens; curved lines symbolize
energy, and stripes evoke skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I moved here my colors have changed," Colomb says. "I now
use strawberry, terra cotta, more cream. Although those colors had
already been in my mind, since I found them in India and Nepal too,"
he says. His rugs' names have changed too. Now there's "Los Angeles"
(little black zigzags on beige and cream), "Sausalito" (cream to pale
loden green) and "Milan" (strawberry, coral and persimmon).</TE>
<TE>   Hand-knotted rugs are the latest creations from Colomb, who was
born in Aix-en-Provence, France, and graduated from the Superior
Architecture and Design Institute in Milan with a degree in
architecture. In 1992, he won the European IDI design award for his
architectural design of the Tehen fashion stores in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "My designs are very simple and modern, and they go well in
contemporary rooms," he says. They're also very architectural, with
geometric shapes. Colomb produces two new designs every six months;
right now he's interpreting the tiger with brightly striped rugs.
Fifty percent of his work is custom, and his rugs showing up
regularly in home design magazines, usually to complement large
abstract artworks on white walls.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $1,600 for a small rug to $5,800 for a larger
one. They may be seen at Arden House, 920 N. La Cienega, Los Angeles.

<TE>   Shari Cornish focused on surface designs for the floor when she
was at art school, designing floor cloths on felt. "I started by
making floor cloths out of industrial felt," says Cornish, who
graduated in 1988 from the Kansas City Art Institute. "Traditional
floor cloths are made from stretched canvas, which is then painted
and varnished, a tradition that goes way back before the Civil War in
America."</TE>
<TE>   Although her pieces were meant for the floor, all the works she
sold ended up as paintings on walls. "That's partly why I started
doing rugs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   All of Cornish's rugs are based on her painted floor cloths,
although they can be customized. They are brightly colored and
playful, with just a touch of humor. "Pie &amp; Coffee" has dots, cups,
triangles and curves in coffee and black colors; "Auntie's Apron,"
her first rug, uses blues, pinks and gray-green. "Pages of Envy" is
green, while "Fall Back" has autumn-colored leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Cornish has always loved rugs, and early in her career earned
money conserving antique Persian rugs. "I love the lushness of
carpets," she says. "When I decided to go into area rugs in 1999, I
searched to find weavers who could translate my designs into rugs,
because I didn't have the time to weave them myself. I also wanted to
make sure that they made a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I didn't have the money to travel all over the world
looking for weavers, I finally found a firm in New Jersey, through
word of mouth. It's a family business, and I send them the designs
and they hand weave them from 100% New Zealand wool." The rugs are
made in a commercial grade, most of them cut pile, although she has
designed a few shag rugs; they retail for around $60 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   Cornish's rugs and floor cloths can be seen through March 9 at the
Gallery of Functional Art through at Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan
Ave., E-3, Santa Monica. (310) 829-6990. They are also available on
the Web at www. homeportfolio.com.</TE>

<HD>Choosing a Wall Color? These Experts' Feelings Are Neutral</HD>
<DH>You want white. But decide if you mean 'stone, 'milk,'
'dove,' 'bone' or 'cameo.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY SELBY</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I spent days deciding what color to paint the walls of our living
room. I held paint chips up to the light and against the wall and
near the sofa. I debated with my husband the relative merits of
various hues. I argued about this shade and that.</LD>
<LD>   I chose white.</LD>
<LD>   The walls are what the paint manufacturer calls "oyster" white.
The ceiling? "Shell." I considered but rejected "dove," "ivory,"
"milk," "stone" and "moon" whites. I was tempted by "bone," but it
seemed macabre. I liked "china" white by the light of the moon, but
not the morning after. "Design-studio" just wasn't me.</LD>
<TE>   A friend in the midst of redecorating a house came for dinner not
long ago and fell in love with our whites. Could she copy them, she
asked somewhat sheepishly. Would we mind?</TE>
<TE>   I'd be flattered, I answered. Soon after that I was approached by
a neighbor who wondered if she could look at our walls. She was
redecorating, she explained, and she'd heard about our whites.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have guessed that white could be so complex, so
demanding? On the surface, it seems innocent, virginal, pure as the
driven snow. But it arrives weighed down with baggage and fraught
with meaning. Think white supremacy. Brides. Communion hosts. Angel
wings. Clerical collars. In some cultures, white is a symbol of joy
or spirituality. In others it is a sign of mourning. White hats are
good guys, white knights may carry you off on their horses and the
White Sox are going nowhere soon. What about White Russians? Or the
Beatles' "White" album, white elephant, white sale, white noise?</TE>
<TE>   Glen Bossard, assistant manager at the Stebbins Anderson store in
Towson, Md., knows the nuances of white through his experience with
paint. "People come in and say, 'Oh, we'd just like a nice
off-white.' I say: 'I've got about a hundred.'"</TE>
<TE>   From the paint manufacturer Benjamin Moore's line of ready-mixed
interior paints, Bossard can offer you "antique," "bone," "simply,"
"timid," "linen," "winter," "mirage," "china," "dove," "cameo,"
"moonstone," "atrium" or "Navajo" white.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate test is to take a quart of paint home and paint your
wall," Bossard says. "I've had people go through five or six cans of
off-white. I've had people spend months on white. I've had people who
just can't make up their minds about white. All they can say is,
'This just doesn't look right.'"</TE>
<TE>   In the contemporary art world, curators swear by the notion of the
"white cube." The less visual interference between viewer and art,
they argue, the better. The more abstract the art, the more important
it is to have a neutral background.</TE>
<TE>   That explains why so many contemporary art galleries sport
all-white walls and neutral ceilings and floors. It does not explain
why Baltimore Museum of Art curator Helen Molesworth has spent hours
in recent weeks trying to decide what color white to paint the
galleries before installing her contemporary art exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "All whites are different, and all spaces need different whites,"
Molesworth says. Lighting, too, plays a role. "White is vexing."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, to prepare for "Body- space," a show of art informed by
minimalism, Molesworth examined pages of paint samples. She thought
about the kind of art included in the show. She considered the size
and shape of the galleries. She considered the lighting. She
eliminated dozens of whites until she chose "country-stove white."</TE>
<TE>   This year, to prepare for an exhibit titled "Looking
Forward/Looking Black," an examination of racial and gender
stereotypes in America that opens Feb. 6, she simplified her
technique.</TE>
<TE>   She chose the white wall labels she wanted to use, took them to a
paint manufacturer and said: "Match this, please."</TE>
<TE>   White isn't really a color but the combination of them all. "The
color that we see is determined by wavelengths of light hitting an
object, some being absorbed and some being reflected. When all the
wavelengths are absorbed, the surface appears black; when all are
reflected, we see white," said Catherine Behrent, a professor at the
Maryland Institute College of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the beauty and intrigue of white. It can be as dull
as chalk and as reflective as snow; as warm as a mother's milk and as
icy as an avalanche. In Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick," a white whale
is Captain Ahab's obsession. In Robert Frost's sonnet "Design," white
stands for purity and disease. In children's storybooks, Snow White
awaits her prince.</TE>
<TE>   Painters long have wrestled with the problem of white. White
paint, made with lead, nearly blinded 18th century still-life painter
Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin. In 1749, French painter Jean-Baptiste
Oudry lectured on the difficulties of painting white on white.</TE>
<TE>   Oudry was known primarily as a painter of animals, says Eik Kahng,
associate curator of 18th and 19th century European art at the
Walters Art Museum. In "The White Duck," he depicts a duck lying
against a crumpled white tablecloth with a white jar and a white
candlestick. The 1753 work is considered a masterpiece in which the
artist conquers the problem of painting white on white.</TE>
<TE>   "Oudry is a great painter," Kahng says, adding, "you can't do a
better duck."</TE>
<TE>   In 1918, avant-garde painter Kasimir Malevich produced a series of
"White on White" paintings. He was grappling with the demands of a
post-revolutionary world, Molesworth says. "There was a sense of
extraordinary possibilities and that the old way of making paintings
wasn't in keeping with the revolution. There was a desire to make a
new, pure, clean, transcendent image for the utterly new, modern
world."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, many artists, including Agnes Martin, Robert Ryman and
Robert Erwin, have created paintings or installations that explore
white or nearly all white. French playwright Yasmina Reza in 1998
wrote "Art," a play about the evolution of a friendship between three
men after one buys an all-white painting.</TE>
<TE>   Not all artists are inspired by white, of course. One, a painter
and professor of art at Hollins University in Roanoke, Va., remains
entirely unconvinced of its merits.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never understood the fascination. I rarely use white in my
painting, rarely straight from the tube. I use color to suggest
white, glowing colors and halftones and shadows," he says. "And my
wife and I agonized over our living room walls. We finally settled on
a beautiful color, a chameleon color: gray. Much better than white."</TE>
<TE>   Who is this man? Professor Bill White, of course.</TE>

<HD>More Cool Quarters</HD>

<LD>The North Carolina State Quarter</LD>
<LD>   The second quarter in the 2001 series is that of North Carolina,
which became the nation's 12th state on Nov. 21, 1789. The quarter
represents Orville and Wilbur Wright, brothers from Ohio who tested
their homemade airplane on a windy strip of land in Kitty Hawk, N.C.,
on Dec. 17, 1903. Soaring in the air for 12 seconds and 120 feet, the
brothers made history. The design on the coin is taken from a picture
snapped with Orville Wright's camera by a man named J.T. Daniels, one

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON--Two great British institutions celebrate special
anniversaries this year. One is respected the world over, is highly
regarded particularly in America and during the course of a turbulent
century has successfully kept both its integrity and reputation as
the exemplar of the highest standards. The other is the monarchy.</LD>
<LD>   The Times Literary Supplement--known universally as the TLS--is a
hundred years old this month. From its first densely printed,
eight-page edition of Jan. 17, 1902, to its special bumper 48-page
centenary issue currently on  newsstands, it has carved out a unique
position in the world of papers and journals as the reviewer of all
that is best and most important in new books, from novels and poetry
to academic studies and biographies.</LD>
<LD>   Even people who don't read books often read book reviews, and
sections devoted to them in daily newspapers, magazines and even on
the Internet have expanded and proliferated. But when it comes to
critical credibility, the cachet of a good review in the TLS remains
unsurpassed. Despite a relatively small circulation of just under
40,000--with nearly half of that comprising American readers--it is
still considered the most influential English-language critical
journal in the world, remaining for a century at the center of
intellectual and cultural life.</LD>
<TE>   So, even as Queen Elizabeth marks her 50th year as monarch,  the
TLS celebrates its own milestone by launching a poetry competition
and London's National Portrait Gallery presents an  exhibit depicting
portraits of famous figures who have reviewed for the paper
throughout the years. A major history by Derwent May, "Critical
Times: The History of the Times Literary Supplement," has been
published, and, in honor of the supplement, a Round Table Literary
Debate was scheduled this month at New York's famous hotel of men and
women of letters, the Algonquin.</TE>
<TE>   That location is fitting, for in some respects, the TLS is now
something of an Anglo-American journal. "In the early years," says
May, "there was a resentful feeling in the U.S. academic world that
British reviewers were a bit haughty about American scholarship." The
paper argued that it was applying evenhanded standards; even so, by
the '50s there was certainly a fresh attempt to get the paper read in
America, in line with the growing interest in American writing. In
fact, American academic work became so powerful and important that
the TLS found itself including more and more U.S. material. Now,
American books, and reviewers, are just as prominent as British ones.</TE>
<TE>   Originally published with the Times of London at a time when the
practice of reviewing new books was becoming increasingly popular,
the TLS was first sold separately (for the princely sum of a penny)
in 1914. Since then it has remained autonomous, with virtually no
link to its  parent paper other than common ownership, a situation
that remains today. Its ultimate proprietor is Rupert Murdoch, and it
operates out of the News Corp. complex in the district of Wapping,
just east of the famous Tower Bridge in London.</TE>
<TE>   Its modern offices give little immediate clues to its illustrious
history, for a list of the writers and critics who have contributed
to the TLS reads like a  roll call of the greats of 20th century
literature. T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Gore Vidal, Anthony Burgess,
Salman Rushdie, George Steiner and Martin Amis are among the hundreds
who have been featured as reviewers in its pages and contributed to
its debates.</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, Eliot wrote to his mother saying that he'd been invited
to write for the Lit Sup (as it was then nicknamed) and that "this is
the highest honor possible in the critical world of literature." In
the past 30 years it has been joined by similar publications, most
notably the esteemed New York Review of Books, but the position it
occupies between the literary and academic worlds, and the fact that
it reviews so many books each week--about 60 each issue--are what
make it unique.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only journal of high culture that I know of," says
Richard Sennett, an American and a professor at the London School of
Economics, and a frequent contributor of 25 years' standing. "The
others, such as the New York Review, are different animals. That
makes its survival extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   That survival is due in no small part to a continuing sense of
purpose and identity. "It's kept a very even keel--a steady,
thoughtful, conscientious survey of books in all fields," says May.
It doesn't pretend to create bestsellers--that is not really its
point. "The TLS doesn't have that colossal an impact on the general
reading public," says May, "but it has an impact on people who are
interested in literature."</TE>
<TE>   The trickle-down effect of this, along with its discussion of
intellectual issues of the day, such as the decline of literary
theory, multiculturalism and the death of Marxism, is, of course,
all-important in determining the general cultural atmosphere. In this
postmodern age of instant gratification, dumbing-down and
attention-deficit disorder, qualities of thoroughness, steadiness and
conscientiousness might seem quaint, dusty even. But they are also
the characteristics that produce a singular authority, one that has
remained remarkably intact.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to our stuffy reputation," says Ferdinand Mount, the
paper's editor for the last decade, "we've always had a lot of young
reviewers--people tend to start really quite young."  There are
something like 3,000 reviewers on the TLS database (although, jokes
Mount, some of these are probably dead, and some mad), and reviews
are anywhere from 400 to 3,000 words long. Writers must be invited to
review for the paper--as is the practice at many publications,
unsolicited  reviews are not especially welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a cunning little art form," says Mount. "You really
are engaging in a conversation with the author of the book."
Intelligence and a certain modesty are required, he says, to do it
well. How can he tell whether a new reviewer has what it takes? "It's
whether they can produce an article with a beginning, middle and an
end, and a convincing argument running through it, and whether they
are capable of enlivening what they write with the odd flash of wit,
or sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   You can tell very quickly it seems, whether someone can do the
job. "People can get better with practice," he says, "but you've got
a fairly good idea." Reviewing for the paper would always be a labor
of love--it's the prestige that counts, as it pays only about 100
pounds per thousand words or roughly $70. In the early days, Woolf
would have received around 2 or 3 pounds for her efforts, when a
special ruler calibrated in pounds and pennies was literally placed
on each article to gauge payment by column inches. "Nobody ever got
rich writing for the TLS," says Mount.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of the cult of personality, it's interesting to
consider that all the pieces in the TLS were, until 1974, anonymous.
Reviews and essays appeared without bylines as a common practice, and
it has only been with the publication of May's book that the
identities of the authors of more than 50 years of articles have been
made public. Bylines were not included because, says May, "there was
the feeling then that this was the voice of all reasonable, educated
men. This was the voice of truth, as it were. There was the general
sense of sharing the same 'civilized' values."</TE>
<TE>   As times and philosophies changed, the notion that anybody could
claim to speak with such implied impartiality became  unfashionable.
There was the feeling that people should stand up for their opinions
and that such monolithic truth didn't exist. Author Edmund White, who
has written over the years for the TLS and who contributed an article
on George Eliot for the centenary issue, is resolute that he wouldn't
have reviewed for the paper during the "anonymous" era. "The reviews
were much more poisonous when they were unsigned," he says. "There is
no such thing as objectivity." Now, who is writing about what is
blazoned across the cover--in today's celebrity culture, no doubt a
good commercial impulse as well.</TE>
<TE>   But where does the TLS stand in a world where, it is often said,
reading is going out of fashion? "I can see the TLS being there even
in a world of mass illiteracy, which I don't think we're destined for
anyway," says May.  As long as there are people who take books and
literature seriously, the TLS will thrive. Film, music and drama
criticism may not be what it was, but the quality of literary
criticism has remained high. "People want books to be good," says
May.</TE>
<TE>   Although reading may appear  passive, it is actually an active
pursuit. "You can sit and watch a film and have all sorts of
emotional responses and at the end not really know what you've seen,"
says May. "You can't really read a book and not know what you've
read. You can't read a book with glazed eyes."</TE>

<HD>White to Lighten Us Up</HD>
<DH>The cheery suits are coming back, possibly to give us a
collective boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>When times are dark, the world wears white--and somehow the old is
made new again.</LD>
<LD>   Judging from the latest fashion shows, the bright white suit may
emerge to be the hottest fashion statement for men and women this
spring, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   The new look may also serve as a boost to the collective dark mood
following the hijack attacks on U.S. landmarks Sept. 11 and the
subsequent war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The current crop of white suits provides a more comfy silhouette,
a no-brainer choice for evening wear and an irreverent, happy twist
on the lean, dark suits of the recent past, trend-watchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Designers such as Hugo Boss, Dolce and Gabbana, Calvin Klein,
Gucci, Viktor and Rolf and Giorgio Armani all show white suits in
their 2002 spring collections.</TE>
<TE>   Show business personalities such as "Girl, Interrupted" star
Angelina Jolie, rapper impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, pop diva
Christina Aguilera and actress Leelee Sobieski have all recently been
photographed in white suits.</TE>
<TE>   Historians say that white outfits have sometimes emerged following
times of darkness. At the turn of the last century, American novelist
Mark Twain caused a furor not only for writing his racially charged
novel "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," but also for donning a
white suit in the middle of a dark, depressing winter, according to a
new PBS documentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Twain," directed by Ken Burns, reveals that in the early
1900s, Twain, reeling from crushing debt and the death of his wife
and children, took to parading around Manhattan in scarlet socks and
a snow-white flannel suit.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why he was wearing the unseasonable color, Twain said:
"What can be more depressing than the somber black which custom
requires men to wear--a group of men in evening clothes looks like a
flock of crows, and is just as inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   "He was looking for something bright and uplifting, a statement
that brought happiness, that was in stark contrast to some difficult
times," said Burns. "In fact, he called his white suit the
'dontcareadam' suit."</TE>
<TE>   Twain caused quite a stir that season with his new choice of
threads. As reported by the New York Herald in 1907, "News of the
style spread rapidly among builders of clothes. Several of them were
glad to know he had the courage to break away from the only wear for
men after 6 o'clock in the evening."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, other famous people have raised their profiles and the
public spirit with white suits. Against a backdrop of the cynical
post-Vietnam and Watergate-era 1970s, Bianca Jagger wore a white suit
to her wedding to rocker Mick, John Lennon wore a white suit in his
famous "Imagine" video, and John Travolta popularized a white suit in
the film "Saturday Night Fever."</TE>
<TE>   Though most of the new white suits were designed before Sept. 11,
white suits are perfect for the current climate, said W magazine
executive editor Bridget Foley.</TE>
<TE>   "White can be so innocent, so gentle....When put in context of
suit, it becomes something else. It attains power, strength, bravado.
It's a way to play to something new  ... and still have a strong
sensibility. It's a way to put a new spin on tailoring."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe a new spin on our lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will take," Foley said. "There's a certain
impracticality that makes it alluring. It's a great new alternative
evening look. It's a great Hollywood look, it's a great way to look
without being fussied up. It's a great way to show off."</TE>

<BD>Hussein Ibish is communications director of the

<DL></DL>
<LD>The appalling spasm of violence between Israel and the Palestinians
over the past few days is almost certainly the precursor of worse--in
all likelihood far worse--to come. What is all the more tragic and
depressing than the grim future ahead is that this mayhem was
deliberately provoked by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   From mid-December to early January, following a speech by
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat that called for an end
to all attacks on Israeli civilians and a return to the negotiating
table, Palestinians enforced a unilateral cease-fire at the expense
of unity. Opposition leaders were jailed and several Palestinians
were killed in protests against the crackdown.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's government reciprocated by increasing its attacks and by
engaging in a series of provocations and humiliations against the
Palestinians. During this period, more than 30 Palestinians were
killed, at least 10 of them children. Little recognition was given to
the steps the Palestinian Authority had unilaterally taken to reduce
violence, let alone its efforts to resume negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon responded to this window of opportunity by placing Arafat
under virtual house arrest in Ramallah and refusing to allow him to
attend Christmas Mass in Bethlehem. The message was clear: All
Palestinians, Arafat included, and all Palestinian towns, Bethlehem
included, will remain objects of Israeli power.</TE>
<TE>   The window of opportunity that opened during this period was
finally slammed shut on Jan. 14 by Israel's assassination of Raed
Karmi, leader of a West Bank militia.</TE>
<TE>   That murder, which set in motion the most recent round of
violence, was a deliberate attempt to escalate the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon knows that his political future depends on the continuation
and intensification of violence, that he remains the panic candidate
for Israelis overwhelmed by anxiety and anger. Worse, his right-wing
government seems to genuinely feel that a military victory against
the Palestinians is not only possible but imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, Sharon's policies have led to less, not more, security
for Israelis and more intense, not reduced, Palestinian resistance.</TE>
<TE>   As this war escalates, it becomes ever more brutal. The attack on
an Israeli bat mitzvah in Hadera was particularly horrifying and
appears to have been a direct response to the murder of Karmi.
Meanwhile, Israel demolished scores of homes--leaving hundreds of
Palestinians homeless--and bombed Palestinian radio and television
facilities. Israel's takeover of the Palestinian town of Tulkarem and
its assassination of four Hamas members Tuesday, including a leading
figure in the movement, makes a massive retaliation inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Apologists for Israel claim that there is "no moral equivalency"
between Israeli and Palestinian violence in this conflict, in spite
of the fact that more than 270 Israelis and almost 1,000 Palestinians
have been killed over the past 16 months. They say Palestinians
target Israeli civilians, while the Palestinian civilian deaths were
somehow accidentally or unintentionally caused by Israeli troops. Yet
every human rights group that has cared to investigate has found that
Israeli forces have routinely used excessive and arbitrary force.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that both sides are attacking each other's civilians
with all means at their disposal. Israel has even turned F-16 jets,
Apache helicopters and tanks against Palestinian civilian targets.
Palestinian radicals turn themselves into human bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are stopping at nothing to enforce their occupation,
while Palestinians have been unwilling to set limits as to what is
permissible in the pursuit of freedom. Anyone searching for morality
in this equation is kidding themselves.</TE>

<HD>GOP Candidates Fumble the Opportunity to Bench Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN SCHNUR</AU>
<BD>Dan Schnur was communications director for former Gov.
Pete Wilson. Last summer, he also advised Richard Riordan's
gubernatorial exploratory committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If November's gubernatorial election is the World Series of
California politics, then Tuesday night's Republican primary debate
was only the beginning of spring training.</LD>
<LD>   The scouting report contains both good and bad news.</LD>
<LD>   All three candidates showed flashes of the potential needed to
knock off the defending champion, but each also demonstrated that
he'll need a lot of practice time if his confrontation with Gray
Davis is going to be a true fall classic.</LD>
<TE>   First the good news. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
California Secretary of State Bill Jones and businessman Bill Simon
each accomplished his objectives for the debate. Riordan presented
himself as a nonpartisan problem-solver, Jones showed his credentials
as the most experienced politician and Simon came across as the
conservative activist.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan clearly believes that the center of the party can bring
him the nomination, while Jones and Simon elbow for advantage among
the conservatives who represent the GOP base.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the best of the three men into one candidate and the GOP
would have an ideal nominee: an experienced officeholder with
mainstream appeal who can motivate conservative voters. Failing that
unlikely scenario, each of the three is gambling that his persona can
appeal to the portion of the Republican electorate that he'll need to
carry the primary.</TE>
<TE>   All three candidates effectively took on the shortcomings in
Davis' record, bashing the incumbent governor for his failures on
education, energy and the economy. Davis is not a difficult target:
California has a $12-billion budget deficit, a continuing energy
crisis made worse by Davis' unwillingness to act more quickly and
student test scores that rank among the lowest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But despite Davis' obvious vulnerabilities on the issues and his
continued slippage in public opinion polls, this governor is no
pushover. The combination of a $35-million war chest and a
ruthlessness that would allow him to wrestle his own grandmother on
broken glass if his donors requested it make him an extremely
formidable foe.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the bad news in the scouting report. Tuesday's debate
contained many moments in which the three men showed how much
progress each must make if he is to be ready for this challenge.</TE>
<TE>   One such moment was when the candidates were asked about campaign
contributions from Enron Corp. Taking on Enron these days requires
only slightly more political courage than criticizing Al Qaeda, so
the question should have been a fastball right down the middle that
could have been hit out of the park. But the three Republicans didn't
even take a swing.</TE>
<TE>   On a day in which Enron employees admitted to shredding financial
records after the bankruptcy declaration and President Bush issued
strong criticism against the fallen energy giant, the candidates were
oddly reticent. Jones and Simon warned about prematurely jumping to
conclusions against Enron. Riordan promised to return any
contributions he received from the bankrupt company. None of them
spoke out against the corporation's excesses and alleged
illegalities.</TE>
<TE>   None of them drew the parallels between Enron's access in
Washington and the incestuous relationship that the Davis
administration developed with Southern California Edison at the
depths of the energy crisis. Worst of all, none of them took Davis to
task for his inexplicable refusal to return money that he has
received from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Such rookie mistakes are not fatal, certainly not at this early
stage of the election season. All three candidates showed that they
have the talent to take the case against Davis to the voters in the
fall. But Tuesday's practice session points to the need for all three
men to sharpen their skills before they're ready to step into the
batter's box against a battle-tested incumbent governor.</TE>

<HD>Circular Argument for Small Town's Charms</HD>
<DH>The 130-year-old Orange Plaza is a revolving memory lane.
It was the thing to drive after weddings and high school gridiron
victories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Orange, when they say life revolves around the Plaza, they mean
it.</LD>
<LD>   Take Steve Ambriz. When he got married, the first thing he did was
drive the limousine into the Plaza and treat his new bride, Bridget,
to a spin on the traffic circle.</LD>
<LD>   They laughed. They honked the horn. They went around and around.</LD>
<TE>   "It was great," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The postnuptials were the height of decorum compared with Ambriz's
days with the Orange High School football team. When the Panthers
won--too rarely--the entire squad climbed aboard school buses and
carried on a tradition that may have begun on a Model-A Ford in the
1940s. They did laps in the Plaza, hanging out the windows and
yelling like banshees.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome," says Ambriz, 31, who, like many people born and
raised in this quaint pocket of suburbia, never left.</TE>
<TE>   The 130-year-old Orange Plaza--site of antique shops, movie
shoots, street festivals, pep rallies, May Day parades, publicity
stunts and high jinks--is more than just the sum of its historic
brick storefronts and sidewalk cafes.</TE>
<TE>   The soul of small-town America still lives at Glassell Street and
Chapman Avenue, where the founders created a real town square. They
lined it with stately two-story buildings. In the middle is a traffic
circle and a tiny round park containing a fountain, benches and
trees.</TE>
<TE>   What happened as a result is too rich for simple explanation.
Laughs happened. Cornball love stories happened. Kids grew up and
bonded with the place--and with one another--and now they're passing
on that feeling, like a precious heirloom, to their own kids and
grandkids.</TE>
<TE>   "Stories just abound," says Judy Schroeder, an art gallery owner
who has collected a list of them for the high school's historical
calendar. Drunken horse-and-buggy owners, cars going backward around
the circle, convoys of hearses and beer trucks and fire engines,
teenagers trying to set records by doing laps all afternoon--the
events seem somehow funnier now, all stacked up together.</TE>
<TE>   There was a guy from the Orange High class of '53 who looked up
one night, saw a beautiful young woman in an upstairs window, and
crashed his car. Another guy, class of '63, joined in Halloween
revelry that consisted of drivers going in circles and flinging eggs
and water balloons.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 13 dozen [eggs] and didn't hit anybody," he wrote in a
brief account, "but we sure got it every time our window went down."</TE>
<TE>   Not that every tale involves reckless driving. Some of the stories
are simply life on display, jewels you might not find anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about loyalty? People who like each other? Check out the
Orange High class of '43. The first Saturday of every month they're
still meeting for breakfast at Watson Drug, the 102-year-old soda
fountain on the Plaza's east flank. A long table is set up for 25
people--no small turnout when you consider the inevitable number of
deaths and illnesses and career moves that have occurred over almost
six decades. And when you realize that the entire graduating class
was scarcely 125 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I have breakfast with kids I went to kindergarten with," says
David Hart, who has been part of the monthly ritual since it began
after the 1973 reunion.</TE>
<TE>   A varsity halfback in the fearful years of World War II, Hart
remembers hauling four or five teammates on victory laps in his
Model-A, but he isn't sure if they were following an existing
tradition or originating one. In any case, he's particularly proud of
the Plaza; his father ran the Orange Daily News when it moved there
in the early 1920s, at a location that still bears the Daily News
sign even though it is now a coffeehouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Plaza is no longer an economic hub--the Block of Orange and
the Orange Mall are the revenue producers for this city of 125,000.
But the old brick buildings house one of California's premier antique
districts. Filming occurs so often that the merchants grouse,
although they usually sign the petitions and let the cameras come in.
The location has been featured in the movies "Gumball Rally,"
"Crimson Tide," "That Thing You Do" and "The Man Who Wasn't There."</TE>
<TE>   "When people find out where I live," says Paige Davis, a writer
and poet who rents an inexpensive flat above the Plaza, "they always
'ooh' and 'aah.' " She is reminded of the town squares of Indiana,
where she grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Passions run deep--sometimes to the point of absurdity. One
never-ending bugaboo is the name. Outsiders often insist on calling
it the Circle, or the Orange Circle, names held as vile by proud
old-timers.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll bite your head off if you call it the Circle," says
short-story author Orman Day, who also rents a second-floor flat. He
knows because he has done it, "and I've been treated with absolute
disdain. Now I find myself correcting other people."</TE>
<TE>   Addresses along the perimeter say Plaza Square.</TE>
<TE>   "How can a square be a circle?" asks Ralph Linnert, a member of
that notorious '43 class, who helped spearhead a campaign some years
back. The old-timers printed 1,500 bumper stickers--"It's the Plaza,
Not the Circle"--and exploited their political leverage to place them
on city trucks and police cars.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Brigandi got into the act. For a time, the author of "Orange:
The City 'Round the Plaza" took to reprimanding offenders--who were
mainly newspaper reporters--by sending form letters. "I used to have
. . . joke letterheads from the Society for the Prevention of the
Term 'Circle,'" Brigandi says. "Part of [the letter] said, 'Surely
you noticed more than just its shape.'"</TE>
<TE>   Details matter. The park isn't even round, Brigandi says. It looks
round enough, but it's actually elliptical.</TE>
<TE>   The city just finished a renovation of the Plaza to restore the
look it had in the 1930s and 1940s, the period considered most
historic. It took years of fretting to settle on the plan. The
$1.8-million project involved improving the street and drainage,
removing heavy planters and tearing up brick sidewalks from the
1970s. The bricks gave way to stained pressed concrete typical of the
war years.</TE>
<TE>   Some are aghast.</TE>
<TE>   "If they like the concrete so much, they should drive on the
freeways more often," complains Hank Mascolo, a barber and ex-sardine
fisherman who has cut hair at the Plaza for 47 years.</TE>
<TE>   Mascolo is its "honorary mayor"--he's got the plaque on his
wall--but he also is a self-confessed "thorn in the side of the City
Council."</TE>
<TE>   He fought to keep out parking meters. "We tell them, 'If it's not
busted, don't fix it,' " Mascolo says. "We give them hell all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   He will likely be here forever. His wife, Renee, runs a jewelry
store across the way.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the romance of the Plaza," she says.</TE>
<TE>   They got married in 1985. After the ceremony, they hopped in their
Lincoln Town Car and did three laps around the Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "Three seems to be the lucky number," Renee says, enjoying the
memory. "It was about 4 in the morning. Then we went up to Norm's and
had breakfast. That's the story."</TE>

just-completed $1.8-million renovation is the occasion for

flank of the Plaza.</CP>

<LD>   One of Cuba's most prominent leading men before fleeing to the
United States in 1962, Barral starred in dozens of Spanish-language
soap operas before becoming a television and radio host. "The Rolando
Barral Show" was a hit that ran 10 years on the Spanish International
Network, which later became Univision.</LD>

Saturday"--a popular three-hour show of music, comedy and games.</LD>
<TE>   In 1988, Barral was arrested in Miami on suspicion of cocaine
possession. He pleaded no contest and was ordered into
rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he was the host of a daily interview program on
cable's TVC network.</TE>

<HD>Rabbi Mika Weiss, 88; Jail Chaplain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a chaplain at the Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, Rabbi Mika
M. Weiss traveled from his home in Brentwood two or three times a
month for more than 30 years to counsel inmates. He felt he could
relate to them.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Hungary, Weiss was imprisoned in two Nazi
extermination camps, Mauthausen and Gunskirchen, during World War II.
He was liberated by American troops in 1945 but lost his freedom
again when he returned to a Hungary that was under increasing
Communist control.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as you don't know bondage and oppression, you wouldn't be
able to appreciate freedom," Weiss told The Times in 1993. "As long
as you don't know bitterness, you cannot appreciate sweetness."</LD>
<TE>   Weiss, rabbi emeritus at Temple B'nai Hayim in Sherman Oaks, died
Dec. 29 of coronary artery disease. He was 88 and had continued his
chaplain duties at the Pitchess center until last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to explain how to be free inside barbed wire,
something that he knew well," said Rabbi Mark Borovitz of Beit
T'Shuvah, a Jewish rehabilitation center.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a tremendous inspiration to all who met him."</TE>
<TE>   Borovitz should know: Weiss counseled him in the early 1980s, when
Borovitz was an inmate at Pitchess on bad-check and forgery charges,
before he became a rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought hope to people who were hopeless, which is probably
the greatest gift he could give to anybody," Borovitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kiskunfelegyhaza, Hungary, in 1913, Weiss earned a
doctorate in philosophy from the Pazmany Peter University of Budapest
in 1939. The same year, he received his first position as a rabbi in
Oroshaza, well before his official ordination from the Jewish
Theological Seminary in Budapest in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Although he had several chances to flee the Nazis after the
Germans seized Hungary, Weiss refused, saying, "What kind of man
would I be if I forsake my own congregation?"</TE>
<TE>   In May 1944, two Gestapo officers burst into his home in Oroshaza.
They marched him at gunpoint to a police station where he joined
other members of his synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, they took us to another town, to Debrecen jail
where 50 people were packed into a small space," he once recalled.
"There was no sanitation. The Nazis threw food at us like dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss was deported to Austria, where he inspired fellow death camp
prisoners to maintain the will to live when they were ready to give
up, said his son, Peter.</TE>
<TE>   The Jews of Debrecen promised to make Weiss their rabbi if they
got out of the camp alive. More than 500,000 Hungarian Jews were sent
to German concentration camps; most were killed in gas chambers.</TE>
<TE>   After the Gunskirchen extermination camp was liberated, Weiss
served as the chief rabbi in Debrecen from 1946 to 1957, and was
later named "eternal rabbi" of the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Hungary, Weiss put his life at risk by speaking
out against those who had stood idly by when Hungary's Jews were
deported by the Nazis, his son said.</TE>
<TE>   When the Communists confiscated the homes and possessions of Jews
living in Budapest and deported them to the countryside in the early
1950s, Weiss developed a plan to return them to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way he could bring them back to Debrecen [was] if they
had health problems," said Peter Weiss. "He had the health minister
start writing health decrees that this person's life is in
danger--and then did it over and over."</TE>
<TE>   About nine months after Soviet forces crushed a short-lived
anti-Communist revolution in Hungary in late 1956, Weiss moved his
family to Finland. He accepted a position as rabbi for the Helsinki
Jewish congregation, where he served from 1957 to 1961; he became
chief rabbi of all of Finland in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, with the Soviet Union threatening Finland, he and his
family moved to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He became the rabbi of the Jewish Community Center in Flemington,
N.J., and then came to California, where he spent three years as
rabbi at Temple Mishkon Tephilo in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Temple B'nai Hayim in 1967, and a year later began
serving as a chaplain at the Pitchess center.</TE>
<TE>   "Only in America can chaplains have such close contact and
[conduct] services in jail," Weiss once told The Times. "Even in
Scandinavian countries, nothing compares."</TE>
<TE>   Saying he wanted "to give something back to this country," Weiss
also served as a chaplain for the Van Nuys Division of the Los
Angeles Police Department for 22 years and was a chaplain at several
hospitals and retirement homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of darkness all around the world," Weiss once told
12 inmates before lighting the menorah at a Hanukkah celebration in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "God's candle is the soul of the heart, the spirit of the human
being. We should spread the light all around us."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Weiss is survived by his wife, Hedy Flesh,
and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions can be sent to the Rabbi Weiss Memorial Fund at
B'nai Hayim, 4302 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.</TE>

<HD>Alan Jackson Drives All the Way to No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Jackson has broken Creed's eight-week hold on the nation's pop
album chart. The veteran country music star's "Drive" collection
entered the sales list at No. 1 on Wednesday after selling 423,000
copies in its first week in stores.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson has been turning out million-selling albums for more than
a decade, but this is the first time one of his albums has gone to
No. 1 on the pop chart.</LD>
<LD>   Although the album would surely have been the best-selling
collection in a week of light competition, the package benefited from
the widespread radio and television exposure received by one of its
tracks--"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" a
reflection on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Creed's "Weathered" finished second, selling 128,000 copies. That
figure pushes the album's total sales to more than 4 million since
its release in November.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the Top 10 this week were claimed, in
order, by Linkin Park, Nickelback, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Nas, Usher,
Pink and Enya. The best-selling single continues to be B2K's "Uh
Huh."</TE>

<LD>   Writer-director Todd Solondz, the chronicler of suburban New
Jersey dysfunction in "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Happiness,"
hasn't cheered up any with his latest film, "Storytelling." Selma
Blair, Robert Wisdom, Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, Lupe Ontiveros and
Julie Hagerty star in two separate stories, "Fiction" and
"Non-Fiction," that mix dark comedy and disturbing drama in dealing
with sex, race, celebrity and exploitation.</LD>
<LD>   "Storytelling," rated R for strong sexual content, language and
some drug use, opens Friday at Laemmle's Sunset 5 in West Hollywood
and Landmark's NuWilshire, Santa Monica.</LD>

<TE>   Just out of his teens, ex-Bostonian Brian Pelletier is the
creative engine driving DanceLA, a nine-member pop-dance company
launched a year ago with his work, "Personal Demons/Deviant
Pleasures." Pelletier--who dances, choreographs, produces, directs,
designs and sometimes tears your ticket at the door--now invades
downtown L.A. with his opus 10, the full-evening "Domestika," set to
music by Bjork. Pelletier is very definitely a developing underground
artist, so don't expect stylistic maturity or expressive refinement
but rather raw talent, high ambition and fearless commitment to his
subject and music.</TE>

<TE>   The esoteric tradition of "sacred steel"--gospel music played on a
pedal steel guitar--has a mainstream-ready hero in the wings. Young
New Jersey native Robert Randolph has been serving up the sounds of
salvation in church for most of his life, and now he's been brought
into the secular realm by the North Mississippi Allstars and John
Medeski (of Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood). They all team up under the name
the Word.</TE>

<LD>   Even in the 19th century, it was man against technology. The Oasis
Theatre Company explores one man-versus-machine struggle in the new
musical "Steel: John Henry &amp; the Shaker." Leon Martell and composer
Penka Kouneva start with the myth of the post-Civil War "steel
drivin'" hero--who beat a steam drill in a race through the
mountain--and then look at his influence on generations of working
men. The show rings with work songs and the sounds of the railroad,
while choreographer Ameenah Kaplan--an original "Stomp" cast
member--has given it a physical charge.</LD>
<LD>   "Steel: John Henry &amp; the Shaker," [Inside] the Ford, John Anson
Ford Theatre Complex, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East, Hollywood. 8 p.m.
Regular schedule: Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends

Civic Arts Plaza. The 14th annual event raises funds for performing
arts programs at Cal Lutheran University, plus a performing arts
scholarship in Hebel's name. This is a sizable production with a

<TE>   Celebrating its 58th year at Scripps College in Claremont,
"Ceramic Annual 2002" is the longest-running exhibition of clay art

functional vessels, expressive portraiture or formal exploration.
This year's show, curated by artist Nancy Selvin, focuses on the
creative use of clay as a medium of sculptural abstraction in the
work of a dozen contemporary artists from the U.S. and England.</TE>

<TE>   4pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Dance as a spiritual practice dominates the ancient and rarely
seen transformation rituals to be performed by Prajwal Ratna
Vajrachara of Nepal. Traditionally executed only by Vajrayana
Buddhist priests as part of their meditations, those rituals invoke
Tantric deities--Manjushri, Avalokiteshvara, Vajrayogini, or
Vajrapani--who are described in the accompanying songs. Union with
the divine is the dancer's ultimate goal, as in many religious rites
worldwide, but the images here are unique to the Charya Nirtya idiom
of the Katmandu Valley.</TE>

Ave., Pasadena. 4 p.m. $9 to $12. (626) 449-2742.</TE>

ceiling, is the venue for "Fuoco e cenere" (Fire and Ashes), an
ensemble of viols performing with Israeli mezzo-soprano Rinat Shaham
and directed by Jay Bernfield. The group, dedicated to "magic and
drama in music," offers "Fantasy in Blue," a program the crosses the
centuries by uniting the musical voices of Henry Purcell and George
Gershwin.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the Mark Morris Dance Group
returns to Irvine with a mixed repertory created over the last 19
years. Now 47, Morris started out as the outrageous maverick of
modern dance but in recent years has smoothly cross-faded into the
role of reigning master of contemporary music visualization. That's a
conservative stance, perhaps, but one that's never out of style. With
live music under the direction of Ethan Iverson, his program each
night includes "Bijoux" (Erik Satie), "Peccadilloes" (Satie), "V"
(Robert Schumann), "Dancing Honeymoon" (newly arranged pop songs of
the 1920s and '30s) and "The Office" (Antonin Dvorak).</TE>

<HD>Where the Fringe Is Middle of the Road</HD>
<DH>The more things change, the more Melrose Avenue stays the
same, an epicenter of hip eccentricity.</DH>

<LD>A tour bus headed east on Melrose Avenue slows down near Wasteland,
which, like many of the stores along this mythic stretch of
institutional hipness, sells campy used clothes from every decade,
hundred-dollar vintage pants and bargain designer shoes. On the
sidewalk outside, a half-dozen kids sporting facial piercings and
black leather, much of it studded with metal, casually ask passing
shoppers for change, one grinning and holding a sign that says, "NEED
BEER...." As a girl, who will not give her name, explains how the
popularized, romanticized shopping district of Melrose Avenue, famous
for its trendy wares and anti-establishment attitude, is littered
with "yuppies and cell phones," one of her friends spots the
rubbernecking tourists and begins yelling.</LD>
<LD>   "Keep moving!" he screams, turning his back to the tour bus and
yanking down his jeans. "That's what you get for slowing down."</LD>
<LD>   And this, the exposed rear end of an angry street punk, is exactly
what any clued-in tourist should expect to see here. Anything less
would be a letdown, for this one mile of Los Angeles is so fiercely
alternative, so unapologetically cool, that its attitude has become
downright predictable.</LD>
<TE>   Some marvel at how this strip has managed to guard its indie
spirit, while others grumble that the place is skidding on its
reputation, that it's become nothing more than a bus-mooning street
punk, too cool for you and me but willing to take our money anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Melrose Avenue is like the L.A. version of Kings Road in London:
It's always been associated with youth culture, new trends,
pseudo-subversive underground designers, art and fashion," says
Pleasant Gehman, night-life columnist for Los Angeles magazine and
editor of the Underground Guide to Los Angeles (Manic D Press, 1999).
She spent many years on Melrose in its heyday, the '80s, when punk
rock and cheap thrifting were new, when their trends defined the
street and the street helped define a culture. "Now the rest of the
world has finally caught up to Melrose, so for some time it's been
established, but never quote-unquote establishment."</TE>
<TE>   So, yeah, punk and piercings don't shock anyone anymore--very few
things do--but Melrose continues to thrive as a sort of commercial
subculture incubator, a place where extreme ideas germinate, grow,
become mainstream. Wedged between two Chevron stations, the strip
borders an upscale gallery-and-furniture-store district to the west,
and, to the east, quickly becomes funkier, sketchier, more Hollywood.
Those who work and walk here sense an invisible hand fending off the
mall-ification now familiar to other outdoor pedestrian strips, Santa
Monica's Third Street Promenade, Pasadena's Old Town and now
Hollywood Boulevard. Alongside Melrose's ever-rotating feast of
fiercely independent storefronts, the Gap opened and closed a few
years later, as did McDonald's and Noah's Bagels. Now, though, a
Starbucks, Johnny Rockets and Urban Outfitters are doing well. So
what's the trick? Who fits in and who is cast away?</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, we don't even belong here, except for one thing: We're
eccentric," says Sanders Chase, walking through his store, the Record
Collector, a bright, neatly kept labyrinth of vinyl, room after room
of floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with a half-million LPs ranging in
price from $10 into the thousands. "The definition of 'eccentric' is
that you stand still and everyone else bends to you--so you become
the center instead of the fringe."</TE>
<TE>   This, he says, is what Melrose is all about, planting extreme
ideas and tastes firmly in the middle of the road. Chase moved his
store here 21/2 years ago, from a Highland Avenue location he'd had
for more than 20 years, and says his clients, including Busta Rhymes
and Michael Jackson, followed. He sells no CDs, mostly classical and
jazz records and some of what he calls "weird music," a wall of
soundtracks, electronic classical (selling very well now) and the
occasional 75-record Beatles collection. "But if you want rock or
hip-hop," says the chatty 50-year-old, "it's all up and down the
street."</TE>
<TE>   True, a few blocks down, Fat Beats offers the latest De La Soul
and Outkast on vinyl while a deejay behind the counter mixes and
scratches to a weekday afternoon audience of three browsers. Vinyl
Fetish has your dance and goth, Head Line Records stocks ska and punk
and books in-store shows and mini-riots. And then there's Street
Sounds, geared toward the European-style deejay set, whom owner Bob
Bagha describes as only 1% to 3% of music lovers worldwide. But, like
anything that thrives on Melrose, the stuff's on the rise: "The total
number of turntables sold in 2001 outnumbered the number of guitars,"
he boasts, as a giant speaker on the sidewalk thumps and thumps. On
the next block, a man sells CDs out of a backpack, an album that he
and his brother recorded and pressed themselves. "Only $7," he says.
"It's going to blow up. I mean it." For some reason, I don't doubt
him.</TE>
<TE>   The foot traffic on Melrose has the ebb and flow of lazy retail
time, open at noon, closed by 8--or whenever. During the afternoon,
the place is packed with scenesters, skateboarders, moms with
strollers, kids from Fairfax High, guys with green hair and even more
guys with just plain old regular hair. There isn't much of a morning
coffee crowd, or many places for them to go, and nothing is open 24
hours. Night life centers on upscale-ish dinner crowds at places like
Melrose mainstay Chianti, Angeli Caffe (owned by KCRW-FM personality
Evan Kleiman) and Tommy Tang's, a couple of bars (Max's, the Snake
Pit), two small theaters and, particularly, the improv club and
acting academy the Groundlings Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when they talked about moving us off Melrose, to
Universal CityWalk I think, which would have been very harmful," says
actor David Jahn, a Groundlings cast member and teacher who has spent
more than a decade with the troupe. "That's much more of a
family-oriented place, whereas on Melrose, yeah, there are tourists,
but it's hip and you've got really creative people here."</TE>
<TE>   Every day of the week, the theater either has classes, where
hopeful future members learn the trade, or performs one of its
sketch-comedy or improv shows. Since moving behind its trademark
brick facade in 1979, the Groundlings has graduated the likes of Paul
Reubens, Lisa Kudrow and Will Ferrell, bringing to the street a slick
industry audience and an older dinner-and-a-show crowd on the
weekends. But Jahn recommends the Sunday night show, which is put
together by students hoping to one day make the main troupe and is a
little more out-there, experimental--a little more Melrose.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the street, however, has little to do with comedy,
Hollywood or music. It's about clothes. And shoes. And more clothes.
Everything from the latest disposable clubwear to ironically plaid
golf pants. Need a sequined Mexican wrestler mask? Try Blue Demon.
How about a chain-mail helmet? See Royal Flesh.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the dozens and dozens of storefronts stand out as
standards: the gleefully rude bondage-flavored Retail Slut, the
vintage threads superstore Aardvarks Odd Ark, and Red Balls on Fire,
with its facade of mirrored half-spheres. It's been here for a
decade, under the direction of designer-owner Petra Vieira, who sells
whatever European brands are hot and makes her own slinky pants and
dresses from used leather outfits. "The street keeps copying us," she
says over the blaring techno-noise of a John Digweed CD, "and they do
it so fast!"</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she's seen countless trends and stores come and
go, but a few things always, always, always sell on this street.
"Anything punk or rock 'n' roll," she says, "and it has to be sexy.
That's Melrose." A few years ago, when much of the street tried more
high-end and expensive concepts, she opened a more sophisticated
spin-off. But the invisible hand of Melrose wanted no such thing, and
her second shop is now packed with close-out items. "It only sells
here," she says, "if it's got some kind of edge to it."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday afternoon, up and down the street, bored
workers stand outside countless boutiques with similar window
displays and names: Serious. Shrine. Flasher. Body Double. Booth. Few
of the shoppers carry bags, and I ask three women how their weekday
spree is going.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the stores are all the same, but so what?" says one,
Mika Neefgaard, twisting her hips, showing off a $10 fringey suede
belt she just bought at some place or another, the name of which she
can't remember. "If things go out of fashion so fast, who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   The history of Melrose Avenue is littered with fads, rages, whims
and the stores that pimped them, too many gone now to even list. In
the early days of punk rock, the late '70s and early '80s, explains
writer Gehman, the rent on Melrose was dirt-cheap, compared with,
say, then-booming Westwood Village. So budget-minded, off-center
shops selling campy gifts, screen-printed Ts and black jeans grabbed
giant storefronts and gathered posses of orbiting hipsters. The
street grew places like oddball toy-and-housewares shops Soap Plant
and Wacko--they have since moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Feliz,
essentially the Melrose of the mid-'90s--and the long-gone thrift
thread shop Flip.</TE>
<TE>   "This was where you could get a job if you looked like a hard-core
punk, and it seemed like everyone was at Flip. My boyfriend was
working there, and two girls from my band were working there," says
Gehman. "And everyone who worked there looked like Elvis or Madonna."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of alternative success and confidence took hold on
Melrose, she says, and it hasn't left, only grown older, wiser, more
entrenched. Some describe the place now as a lesser civilization
built in the shadow of a great one. "I think the street has actually
lost character," says Matt Joseph, owner of House of Freaks, a tattoo
and piercing parlor located above a convenience store. His business
used to be novel, weird, out there, but like much of what made
Melrose different, it's gone mainstream. There are now a half-dozen
places here to get skin ink and body jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first opened, the customers were more likely to get a
tattoo of something because it was important to them, but now, they
get what everyone else has," he says, as two women at his counter
shop for new navel rings. "People go into office jobs now with
pierced eyebrows, and it's no big deal." And that, he says, is
Melrose today: The middle manager with a nose ring.</TE>
<TE>   Other old-timers are downright cranky about the mature Melrose,
complaining that the creative energy is gone, that trend-setting
crowds have given way to younger, less discriminating
follow-the-leader types.</TE>
<TE>   "This used to be a great street," says Dean Miller, manager of the
pop-antique store Off the Wall. "Now it's, what? Women's clothing
store, shoe store, women's clothing store, used women's clothing
store, shoe store." Pointing up and down the street, he stands on the
sidewalk beneath a sign that reads "Weird stuff," flanked by a large
spinning flying saucer and a 6-foot Ronald McDonald he has for sale.
Miller talks about the old days, the '80s and even '90s, when the
street had more rock 'n' roll character, when the jazz club Nucleus
Nuance drew crowds, when Off the Wall used to be bigger and there
were at least three competing high-end antique stores.</TE>
<TE>   The stores that have been here the longest, been here for decades,
have created their own markets and subcultures but don't quite fit
the stereotypical punk profile: Off the Wall, Wound &amp; Wound Toy Co.,
L.A. Eyeworks, Wanna Buy a Watch, Golden Apple Comics. Miller still
does brisk business in things like Frank Lloyd Wright furniture and
Charlie the Tuna lamps and chandeliers from the Empire State
Building. Heck, he's sold three giant $2,000 fiberglass cows in the
last four months.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's still fostering the street's reputation as an easy place
to find hard-to-find stuff. Need a neon sign made? Or a wind-up,
bouncing Godzilla toy? How about a rare Bill Evans reissue? One
store, Animate, sells not only Japanese animation DVDs, but also the
pens and paper tailored for drawing saucer-eyed schoolgirls and
robots that turn into space ships.</TE>
<TE>   Today, newcomers such as G.A.L.A.X.Y. Gallery are, in the
tradition of Melrose, turning extreme ideas into mainstream fare,
standing still while the world bends to them. In particular, this art
gallery, cafe and pipe store is hoping to bring the once-taboo head
shop to the Abercrombie-and-Restoration Hardware crowd. When owner
Russ Cress moved to L.A. from Ohio, he shopped around for the perfect
neighborhood to open a store devoted to the culture and paraphernalia
of "the graduated smoker," the sophisticated pot enthusiast, to open
"a place you could take your grandmother," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "What I realized was that Melrose wasn't the coolest street," he
says, mentioning more raw urban soil in Silver Lake and Hollywood,
"but it's got this young, trendy demographic that we need." So the
street hit the spot for his enormous selection ranging from $6 carved
wood pipes to ornate, handblown glass bongs in the $1,800 range. He's
even opened a bar where you can smoke a variety of perfectly legal
substances from large hookahs. It's predictably offbeat, essentially
a gift shop located just outside the subculture.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, another man plies his trade, selling his own
brand name to the casual shoppers. His name is Dutch, he's 27, and
he's crouching on the street and asking for change, politely,
quietly, wearing a lot of leather with a tattoo of a star under each
eye. He loves it here on Melrose and walks all the way from his
apartment on Hollywood Boulevard to gather a few bucks for the day.
He describes it as "much more alternative" than Hollywood or anywhere
else and insists that--are you kidding?--the place can't and won't
change, no matter how successful he or anyone else gets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just Melrose, man," he says, as if stating the obvious.
"It's always going to be like this."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The actor, who starred in the films "Scream" and "Scream 2" and
also appeared in "Boiler Room" and "Three Kings," is the star of the
WB's new show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment."</LD>
<LD>   Cena Completa: On Friday nights after work, I like to go out and
eat at Marino on Melrose. It's a great place to have Italian food. I
usually get the chicken parmigiana, and I start with the pasta with
olive oil and garlic, and they make it really good. They also have
amazing roasted eggplant there. I finish it off with a nice tiramisu.</LD>
<LD>   Surround Sound: I like to go to the movies, and I love the new
Mann Chinese 6 in Hollywood. The old Mann Chinese is awesome, but the
new one is different. It's so high-tech with stadium seating and
surround sound. I like everything from popcorn films to tear-jerkers
to comedies.</LD>
<TE>   House of the Dead: I love to play video games. There's one arcade
on Vermont, the College Arcade. I love that place. I'm into House of
the Dead, House of the Dead 2 and Golden Tee '99, this golf game. I
always go there late at night. When I'm at home on the weekend, I
spend a lot of time with the Nintendo Game Cube.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Martinis: I'm not a huge drinker, but I like to have apple
martinis. When I hang out with my friend Dickey Ehrlich, we'll
usually hit the Standard Bar on Saturday night, and the crowd there
is young and fun. And usually when I'm hungry, I'll go to the little
Standard Lounge there and eat, or grab something at a coffeehouse
late at night.</TE>
<TE>   High-Stakes Putt-Putt: On Saturday, I like to play golf with my
friend Josh at the Roosevelt Golf Course in Griffith Park, a
nine-holer. It's really cheap, like nine bucks. It's a good little
course. And then I like to play putt-putt golf, too. I like to
gamble. We play for three bucks a hole at that place in Sherman Oaks.
We play 72 holes in one day, except we don't play the last hole
because you lose your ball.</TE>

<HD>Forsaking the Flash</HD>
<DH>Rappers Cannibal Ox, now heard beyond New York, reject
gangsta sensationalism for an intense sound that's earning raves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The statement "some people have to be modest" doesn't seem a likely
motto for a hip-hop performer. Modesty--of ego or lifestyle or career
aims--is anathema to the bling-bling that rules rap's roost. But
those are the words rapper Vast Aire, of the New York group Cannibal
Ox, says he lives by.</LD>
<LD>   The acclaim generated by "The Cold Vein," the group's debut album
on the Def Jux label, has been anything but modest. Critics and
front-line fans have heralded the group--which plays an afternoon
show Saturday at the Knitting Factory Hollywood with fellow Def Jux
rapper Aesop Rock--as a groundbreaking arrival comparable to such
landmark acts as Grandmaster Flash, Public Enemy, N.W.A. and the
Wu-Tang Clan.</LD>
<LD>   "Cannibal reminds me of the first Wu-Tang album, the cutting edge
of gritty New York," says Kathryn McGuire, senior editor of hip-hop
and electronica magazine Urb. "Everybody seems to think Def Jux is
the next [hot label], and that sound is the most exciting sound out
of New York now."</LD>
<TE>   A typical Can Ox piece features Vast's vivid rhymes ("You'll get
tossed in the flames/Where some ornithologist will find your skeletal
frame," he raps in "Pigeon") countered by fellow rapper Vordul
Megilah's synaptic shards ("Terror toys jubilated mega noise when
iron works/Bullet shot animated mad windows with fireworks," he spits
in the same piece).</TE>
<TE>   The words are set amid producer-composer El-P's inventive, complex
sonic collages, making for a dense, intense and unsettling portrait
of ghetto life, offered without either gangsta sensationalism or
fashion-conscious materialism--or with any real concessions to the
mainstream pop world.</TE>
<TE>   El-P (real name: James Meline) is also the owner of the defiantly
independent Def Jux, whose sound is starting to reach beyond New
York. Last year former Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la
Rocha hired El-P to produce several songs for his still-unfinished
debut solo album.</TE>
<TE>   Vast (real name: Theodore Arrington II) says that so far it's been
easy to keep in perspective the rising tide of praise.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing, to us, is simple," says the rapper, 24. "All
we're doing is figuring out rhythmic patterns, doing that with our
flow, what we have to talk about. We're kids who like jazz, we know
what funk is, we know what rock is, and reggae. All of that is
hip-hop. We can apply any sound we use to get our point across."</TE>
<TE>   Arrington, an imposing 6 feet, 7 inches and 300 pounds, met
Megilah (real name: Shamar Gardner) when they were ninth-graders in
Manhattan's Washington Irving High School. The two started writing
and performing together and, by the time they were 15, they and a few
other friends--collectively known as the Atomz Family--were appearing
in Brooklyn and Manhattan clubs and occasionally making road trips as
far as Philadelphia and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   It was on the New York club circuit that they encountered El-P, a
member of influential underground hip-hop group Company Flow.</TE>
<TE>   "They opened for us a few times," says El-P, 26. "They were cool
kids. They'd come up to me and give me tapes. And every time I heard
their stuff they got better. I became friends, and Company Flow was
on the verge of breaking up [in 2000] and I was looking for something
to throw myself into. I approached them and said, 'Do you want to
form a group? You two are the main MCs and I'm the producer.'"</TE>
<TE>   The teaming seems something of a mismatch on the surface. The
rappers are African Americans from the ghetto, El-P is white and was
raised in middle-class neighborhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "Vast and Vordul's experience of how they grew up is what
attracted me as a producer," says El-P. "I've always been on the same
things as them, but from a different perspective. I don't have the
same background they do. But as long as your stuff is honest and
searching for something true, it doesn't have to be the same
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   A perspective they do share is wariness of the music business.
Overtures have come from major labels, but the three are content to
stay where they are, even though the acclaim heaped on the act hasn't
translated into cash register action. "The Cold Vein" has sold just
20,000 copies since its release last May, according to industry sales
tracker SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all just mathematics at the end of the day," says Arrington.
"I want people to respect my music, whether it's 50,000 or 7 million.
I want people to respect a point of view where we're coming from, and
maybe we'll get our just desserts before we're dead and gone."</TE>
<TE>   El-P takes the same stance about inquiries that have been made for
his label.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been of the sense that if you can do it yourself and
not be beholden financially, you're better off," says the label
owner. "If you're selling 10,000 and getting 100% of the profit,
that's better than selling 300,000 and getting no profit and getting
dropped. I'm not a businessman, but I'm not an idiot."</TE>

<HD>A Warhorse Rides Again</HD>
<DH>The Count of Monte Cristo's back. Is there enough life left
in him for the latest remake?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a century ago, moviegoers flocked to the nickelodeons to see a
one-reel adaptation of "The Count of Monte Cristo," Alexandre Dumas'
classic 19th century revenge story. Five years later, in 1912, the
legendary actor James O'Neill, father of playwright Eugene O'Neill,
starred in the first feature-length version of the legendary
swashbuckling tale. In 1934, Robert Donat headlined the exciting
Hollywood production that scored a bull's-eye with critics and
audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, producers have frequently returned to the "Monte
Cristo" well. Richard Chamberlain and Gerard Depardieu starred in
well-received TV versions, and even George Dolenz, father of the
Monkees' Micky Dolenz, starred in a '50s TV series.</LD>
<TE>   Touchstone Pictures has dusted off the old warhorse one more time.
This time around, Jim Caviezel ("Angel Eyes," "Pay It Forward") plays
Dumas' hero, Edmund Dantes, an honest, God-fearing sailor who is
planning to marry the beautiful Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk).
However, the trusting Dantes is betrayed by his best friend, the rich
and spoiled Fernand (Guy Pearce), who wants Mercedes for himself.
Fernand reports to the French authorities that Dantes is a traitor to
the French monarchy, and the young man is sentenced to the infamous
island prison of Chateau d'If. During his 13 years in solitary,
Dantes becomes consumed with vengeance. With the help of another
prisoner, Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), he escapes from the prison and
transforms himself into the mysterious, dashing and wealthy Count of
Monte Cristo. And as Dantes befriends the French nobility, he begins
to destroy all the men who ruined his life.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Reynolds, who directed the 1991 box office hit "Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves," directed this edition from a script by Jay
Wolpert.</TE>
<TE>   The big question is that in this day and age of the high-flying
martial arts fight sequences of "The Matrix," "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon" and the current "Brotherhood of the Wolf," will a
traditional period action-romance connect with teen audiences?</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think it will appeal to younger audiences,"
Reynolds says. "But I don't know, you tell me."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Kuntz, visiting professor of American film at UCLA,
points out that classic stories such as "Monte Cristo" have appealed
to every generation. "It is the very definition of a warhorse. Over
and over it has proven itself over many generations. It has had a
long life in film, and it's not surprising it will be getting [a new]
Hollywood treatment--in color and wide screen, great locales, sets
and costumes, and a relatively young cast. You are drawing on
something that has an extremely solid, established story and
characters that have already proven themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the films like 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the
Ring' and 'Star Wars,'" Caviezel says. "Those films have taken stuff
out of this book. It was way out of this time."</TE>
<TE>   "The Count of Monte Cristo" is as different as can be from
Reynolds' "Robin Hood," which starred Kevin Costner in the title
role. The latter was definitely geared for the young crowd that had
never seen Douglas Fairbanks' silent classic or Errol Flynn's 1938
"The Adventures of Robin Hood." It was much campier in tone than
"Monte Cristo" and featured a hit pop tune sung by Bryan Adams,
"(Everything I Do) I Do For You."</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't my idea," Reynolds says of Adams' hit. Warner Bros.,
the studio that released "Robin Hood," he says, went for the lowest
common denominator when it came to audience appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Kuntz: "'Robin Hood' was completely done for modern
audiences, so much so, it kind of lost the medieval spirit about the
story."</TE>
<TE>   Although "The Count of Monte Cristo" has PG-13 gore and discreet
sex scenes, it is very much in the vein of an old-fashioned
swashbuckler. There are no pop tunes peppered throughout the
soundtrack. There is no flashy MTV-style editing. And the film is
filled with numerous spiritual references and discussions about God
and religion.</TE>
<TE>   The religious aspect was a product of Wolpert's script, Reynolds
says, and is present in Dumas' book. "In 19th century French
literature, everything was much more spiritual," Reynolds says. "God
and religion was much more a part of people's lives. I think it was
something that Jay sort of accentuated because one of the things we
wanted to explore in the character arc was this was a guy who is bent
on revenge. But rather than just having the guy bent on revenge, we
wanted to explore the notion: Is revenge satisfying? That was one of
the aspects I found sort of intriguing about it--to show that this
guy can focus himself utterly and completely about wreaking vengeance
on the people who did this to him, but is it going to make him whole
again? You don't see [this subject discussed] in contemporary movies.
But was it a conscious effort on our part to impart some sort of
theological thing? No it wasn't. It just felt like it was apropos to
the time and the place."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that he has directed two swashbucklers, Reynolds
acknowledges he's really not a fan of the genre. "After a while,
staged sword fighting gets boring," he says. "I was a big fan
[growing up] of complex, heart-wrenching stories like 'Les
Miserables.' One of my favorite pictures growing up was 'Dr. Zhivago'
because you had this multitude of complex characters set against the
tableaux of an enormous background of some sort."</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin made an unbelievable film to look at visually," Caviezel
says, noting also that Reynolds "makes a great action film." "He
surrounded me with a great cast, so basically what I had to do was my
job. Kevin has real good insight into what he feels is going to be
really exciting to watch."</TE>
<TE>   All the spectacular sword fights were choreographed.</TE>
<TE>   But even advance preparation didn't always work. Caviezel and
Pearce's final duel in a wheat field had to be reshot. "We shot it
once last fall and we didn't have enough time to do it properly,"
Reynolds says. "When we came together [to edit the film] and realized
it, we went back. The big wheat field where we shot was all brown
now, so we couldn't do pickup shots. We had to reshoot the whole
thing. It was a nightmare, especially for Guy Pearce. We were waiting
for him to finish 'Time Machine.'" He literally got on the plane
[when he finished the movie], flew to Ireland and started the next
day. There was no rehearsal time, so I had to break down the fight
into little segments. It gave us a more frantic quality."</TE>
<TE>   Caviezel, who studied with five fencing instructors, says that the
dueling sequences were very intense. "At one point, I went into Guy's
ribs! I tell you because of the speed and the blade coming by, I just
missed him a couple of times. Once I thought I had killed him because
I slipped on the ground. It was wet and you don't have any real grasp
out there. That is when I took my blade and went into Guy's side." He
didn't pierce Pearce, but did give him a good scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Universal and Miramax released "The Musketeer," Peter
Hyams' disappointing version of Dumas' "The Three Musketeers," which
featured fight and stunt sequences choreographed by Xin Xin Xiong
from Hong Kong. But Reynolds did not want to give "Monte Cristo" an
Eastern flavor. "It just wouldn't have fit what we were trying to
do," Caviezel says.</TE>

<HD>Five Classics Full of Soaring Swords</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The swashbuckler genre took off in 1920 with Douglas Fairbanks'
dashing turn in "The Mark of Zorro." He continued to demonstrate his
athletic dexterity and derring-do in several more films during the
decade, including "Don Q, Son of Zorro" and "Robin Hood."</LD>
<LD>   Fairbanks' mantle was taken up in the 1930s by Errol Flynn, and
over the years, everyone from Tyrone Power, Richard Chamberlain and
George Hamilton to Stewart Granger, Maureen O'Hara and Kevin Costner
have proved themselves to be masters of the sword. Here's a look at
five of the best swashbucklers ever made</LD>
<LD>   "The Black Pirate": Fairbanks' buckle never swashed brighter than
in this 1926 action adventure shot in early two-strip Technicolor.
He's at his athletic best in this terrific tale of revenge in which
he joins the pirates responsible for his father's death. One of the
film's most exhilarating scenes finds Fairbanks sliding down the
ship's sail as his dagger slices it in half. Billie Dove and Donald
Crisp also star.</LD>
<TE>   "The Adventures of Robin Hood": Errol Flynn became an overnight
sensation in Michael Curtiz's action-packed 1935 "Captain Blood." But
he really became a superstar in this 1938 film by Curtiz and William
Keighley. Full of humor, action, romance and Erich Wolfgang
Korngold's evocative score, "Robin Hood" is also one of the most
beautiful films--shot in eye-popping Technicolor. There are several
memorable action sequences, but the best is Robin Hood's concluding
duel with the vile Sir Guy (a wonderful Basil Rathbone).</TE>
<TE>   "The Prisoner of Zenda" Whereas Fairbanks and Flynn were
boisterous, Ronald Colman was every bit the gentleman even when he
handled a sword to defend himself and his honor. And he has plenty of
opportunity to use the sword in this handsome 1937 David O. Selznick
production based on Anthony Hope's novel. John Cromwell (father of
"Babe" star James Cromwell) directed this fast-paced romantic epic
about a commoner who is forced to pretend he is his look-alike
cousin, the king of a troubled European country. Madeleine Carroll,
Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (a delicious villain), Raymond Massey and Mary
Astor also star.</TE>
<TE>   "The Captain From Castile": Swashbucklers fit handsome, athletic
Tyrone Power with the greatest of ease in such films as 1940's "The
Mark of Zorro" and 1942's "The Black Swan." One of his best
swashbucklers is this overlong but gorgeous Technicolor adventure
from 1947. Henry King directed this actioner that finds Power a young
man seeking to avenge his family, who had been mistreated by a
Spanish inquisitor, and eventually traveling with Cortez to Mexico.
Lee J. Cobb and Jean Peters (her seduction dance is priceless)
co-star. Alfred Newman penned the lush score.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pirate": One doesn't think of song-and-dance man Gene Kelly
as a swashbuckling hero. But the muscular, athletic Kelly proved to
be a great action star in two 1948 films--the Vincente Minnelli
musical "The Pirate" and "The Three Musketeers." Although the latter
is more a traditional swashbuckler, Kelly really gets to show his
athletic prowess and his torso in "The Pirate." Judy Garland plays a
lovelorn woman on a Caribbean island who believes that a traveling
performer (Kelly) is really a vicious, romantic pirate. Kelly's sexy,
energetic production number "Mack the Black" is one of the most
memorable he put on screen. Cole Porter wrote the score.</TE>

<LD>Last Chance Theater</LD>
<LD>   "Pinafore!"--A Gilbert &amp; Sullivan parody about gay sailors serving
in their own separate Navy? On paper, the concept sounds fluffy at
best, more like a glorified comedy sketch than a complete show. Put
aside your initial reservations, however, and you're likely to find
"Pinafore!" a double-edged treat. Not only is the show a giddy comic
romp, it also is a wickedly incisive sendup of the U.S. military's
"don't ask, don't tell" policy. The belly laughs keep coming,
informed by a rueful subtext more often than not. One of the first
theatrical directors (before the late Victorian era, the discipline
of "directing" was largely unknown), W.S. Gilbert was an exacting
taskmaster who wrested order from the egalitarian stew that typified
theater of the day. Gilbert was famous for tailoring his productions
to his performers' strengths while downplaying their weaknesses.
Director and adapter Mark Savage is a fitting descendant of that
tradition. Not only is Savage's staging a triumph of compressed
energy, but it is surprisingly faithful to its source material and
sharply professional in almost every particular.</LD>

<DH>'Lost Skeleton of Cadavra' has fun with Z-grade sci-fi
horror films of '50s, '60s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinematheque's Alternative Screen showcase presents
tonight at 7:30 Larry Blamire's "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra," one
of the funniest and most accurate spoofs of Z-grade sci-fi horror
pictures of the '50s and early '60s.</LD>
<LD>   Blamire, who also stars as scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong, has the
cornball dialogue down so perfectly that it's hard to resist quoting
swaths of it. He and his admirably professional cast manage to keep
straight faces, even in the most deliriously silly moments. Paul and
his pretty wife, Betty (Fay Masterson), are off to a vacation in the
mountains, where he hopes to locate a small meteor that looks like a
radioactive plum pudding and is potentially such a great source of
power that one teaspoon of its "atmospherium" can fuel six
round-trips to the moon.</LD>
<LD>   Also eager to get his hands on this meteor is evil Dr. Roger
Fleming (Brian Howe), who figures that with a dose of atmospherium he
will be able to bring back to life "the lost skeleton of Cadavra,"
whose genius brain lives on, and in cahoots with the revived
skeleton, rule the world. In the meantime, a pair of amiable aliens
(Susan Connell and Andrew Parks) arrive from outer space with a
mutant creature, who immediately runs away. They carry with them a
ray gun that can transform creatures into humans--at least
partway--and that is how the sultry Animala (Jennifer Blaire) comes
to life.</LD>
<TE>   What keeps "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra" from being a carbon copy
of vintage drive-in flicks is that its dialogue is so consistently
hilarious. It also offers an implicit commentary on how easily women
could be patronized in the pre-feminism era and how sexually
repressed the '50s were.</TE>
<TE>   Playing with this deliberately schlocky gem is Efram Potelle and
Kyle Rankin's short, "They Came to Attack Us," a bravura spoof of
trailers that also deliriously sends up the space invasion genre.
It's seven minutes long and is a nifty industry calling card for its
filmmakers. 6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   Hungarian films surface so rarely in local theaters it's a shame
that Robert Koltai's "May Day--Mayhem," a big hit on home ground,
doesn't travel better. Koltai takes a humorous look back at Hungary's
grim Stalinist era of half a century ago. He celebrates the
irrepressible spirit of the Hungarian people in the figure of a
colorful, easygoing guy in a new industrial community, Steel City,
constructed alongside the Danube.</TE>
<TE>   Koltai casts himself as the warmhearted, good-humored Csocso, a
burly, middle-aged man who teaches high school Russian despite having
only the slightest grasp of the language. He also coaches the local
soccer team and organizes the Communist holidays. He therefore has a
major assignment in planning Steel City's first May Day celebration,
which will be attended by top Communist Party officials from Budapest
and delegates from the USSR.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Koltai as a filmmaker succumbs to the
heavy-handedness that characterized the Stalinist era, which demanded
of the Hungarian citizenry patriotic fervor and public displays of
gratitude for Soviet "protection." The film abounds in a verbal,
broad humor loaded with insular references that are largely lost on
foreign audiences. It's easy to see how "May Day--Mayhem," which
opens Friday at the Music Hall, 9036 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills,
connected with Hungarian audiences, especially older audiences who
lived through the period. It's equally easy, however, to predict that
American audiences will find it lacking universal appeal. (310)
274-6869.</TE>
<TE>   The amateurish and unfunny "Jane White Is Sick &amp; Twisted," about
the misadventures of a young woman addicted to a Jerry Springer-type
show, has a Friday and Saturday midnight run (12:15 a.m.) at the
Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500. It's
also playing at the Village, 1140 N. Tustin Ave., Orange, (714)
538-3545.</TE>
<TE>   Outfest's Wednesday 7:30 p.m. film series at the Village at Ed
Gould Plaza, 1125 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood, continues with
Michael Selditch's powerful film of Ken Hanes' play "Fixing Frank,"
an effective adaptation of a work from the stage to the screen that
bristles with intense portrayals. A gay psychotherapist, Dr. Jonathan
Baldwin (Paul Provenza), becomes outraged at the damage that
psychiatrist Dr. Arthur Apsey (Dan Butler) has done to gay men (he
claims he can make them straight). So Dr. Baldwin enlists his lover
of more than six years, Frank Johnston (Andrew Elvis Miller), a
freelance journalist, to go undercover as a patient and expose Apsey
as a dangerous fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin and Johnston have underestimated the force of Apsey's
personality and intellect. Apsey claims not to be practicing either
Christian or aversion therapy; he's simply a strong-willed homophobe
who would seem to be preaching mind over the matter of sexual
orientation. Johnston is a likable, intelligent man who is caught
between two stronger personalities. Apsey asks Johnston if there were
a pill that could change him from gay to straight, would he take
it--and then produces such a pill (most likely a placebo). It's a
potent question to pose to any gay man, especially a young man with
his whole life before him, who may not yet have come to terms with
his sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure builds on the increasingly confused and conflicted
Johnston, but it is unfortunate that Selditch and Hanes address
neither the possibility of fluidity in sexual orientation nor
bisexuality. Such notions are not in Apsey's agenda, but it's
disappointing that Baldwin does not address them; it would go a long
way toward keeping Baldwin from seeming as manipulative and
doctrinaire as the man he wants to bring down. Even so, "Fixing
Frank" is entertaining and thought-provoking. (323) 960-2394.</TE>

<HD>Like-Minded Writers Try to Make Life Sing</HD>
<DH>Author Anne Lamott and singer Mary Chapin Carpenter will
share the stage and their stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Just a second, I have to yell at my kid for a minute," says
best-selling writer Anne Lamott, on the phone from her home in
Northern California. On Saturday, Lamott will appear in concert with
singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter at UCLA's Royce Hall. Billed
as an evening of spoken word and songs, the unabashed chick fest will
be their first joint appearance. Lamott, who would rather cut off her
dreadlocks than give interviews, has consented to talk about how the
pairing came about.</LD>
<LD>   Several years ago, she says, she got an unexpected e-mail from
Carpenter, saying how much she liked Lamott's work. "It was like
hearing from Susan Sarandon or something," says Lamott, who knew and
admired Carpenter's work. Establishing an electronic friendship, the
women found they had much in common, including, Lamott says, "we're
both big dog and book people, and we've been through a lot of dog
loss and dog celebration." In the past, Lamott has done readings with
her church choir, because "it's so joyful to listen to music and not
just get read at for an hour." And she thought appearing with
Carpenter "would be both risky and intimate," two things Lamott
obviously relishes. Their representatives took it from there.</LD>
<TE>   Calling from home near Washington, D.C., Carpenter confirms her
co-star's story. In the summer of 1999, Carpenter recalls, she was on
tour and grief-stricken over her dog Riley. "One of my beloved dogs
was on chemo and was dying," Carpenter says. "That's when I stumbled
onto the Salon Web site. I clicked on a column she wrote about the
death of a friend's pet, and it spoke to me.... She said the things I
was feeling, and she said them with such naturalness and grace."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter used the Internet search engine Google to track down
Lamott and found her agent. He forwarded the message: "My name is
Mary Chapin Carpenter, and I just love Annie Lamott."</TE>
<TE>   From their work, it is evident that both Lamott and Carpenter
learned long ago that everything, no matter how dreadful, can be
crafted into a story or a song. Art is alchemy and, as a result, as
Carpenter sings in "Maybe World," "all mistakes are worth making."</TE>
<TE>   In that spirit of spinning grief into gold, Lamott's first novel,
1980's "Hard Laughter," fictionalized the death of her writer father,
Kenneth Lamott, at age 56. Her mother died last year of Alzheimer's,
and you realize that, through language, that loss is already being
transformed somewhere deep inside Lamott. She recalls watching her
mother lose her mind: "Every day there's a little bit more of the
beach that's washed away. It makes you ache."</TE>
<TE>   Like Lamott, Carpenter writes compelling stories about big
topics--thus the title of last year's album, "time*sex*love."
Carpenter is working on a new album, and she reveals something else.
In June, she plans to marry (for the first time). She declines,
however, to name her fiance.</TE>
<TE>   Accurately or not, their admirers perceive Carpenter and Lamott as
articulate survivors who know that a dark wit will keep you afloat
better than almost anything else. A five-time Grammy winner,
Carpenter established herself as a hip writer-performer of what
country singers call hurtin' songs with her 1987 debut album,
"Hometown Girl." But while her biggest hit, 1992's "He Thinks He'll
Keep Her," is about spousal servitude, Carpenter has always done more
than exploit the musical potential of misery. And those sad songs are
not necessarily about her: She is a songwriter, not an
autobiographer.</TE>
<TE>   Songwriting is cathartic, she says, "but I didn't start writing
songs as therapy." Rather, she says, "songwriting is my tool for
making sense of my world." Both women have passionate followings,
including each other.</TE>
<TE>   As for Lamott, writers all but prescribe her thin 1994 classic,
"Bird by Bird," to other writers, confident that it will cure most of
their ills, from writer's block to worry about the cloacal quality of
their first drafts. You have to love a writer who spends an entire
chapter trumpeting her jealousy of a writer who makes more money than
she does.</TE>
<TE>   As those who have read Lamott's 1993 bestseller, "Operating
Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Year," know, she is a
single mother to Sam, now 11. As a writer with responsibilities other
than craft, Lamott tends to see writing and life as a single tangle.
Even when her subject is writing, other meaningful things pop up in
her work. Among them: friendship, tricking your demons into
submission and the way children enlarge your soul and make your
keyboard sticky. Lamott is also a born-again Christian, although, as
she said during her book tour for 1999's "Traveling Mercies," she
prefers to be called a Jesus freak: "Born-again sounds too much like
'twice-baked potatoes.'"</TE>
<TE>   Lamott and Carpenter are both women over 40, as are many of their
devotees. Lamott says that half her mail comes from men and that she
never really thinks about the gender of her audience. "Women buy 75%
of the books in this country," she points out, so she always expects
to see a lot of women at her readings and signings. She recently
heard journalist David Halberstam ("War in a Time of Peace," "The
Best and the Brightest") read, and his audience was mostly women too.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter shares Lamott's appreciation of the women who support
her and shares Lamott's mild pique at the rap that she is a women's
writer. "When I sit down to write something, I write first for me,
and then you send it out into the world and see who it connects
with," Carpenter says. "I don't set out to write for women."</TE>
<TE>   A week before their concert, Lamott and Carpenter weren't sure
what they would do beyond reading and singing, respectively. Lamott
has just sent her latest novel, "Blue Shoes," to her publisher and
will include sections from that, along with past work. Asked if she
has started a new book, she says no. "I'm doing real life, with sick
cat and unopened mail."</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to show up and trust the spirit or friendship or
something and just skate together," Lamott says. "I think it will be
so cool."</TE>
<TE>   "Anne Lamott and Mary Chapin Carpenter: An Evening of Spoken Words
and Songs," UCLA's Royce Hall, Saturday, 8 p.m. $35, $25, $20 and $14
(UCLA students with valid ID). (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<HD>Jet Li Breathes Life Into 'Kiss of Dragon'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martial arts expert Jet Li is extraordinary to watch on screen and he
has some spectacular fight sequences in the suspense thriller "Kiss
of the Dragon," which was produced and co-written by French filmmaker
Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita").</LD>
<LD>   But even the presence of Li can't help this extremely violent and
often misogynistic film about a tough Chinese government agent who
becomes embroiled in a conspiracy when he is sent to Paris on a
top-secret mission.</LD>
<LD>   The DVD of "Kiss" features a wide-screen edition of the film,
production stills, theatrical trailers, storyboard-to-scene
comparisons, a pretty good mini-documentary in which Li talks about
the martial arts and another that highlights the work of action
choreographer Cory Yuen. French director Chris Nathon, Li and Bridget
Fonda, who plays a drug-addicted hooker who comes to the aid of Li,
supply the commentary.</LD>
<TE>   Though Nathon and Li are enthusiastic in their commentary, their
strong accents make it difficult to understand. Fonda, though, is
very interesting as she describes how she prepares for her movie
roles. For the first time in her life, she says, she accepted the
film without a script or even without a clue as to her character
because she loves the films of Besson and Li.</TE>
<TE>   "An American Rhapsody" is a more entertaining and enriching
experience than "Kiss of the Dragon." The drama marks the directorial
debut of film editor Eva Gardos.</TE>
<TE>   Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn star as a couple who escape
communist-ruled Hungary, only to discover that their baby daughter
has been left behind in the country. The young girl, Suzanne (played
as a teenager by Scarlett Johansson), is sent to live with foster
parents while her real parents, now living in California, try to undo
the red tape in order to get her back. At the age of 6, Suzanne is
taken from her loving foster parents and sent to live with the family
she never knew in California.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Paramount, $30) includes a nice wide-screen edition of
the film and lovely commentary from Gardos, who also wrote the film,
and her best friend and producer, Colleen Camp, who also has a small
role in the film. The two, who have known each other since they
worked together on "Apocalypse Now," talk eloquently about the
genesis of the project and the difficulties they encountered getting
the film made.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Clark, who directed the controversial drama "Kids," returns
with another difficult, uncompromising drama about today's youth,
"Bully." It is based on a true story, about a group of teenagers
drifting aimlessly in a sea of booze, drugs and sex. Brad Renfro
stars as a surfer who is physically and mentally abused by his
longtime friend, Bobby (Nick Stahl). Rachel Miner plays Renfro's
girlfriend, who decides that Bobby's reign of terror must end. Not
for the faint of heart.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Lions Gate, $25) features the wide-screen edition of the
film, a music-only soundtrack, a brief on-set interview with Clark
and interviews with the entire cast, who talk about their characters
and working with Clark. The young actors, who seem to have no qualms
in baring all in this film, have some fun with the interviewer when
she asks them how they got their roles.</TE>
<TE>   Clocking in at 225 minutes, "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India"
won the Audience Award at the 2001 Locarno International Film
Festival. The handsomely made but overlong drama (with musical
interludes) stars Aamir Khan, one of India's most popular performers.</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1893 during the reign of Queen Victoria in India, "Lagaan"
focuses on a young Indian farmer who, out of anger that his poor
village is faced to pay twice the amount of "lagaan" (tax) to the
local raj, makes a deal with the British that he and the village can
beat them at cricket. And if they do, they won't have to pay "lagaan"
for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Columbia TriStar, $28) includes a wide-screen edition of
the film, deleted scenes and filmographies.</TE>
<TE>   Daria, the star of the popular MTV animated show about a cynically
funny high school student, made her film debut in the made-for-video
feature "Daria: The Movie: Is it Fall Yet?" The 75-minute film is
very funny and should even appeal to people who have never seen the
MTV series.</TE>
<TE>   The sarcastic Daria Morgendorffer is forced by her parents to
spend her summer vacation as a volunteer at a camp for sensitive
children. Meanwhile, her younger sister, Quinn, and the other members
of her fashion club decide to get a tutor to help them improve their
scores to get into a party college.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Paramount, $20) includes two bonus episodes of the series
and a movie video. "Daria" is also available on VHS ($15) and
includes the music video.</TE>
<TE>   "Tombstone," the 1993 western about Wyatt Earp and his brothers
and their shootout at the OK Corral with the infamous Clanton gang,
comes to DVD in a two-disc set (Hollywood, $30). Kurt Russell stars
as Wyatt and Val Kilmer is Doc Holliday. "Tombstone" garnered mixed
reviews but was a surprise hit at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a behind-the-scenes featurette from 1993 that
features interviews with the stars and director George P. Cosmatos
("Rambo II"). Another featurette, "Making of an Authentic Western,"
looks at how the production and costume designers helped bring
Tombstone to life. A third, "The Gunfight at the OK Corral," examines
Cosmatos' approach to the famous shootout. There's also a timeline of
events in Tombstone leading to the shootout; the actual newspaper
stories of the event from the Tombstone Epitaph; trailers and TV
spots; Cosmatos' storyboards of the shootout; and a copy of Earp's
own map of Tombstone.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmatos, who was brought into the project to replace the original
director, Kevin Jarre, offers the pleasant commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Light Keeps Me Company" (First Run, $25 for VHS; $30 for DVD) is
a lovely valentine of a documentary to Oscar-winning Swedish
cinematographer Sven Nykvist, who is best known for his work with
Ingmar Bergman. Directed by his son, Carl-Gustaf Nykvist, the
documentary includes insightful interviews with Bergman, Woody Allen,
Susan Sarandon, Roman Polanski, Melanie Griffith, Gena Rowlands, Bibi
Andersson; clips from Nykvist's various films; home movies and family
photographs.</TE>

<TE>   PICAYO: Hidden away in residential north Laguna, a little bungalow
houses Picayo, a French restaurant with Spanish and Moroccan
influences and a taste for duck, both as appetizer and entree. Try
Chilean sea bass on eggplant with olive vinaigrette, or the napoleon
of scallops, prawns and salmon with black truffle sauce. Picayo, 610
N. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (949) 497-5051. Dinner
Tuesdays-Saturdays, 5:30-10 p.m.; brunch Sunday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   PLAZA GARIBALDI: The main attraction is the mariachi dinner show
(Fridays-Sundays). Though the limited show menu offers quality, such
as pleasing shrimp dishes and a fine carnitas entree, a larger menu
of standard Mexican dishes is served during the week. Plaza
Garibaldi, 500 N. Brookhurst Ave., Anaheim. (714) 758-9014. Lunch and
dinner Mondays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-8:30 p.m.; Fridays-Sundays, 11
a.m.-midnight. $$</TE>
<TE>   PLUMS: Once known only for breakfasts, sandwiches and salads,
Plums Cafe now offers creative entrees, ranging from fried trout to
tenderloin medallions topped by mushrooms. If it's a sandwich you
crave, the confetti meatloaf is rich with cumin flavor and the
excellent lamb-burger comes alive with fresh oregano. Plums Cafe, 369
E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (949) 722-7586. Breakfast and lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 7 a.m.-3 p.m.; Saturdays-Sundays, 8 a.m.-3 p.m. $</TE>
<TE>   POLISH RESTAURANT: First it was a plain barbecue restaurant, but
patrons liked the Polish dishes that sneaked on the menu so now it's
known as Polish Restaurant. So enjoy the potato pancakes, the
sweet-sour sauerkraut, the veal cordon bleu-like cutlet Sobieski--and
once in a while, have some of that barbecue too. Polish Restaurant,
2610 W. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 827-9074. Lunch and dinner
Tuesdays-Fridays, 11 a.m.-9 p.m.; Saturdays-Sundays, noon-9 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   THE QUIET WOMAN: The Quiet Woman leads a sedate life, but it is
one of the area's most consistently good dining spots. Entrees,
mostly cooked on a mesquite grill, include Angus beefsteaks, fresh
fish and a terrific rack of lamb. There are good salads, excellent
homemade soups and fine desserts too. Don't miss the homemade pumpkin
pie in season and the fudgy Toll House pie all year. The Quiet Woman,
3224 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (949) 640-7440. Lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; dinner Sundays-Thursdays, 5
p.m.-10 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5 p.m.-11 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   RESTAURANT ABE: Master chef Abe (pronounced AH-bay) has been
called the Matsuhisa of Orange County, and the comparison is apt: He
has worked at Nobu Matsuhisa's famed Japanese fusion restaurant in
West Hollywood. Come to Abe's Newport restaurant for the sushi if you
must, but he has far more interesting creations, such as tuna rib,
smoked monkfish liver, oddball oyster shooters and mind-blowing
omakase dinners. Restaurant Abe, 2900 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach.
(949) 675-1739. Lunch Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner
Mondays-Thursdays, 5:30-10 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5:30-10:30 p.m.;
Sundays, 5-9 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   THE RITZ: Hans Prager's ornately decorated restaurant, the Ritz,
remains a bastion of Continental cuisine after more than two decades
at Fashion Island. A well-dressed Newport crowd still turns out for
retro faves such as lobster bisque and veal Oscar. Now there is a
lovely outdoor garden area open during lunch and dinner. The Ritz,
880 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (949) 720-1800. Lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.; dinner Mondays-Thursdays, 6-10 p.m.;
Fridays, 5:30-11 p.m.; Saturdays-Sundays, 5-11 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   ROMA D'ITALIA: Tustin's busy Roma D'Italia is an old-fashioned
checked-tablecloth pizzeria/restaurant specializing in dishes with
big, rich flavors, such as chicken d'Italia, which includes eggplant,
ham, tomatoes, provolone and mushroom sauce. For something lighter,
try the mixed seafood platter in a flavorful garlic white wine sauce.
Roma D'Italia, 611 El Camino Real, Tustin. (714) 544-0273. Lunch and
dinner Sundays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 11
a.m.-10:30 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   ROYAL KHYBER: Royal Khyber is aiming to be O.C.'s top Indian
restaurant, and it has all the tools--a gorgeous dining room, an
innovative menu and the talents of chef Arun Puri in the kitchen.
Some of the dishes need more oomph, but certainly not the terrific
shrimp samosa, killer warm eggplant salad or wonderful lamb shank in
spicy broth. Royal Khyber, Fine Indian Cuisine, 1621 W. Sunflower
Ave., South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714) 436-1010. Lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner Sundays-Thursdays,
5:30-9:30 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5:30-10:30 p.m.; Sunday brunch,
11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   ROY'S: Roy's benefits from the inventive Pacific Rim cooking of
superstar Hawaii chef Roy Yamaguchi. But this isn't the islands, and
you won't find many of the fresh Hawaiian fish or Japanized items
that make the restaurant soar there. Don't miss crunchy lobster pot
stickers and blackened ahi. There also is a signature chocolate
souffle. The wine list, by the way, is priced for Honolulu, so
consider bringing your own. Roy's, 453 Newport Center Drive, Newport
Beach. (949) 640-7697. Dinner Sundays-Thursdays, 5-10 p.m.;
Fridays-Saturdays, 5-11 p.m.; holiday lunches daily, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.
$$$</TE>
<TE>   SPAGHETTINI: With a name like Spaghettini Italian Grill and Jazz
Club, it's hard to know what to expect. Not improvisation, it turns
out; the ingredients are of the highest quality, but they're used in
a cautious, lackluster way. Still, it has jazz, an open kitchen and
dramatic low lighting, and the chocolate souffle cake is a knockout.
Spaghettini Italian Grill and Jazz Club, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal
Beach. (714) 960-6002. Lunch Mondays-Fridays, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner
Sundays-Mondays, 5-9:30 p.m.; Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 5-10 p.m.;
Thursdays-Saturdays, 5-11 p.m.; brunch Sundays, 10 a.m.-2:30 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   S.W. SEAFOOD &amp; BARBECUE RESTAURANT: Featuring a mind-numbing range
of barbecue entrees (go with the pork) and seafood dishes (great
shrimp and scallops). If you're feeling particularly carnivorous,
order the blossom platter, a heaping cold-cut sampler of pork,
chicken, duck and jellyfish. S.W. Seafood &amp; Barbecue Restaurant,
5406-A Walnut Ave., Irvine. (949) 262-0128. Lunch and dinner daily,
11 a.m.-10 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   TANGATA: Joachim Splichal's museum-located restaurant is worth
going to even if you aren't interested in art. At Tangata, the famous
chef is playing with Mexican themes as well as brunch ideas like a
crab Benedict and light, "tall food" French toast. And Tangata can
give you fast service when you need it. Tangata, Bowers Museum of
Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. (714) 550-0906. Open for
lunch daily (except Mondays), 11 a.m.-3 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   TANGERINE GRILL: Though right across the street from Disneyland,
Tangerine Grill is actually a decent California cuisine restaurant.
This means Italian touches like fresh mozzarella and an imported
tangerine sorbetto, but it also grills a good Santa Maria-style strip
steak and a pork chop in a successful cranberry Bourbon sauce.
Tangerine Grill and Patio, 1030 W. Katella Ave., Anaheim, (714)
772-1186. Lunch, breakfast and dinner daily, 6 a.m.-10 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   TAPS: Taps is one of the most ambitious brew pub/restaurants ever
to open in northeast O.C. It's a 14,000-square-foot establishment
featuring gleaming copper fermentation tanks, a centrally located
oyster bar and a large, hangar-like dining room. Fresh seafoods, good
side dishes and the dozen-plus house beers are best bets. Starters,
pizzas and pastas are often either muddled or bland. Taps, 101 E.
Imperial Highway, Brea. (714) 257-0101. Daily, 11:30 a.m.-11 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   THAI PORN: This restaurant is named for its owner, Pornpan, whose
name means "blessing." But Isarn (northeast Thai) dishes are the real
blessings here. This disarmingly simple restaurant is the place to
come for raw green papaya salad (som tam), Thai barbecued chicken,
the chopped meat salad larb or anything made with the homemade sour
pork sausage. It's all quite good Thai Porn, 1739 W. La Palma Ave.,
Anaheim. (714) 956-8105. Daily, 10:30 a.m.-10 p.m. $</TE>
<TE>   THANH MY: The big deal at Thanh My, one of Little Saigon's oldest
Vietnamese restaurants, is bo 7 mon, beef served in seven courses
such as salad, soup, rice paper wrap and meatloaf. The hot pots,
cooked at your table, are also good, though messy to eat. Late
groovers, take note--Thanh My stays open till 1:30 a.m. Thanh My,
9553 Bolsa Ave., Westminster. (714) 531-9540. Lunch and dinner daily,
10 a.m.-1:30 a.m. $</TE>
<TE>   TIRAMISU: From the street, Tiramisu looks like a jewel box;
inside, it's all restrained elegance in earth tones. Many of the best
dishes, notably the thin-crust pizzas and whole fish, come from a
wood-burning oven. The pastas are fine when the kitchen goes easy on
the sauce. And yes, the tiramisu, available in three flavors, is the
star attraction. Tiramisu, 2325 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar.
(949) 673-8444. Lunch Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; dinner
Sundays-Thursdays, 5-9:45 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5-10:45 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   TROQUET: A polished French bistro in a mall? Sure, when
Aubergine's Liza and Tim Goodell are behind the operation and the
mall is South Coast Plaza. Try the celery root puree garnished with
duck confit and pears and Maryland crab cakes with a smoky chipotle
aioli and fried capers. Troquet, South Coast Plaza, 3333 Bristol
Ave., Costa Mesa. Lunch Mondays-Saturdays, 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m.; dinner
Tuesdays-Thursdays, 5:30-9 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5:30-10 p.m.;
brunch Sundays, noon-5 p.m. (714) 708-6865. $$$</TE>
<TE>   WEI'S: Wei's is O.C.'s best Chinese restaurant at the moment, a
boxy place that serves the fiery cuisine of China's Sichuan province
and much more. Look to the short house-specialties section to snare
the dishes that all these Chinese families are eating. The fabulous
stewed assorted pork has a meatball, Chinese bacon, chicken feet and
cooked spinach. Also be on the lookout for boiled salty duck and the
best sizzling rice soup around. Wei's, 17046 Magnolia St., Fountain
Valley. (714) 842-9778. Lunch Tuesdays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.;
dinner Tuesdays-Saturdays, 5-9 p.m.; Sundays, 4:30-9 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   YAMABUKI: This is really three restaurants: an elegant main dining
room, private tatami rooms (where you dine while seated on straw
mats) and a polished cedar sushi bar. Of the three, the sushi bar is
by far the best--and the most economical. Let the chefs ply you with
treats such as monkfish liver, delicious marinated raw mackerel,
broiled smelts and almost any kind of sushi. Yamabuki, Paradise Pier
Hotel, 1717 Disneyland Drive, Anaheim. (714) 239-5683. Lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner daily, 5:30-10 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   YARD HOUSE: The clubby, boisterous Yard House has 180 beers on
tap, which it claims is the world's largest selection. Chef Carlito
Jocson has cooked up a fusion menu of appealing pub dishes, such as
salmon spring rolls, grilled shrimp skewers with Indonesian fried
rice, pan-roasted sea bass and a variety of meats cooked on a
mesquite grill. Yard House, 1875 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (949)
642-0090. Lunch and dinner Sundays-Wednesdays, 11:30 a.m.-midnight;
Thursdays-Saturdays, 11:30 a.m.-1 a.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   Y ARRIBA Y ARRIBA: Y Arriba Y Arriba offers pan-Latin American
tapas along with its flashy floor show. The churrasco is a grilled
skirt steak served with a garlicky vinaigrette, the lechon is moist
Cuban roasted pork with a well-balanced sauce of garlic, lime juice
and oregano. The ceviches--all five variations--are also superb. Y
Arriba Y Arriba, Downtown Disney, Anaheim. (714) 533-8272. Lunch and
dinner daily, 11 a.m.-2 a.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   ZOV'S BISTRO: A longtime Orange County institution, Zov's has
expanded its dining space again. One still goes for hummus and baba
ghannouj, Middle Eastern gravlax, the pork prime rib in sour cherry
glaze and rich pastries such as chocolate obsession: mousse on
chocolate hazelnut crust. Zov's Bistro, 17440 E. 17th St., Tustin.
(714) 838-8855. Cafe open Mondays, 7 a.m.-2:30 p.m.;
Tuesdays-Thursdays, 7 a.m.-8 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 7 a.m.-9 p.m.
Bistro open for lunch Mondays-Fridays, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner
Tuesdays-Thursdays, 5-9 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5-10 p.m. Closed
Sundays. $$</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan may be strangers to some Orange County playhouses,
but they find a regular spotlight at the Chance Theater in Anaheim
Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The duo's greatest hits, including "The Mikado," "The Pirates of
Penzance" and "H.M.S. Pinafore," have been revived at the Chance,
which now opens its fourth season with the less frequently produced
"The Gondoliers." It's an enthusiastic staging with patches of
lifting humor, but ultimately not polished enough to satisfy this
1889 operetta.</LD>
<LD>   Director Kent Johnson and his cast find silly opportunities in the
silly story. Johnson even has the audacity to dress a quintet of
characters in Village People get-ups to rouse the second act. An old
joke, sure, but it prompts laughs and fits the production's giddy
tone.</LD>
<TE>   The nagging problem, however, is erratic singing. There are a few
charming turns, especially among the women, but it can slide from
accomplished to barely adequate in a chorus change. That just won't
do with Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's rich score.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice gondoliers of the title are Marco (Nikhil Korula) and
Giuseppe (E. Philip Schneider), ever-grinning bachelors ready to
marry the fetching Tessa (Candice Balen) and Gianetta (Kristy
Errera). They're all surprised to learn the gondoliers were
apparently born in Barataria and one of them is heir to its throne.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed in are Casilda (Erika Ceporius), the daughter of the
penniless Duke of Plaza Toro (Michael Buss) and his wife (Barbara
Gibbs). Casilda, supposedly, was married to one of the gondoliers at
birth and is now expected to join him. But she loves the lowly
drummer, Luiz (Timothy Quirus). The ominous Don Alhambra (Casey Long)
lurks about, pushing everybody this way and that as the plot unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of the best voices, fortunately, belong to Balen and
Errera. Balen's clear, bell-like tones stand out, and Errera is
always confident. Schneider also has a crisp style, but Korula seems
to talk as much as sing his tunes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a small stage, which doesn't help Jenna Kantor's fairly
demanding choreography, a combo of the athletic and twitchy Monty
Pythonesque moves. At least Oanh Nguyen's simple set, with its pretty
faux stained-glass background, doesn't intrude on the action.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gondoliers," Chance Theater, 5576 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim
Hills. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. $15 to $18. Ends
Feb. 24. (714) 821-6903.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-based artist Richard Cronin is tilling a personalized
expressive soil in his work, and it has something to do with tidily
recounted dreamscapes.</LD>
<LD>   In his show "Personal Metaphors," now at the Carnegie Art Museum,
we find a friendly brand of neo-surrealism, which he dubs "narrative
surrealism." In other words, the balance of elements and a kind of
easygoing anecdotal air lead us into interpretations of a story line
that, in fact, may or may not be present.</LD>
<LD>   Fluorescent colors amp up the visuals in "The Night Garden." As in
other paintings here, a sense of blended forms and shifting depth
hints at the irrational but maintains a design-esque decorum. "The
House" is based on the generic form of a house, with Popsicle
fireworks overhead, evoking either a celebration or a firestorm: Is
it an ambivalent tribute to suburban bliss? Your call.</LD>
<TE>   Cronin's art, both the big, loud paintings upstairs and the
meticulous pencil drawings downstairs, deals with a bank of recurring
images, including faceless faces and objects such as gears and
ladders, which lend themselves to metaphorical readings. But in the
end, his main achievement is sensory, a tendency toward eye massage.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the intriguing paintings of Ginger Moore Maxwell are
highly detailed but also conscientiously subtle. Flower subjects are
set against carefully arranged backgrounds, the shadows on which
accentuate the artist's consistent aesthetic. Her assiduous setup,
seen clearly over the course of a healthy selection of pieces, is a
critical part of the end effect. These are delicate paintings but
emboldened by the approach, as seen in "Bow," a branch of leaves with
twine, an arranged marriage of elements toward a happy whole.</TE>
<TE>   * "Personal Metaphors," the drawings and paintings of Richard
Cronin; "Supernatural," new paintings by Ginger Moore Maxwel; at
Carnegie Art Museum, 424 S. C St., Oxnard. Ends Feb. 24. Museum

<TE>   Continuing Saga Department: It's been a big month for rock vets
and gnarled family trees at the Ventura Theatre. Earlier in the
month, Eric Burdon brought his New Animals to town, touching on a
twisting musical career highlighted by the strange, seductive 1970
hit "Spill the Wine." That dizzy pre-rap classic was recorded with
the band War, formed in Long Beach back in 1969. Burdon departed the
band, but War continued boldly, its moody urban variant of R&amp;B
hitting pay dirt on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   It all might seem like ancient history by now, a quarter of a
century since a string of hits that includes "Slippin' Into
Darkness," "Cisco Kid" and "The World Is a Ghetto," except that songs
like these are embedded deeply in our psyches, awaiting rekindling.
Hear this band's ongoing saga this Saturday at the Ventura Theatre.</TE>

<HD>Clever Mimes Craft a Fine Time</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In exploring the intricacies of storytelling through physical
movement for more than 40 years, Richmond Shepard has accumulated
more than enough experience and perspective to make "A Mime's Life"
at Stages Theatre Center a meaningful career summation. It's also a
fun way to discover and appreciate some of the finer points of mime
craft from an accomplished teacher and performer.</LD>
<LD>   Making his first L.A. appearance since moving to New York 15 years
ago, the limber 72-year-old Shepard personifies an inspirational
triumph over time itself through a series of sketches and brief
autobiographical anecdotes.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the show, Shepard is joined onstage by five performers
in the ensemble mime format he introduced to America in the 1960s.
Prominent among the troupe are Russia's Janna Papsuyeva and Edward
Grigorian, who bring an Eastern European intensity and precision to
their work that complements Shepard's loose, accessible style.
Papsuyeva combines emotive dexterity with a ballerina's grace and
poise to make all of her characters riveting--from the beleaguered
homesteader's wife in a spaghetti western parody to a jack that
Shepard uses to fix a spare tire.</LD>
<TE>   The American mime contingent--Ann Michele Fitzgerald, Emily
Calabrese and Cher Ferreyra--acquit themselves capably as well. An
offstage musical ensemble is directed by Omar Kaczmarczyk, who also
provides perfectly timed sound effects and occasional narration.</TE>
<TE>   Shepard's material mines as much comic material from the
commonplace (a car ride in whichcast members become various
automotive components) as it does from the fanciful (a trip to the
moon, affording a skillful illusion of weightlessness). A more
sobering piece about the self-destructive cycles of civilization was
adapted from a James Thurber story. Generally, though, the pieces
aren't highly conceptual--Shepard's natural domain is good-natured
whimsy, and by and large he sticks to it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does he try to elevate his craft above its entertainment value
(his humility and lack of pretension are part of the show's genuine
delight). In a short solo tour of some basic combinations of head and
chest positions, he economically demonstrates the evocative power of
pure physicality to define the essentials of character.</TE>
<TE>   Equally engaging are Shepard's personal reminiscences and
reflections, delivered in a breezy, self-deprecating style that
invites us to share in a celebration of his life. A hilarious "Dawn
of Mime" sequence spoofing the beginning of "2001: A Space Odyssey"
makes a fitting finale. For anyone who enjoys the craft, buying a
ticket to this show is your perfect opportunity to help get mimes off
the street and onto the stage where they belong.</TE>

<LD>Tell you what, there's nothing like a bit of pain to bring this scene
together.</LD>
<LD>   After mourning the recent death of Betty Blowtorch's Bianca
Halstead, Hollywood's rock community was dealt another blow: Carrie
Hamilton, a dear friend of the L.A. scene, died of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The first time I met Hamilton, she was strolling down Ventura
Boulevard with Danny Nordahl from Motochrist. I recall thinking she
was possibly the coolest woman I'd ever encountered.... An important
benefit is taking place Saturday at Mr. T's Bowl in Highland Park for
a member of the L.A. punk scene, Maddog, the drummer for the Leaving
Trains and the Controllers. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
recently, and such artists as the Humpers, Mike Watt, the Rotters and
others are scheduled to perform to raise money for her rising medical
costs. That's so righteous....</LD>
<TE>   In happy news, took my folks to my favorite Persian restaurant,
The Spot in Encino, and found Johnny from Johnny and His Band still
crooning the night away. Me and mum did the twist to timeless
classics by Neil Diamond, Kris Kristofferson and Tom Jones. 'Twas
lovely.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sooooo jealous of Gate/Lounge/A.D. diva Cheryl Rixon-Davis.
Not only did Queen's Freddy Mercury give the former Penthouse Pet of
the Year one of his leopard coats--which she still wears!--but her
cell phone plays Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine." That so rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Heard Star Shoes' new bimonthly Friday night scene, Funky Sole, is
off the hook. The promotion, which takes place on the second and
fourth Fridays of each month, was started by the folks behind Gabah's
successful Thursday night club, the Root Down. Rooty tooty.... We're
thrilled to announce that as of this week, scene author Clynt
Catalyst took a No. 1 slot at Amazon.com. His sexy thriller
"Cottonmouth Kisses" reached the top slot of the Amazon's Gay &amp;
Lesbian book chart.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of Vandal/attorney/matador Joe Escalante can check out his
bullfighting talents in early June in Tecate, Mexico. We'll keep you
posted.</TE>
<TE>   It's gonna be hot in Old Town Pasadena tonight, as the White Trash
Debutantes and Snap-Her wreak havoc at the Old Town Pub on Fair Oaks
Avenue. Hot dawg! .... Speaking of Pasadena, had dinner with
nightclub veteran Kevin Lyman at Gordon Biersch in Old Town. As we
were leaving, we got caught in a WB party whirlwind. Alas, there
wasn't a Gilmore Girl in site.</TE>
<TE>   Handsome club owner Paul DeVitt of Star Shoes tells me the bar has
a new Thursday night indie rock scene, with DJ Otefsu....Chatted up
my good friend Bruce Haring, whose DIY Convention kicks off on Feb. 9
at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood. This year's keynote
speaker is Smithereens singer/songwriter/guitarist Pat DiNizio, who's
now a programmer for XM satellite radio.... Speaking of DIY (do it
yourself), Bad Religion kicks off three nights of fun and frolic with
tonight's Whisky show. The legendary punk band plays the Roxy manana
and the Key Club on Saturday. The new album, "Process of Belief," is
so good, I signed up for all three shows.</TE>
<TE>   We hear the Sunday Social, now in its sixth year at Louis XIII in
Hollywood, is in fighting form.... Wow. The Knitting Factory in
Hollywood has all these great shows coming up but isn't allowed to
advertise them. Good thing there's Club Buzz. Look for Macy Gray next
Wednesday, Feb. 6 and Feb. 20. And Guttermouth is scheduled for Feb.
1. Rock on yo.... Multi-tasking fashion hottie Christina Carey can be
found deejaying at the Room in Hollywood when she's not running her
store, Blest Boutique. If Christina's there, you can bet there's a
scene. And you didn't hear this from me, but Highlands' partner Kenny
Griswold just leased a 35,000-square-foot spot in the heart of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   And the beat goes on....</TE>

<HD>A Charming 'Don'</HD>
<DH>Opera Pacific's version of Mozart's 'Don Giovanni' gives
the music center stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new production of "Don Giovanni" by Opera Pacific shows the company
at its most accomplished and charming. The music-making is
first-rate, the visual realization of Mozart's masterpiece striking,
the singing ensemble admirable.</LD>
<LD>   A co-production with the opera companies of Pittsburgh, New York
and Tulsa, this "Giovanni," which opened Tuesday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, was directed by Thor Steingraber in
collaboration with designer Riccardo Hernandez, with costumes by
David Woolard and lighting by Chris Binder.</LD>
<LD>   The set is not so much minimal as it is effectively abstract. It
consists of two vertical thrusts--one a stage-tall door at the left,
the other a stage-high opening in the center--and a low wall with two
doors, at the right. The props are simple tables and chairs. The
moody and specific lighting is where most of the atmosphere is
created in this production, including a motif of projected clouds
evoking the heavenly judgment that awaits the unrepentant rake, Don
Giovanni.</LD>
<TE>   Steingraber's direction matches the stripped-down set. He's
unobtrusive--the actors move naturally; the acting is as effective as
the singing. As he did in two previous productions at Los Angeles
Opera ("Cinderella" and "The Capulets and the Montagues"),
Steingraber succeeds by allowing the music to be the main event.</TE>
<TE>   And the music comes off the stage and out of the pit handsomely,
from a tight ensemble of principals, a good chorus and an able
orchestra, led by John DeMain, who proves himself (again) to be an
authoritative Mozartean conductor. From the overture through the
epilogue, the joys of the score are delivered.</TE>
<TE>   The strong cast begins with the convincingly sung Don of William
Shimell, who creates an anti-hero of vulnerability and human
weaknesses whose bravado is transparent. Shimell's Giovanni is not
charismatic but highly faceted and his singing not showy, but
functional. He is a contrast to Kyle Ketelson's resourceful,
well-sung Leporello.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Goerke makes an imposing, commanding Donna Anna more
capable than touching. On the other hand, Pamela Armstrong's
virtuosic singing of Donna Elvira's music and nuanced acting proved
noble throughout. Robert Breault's Don Ottavio treats the character
seriously and sings beautifully through challenging musical hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Sari Gruber was a charming Zerlina, Mark McCrory (who sings the
Don on Friday) her bluff Masetto. In his two appearances, David
Michael had the right voice and the proper dramatic weight for the
Commendatore. And the convincingly staged fight scene in Act One was
the handiwork of choreographer Mark Antonio Pritchett.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Don Giovanni" will be repeated Thurs., Fri. and Sat. at 7:30
p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $25-$175. (800) 34-OPERA.</TE>

<LD>They had me at the view.</LD>
<LD>   Forget about the opulence and ambition of the new Highlands
nightclub in Hollywood--its French stone floors, private parties and
grand openings. Just consider the view: The club looks directly out
over the new Hollywood Boulevard, and it's a sight to behold, a Vegas
in miniature, with "bright lights, big city" written all over it in
sparkly neon. At long last, the promise of revitalization is coming
true, and the Highlands--a 25,000-square-foot, split-level space in
the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex--couldn't have made its debut at a
more opportune time. Although it's too soon to pass judgment on the
shopping and entertainment complex (where occupancy is about 75%),
the Highlands nightclub is a strong component.</LD>
<LD>   Its owners, L.A. nightclub impresarios Nick and Jim Colachis and
Tod and Kenny Griswold, made some good decisions early on. The
nightclub was originally divided into three separate, walled-off
spaces, with no views. Nick Colachis had a better idea. Take down the
walls, turn it into one club and extend an enormous outdoor terrace
overlooking the boulevard. Voila, the view--the thing that sets
Highlands apart. There have never been so many clubbing choices in
Hollywood, and that's the edge Highlands needs to woo guests.</LD>
<TE>   Wolfgang Puck created the menu, and the club scored some of its
other key employees from a recent House of Blues downsizing. Its
biggest coup is former HoB talent buyer John Pantle, who booked
exciting, cutting-edge bands at that Sunset Strip nightclub for eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Pantle's plans for the 1,300-capacity Highlands include biweekly
live music bashes aiming for an upscale clientele. Upcoming shows
include the Nortec Collective Feb. 7, John Waite on Feb. 21 and Andy
Garcia with Cachao on March 7.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a favorite scene veteran, Glyn Samuel (Martini,
Hell's Gate, Glam Slam) has been tapped to be the nightclub's general
manager. By hiring familiar faces with good track records, the owners
are taking shortcuts many new clubs don't consider or can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the view, and the easy freeway access--right off the
Hollywood (101) Freeway at Highland Avenue--the club has one more leg
up on the competition: parking. There are so many levels of
underground parking at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex that you
might get the bends in the elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, though, its strength is that the owners are pros. The
Colachis brothers kept L.A. rolling in the '80s and into the '90s
with downtown's Vertigo nightclub, which evolved into Glam Slam when
they sold it to Prince in the mid-'90s. Partner Kenny Griswold owns
ski resorts and Harry O's in Park City, Utah, and is a partner in
L.A.'s Sunset Room. They've already come up with a club motto: Class
at last. And in a visual sense, the class is apparent. Its seems they
spared little expense to design a club that is both modern and warm.
For every wrought-iron staircase there's a comfy couch.</TE>
<TE>   The Highlands weekend deejays include Chris Paul from Sting
Fellows in London, and such popular turntablists as Johnny Knight and
Farouk, who battle it out to be top dog every Friday and Saturday.
Adding to the fun are strolling violinists and magicians, as well as
smaller jazz and blues combos playing in some of the club's dining
nooks. For a club so large, there are plenty of places to get cozy.
It's easy to find refuge from the thumping noise of the dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Boulevard, with its funky mishmash of trash and class,
may never be the Sunset Strip. But with the debut of the Highlands,
it just got one step closer.</TE>

<HD>Oaxaca's Subtle Complexities</HD>
<DH>Authentic flavors--especially in the moles--are El
Danzante's specialty. Fans keep tables full.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At El Danzante, a little Oaxacan place on Pico Boulevard near Western
Avenue, the food is not watered down for American tastes. And it's
terrific--often, every table is occupied.</LD>
<LD>   The moles (most of them are available in either pork or chicken
versions) include a mole negro that is complex with herbal and berry
tones and not too sweet. It approaches the best I've tasted in Oaxaca
itself.</LD>
<LD>   Coloradito, a deep, brick-red mole, balances the acrid taste of
dried chiles with some sweetness and rich hints of chocolate. Quite
spicy, it is also used as an enchilada sauce. And that is one fine
plate of enchiladas, accompanied by beans and grilled Oaxacan
chorizo, or, if you prefer, cecina (a thin square of grilled spicy
pork) or tasajo (much the same made from beef, but without the
chiles).</LD>
<TE>   El Danzante's version of green mole (mole verde) is hot with
jalapenos and dominated by the anise flavor of hierba santa, the
characteristic herb of Oaxacan cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   "Estofado" means stew, but in El Danzante's estofado mole, the
components aren't distinct in the familiar way; they're blended into
a smooth, creamy sauce that is slightly sweet and mild, although the
menu says it contains chiles as well as tomatillos, raisins, olives,
nuts and spices. A subtle aroma of almonds drifts up from the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Amarillo, the yellow mole, is rather dull compared to these, but
that's the way it is in Oaxaca. Lightly thickened with masa and
available with either chicken or beef, the sauce is seasoned with
cumin, cloves and chiles, but not enough to make it spicy-hot. It
comes in a bowl, along with potatoes, green beans and chayotes.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, the restaurant serves barbacoa de chivo (barbecued
goat). It's stained red with chiles, as is the consomme that comes
with it. Black beans cooked to a creamy puree and perfumed with
fragrant Mexican avocado leaves accompany the barbacoa and other
dishes. With their strong anise-like scent, these leaves add an
intriguing flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Other Oaxacan dishes on the menu include enfrijoladas (tortillas
dipped into black bean puree, folded and topped with cheese),
cheese-filled quesadillas and empanadas filled with chicken in yellow
or green mole. And then there are clayudas and memelas.</TE>
<TE>   The clayuda is, in effect, a Oaxacan tostada. The base is not
crisp, fried tortillas but a somewhat dry and chewy extra-large
tortilla. The restaurant imports these from Oaxaca. They are daubed
first with asiento--the browned residue left when pork is fried for
carnitas--then spread with black beans and topped with shredded
cheese and a few strands of green cabbage. Clayudas come with any of
the Oaxacan cured meats or with quesillo, a Oaxacan string cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Memelas are thick tortillas topped, like clayudas, with asiento,
beans and cheese. Owner Armando Aguilar makes the tortillas for the
empanadas, quesadillas and memelas himself, flattening the masa in an
extra-large hand press.</TE>
<TE>   This hard-working young chef leads a double life. During the day,
he cooks at El Danzante. At night he heads for Cafe Med in Sunset
Plaza to cook Italian food while his wife, Maricela, takes over at El
Danzante. A few Italian dishes have crept onto El Danzante's menu,
among them fried calamari and a mussel and clam soup.</TE>
<TE>   Drinks made with watermelon, cantaloupe, tamarind or jamaica
flowers go well with this food, but they are not always available.
The most unusual is the Oaxacan specialty agua de chilacayota. The
chilacayota is a squash that separates into strands, much as
spaghetti squash does. El Danzante makes the drink the classic way,
adding chunks of fresh pineapple, shavings of lime zest and Mexican
brown sugar, which contributes a molasses flavor and dark brown
color. Despite the murky hue, the drink is light and refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast includes typical Mexican eye-openers like chilaquiles
(tortilla hash) but also an egg-white omelet stuffed with mushrooms,
poached eggs on spinach on an English muffin and French toast with
almonds and raspberry sauce. There are lattes, espressos and
cappuccinos too, the ambience of Sunset Plaza transported to the
other side of town.</TE>
<TE>   El Danzante, 3071 W. Pico Blvd., L.A. (323) 735-4688. Open from 8
a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. No alcohol. Street parking. Cash only. Dinner
for two, food only, about $14.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: negro (black mole), verde (green), coloradito (red),
estofado, clayudas, enchiladas, barbacoa (weekends only), agua de
chilacayota.</TE>

<HD>Alex Gives a Refreshing Twist to Citrus' Old Space</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After French chef Michel Richard decamped to Washington, D.C., and
became a star there, he seemed to lose interest in his first
restaurant and Los Angeles. Citrus, which opened in 1987, closed in
2000 and has sat empty ever since.</LD>
<LD>   Who can forget Citrus' white umbrellas and Richard's marvelously
inventive California-French cooking? In its heyday, it was a
destination for food lovers around the country.</LD>
<LD>   That was then. Now a young chef, Cordon Bleu-trained Alex
Scrimgeouer, late of Saddle Peak Lodge, has moved into the space and
scrawled his name in large letters out front. He's also completely
changed the look of the place. It's a surprise, and a pleasant one.</LD>
<TE>   Inviting, Deco-inspired leather armchairs are grouped around the
bar, which hasn't been moved. The wall between the main dining room
and the bar has been removed, though. And the interior has been given
a modernist makeover with dark wood beams, contemporary furniture and
discreet touches of stained glass. The effect is both comfortable and
elegant.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when many restaurateurs are looking to the bottom line,
Scrimgeouer is taking the high road to fine dining. The weight of the
silverware will give you an idea of how much he's spent. It's a menu
on which appetizers average $15, middle courses $12 and all the main
courses $29, desserts $9--until you discover a four-course menu
(choose one item from each category) is $58. This is clearly the way
to go, unless you opt to "let Alex cook for you" for a cool $85 per
person.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ambitious menu, but one Scrimgeouer seems capable of
handling if a recent meal there is anything to go by. Among the first
courses is a delightful coriander-crusted skate wing with leek fondue
and a duck leg confit paired with a little Nicoise-style tapenade. I
liked the bright taste of his vinegar-marinated anchovies, which he
accompanied with some Spanish raw-cured ham and velvety roasted
piquillo peppers.</TE>
<TE>   Among the middle courses is a delicious asparagus and quail's egg
salad with a piquant saffron remoulade. I'm going back, too, for the
grilled langoustine, which tastes as if it were live moments before
it was cooked. Don't leave a drop of the anchovy butter behind.</TE>
<TE>   Cote de boeuf makes quite a feast for two; the beef is prime and
aged 21 days. If you order lamb, it comes two ways, as chops and
ossobuco.</TE>
<TE>   Scrimgeouer does some interesting things with fish, too, without
going over the top. John Dory, for example, is served simply with
mascarpone-swirled polenta. The surprise was my wild mushroom
risotto--for my taste, too strong in flavor, but he got the texture
right, which is an achievement in itself.</TE>
<TE>   Order the dark chocolate souffle at the beginning of the meal and
you're all set. Unless, that is, you'd prefer "Alex's daily pairing
of imported cheeses" for a $5 supplement.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of Alex is one more sign that the L.A. restaurant
scene may be, finally, on the comeback trail.</TE>
<TE>   Scrimgeouer doesn't seem to be the cautious type: He's already
started serving lunch weekdays. The tariff is $29 for a three-course
prix fixe menu.</TE>

<HD>Getting Kids' Attention in the Era of Britney Spears</HD>
<DH>Norman Foote and others have a few tricks up their sleeves
for a series starting this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era of teen divas and boy bands, traditional children's
performers have a hard enough time attracting an audience. But what's
a kid's entertainer to do when even his own progeny prefer a Britney
Spears CD to Dad performing live?</LD>
<LD>   For Norman Foote, an award-winning singer, songwriter and
puppeteer who has released five CDs, the trick is to let the audience
pitch in. Booked to perform Saturday at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, Foote prides himself on interactive stories and songs that
both parents and kids love. Still, he knows what he'll be up against.</LD>
<LD>   "Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync--that is what
they really want to hear," says the Vancouver-based Foote, whose two
youngest children are 6 and 8. "I know my kids do, but some of us
have survived, and that is really lucky."</LD>
<TE>   By us he means the kinds of performers who will be joining him
during the Performing Arts Center's second-annual Family Saturdays
series, which starts this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Foote, the first act, will sing songs from his latest album, "One
Thousand Pennies," accompanied by a few giant puppets that he calls
"props with attitude."</TE>
<TE>   He'll be followed in the coming months by African and Mexican
dancers and a comic/poet. There will be an acting troupe that will
introduce kids to gender issues with a tale about a boy who wakes up
one day to find himself a girl. There also will be musicians who play
their own instruments. The performances, once or twice a month, run
through June 1.</TE>
<TE>   No pyrotechnic displays, backup vocalists, roadies or spandex.
Just modest events at small prices--as little as $5--bolstered by
creativity and a love for the living arts.</TE>
<TE>   Series organizer Lynn Jenner said she created the series last year
as a way for kids to learn about the performing arts in all of its
rich traditions--not just through the bits and pieces heard on the
radio or seen on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Jenner is an Emmy Award-winning producer of PBS programming and a
former fifth- and sixth-grade teacher and wanted something that could
educate without feeling like a lecture.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted a program that appeals to the whole family," Jenner
said. "We wanted it interactive, we wanted it fun and where they are
also learning something.... It is entertainment, but it is not
fluff."</TE>
<TE>   Underwritten by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and
United California Bank, the series was not planned as a profit-making
venture, Jenner said. Instead, she hopes the series will help to
advertise the Performing Arts Center and draw audiences to its other
music programs, such as the L.A. Philharmonic or the L.A. Opera.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even begin to break even," Jenner said. "It is something
we all felt strongly about, that this program could operate as
outreach, as an investment in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Jenner also took pains to make the shows accessible in other ways.
The series is actually two sets of four performances, one aimed at
children ages 3 to 6, the other for kids in elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   The Pillow Theatre shows for younger tots have no raised stage.
Instead, children in the audience sit on cushions on the floor while
performers stand in their midst, encouraging interaction. The layout
also allows everyone an unobstructed view of the action--a sensitive
point among very young children, Jenner said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Pillow Theatre, the kids don't hold themselves back at
all," Jenner said. "They just giggle and laugh, and when the
performer asks a question, all these hands go up. They all want to
answer."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Young Arts series is aimed at kids ages 5 to 9.
Last year's Young Arts series invited kids as old as 12, but, Jenner
soon found, "we were competing with soccer."</TE>
<TE>   This will be Foote's first time performing for the series, and his
act, titled "Step to It," will be part of Pillow Theatre. He plans to
tell stories based on his own childhood, including a tale of a family
cat dubbed "Mother" after she bore a litter.</TE>
<TE>   In his decade as an entertainer, Foote says he's gotten the
biggest laughs when he reaches into the more cringe-worthy moments of
his own past.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always embarrassing to say, 'Someone get mother off the
table,' or 'Mother is standing on the counter again,'" Foote said.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Foote says, better to share such embarrassment than
lose his audience to Spears.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a healthy alternative," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If the Family Saturdays concept goes well, Jenner hopes to take
the series on the road in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "That would take the center's name out to the public," Jenner
said. "It's one dream I have."</TE>

<HD>MOCA Lists 2001 Acquisitions</HD>
<DH>Large sculptures by Nancy Rubins, Gabriel Orozco and Paul

<LD>A large-scale sculpture with an equally large-scale title--Nancy
Rubins' 2001 work "Chas' Stainless Steel, Mark Thompson's Airplane
Parts, About 1000 Pounds of Stainless Steel Wire and Gagosian's
Beverly Hills Space," fashioned from used airplane parts--is among
the artworks acquired through gifts and purchases by the Los Angeles
Museum of Contemporary Art in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The list of 130 works acquired last year, announced Wednesday,
also includes large-scale sculptures by Gabriel Orozco and Paul
McCarthy. The outsized pieces represent the first major sculpture
acquisitions to MOCA's collection by the three artists, all of whom
have had exhibitions at the museum. MOCA also acquired another
large-scale work, Joel Shapiro's 1981 "Untitled," from the artist's
early career. The museum will not comment on the acquisitions' value.
A selection will go on display Sunday at MOCA's Pacific Design Center
space. The museum is looking into exhibiting some of the larger-scale
works at its downtown sites later in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Other significant acquisitions include Mona Hatoum's "Map (second
version)" (1999); William Kentridge's "Medicine Chest" (2001);
McCarthy's "Tokyo Santa, Santa's Trees" (1999); Orozco's "Toilet
Ventilators (Ventiladores toilet)" (1997/2000), which was a gift from
the artist; and Sara Sze's "Many a Slip."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles collector Kourosh Larizadeh contributed 21 works by
L.A. artists, including Chris Finley, Jason Meadows, Pentti
Monkkonen, Jorge Pardo, Jason Rhoades, Sarah Seager and Jim Shaw.
Judd Marmor donated Walter de Maria's "High Energy Unit" (1966),
Donald Judd's "Untitled" (date unknown), Jean-Michel Basquiat's
"Untitled" (circa 1982) and Oyvind Fahlstrom's "Study for Lithograph
to Poem by Walasse Ting" (1963).</TE>
<TE>   With funds from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in
New York and former Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, now
president of the Warhol foundation, the museum purchased two works
from 2000 by Christopher Williams, three works on paper by Jim
Isermann, and Louise Lawler's "Pleasure More." Wachs also personally
donated six works, including works by John Cage, Ann Chu, Nancy
Dwyer, Robert Rauschenberg and Susan Hartnett.</TE>
<TE>   Artist James Welling, whose mid-career survey of photographs was
presented at MOCA in 2001, made a gift of 37 photographs spanning his
career. And artist Mike Kelley donated three works by other artists:
William Leavitt's "Interior With Cactus Painting and Spiral (1984),
Franz West's "0 15" (1994-1999) and Isermann's "Untitled." Drawings
added to the collection include works by Barry Le Va, Adrian Piper
and Lari Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   Through the Curator's Discretionary Fund, the museum purchased
Robert Barry's "Invitation Piece" (1972-73), Richard Hawkins' "black,
green, blue" (2000), Los Carpintero's "Caja" (2001), Allan Sekula's "
Untitled Slide Sequence" (1972), Diana Thater's "RGB windows for
MOCA" (1992/2001) and Hellen Van Meene's "Untitled (Series Blanc)"
(1995-1998).</TE>

<HD>Sweet Baby J'ai Offers Vocal Pyrotechnics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's never any doubt who's in command when singer Sweet Baby J'ai
is on stage. Sweeping magisterially from one side to the other,
urging her musicians with body language and vocal exhortations,
interacting with her listeners, she is a consummate entertainer,
constantly seeking to make the most of every possible performing
moment.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, before a packed-house,
enthusiastic crowd, Sweet Baby J'ai (the only name she uses) was in
high gear from the first notes of her opening number--an offbeat
rendering of Thelonious Monk's "In Walked Bud." The balance of the
program, virtually all of it drawn from her new CD, "Evolution"
(Sunset Music Group), continued at the same pace, driven by J'ai's
seemingly inexhaustible supply of musical energy.</LD>
<LD>   Equally important, she worked hard to bring a new perspective to
virtually every tune. There was, for example, a quirky version of
"Nature Boy," with atmospheric accompaniment from Sherman Ferguson's
drumming, Carol Chaikin's flute playing and an unidentified
participant's simulated bird whistles--unusual, but intriguing. The
Ray Charles hit "Hit the Road, Jack" emerged in combination with "I
Got Rhythm," and the Gershwins' "Summertime" was positioned within a
rap about the glory days of Central Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   A pair of originals--"Hypnotize," a hard-grooving blues, and
"Evolution"--displayed J'ai's songwriting skills, and an all-join-in
rendering of "Meet Me Wit' Your Black Drawers On"--a suggestive blues
that has become her signature number--provided an appropriate climax
to a pyrotechnic evening of music.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Chaikin and Ferguson, J'ai was ably supported by
pianist Danny Grissett, bassist Trevor Ware and, sitting in for the
final number, saxophonist Steve Carr and trombonist Kerry Loeschen.</TE>

<HD>Hockey Goes Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Before the NHL All-Star game Feb. 2, celebrities and fans
will get their own chance to compete.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the trendy surf 'n' sun environment of Los Angeles, the mention of
puck can just as easily bring to mind Wolfgang as it does a
vulcanized rubber disc sliding across the ice.</LD>
<LD>   But next week, the National Hockey League will attempt to
temporarily turn Hollywood into Hockeywood with a series of special
events preceding its All-Star game on Feb. 2 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the NHL's greatest players assembled in Los
Angeles--1981--the league's itinerant All-Star game was just that--an
All-Star game. Since then, this annual convergence of the world's
best stick-wielding talent on ice has evolved into a multi-day
festivity that also includes a slew of fan-friendly activities.</LD>
<TE>   And the savvy marketers at the NHL promise that this year's
All-Star bash will represent its glitziest and hippest midseason
celebration to date.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a different approach this year and making everything
more of an entertainment show because we will be in the entertainment
capital," said Greta Palmer, manager of events and entertainment for
the NHL. "We want to offer something to fans of the sport and future
fans of the sport by offering both hockey and entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   A celebrity hockey game, performances by local rock bands and
appearances by a number of non-hockey playing celebrities will help
bring a distinct L.A. feel to the whole shebang, which runs Wednesday
through next Saturday (Feb. 2).</TE>
<TE>   The benefit celebrity game will take place at Staples Center on
Wednesday night. Film producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Black Hawk Down"
and "Pearl Harbor") will lead a squad of hyped-up entertainers
against a team captained by television creator-writer David E. Kelley
("Ally McBeal," "The Practice" and "Boston Public"). Cuba Gooding
Jr., Kiefer Sutherland, Alex Trebek and Brendan Fehr will be among
the celebrities skating for Bruckheimer's Bad Boys. Denis Leary,
Jason Priestley, Scott Wolf and Joshua Jackson will be among the
stars lining up for Kelley's Heroes. The skill level of both teams
will be greatly enhanced by the participation of ex-NHL greats such
as Phil Esposito, Jari Kurri and Dave Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   "I never in a million years thought I would get a chance to skate
with Phil Esposito and Jari Kurri," says Fehr, an actor on the UPN
television drama "Roswell." "Being from Canada, this is going to be
one of the most exciting moments of my life. If I skate on a line
with Jari [who teamed with Wayne Gretzky for many years in Edmonton],
I am going to have big shoes to fill in feeding him those passes!"</TE>
<TE>   Taking a Slap Shot at Contests, Prizes</TE>
<TE>   Taking place at the Los Angeles Convention Center next door to
Staples Center, NHL All-Star FANtasy will anchor the festivities
leading up to the NHL All-Star game. This multifaceted fan fair will
take place over the course of the four-day celebration.</TE>
<TE>   At All-Star FANtasy, puck followers will get a chance to test
their slap shot against a radar gun and tend goal in a
virtual-reality setting.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia contests with prizes, exhibits featuring the Stanley Cup
and NHL memorabilia, street hockey clinics, vendors hawking hockey
merchandise and various interactive activities will add to this
celebration of the coolest game on ice. Hockey masks designed and
painted by various celebrities such as Britney Spears, the cast of
"The West Wing" and Mel Gibson will also be on display.</TE>
<TE>   Special hockey games occurring at a Convention Center ice rink
include a match pitting the gold medal-winning 1980 U.S. Olympic team
against a group of former NHL players at 3 p.m. next Friday (Feb. 1);
a battle between USC and UCLA at 8 p.m. next Thursday (Jan. 31); and
the Los Angeles Police Department facing off against the New York
Police Department at 10 a.m. next Saturday (Feb. 2).</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten more calls from the media about the U.S. Olympic
reunion game because of the upcoming Olympics [starting Feb. 8 in
Salt Lake City] and the NYPD-LAPD game because of the [social]
climate [in this country since Sept. 11]," Palmer says.</TE>
<TE>   Live music will be offered nightly at All-Star FANtasy. The
Irish-flavored rock band the Young Dubliners will kick up its Celtic
heels on Wednesday night; alternative rockers Unwritten Law will play
next Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   A skills competition featuring current NHL stars on Friday night
at Staples Center and the NHL All-Star game on Saturday afternoon are
both sold out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NHL All-Star FANtasy takes place at the Los Angeles Convention
Center, 1201 S. Figueroa St., L.A., Wed., 4-10 p.m.; next Thu. (Jan.
31), 4-11 p.m.; next Fri. (Feb. 1), 1 p.m.-midnight; Sat. (Feb. 2), 9
a.m.-midnight. Adults, $15; ages 2-12 and seniors, $10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NHL All-Star Celebrity Challenge game occurs Wed. at 7:30 p.m.
at Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., L.A. $25 and $10. Tickets
also include admission to NHL All-Star FANtasy. (800) 4 NHL FANS or

<LD>   Night of the Witch's Brew: Songs to Chill &amp; Thrill. Global
Creative Group. CD: $16. Ages 7 to 14. (310) 937-7275.</LD>
<LD>   There's more going on in this unusual independent release than the
title suggests. The inventively atmospheric songs--which paint such
images as a haunted house with a "whispering floor," rooftop
gargoyles with teeth "green with mold" and a ghoulish switchboard
operator for the dead's "Afterline"--skew older than expected for a
reason. They tell the coming-of-age story, rock opera-style, about an
angst-ridden teenage vampire named Vinny.</LD>
<TE>   Production values are outstanding, and a nifty illustrated booklet
of lyrics bridges the songs with a dramatic narrative about the
spoiled "son of a well-known Count and Countess," whose
spine-tingling journey toward self-discovery includes a magic mirror
that reveals the true face of evil.</TE>
<TE>   The urgent, wickedly fun Oingo-Boingo-ish music is by
multi-instrumentalist Patrick Bolen; Heidi Nye wrote the story and
the clean but devilishly evocative lyrics--not recommended for
preschoolers or nightmare-prone grade schoolers--are by Jack David
Grimshaw.</TE>
<TE>   Singin' in My Heart: Songs of Love and Friendship. Music for
Little People. CD: $17; cassette: $11. For the Family. (800)
409-2457. www.mflp .com</TE>
<TE>   Music for Little People can be counted on for heartwarming,
family-friendly compilations of pop music for special occasions, and
that pretty much sums up this almost-Valentine's Day release.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly performed by the original artists, songs include "Lean on
Me," with Bill Withers; "Put a Little Love in Your Heart," with
Jackie DeShannon; and Seals &amp; Crofts' "Get Closer." Maria Muldaur's
version of "Bushel &amp; a Peck" is here, and the Music for Little People
kid singers pipe up sweetly in their version of the Beatles' "All You
Need Is Love."</TE>

<TE>   Adventures in Oz With Cheryl: Yellow Brick Road. Ozsome
Enterprises. VHS: $10. Ages 3 to 8. (800) 234-8318.
www.adventuresinoz .com</TE>
<TE>   What if Dorothy were an exercise guru with biceps the size of
grapefruit? Would it be smackdown city for the Wicked Witch?</TE>
<TE>   Not in this offbeat, upbeat, nonviolent kids' fitness video, one
of three in a series from "American Gladiators" champion and personal
trainer Cheryl Ann Silich. In this Oz, niceness and healthy living
conquer all.</TE>
<TE>   Decked out in an arm- and midriff-baring Dorothy outfit and
magical, talking tennis shoes, Silich gives the L. Frank Baum classic
an anti-couch-potato twist. The yellow brick road takes viewers
through a musical adventure that includes physical and breathing
exercises, nutrition tips and positive, character-building messages.</TE>
<TE>   Her companions are pretty much what you'd expect--Scarecrow,
TinKid and Lion--although TinKid's clearly been pumping iron and
Toto's replacement is the talking Lizard of Oz, a small, green,
peculiar-looking animatronic reptile in a fez.</TE>
<TE>   The colorful, theatrical sets and special effects are
professionally done, with a big-budget look. Silich's positive energy
is infectious, once the sheer magnitude of her physical presence
ceases to startle. Her actors are notably professional, and the
easy-to-follow exercises are presented with a sense of fun and
sing-along rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   The least effective element is an animated "Key to Fitness"
character who pops up at strategic moments, freezing the action to
shine down on the travelers and dispense advice. His voicing could
use more clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Available Feb. 12, "Yellow Brick Road," the second video in the
series, is intermediate level; "Munchkidland," the first in the
series, is for beginners; the third, "Emerald City," features
advanced exercises.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone is killing Los Angeles' Judy Garland impersonators. Called to
the scene of the latest murder, the man who coached the
victims--himself a great interpreter--wails, "How many more times
does Judy Garland have to die?"</LD>
<LD>   Meant to pass for humor, the line serves instead as an epitaph for
the new comedy "Doing Judy!," which subjects Garland's memory to a
thousand deaths.</LD>
<LD>   In this visiting production at the Matrix Theatre, first-time
playwright Dan Evans tries for a '40s film noir-style mystery, set in
a comically improbable milieu. Problem is, he never finds quite the
right tone. His characters--many of whom are gay--tend to come off as
tart-tongued stereotypes, and he bungles the central mystery by
providing plenty of red herrings but too few real clues. A
murder-mystery is no fun if the audience can't play along.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Pardoe's staging struggles to keep up with the shifts in mood.
But its best moments achieve a playful film-noir quality, thanks in
part to the moody designs of Frank McKown (lights), Terry Gordon
(costumes), Bernard Vyzga (sets) and David Lee Kelting (sound).</TE>
<TE>   Todd Sherry finds vulnerability and heart in an otherwise
larger-than-life role as the impersonation coach. Among his pupils,
Sammy Williams (a Tony winner as the original Paul in "A Chorus
Line") suffuses his aging impersonator with equal amounts of dignity
and quiet desperation, and Patti Allison goes wonderfully unhinged as
a sorrowful mother with a rage problem.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pirri is appropriately stiff and square-jawed as a police
detective who struggles with conflicted feelings while investigating
the case, and Francesca P. Roberts is deliciously brassy as his
no-nonsense captain.</TE>
<TE>   But poor Judy Garland comes out worse for wear, reduced to a mere
sight gag as impersonators of all sizes--and wildly varying degrees
of ability--have a go at her.</TE>

<LD>We all know ravioli and tortellini stuffed with meat or cheese, but
they aren't the only kinds.</LD>
<LD>   Chianti: This venerable trattoria serves plump tortellini (striped
green, black and white) filled with lobster and shrimp. They come in
saffron cream sauce with leeks and lobster. (Rapsodia di mare,
$16.25.) Chianti, 7383 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (323) 653-8333.</LD>

Plaza Center, 968 S. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village, (805)
495-2768.</LD>
<TE>   Giorgio Baldi: Delicate, translucent pasta surrounds either of two
fillings, lobster-zucchini or asparagus-ricotta. The lobster ravioli

<LD>   Sidney Poitier Selected</LD>
<LD>   for Honorary Oscar</LD>
<TE>   Sidney Poitier has been selected to receive an honorary Oscar by
the governors of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   The academy said Wednesday that the statuette is intended to
recognize not only Poitier's "extraordinary" performances and "unique
presence on the screen" but also his representation of the motion
picture industry with "dignity, style and intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   In a career spanning half a century, Poitier has appeared in more
than 40 films. He received a best actor Oscar nomination for 1958's
"The Defiant Ones" and won in that category for 1963's "Lilies of the
Field." He'll get his honorary Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony
on March 24.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia to Reinstate C-SPAN to Full Time</TE>
<TE>   Responding to criticism of its decision to reduce the amount of
C-SPAN coverage on Southland cable systems, Adelphia Communications
has decided to reinstate the programming full time. Because of a
shortage of channels, the public-affairs outlet had recently shared a
channel with a TV Guide listings service.</TE>
<TE>   A call from the company's corporate headquarters Wednesday morning
informed C-SPAN of the good news: In the 11 Southern California
communities affected, round-the-clock programming would take effect
by March 1--or sooner, if local authorities waive the federally
mandated waiting period and give the go-ahead. Postcards will be sent
to customers advising them of the change.</TE>
<TE>   "Though the number of calls we got wasn't huge, people who watch
are passionate, and we listened to what they were saying," said Lee
Perron, Adelphia's regional vice president. "What we decided to do,
for the most part, was to take an analog pay-per-view channel and
migrate it to our digital platform--moving TV Guide to the channel
vacated."</TE>
<TE>   C-SPAN Chief Executive Brian Lamb commended Adelphia's action:
"John Rigas and the Rigas family [owners of Adelphia] reacted exactly
the way you'd want people to in this kind of situation--they got
personally involved and made it right."</TE>
<TE>   C-SPAN2 won't be on full time for an estimated three to nine
months, however, when Adelphia has upgraded its cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   In East L.A., Eagle Rock, West L.A., Sherman Oaks and the east San
Fernando Valley, TV Guide will be dropped because there is no channel
capacity for its signal. The company said customers may contact
Adelphia to receive a free digital converter to access an advanced
interactive version until TV Guide can be returned to analog.</TE>

<TE>   Chung Not Interested</TE>
<TE>   in Doing Opinion Show</TE>
<TE>   Connie Chung's new nightly show for CNN, due to premiere in the
spring, will be a "news-driven" mix of live and taped programming,
and, unlike her competition, Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly, won't
be about opinion-making.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not what I do," Chung said Wednesday at a press conference
announcing that, with a year left on her contract, she's leaving ABC
News for the all-news cable network.</TE>
<TE>   Although few details of the program have been worked out, CNN
Chairman Walter Isaacson said Chung's addition to a lineup that also
includes former broadcast network anchors Paula Zahn and Aaron Brown
cements a network strategy: putting in place "smart, respectable
journalists" who also have "some sense of personality and
excitement."</TE>

<LD>New This Week: Mark Wahlberg, a former rap star, stars in "Rock
Star," a genial look at what happens when a wannabe becomes a
headliner. Written by John Stockwell and directed by veteran
middle-of-the-roader Stephen Herek, the film only stumbles when it
decides it has to deliver a lesson. This is classic Hollywood comfort
food, intent on delivering well-worn homilies about the pitfalls of
fame, the attractions of a normal life and how being yourself is just
the most important rule. Jennifer Aniston co-stars as Wahlberg's
girlfriend and manager.</LD>

<HD>Young Drago Keeps the Family Cooking</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another Italian, Part 1: Giacomino Drago, the youngest of the eight
cooking Drago brothers (the best known being Celestino Drago), has
opened another Italian restaurant for the family. Piccolo Paradiso
occupies the Beverly Hills location of the short-lived Le Stelle.</LD>
<LD>   The decor hasn't changed much since its Le Stelle days, but
Giacomino is there nightly, cooking and greeting his guests in the
dining room. So if you don't know it's a Drago venture when you walk
in, you certainly will by the time you walk out.</LD>
<LD>   The food is slightly more formal than what Giacomino cooked at Il
Pastaio (also in Beverly Hills), and Piccolo, unlike Il Pastaio,
takes reservations. Piccolo Paradiso is open for dinner Monday
through Saturday and for lunch Monday through Friday.</LD>
<TE>   * Piccolo Paradiso, 150 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (310)
271-0030.</TE>
<TE>   Another Italian, Part 2: The Patina Group will open an Italian
restaurant in downtown L.A. soon. Zucca has 6,000 square feet of
space and seats 182 in its main dining room, two private rooms and
patio. There's also a very Italian stand-up bar near the wood-burning
oven at the entrance, where patrons can grab a quick espresso or a
bowl of pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Joachim Splichal flew in Giancarlo Gottardo from Milan to be
the chef for the venture. Zucca is at 8th and Figueroa streets, about
two blocks from Staples Center; enter from Figueroa. It will open for
dinner by Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   * Zucca, 801 S. Figueroa St., downtown L.A.; (213) 614-7800.</TE>
<TE>   To the Max: Chef Andre Guerrero, who leaves Linq on 3rd Street
Feb. 16, just took over JoeJoe's space (yes, JoeJoe's is closed) at
13355 Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks. Guerrero owned Duet in Glendale
back in the early '90s, so he's not a total stranger to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   His partner in this project is Michael Lamb, former general
manager at Saddle Peak Lodge in Calabasas. The new restaurant, Max,
is named after Guerrero's younger son, who plans to be a chef like
dad. (His older son, Fred, has his heart set on music.)</TE>
<TE>   The food will be Cal-Asian with Filipino touches. Max is slated to
open April 1 for dinner, with lunch service to follow a month or so
later.</TE>
<TE>   Drink Like a Vintner: Vincenti is hosting a private dinner for
Estate Wines and 22 of Italian exporter Marc de Grazia's Italian wine
producers from Piedmont and Tuscany. Chef Nicola Mastronardi and
owner Maureen Vincenti want to give all their diners that night an
opportunity to have the same meal the wine producers. They've secured
five of the Italian wines and will prepare a five-course meal to
match on Feb. 5. The meal, including wine, is $125 plus tax and tip.</TE>
<TE>   * Vincenti, 11930 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood; (310) 207-0127.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Shares: Derek Dickenson, owner of Derek's Bistro in
Pasadena, will break out some oversized bottles (e.g., a magnum of
'97 Cambria "Katherine's Vineyard" Chardonnay, a double mag of '96
Steltzner Cabernet) from his cellar for a wine dinner Feb 6. To
accompany the wines, he'll also make shrimp avocado cocktail, Muscovy
duck with a winter tart, bacon-wrapped monkfish and Grand Marnier
souffles. Dinner begins at 6:30 p.m. and costs $65 plus tax and tip.</TE>
<TE>   * Derek's Bistro, 181 E. Glenarm St., Pasadena; (626) 799-5252.</TE>
<TE>   Amie's Dinner: It's time again for the Amie Karen Cancer Fund for
Children dinner. This jazz-themed formal affair (the invitation says
to dress in "sparkling attire") benefits the Pediatric Hematology and
Oncology Department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. This year it's
held at the Knitting Factory, 7021 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood at 6:30
p.m. on Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   The chefs are Joe Miller of Joe's, Raphael Lunetta of JiRaffe,
Josiah Citrin of Melisse, Michael Cimarusti of Water Grill, Mark Peel
of Campanile, Josie LeBalch of Josie, Bill Bracken of the Belvedere
and Sherry Yard of Spago. Tickets are from $102 to $5,002 for a
diamond tribute and 20 tickets. Blind gifts from Tiffany will be sold
for $102. Call the Amie Karen fund for tickets at (323) 655-5977.</TE>

<HD>The Thin and Thick of 'The Tick'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Tick" proves that time can fly when you're having fun, even if
you're going nowhere fast in the process.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's season finale (8:30 p.m., Fox) is only the eighth
episode in the live-action series, which is based on Ben Edlund's
comic book and animated show of the same name. It is also most likely
the series finale, because the network is dropping the show.</LD>
<LD>   As was the case with "The Tick's" premiere in November, this
installment is often funny but is as thin as a superhero's tights. It
focuses on the tribulations of the Tick's sidekick, Arthur (David
Burke), who reveals his decision to be a crime fighter to his mother
and sister. They, in turn, are so repulsed by his "lifestyle" and put
off by the behavior of this dynamic duo's dumber half (Patrick
Warburton) that the family stages an intervention.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is that the plot and character development are about
as facile as the Tick himself. Instead, the humor derives mainly from
double-entendres (lots of them tonight are about "coming out") and
the incongruity of comic book heroes' overinflated dialogue and
demeanor in the most mundane of circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Although "The Tick" has had an enjoyable satirical ride, it
appears that its run in this incarnation is deservedly over.</TE>

<LD>Amoonscape. Ground zero. A land where everything is destroyed. Yes,
that's Afghanistan, after 22 years of civil war, rule by fanatics and
bombing by U.S. forces trying to root out the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
Now the question is where to start rebuilding.</LD>
<LD>   This week's Tokyo conference of two dozen nations and
international organizations ended with promises of $4.5 billion in
aid to Afghanistan. Spending that money properly will not be easy,
but the early needs are easily identified. Thousands of workers for
the past and current Afghan governments have just been paid after
months without salaries. Their pay has to keep coming. Still waiting
for cash are the police and other security forces. If the pay isn't
forthcoming, there's little incentive for doing honest government
work--just an invitation to extortion.</LD>
<LD>   Next up should be road building. Transportation other than by mule
or horse is essential. Afghans can get jobs building the roads. When
they're done, it will be easier to get food shipments to those
starving after decades of war and three years of drought.</LD>
<TE>   Nations providing money will have to put aside at least some of
their desire for name recognition. It's easy to hang a "Paid for by
Japan" sign on a new school or a "Gift of the people of Iran"
billboard next to a factory. That kind of reminder gratifies egos in
the donor nation and provides evidence to the people back home of
where the money went. It also reminds recipients of where the money
came from. But not everything of importance can carry a sign. The
salaries of Interior Ministry watchmen and school janitors may not
bear  labels saying "From your friends in Saudi Arabia," but those
payments too are necessary.</TE>
<TE>   It would also be good to funnel most of the money through as few
agencies as possible, rather than having dozens of nations providing
funds and equipment and demanding dozens of receipts for each
disbursement. Afghanistan should not have to tie up hundreds of
people as clerks. Nearly $2 billion in foreign aid is supposed to be
spent this year. In a country with no infrastructure and a history of
warlords grabbing what they want, corruption is likely. Fewer aid
pipelines could minimize those diversions. Countries providing aid
should insist on careful oversight.</TE>
<TE>   The United States paid most of the bills for fighting the war;
other countries should pick up most of the tab for reconstruction.
Washington can help get things started, perhaps by having the Office
of Foreign Disaster Assistance work closely with the Pentagon's
humanitarian assistance department to get basic buildings like
hospitals built. That teamwork was impressive in boosting Bosnia's
reconstruction. The need in Afghanistan is even greater and will
require years of aid. But if the result is a functioning nation of
moderate Muslims--as Afghanistan was before the Soviet invasion in
1979--it can be a model for other countries.</TE>

<LD>Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head
between his paws and began to think.</LD>
<LD>   First of all he said to himself: " ... The only reason for making
a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee."</LD>
<LD>   Then he thought for another long time, and said: "And the only
reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey."</LD>
<TE>   And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making
honey is so that I can eat it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winnie the Pooh began life not as a loyal retainer in the House of
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck but as a gentle, befuddled character in
a father's bedtime story for his son. A teddy bear from London's
Harrod's department store was A.A. Milne's birthday gift in 1921 to
his 1-year-old son, Christopher Robin. The stories Milne wove around
that stuffed bear, published in 1926, were the writer's gift to
generations of children.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney company got into the act in 1961, buying the Pooh clan
from Stephen Slesinger Inc., a literary agency to which Milne sold
his merchandizing rights in 1930. Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and the others
now may generate more than $4 billion a year for Disney's empire and
licensees.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Stephen Slesinger's heirs sued Disney, claiming that the
media behemoth had cheated them out of $200 million in royalties from
Pooh-related videos, DVDs, computer software and Pooh attractions at
theme parks. For 11 years, Disney has pooh-poohed that claim,
insisting that the deal with Slesinger, revised most recently in
1983, bound Disney to pay royalties on only a limited line of Pooh
products, including apparel and stuffed animals.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud and breach-of-contract suit will go to trial later this
year. In the meantime, the mouse appears to have gotten its head
stuck in the bear's honey pot. Secret company memos and other
documents unsealed by the trial judge last week reveal that Disney
executives knew early on that the company's right to profit from the
furry creatures in Milne's Hundred Acre Wood were far from exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   "A.A. Milne has certainly and completely balled up his rights to
Winnie the Pooh in America," harrumphed Walt's brother, Roy Disney,
in a 1967 memo. "If we were to do anything with Winnie the Pooh,
Slesinger is in a beautiful spot to either hold us up for an
outrageous price or ... reap the rewards of our work and investment."</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the $90,000 the judge fined Disney in August upon
learning the company had destroyed 40 boxes of documents, including
one labeled "Winne the Pooh--legal problems." In all, things right
now don't look so good for the mouse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Eeyore," said Owl, "Christopher Robin is giving a party."</TE>
<TE>   "Very interesting," said Eeyore. "I suppose they will be sending
me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not
at all, don't mention it."</TE>

<LD>Energy giant Enron's conduct has been so egregious that even
President Bush, a personal friend of just- resigned company Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay, has finally felt compelled to denounce the
corporation's alleged defrauding of employees and outside investors.
If politicians are starting to return donations from Enron to assure
the electorate that Congress isn't bought and paid for, then drastic
measures surely need to be taken to reassure investors as well.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey
Pitt is taking exactly the opposite course. The giant Andersen
accounting company is under intense scrutiny for its auditing in the
Enron debacle. Instead of pushing for reform, however, Pitt is
dismissing the need for it, claiming "there is nothing rotten with
the accounting industry."</LD>
<LD>   Pitt has called for creating an oversight board. The five-member
board currently responsible for ethics oversight has resigned, and
its head, Charles Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, has
denounced Pitt's proposals as too friendly to the industry that is
supposed to be monitored. The new oversight board would apparently be
largely controlled by the industry's American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt, as the head regulator of financial markets, has come up with
some cozy proposals that are astonishing. But they are less so
considering that Pitt, a lawyer, had as clients the five biggest U.S.
accounting firms, including Andersen, as well as the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Unless he changes course,
he will be unable to restore investor confidence that fair and open
audits are taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Pitt's claims, there is a lot that is rotten in the
accounting industry. It appears that Andersen did not just wink at
Enron's end run around the law; Andersen may have abetted it. Though
Andersen is reported to have shredded paperwork, memos have surfaced
showing that auditors were aware of Enron's enormous manipulation of
its reported earnings, which were really losses, and did nothing to
expose it. On the contrary, because auditors can also be consultants
to the companies they are supposed to monitor, the incentive is for
them not to blow the whistle. Andersen, for example, received $27
million from Enron for consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Congress needs to pass a law that would create an oversight board
that would have enough power to police the industry effectively. It
also needs to make it illegal for auditors to work in any capacity
for corporations other than auditing. That would help end the smell
from the accounting industry that Pitt is pretending doesn't exist.</TE>

<LD>Re "Enron Got Its Money's Worth," Commentary, Jan. 22: So Robert
Scheer believes that the way to develop an energy policy is without
industry input. I thought that the Clinton administration tried that
with health care. The results were spectacular, were they not? Any
energy plan would be controversial, but if I were going in for brain
surgery I wouldn't want my gardener to perform the operation.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton administration, eight years in office, had ample
opportunity to develop an energy plan, as imports skyrocketed, but
refused because there was no political upside in so doing.</LD>
<LD>   Making electricity a commodity was Enron's objective. Its
officials failed miserably and perhaps criminally, but they were on
the right track. Futures markets are the way to provide the lowest
possible electricity prices.</LD>
<TE>   The market works for all but someone like Scheer.</TE>

<TE>   Your Jan. 19 editorial ("Enron's Far-Reaching Web") conveyed the
impression that (a) I was in some sense on the take from Enron and
(b) I hid that involvement. Both impressions are totally false.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 I briefly served on Enron's advisory board. I ended that
connection when I agreed to write for the New York Times in the fall
of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   I also disclosed that past relationship the very first time I
mentioned Enron, in a column sharply criticizing the company's role
in California's energy crisis, in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Enron paid members of its advisory board $50,000 for attendance
and presentations at two meetings (one of mine was canceled at the
last minute), each spanning two business days. This payment, as a
daily rate, was if anything somewhat less than I was regularly
receiving for presentations to other companies: At the time, as an
expert on international financial crises, I was in high demand as a
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial quotes my remark that the board "had no function I
was aware of." This was self-deprecating humor: I later wondered
whether the board was of much direct value to the company. However, I
devoted as much time and effort to my presentations as I would have
for any other corporate event.</TE>
<TE>   Given how scrupulously I have followed the strict
conflict-of-interest rules at the New York Times, and how tough I
have been on Enron this past year, I am astonished that the Los
Angeles Times would imply that I had any ethical lapses.</TE>

<TE>   Columnist, New York Times</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re your editorial: Enron's strategy in achieving its energy
objectives through public policy was quite simple.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the company decided that if you can't buy one
influential politician, then the next best strategy was to attempt to
buy them all. The amusing part of this debacle was for how little
money so many thought to be smart, intelligent politicians and public
policy officials and others settled.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Enron was quite successful in achieving its energy
goals.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Bush's chief economic advisor was a paid consultant to Enron,
Bush's energy policy was dictated by his old friend and paymaster,
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, and Bush appointees to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission were vetted by Enron.</TE>

House--God help America!</TE>

<TE>   The "shell game" existence of Enron makes me wonder: What if,
instead of handing out millions to politicians and selling off
inflated stock, Enron executives had actually used the money Enron
took from investors to develop--heaven forbid--renewable energy
plants? What if politicians couldn't be bought and actually used
their positions to work for, as the Constitution provides, "the
general welfare"?</TE>

<LD>Re "An Identity Reduced to a Burka," Opinion, Jan. 20: Of course, no
woman should be forced to burn her burka or cast aside the hijab in
order to advance. But Islam, more than any of the other great (read
patriarchal) world religions, is obsessed with assuaging primitive
male fears and spinning out medieval male fantasies. That doesn't
leave much room to embody the highest human aspirations.</LD>
<LD>   The religion hasn't been permitted to evolve by the men who
interpret it. They've decided that their women (and 14-year-old
girls) must bear responsibility for the lack of masculine
self-control. This isn't God talking about veiling but the guys who
fancy themselves his proxies.</LD>

<TE>   Laila Al-Marayati and Semeen Issa could not have better
encapsulated the voice of Muslim women everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   As a young Muslim American woman, born and raised in the
Southland, I chose to begin wearing the hijab (head scarf) at 13 to
assert my individuality and devotion to God. I dress this way to
please my creator, but I also strive to please him by dealing justly
with people, pursuing my career and simply having a smile on my face.
While the hijab represents these assertions, it is not the end-all of
my being.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you on behalf of all Muslim women for setting the record
straight.</TE>
<TE>   Sakeena Mirza</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In their zeal to represent Muslim culture as an equal opportunity
employer, Al-Marayati and Issa assert that Muslim women, "like women
everywhere," will seek education and positive contributions to their
societies and that "how they dress is irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   I beg to differ. Have you ever tried to do surgery in a burka?
Pilot a plane? Play golf or tennis? Being beaten for publicly
exposing your feet or hands hardly enables you to pursue higher
learning.</TE>
<TE>   If Muslim women are not outraged by a regime that forces them to
wear such a contraption, then what tree is the U.S. barking up? If a
Muslim woman chooses to wear a burka, that is her business. But
aren't we fighting for that key word, "choose"?</TE>
<TE>   Karen McCarthy</TE>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is so true that women's dress seems so important and that we
sometimes forget to reflect on what is truly more important, the
individual's spirit and behavior. The hijab is really not a new
concept in religion. This expression of modesty has also been a part
of Christianity, in the habit worn by nuns, and of Judaism, where
Orthodox married women wear head scarves.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not only dress that contributes to being modest, it is
one's behavior and attitude. These women who choose to wear the head
covering because of their belief and level of God-consciousness
should be commended for daring to be different and for standing out
among a society where "physical beauty" is overemphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Burka, hijab, habit, head scarf: May we recognize these symbols
for what they are, as symbols of faith and free choice that women
must make on their own and society must respect.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Al-Sarraf</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I fear Al-Marayati and Issa may have misunderstood the feminists
who are faulted for their overzealous photographing of women in
burkas to draw attention to the oppression of Afghan women. The
feminists are not solely focused on the burkas, nor is any feminist
suggesting that a woman should not be given the freedom to proudly
wear a burka if she so chooses. However, if there is one Afghan woman
who, because of her gender, is forbidden from learning to read, to
educate her daughters or to dress as she chooses, then further change
is needed. The burka was not chosen as a symbol because of an
obsession with clothing but more likely because it is easier to
photograph than illiteracy and oppression.</TE>

<LD>The current impasse in the Senate approval of federal appellate court
judges isn't about payback or politics, and it isn't a "game," as
suggested in the headline of your Jan. 21 editorial, "Judgeship Game
Cycles On." It's about not confirming judges who would set the
country's laws back 200 years.</LD>
<LD>   The judicial nominees sent down by President Bush were handpicked
by the ultra-right-wing Federalist Society, a group of lawyers so
extreme they advocate rolling back the law to the 18th century. I
don't believe these kinds of people should be part of our judiciary.</LD>
<LD>   The Times recommends bringing all candidates to an immediate
Senate confirmation vote. But that's only a short-term solution and
won't fix the problem.</LD>
<TE>   Bush should no longer rely on advice from his handlers and should
stop being the front man for the Federalist Society. He should
withdraw these nominations, go back to using the American Bar Assn.'s
recommendations (as our past presidents did) and nominate
moderates--Democrat or Republican.</TE>

<TE>   Two can play the game of "Gotcha!" The Republicans started this
procedure when they decided to destroy President Clinton's
administration.</TE>
<TE>   With the Republican Party stealing the election with a loaded
conservative Supreme Court and replacing the American Bar Assn. with
the Federalist Society, the Democrats must preserve some balance in
our country. The Democratic minority is acting as the constitutional
balance written into our Constitution by some bright men who had
experience with a monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   I understand The Times' criticism of the Democrats. However, our
political system is evolving poorly, as campaign finances have
obliterated political discourse.</TE>

<LD>How ironic that columnist Steve Lopez, in the next-to-last paragraph
of "Sardine Packer Passes for Transit Agency" (Jan. 21), hit upon the
exact reason the MTA is continuing its appeal of the federal consent
decree.</LD>
<LD>   After unfairly blasting the MTA and glossing over the serious
issues the consent decree has raised, Lopez then calls not only for
more buses but also for "more trains, more bike lanes and more good
reasons to get more people out of their cars."</LD>
<LD>   That's the heart of the MTA's argument for an appeal: Reducing
traffic congestion and air pollution in Los Angeles County will
require far more than adding more buses to already jammed streets and
highways.</LD>
<TE>   The MTA needs the flexibility--without court interference--to size
its bus fleet according to need, schedule bus service where it will
be most effective and use its scarce resources to fund other
transportation programs, including bike lanes and street and highway
improvements, that also will serve people who don't use public
transit.</TE>

<LD>Re "Stalking the Web Predator," Jan. 17: Reading about Julie Posey's
fight against Web predators, I ask: What is the matter with our
humanity that it produces specimens looking for unnatural
satisfactions that by our post-Victorian society are classified as
sick?</LD>
<LD>   When my computer says "you have mail" and I discover that my
privacy was again invaded by messages of what teenage girls are
doing--or other kinky exploitations--my blood starts to boil.</LD>
<LD>   I am familiar with the birds and the bees, but those messages are
molestations of the mind and body. What can we do about it? Censor
it, maybe, but free speech is our most valued right.</LD>

<LD>I have a great idea. Let's pull the DEA, state and local agents who
have been busting medical marijuana cooperatives and patients by the
score and put them to work in the Central Valley against
methamphetamine production ('Meth Lab Crackdown Dealt a Setback,"
Jan. 20). It seems police would prefer spending their time and our
tax dollars busting peaceful small-time marijuana growers rather than
take on scary meth manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of crying for federal money, why not redirect our
resources more in line with what the voters intended when they passed
Proposition 215 in 1996?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Palm Inc., the No. 1 maker of electronic organizers, separated its
Palm OS business into a wholly owned subsidiary to license the
software for hand-held computers.</LD>
<LD>   Palm, which makes hand-held computers, also makes the Palm OS
software used on more than 20 million hand-held computer devices.</LD>
<LD>   Palm said that as of November, 82% of all hand-held computers use
the Palm operating system. Palm, which also licenses the operating
system to other device makers such as Sony Corp. and Handspring Inc.,
doesn't want to compete with its own customers. Now it, too, will
have to license the software from Palm OS for its devices.</LD>
<TE>   Palm OS Chief Executive and President David Nagel will head the
business, the company said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. and VeriSign Inc. will jointly develop and sell services
designed to enhance companies' ability to conduct secure, automated
transactions over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The largest computer maker said it will stop selling its Tivoli
Public Key Infrastructure software and instead sell a similar,
upgraded service developed with VeriSign.</LD>
<TE>   The service uses digital signatures, encryption and automated
updates to ensure a secure transaction, the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   IBM and VeriSign want to make Web-based transactions easier and
cheaper for corporations. Both companies would benefit from increased
sales of security services and software, and IBM would gain sales of
its server computers, Web-management software, databases and
networking and integration services.</TE>
<TE>   "It will improve a customer's sense of confidence that IBM will
serve as the prime contractor for this," Gartner Inc. analyst Vic
Wheatman said.</TE>

<HD>The Lady Knows What She Likes</HD>
<DH>'Sex and the City' star takes care of business on a Mac and
says she prefers a big screen for watching films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Cattrall plays the unabashedly sexual Samantha Jones on the "Sex
and the City" cable television series, and in a case of life
imitating TV, she has co-written a book, "Satisfaction: The Art of
the Female Orgasm," which hits bookstores today.</LD>
<LD>   Cattrall was not well known as an actress before the HBO show
became a hit, but her career goes back to 1975 when she debuted in
"Rosebud," one of the last films directed by Otto Preminger. She went
on to play the gym teacher in "Porky's," a Vulcan in "Star Trek VI"
and parts in "Police Academy" and "Bonfire of the Vanities."</LD>
<LD>   She lives in New York and on Long Island with her husband, Mark
Levinson, co-author of "Satisfaction."</LD>
<TE>   COMPUTER: A PowerBook G3. My husband actually bought it for me in
1998 and didn't tell me. I didn't think I needed a new computer, so
he just got it. Now it travels with me everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   I've always had Macintoshes. I feel lost on IBMs, it's like it's
another language.</TE>
<TE>   I use it all the time for e-mail and to go on the Web, especially
for medical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Question: To do research?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I was diagnosed with having Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, a
condition that is apparently fairly common, but I had never heard of
it.</TE>
<TE>   When I thought of thyroid problems, I thought of goiters or
hyperactiveness or poppy eyes. But after looking for information on
it on the Web, I saw that it was an autoimmune problem that makes you
tired and can lead to depression.</TE>
<TE>   It was really a revelation for me. I had gone on the Web for
advice on diet and exercise routines, but then I discovered how
valuable it was for medical feedback.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes when you are in a doctor's office, it's hard to have a
conversation about a condition, to ask everything you mean to ask, to
know the topic well enough to ask specific questions. On the Web, you
can take your time and look for just what you want to know.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did it affect your relationship with your doctor?</TE>
<TE>   A: It gave me the knowledge to go to my doctor and say that I was
not interested just in the T3 and T4 (both are thyroid hormone
measurements), but also that I wanted to find out how the TSH
(thyroid stimulating hormone) is doing. I would also be able to talk
about different test laboratories, and the fact that they differ in
what they call "normal" or "low" or "high" in their ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing you get from the Web is that you find out you are
not alone. There would be all these postings--you would read each
other's messages and realize there were people going through the same
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did people realize your postings were from the actress on "Sex
and the City"?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I used my married name. I didn't want it to be about
celebrity, I wanted it to be about the condition.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How are you doing?</TE>
<TE>   A: Great. We found the medication that works for me. It's funny
because I try to eat organic foods as much as possible, but the
medication that worked for me is a synthetic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The e-mail is for business?</TE>
<TE>   A: Mostly. My agent, lawyer, publicist and accountant are all on
the West Coast because I lived in California for about 22 years and
put down major roots there. If it wasn't for e-mail, I'm not sure I
could stay in touch with them enough, but now you can be anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   I e-mail my family, too. Most of them don't have answering
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Q: They have computers but not answering machines?</TE>
<TE>   A: My sister and brother-in-law live on Vancouver Island; she is a
school teacher and he is a surveyor. At the end of a long day, if
they miss a call it's OK. Someone will call back.</TE>
<TE>   HAND-HELD: I have the PalmV, I use it every day. I had a Filofax
for 18 years and it's still my comfort contact list, but it does not
fit into a lot of the purses I own. It certainly does not fit into
anything resembling an evening purse.</TE>
<TE>   BOOKMARKS: For the medical condition, I would go to the About.com
thyroid disease forum and also Gail's Thyroid Tips (home.usaa.net
/~wurmstein).</TE>
<TE>   I order some of my food through Diamond Organics (www.diamond
organics.com). Finding organic food in Manhattan has gotten a lot
easier in the last five years, but sometimes I can't get out to a
store. And the site has foods, like figs, that you can't always find
organic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You order perishables from them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, they send them overnight. When you figure in the cost of a
taxi to get to a store, it's about the same price.</TE>
<TE>   HOME THEATER: Mark designs and installs home systems for a living,
so we have good ones in both homes.</TE>
<TE>   I don't really watch TV much, but we like to rent films, even
classics that we have seen before. Now with this big screen, we can
see a film the way it was meant to be seen. Seeing the Marx brothers
on a big screen is a different experience.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You use a big system to see the Marx brothers?</TE>
<TE>   A: The Marx brothers' physical comedy is truly an art form. I just
love to see them in the format for which it was intended. It's like
what Norman Desmond said about the pictures getting small. The screen
got too small.</TE>
<TE>   As told to David Colker</TE>

<HD>Making Waves More Art Than Science in TransWorld Surf'</HD>
<DH>Physics helps power the interactive ocean, but animation
does much of the work of making the surf look good and varying the
water's action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Neversoft, the game development studio in Woodland Hills
responsible for the "Tony Hawk" skateboarding series, aspiring
developers must take a test, one that includes the question of how to
make water.</LD>
<LD>   The answer does not involve smashing two hydrogen atoms with an
oxygen atom. Nor does it invoke the Navier-Stokes equation for
simulating water turbulence.</LD>
<LD>   The correct reply, as it turns out, has more to do with art than
science.</LD>
<TE>   A great deal of hard-core physics is required in the creation of
water for video games. But because consoles don't have enough
horsepower to simulate the fluid dynamics of anything bigger than a
glass of milk, developers must find clever shortcuts to lull players
into their virtual water worlds, especially when players are required
to interact with the water rather than merely gaze at it.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rotenberg, 29, director of research and development at Angel
Studios in Carlsbad, talks about how his team created an interactive
ocean for "TransWorld Surf," a title published by Infogrames Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Question: So what does it take?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There are four major things about water that the human eye
will pick up. One is the physics of the movement of the water, or how
it animates. Another is the reflections off the water's surface, the
refraction, and what I would call subsurface scattering of light, or
the diffusion of light. Those are the three visual components. Then
there's the fourth--the physics of the water itself.</TE>
<TE>   If you have those four things, you can do convincing water. But to
do those four things properly requires more computing power than a
game system is going to have. So the trick is to fake it, or capture
the essence while preserving controllability for the designer. It's a
big balancing act.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where do you start?</TE>
<TE>   A: My approach on a lot of things is to study the real thing
first. If you want me to do an ocean, I'll start with how the ocean
really works. Then I'll go on to find out what the human eye
perceives.</TE>
<TE>   But I don't commit myself to the real thing. Techies like myself
have a tendency toward doing things the most technically interesting
way, or toward making it super-realistic. But you have to know where
to cut the corners and know how to preserve different aspects and
discard others.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't a universally correct way to do water, because every
game is going to use water differently. The important thing is to
keep in mind the ultimate goal. Usually, we make sure that fun is the
No. 1 goal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do the goals in your game differ from other water-based
games, and how do those differences govern your design decisions?</TE>
<TE>   A: Take "Wave Race," "Splashdown" and our game. They're all
solving different problems. With "Splashdown," the water is basically
flat with ripples. It also channels through rivers. It's the same
with "Wave Race," where you're creating a track with water of varying
turbulence with obstacles scattered throughout. Our game recreates an
ocean with waves. Waves curl over. It behaves differently. So we
devote a different set of resources to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where does physics come in?</TE>
<TE>   A: Some of our initial experiments involved a more physical
approach. We generated ripples on a computer based on fluid dynamics.
As the game went on, though, we moved away from physics to more
procedural animation, meaning a technique where you use algorithms to
drive animation rather than physics.</TE>
<TE>   Proper physics has two drawbacks. One is that it requires a lot of
computing power. Two, it tends to be more difficult to control. Game
designers want precise control over how the wave breaks, how fast it
is, how large it is, how many there are. It's easier for them to just
direct that, as opposed to coaxing the physics simulation to behave
the way they want.</TE>
<TE>   So, for example, we thought of modeling the bottom of the ocean,
and having the wave shapes be based on the shape of the ocean floor.
But for the designer to change the wave, he'd have to change the
shape of the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   Physics certainly has its place. It's particularly cool for
handling more unpredictable situations. But if you want very precise
controls over something, physics isn't always the best choice.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much real-world physics did you incorporate into
"TransWorld Surf"?</TE>
<TE>   A: Close to one-third to half of the [central processing power] is
allocated to the ocean, in terms of physics and rendering. That makes
sense for a surfing game. But very little physics of the ocean is
left in the game. How the surfer responds to the water is physical,
and that remains. But the wave is more precisely controlled through
animation.</TE>
<TE>   People have the impression that it's a lot more physical than it
is. In fact, it's more physically inspired than physically based.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There have been many stabs at surfing games. Nearly all have
wiped out. Why is it so hard to make a fun surfing game?</TE>
<TE>   A: Two reasons. One is the challenges involved in getting it to
look good. A wave is a very dynamic thing. It's constantly changing.
That adds technical difficulty. The second is game play. We went out
of our way to put as much stuff in the world as we could.</TE>
<TE>   If you were just doing one wave after another, it would get
tiresome. We knew we had a challenge in making the levels feel
different, giving players something at every level that they hadn't
seen before. Previous surfing games hadn't put as much effort into
this. So they tended to just have one wave after another. That's not
very exciting.</TE>
<TE>   We also put a lot of effort into the feel of turning and
performing tricks. Other surfing games just steer and turn. We tried
to put more subtleties into the controls.</TE>

<HD>Haunted by Ghosts of Programs Past?</HD>
<DH>Wide-screen TVs help you see the big picture, but if the
show doesn't fit the bill? The answer may frost your phosphors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TV manufacturers are wild about wide-screen digital sets, which
display movies and high-definition TV shows in their full cinematic
glory.</LD>
<LD>   There's just one problem: Most of the programs on local stations
and cable networks are broadcast in the boxier format used by
conventional TVs. As a result, wide-screen owners must choose the
lesser of two evils: They either watch a cropped or distorted
picture, or they risk ruining the set's ability to display colors
evenly across the screen.</LD>
<LD>   The problem stems from the way most picture tubes, projection sets
and flat-panel plasma monitors work. The inside of the tube or screen
is lined with thousands of tiny phosphors, which glow red, green or
blue when struck by an electron beam. That's where the color in a
color TV comes from.</LD>
<TE>   The more a phosphor is heated by electrons, the faster it ages and
diminishes in intensity. If all the phosphors in a screen age evenly,
the set's picture will fade gradually without distortions. But if a
group or pattern of phosphors age faster than the others around it,
they could cause ghosts or double images.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we manufacturers call 'the fish-tank effect,'" said
Dave Arland of Thomson Multimedia, the company that makes RCA sets.
According to Arland, there was a popular laserdisc that was a video
of a fish tank. The fish swam to and fro, but the tank, coral and
other decorations didn't move.</TE>
<TE>   If you played the disc for hours on end, the phosphors matching
the stationary objects would "burn in" on the screen. As a result,
ghosts of the tank, coral and plants would seem to glow on top of
other programs.</TE>
<TE>   A similar problem can occur if part of the screen is left black
for long periods of time. The phosphors in the black areas won't age
at all, so they'll appear brighter than the areas around them when
the screen is filled again.</TE>
<TE>   New sets are the most susceptible to uneven aging. High-tech
digital light processing and liquid-crystal displays, which don't use
phosphors, aren't affected at all.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the risks disappear when watching wide-screen programs,
which are growing more abundant every day. More than half of the
prime-time shows on the digital channels broadcast by CBS, ABC and
Fox are in wide screen, as are a few NBC dramas. And about half of
the DVDs on the market are available in wide-screen formats,
including just about every major new release, Emily Bradley of the
DVD Entertainment Group said.</TE>
<TE>   DVDs have been the driving force behind the initial sale of
digital TVs, most of which aren't capable of tuning in an
over-the-air signal. And the incredible popularity of DVD is the main
difference between now and the early 1990s, when set makers made a
futile attempt to interest the public in wide-screen TVs.</TE>
<TE>   "For most people, this [burn-in issue] is not a big deal," said
Arland of RCA. But he added, "If you spend most of your time watching
over-the-air TV, not movies, maybe this is something you ought to
think about."</TE>
<TE>   That's because the bulk of the programs on TV fill only 75% of a
wide-screen display. Their width-to-height ratio is 12 by 9 (or 4 by
3), whereas a wide screen's ratio is 16 by 9. When centered, such
pictures leave a blank bar on either side of the display.</TE>
<TE>   Many manufacturers and some broadcasters, including CBS,
automatically fill the blank areas with gray bars designed to age the
phosphors evenly with the rest of the screen. Nevertheless, Bill
Whalen, senior product and marketing manager for Hitachi Home
Electronics, said even that approach shouldn't be used more than 15%
of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Arland said RCA got so many complaints about the gray bars used by
its initial digital TV receiver, it had to add another option: black
bars. But the company also warned customers: "If this is the only way
you watch ... you're going to have a burn-in problem," Arland said.</TE>
<TE>   To provide protection for the screen, manufacturers have come up
with several ways to fill a wide screen with a conventional-size
picture. Unfortunately, all have potentially significant drawbacks.</TE>
<TE>   One way is to enlarge the image electronically, a technique that
crops off some of the top and bottom. "You give everybody a haircut,
essentially, especially if you're watching the news," Arland said.</TE>
<TE>   Another approach is to stretch the picture, an approach that makes
everything look heavier. If a regular TV image makes a person look 10
pounds heavier, as the saying goes, the stretch mode "adds a good 20
to 30," Whalen said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hitachi, Panasonic and other manufacturers have developed
a technique that leaves the middle of the picture undistorted but
expands a portion on each side. Hitachi's Smooth Wide mode, for
example, starts altering the image halfway to each edge, with the
sections at the edge undergoing the most stretching.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff in having a wide screen is viewing movies the way their
directors intended them to be seen, and in watching a game without
losing sight of key players. For some programs, the expanded field of
vision is more important than the improvements in picture quality a
digital set brings.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Ed Wolff, general manager of the display group at
Panasonic, pointed to a scene in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" where
Indiana Jones is lobbing things at a tank. In the 4-by-3 version, he
said, "you didn't see the tank."</TE>
<TE>   On the sports front, Fox is presenting this year's Super Bowl,
pregame festivities and postgame wrap-up in wide screen. It will be
the first time the full day of Super Bowl programming has been
available in wide screen, with Fox producing both the analog and
digital feeds from the same set of cameras and production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, broadcasters will turn off their analog channels and
offer only digital programs, a shift that could make wide screen the
dominant format. Until then, some consumers see too many trade-offs
to invest in a wide screen.</TE>
<TE>   Retired engineer Stan Corbett of Palos Verdes is one example. He
recently went shopping to replace a 19-year-old Hitachi projection
set, and was intrigued by the wide-screen models until he learned
about the burn-in problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm going to get a 4-by-3 format [set] just because of
the way we watch TV," Corbett said. The risk of burn-in disturbed
him, he said, adding, "I don't expect to be getting another TV set in
a couple of years. This is going to be a long-term buy."</TE>

<HD>Using Room-Design Software Isn't a Moving Experience</HD>
<DH>Several CD-ROMs on the market promise to take the
frustration out of interior decorating, but the learning curve can be
flat-out ugly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given only a chair, table, vase and area rug, some people can create
an inviting living room space.</LD>
<LD>   Give me the same objects and you might as well have a yard sale. I
didn't get the gene for interior design, although I am an
appreciator, much in the way I enjoy architecture, music, painting,
indoor plants and other endeavors for which I have no talent. When a
room is right, I know it--but creating one of those comforting spaces
I see in magazines is beyond my ken.</LD>
<LD>   Deficiencies in other areas of my life (spelling, for one) have
been overcome by use of the computer. So why not decorating?</LD>
<TE>   Several interior-design CD-ROMs on the market allow a user to
input the dimensions of a room, incorporate existing doors and
windows, and then add furniture and accessories. The furniture can be
moved around and even resized (in case you have the budget for new
pieces) until you are happy with the room.</TE>
<TE>   These decorator-in-a-box programs also all come with
computer-assisted design (CAD) that allows a user to view the results
in 3-D. This mode makes a living room look like the set of a cheap,
computer-generated Saturday morning cartoon, but it also allows a
user to do a graphic walk-through to better imagine himself or
herself among the new furniture arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   These programs have come a long way since design software for the
home computer hit the market as part of the CD-ROM craze of the
mid-1990s. But overall, they still require a steep learning
curve--you're likely to need the better part of a day, at least, just
to create your first room layout on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Putting in the furniture and trying the CAD mode will take up the
rest of that day. And even if you get everything successfully input,
rearranging the furniture will take patience and practice.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, is it all worth it?</TE>
<TE>   No. Not for the occasional user. After the hours of drudgery and
frustration spent just learning how to use these programs, I was no
longer much interested in rearranging my living room.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-D modes were, in particular, uninspiring. The 3-D sofas and
chairs looked, for the most part, as inviting as those found in bus
terminals. And the cabinetry didn't look worthy of particle board.</TE>
<TE>   I found it more helpful, instructive and just plain enjoyable to
draw a room to scale on a letter-sized piece of paper. (Using a type
of triangular ruler, available at art supply stores, that adjusts
automatically for scale makes this an easy task.)</TE>
<TE>   I cut out rectangles, also drawn to scale, to represent the
furniture pieces. Then I moved my paper furniture around the floor
plan to test different arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Very analog. But it worked and took far less time than using one
of these CD-ROMs. And it was a lot cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   3-D Complete Home</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Home, one of the big names in home software, recently
discontinued this CD-ROM, but it still is available from some retail
outlets.</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of there being no use in beating a dead horse, the
less said about "3-D Complete Home" the better. It's a suite of
programs that includes sections on designing a house, deck,
landscaping and garden. It even includes a program for planning a
home's electrical wiring.</TE>
<TE>   The interior-decorating section was so difficult to use and
uninspiring that I gave up after a couple of hours.</TE>
<TE>   3-D Home Architect</TE>
<TE>   This software suite from Broderbund also was meant to be used to
design numerous parts of a home, but it cost a good deal less. It
also was easier to use and produced better-looking graphics. But it
still was a long way from user-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   The problems started with the drawing of the basic room plan.
There were several annoyances that added up to frustration and extra
steps. If you made all your room and furniture measurements in inches
(as the major furniture manufacturers do), you must convert them to
feet and inches for the program.</TE>
<TE>   The layout, when done, showed measurements from the middle of
windows and other objects. So, if you wanted to find out just how
close a sofa or bookcase was to a window's edge, you had to do the
calculations in your head or get out a scratchpad.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-D mode was graphically striking to the point of overkill. It
showed my modest living space suspended in a cloud-filled sky, as if
my room was on its way over the rainbow to Oz. Annoyingly, I could
not move the furniture in this 3-D space--changes had to be made in
the 2-D and then the 3-D had to be refreshed to see them.</TE>
<TE>   Not that moving furniture in 2-D was any treat. The difficulty and
limitations in moving objects was the most frustrating aspect of this
program.</TE>
<TE>   Complete Home Designer</TE>
<TE>   This program from Data Becker was the most flexible and easiest to
use. It almost made interior design by computer fun.</TE>
<TE>   It took measurements in inches, allowed the dimensions of objects
to be easily adjusted, and provided a view of a piece of furniture in
3-D before it was used in the design.</TE>
<TE>   One of the endearing aspects of the program was that it gave items
weirdly descriptive names--for example, the "TV, exploding" seemed to
refer to a big-screen TV. It also allowed the insertion of pets--I
put a dog in the living room and even made him sit up or lie down by
orienting the figure by 90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   These might be little things, but a bit of amusement came as
welcome relief when using these programs.</TE>
<TE>   Objects could be moved in the 3-D view of "Complete Home
Designer," but not easily. Another gripe was that in the 2-D view,
the furniture and other items could not be situated by exact
measurement.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, this was the best interior-design software tested. It
also was the least expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Design Your Own Home</TE>
<TE>   A tutorial section makes the learning curve on this CD-ROM from
Abracadata a lot less steep. After only half an hour of following the
step-by-step instructions, I was ready to take on my first project.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, starting a project from scratch is a good deal more
difficult than working on a carefully laid-out tutorial environment.
The worst parts of "Design Your Own Home" concerned furniture and
other objects.</TE>
<TE>   The choices in furniture were difficult to find, due to poor
interface design. And when found, there weren't enough choices. For
example, I could not find a simple doorway without a swinging door. I
also couldn't locate a built-in cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   The furniture available was particularly unattractive.</TE>
<TE>   This CD-ROM was the only one tested that came in Macintosh as well
as Windows versions.</TE>

<HD>Kids Need to Know Why That Electronic Timeout Is Necessary</HD>
<DH>There are many ways to punish through gadgets, but make it
relate to the offense, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television traditionally has been revoked for misbehaving children.
But now some parents are pulling the plug on much more than the TV.</LD>
<LD>   The number of parents using the Internet as a form of punishment
has increased, from 30.6% in 2000 to 37.2% in 2001, according to a
recent UCLA Internet Report.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very real electronic timeout," said Jan English-Lueck, an
anthropology professor at San Jose State University.</LD>
<TE>   But simply taking away a child's games or pager might not improve
their behavior, experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Punishments should be "natural consequences that deal directly
with the transgression," said Susan Panzarine, author of "Teenagers
and the Internet: What Every Parent Should Know." A child that runs
up a cell phone bill, for example, might be required to pay it.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids forget that these are not rights that they have," Panzarine
said. "They really are privileges and with privileges comes
responsible behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Before taking away a privilege, however, parents need to inform
their children of the consequences of their actions, said Nadine
Block, director of the Center of Effective Discipline in Columbus,
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Block recommends that parents sit down with the child and decide
together how much time to allot for the Internet, video games and
cell phone, allowing for more time on weekends than during the week.
Should a child fail to adhere to the established guidelines, parents
should be reasonable with their punishment, withdrawing privileges
for days--not weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Parents also must consider how a particular punishment will affect
their children, said Irwin Hyman, a professor of psychology at Temple
University who studies discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "Is what you're going to withdraw a privilege or necessity in our
technological age?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not essential for children to visit chat rooms,
they may need to use the Internet for schoolwork. In some cases, it
may be better to limit, instead of completely prohibit, a certain
privilege. Instead of banning a child from using the telephone,
parents can block calls to certain area codes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can use technology as part of the discipline," Hyman said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, rather than deny their children technology, some parents
force them to use it as punishment. Conducting research for the
Silicon Valley Cultures Project, anthropology professor English-Lueck
has seen parents threaten to keep track of kids with global
positioning systems or insist that they carry pagers and cell
phones--what she calls the "electronic tether"--with them at all
times.</TE>
<TE>   Since punishment is considered a negative form of discipline, most
experts encourage parents to discipline children by helping them
acknowledge what they did wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to give kids from an early age [an understanding of] how
they hurt others and what they can do to make amends, so when they do
things they can put themselves in the other person's place," said
Block of the Center of Effective Discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Often the threat of punishment is enough to prevent children from
misbehaving.</TE>
<TE>   "You should be able to raise kids using positive techniques and
rarely use punishment," Hyman said.</TE>

<LD>Air Guitar Goes Virtual</LD>
<LD>   Lurking within every music fan is a star waiting to be discovered.
For the leaping, strutting performer within you, MusicPlayground Inc.
offers software-powered guitar picks and drumsticks that can insert
you into dozens of rock, pop or country songs.</LD>
<LD>   MusicPlayground software includes specially recorded versions of
hit songs, ranging from lounge-music chestnuts such as "Strangers in
the Night" to relatively fresh pop baubles such as "Ironic."</LD>
<TE>   You pick a song, then select the part you'd like to
perform--guitar, bass, drums or vocals. That portion of the recording
will be muted, and your sounds will be inserted.</TE>
<TE>   For the masses of undiscovered rock gods who don't own a guitar or
bass, MusicPlayground offers the V-Pick, or virtual guitar pick. It's
about the size of a conventional pick, and it connects via a long
wire to your computer's USB port.</TE>
<TE>   When you strum something solid with the V-Pick--a tennis racket,
for example--your computer emits the guitar or bass sound
corresponding to that spot in the tune.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, striking the V-Stix virtual drum pad with drumsticks
simulates the sounds from a real drum kit.</TE>
<TE>   The software also lets you plug a real instrument or microphone
into your computer's sound card and play along with the song,
following the notes or words displayed on the computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   There's no "Stairway to Heaven," at least not yet, but there's the
next best thing: "Free Bird."</TE>
<TE>   The package comes in two flavors. The $29.95 Concert Edition
includes the V-Pick for guitar and bass, 25 songs and software. The
$69.95 Band Edition adds a virtual drumstick and 25 more songs.</TE>

<HD>These Board Games Won't Leave You Bored</HD>
<DH>'SSX Tricky,' 'Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3' and 'TransWorld
Surf' share elements but sport their own very likable personalities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON CURTISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In real life, of course, skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing are
distinct sports that happen to share a rebellious culture.</LD>
<LD>   But in the make-believe of video games, in which repetitive button
pushing replaces physical strength and grace, the three sports often
have been indistinguishable.</LD>
<LD>   Move around with the joy pad.</LD>
<TE>   Perform tricks with various button combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Mix and match outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Be cool.</TE>
<TE>   Three recent titles--"SSX Tricky," "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3" and
"TransWorld Surf"--demonstrate that even when games share fundamental
play elements they can have their own very likable personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "TransWorld Surf" for Microsoft's Xbox is the first surfing game
that actually is fun to play. Until now, surfing games have been
overly complex and literal pains in the wrist that required madly
tapping buttons to simulate paddling in front of a wave.</TE>
<TE>   Come on. The physical act of surfing and playing a video game have
virtually nothing in common. "TransWorld Surf" recognizes this. So
instead of focusing on catching the wave, the game challenges players
to exploit the wave with any number of cool tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Getting up on the board is a snap and staying up is not all that
difficult--even on hazardous waves. But what fun is that? "TransWorld
Surf" is all about image, baby. Looking good on the wave is what
counts. For instance, players must complete a virtual photo shoot
before they can begin to compete on a specific beach. That means
pulling off tricks for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Although players drive the game forward, the real stars of
"TransWorld Surf" are its waves. They actually look and behave like
water, a feat allowed by the graphic power of Xbox. Waves swell and
undulate gracefully as players paddle out from the shore.</TE>
<TE>   They are a joy to ride--and players can dart up and down the face
of the wave and drive into the pipe as it begins to roll. The
flawless camera work follows players closely and never gets in the
way.</TE>
<TE>   And true to the ethos of gentle surfers, players must monitor
their karma as they splash about. Hit marine life, splash another
surfer, steal a wave and karma goes down. Players who run down their
karma may find themselves unwelcome on some beaches.</TE>
<TE>   But "TransWorld Surf" does a great job of welcoming a range of
players.</TE>
<TE>   "SSX Tricky"</TE>
<TE>   The sequel to the popular "SSX" snowboard game is less accessible
but oozes attitude from every pixel. That may make it popular with a
certain segment of game players, but it's just as likely to alienate
those old enough to remember a time before the Olsen twins.</TE>
<TE>   It's easily solvable, though. Turn down the music volume. But be
sure to keep the voices volume up, at least for the first few runs.
Like many recent games, "SSX Tricky" for Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and
Sony PlayStation 2, features the voices of recognizable Hollywood
stars--from David Arquette and Billy Zane to Lucy Liu and Oliver
Platt.</TE>
<TE>   As its name suggests, "SSX Tricky" is all about tricks. Sure,
there's an option to race straight down the mountain, but that loses
appeal pretty quickly. Replay value lies in mastering stunts at high
speed and high altitude. It's all ridiculously overblown. And great
fun.</TE>
<TE>   The mountains of "SSX Tricky" slip along without a hitch. There
are discernible differences in control as players glide over powder
and ice and corduroy. Unlike "TransWorld Surf," which allows
considerable movement within the playing environment, "SSX Tricky"
focuses action on the courses. That's fine because they stretch out
for what feels like miles.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3"</TE>
<TE>   As nice as they are, neither "TransWorld Surf" nor "SSX Tricky"
matches the long-term value of the third installment in Tony Hawk's
exceptional skateboard series. "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3" for
GameCube and PS2 sharpens all the best elements of the first two
versions and presents them in the kind of crisp detail possible only
with the latest consoles.</TE>
<TE>   There is virtually nothing to dislike about "Pro Skater 3." As
with the second installment, one of the nicest features is the
ability to design skate parks that can be saved and played on a
friend's machine.</TE>
<TE>   But the built-in arenas are nothing to sniff at. From factories to
airports to the Great White North, the environments crackle with
life, which makes them more realistic than their predecessors and
more interesting to play. Even non-skaters can find plenty to do.</TE>
<TE>   Skateboarding may not be a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Something this addictive ought to be.</TE>

<HD>NexiCam Captures Still and Moving Moments</HD>
<DH>Attached to the back of a Compaq iPaq, the $199 camera
shoots photos and can record up to 15 seconds of video.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK A. KELLNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nexian, a San Diego-based subsidiary of South Korea's Navicom Ltd.,
expects in February to ship the $199 NexiCam, a PDA camera that slips
onto the back of Compaq Computer Corp.'s iPaq.</LD>
<LD>   The camera shoots photos and short video clips at a resolution of
800-by-600 pixels.</LD>
<LD>   There are many good reasons for combining a personal digital
assistant and a camera. The iPaq already has a powerful processor, 32
to 64 megabtyes of RAM and, in its newest models, a slot for secure
digital memory cards to store images.</LD>
<TE>   Installation and use of the NexiCam is simple. Once software has
been loaded on the PDA via Microsoft's ActiveSync software, you slide
the iPaq into the NexiCam "sled." The device will recognize the
camera and you can start the software controls from the Pocket PC
drop-down menu.</TE>
<TE>   The NexiCam offers an on-screen viewfinder, plus controls to
brighten a picture. It works best in daylight or bright office
conditions, but also functions well in lower-light situations. The
lens can rotate as much as 180 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Once snapped, photos can be viewed on the hand-held screen as
thumbnail images or as a slideshow. Individual albums can be created
to organize pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Transferring images to the desktop again takes place via the
ActiveSync process, and a separate "My Pictures" folder is created on
the host PC. The pictures, which are stored in the Web-friendly JPEG
format, can be viewed with the standard imaging software supplied
with Microsoft Windows or specialized programs such as Adobe
Photoshop or JASC PaintShop Pro 7.</TE>
<TE>   The NexiCam unit also has a Type I CompactFlash slot that can be
used for added storage or a wireless antenna card, the latter being
good for sending pictures when not at a desk.</TE>
<TE>   You can record up to 15 seconds of video with the NexiCam, which
can be played back on the screen or uploaded to a PC for playback as
a video file. No sound is included, but the image should be good for
a quick survey of something, such as a car being inspected.</TE>
<TE>   The NexiCam offers a good value for money. During the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month, the item caused a stir at
Compaq's demonstration area. Information on the device can be found
at www.nexian.com.</TE>

<LD>One of the most popular genres of children's software is the
interactive adventure. Good ones will teach while children play. Two
new interactive adventures, "Mia's Math Adventure" and "The Mummy
Mystery," do a good job at both tasks.</LD>
<LD>   "Mia's Math Adventure"</LD>
<LD>   Mia is an adorable girl mouse who has starred in two other
computer adventures. She is ensconced in her cozy home in the attic
of an old Victorian house when a fire forces her and her family to
evacuate.</LD>
<TE>   Devastated by the loss of her home, Mia sets out on an adventure
to rebuild a friend's time machine, go back in time and stop the fire
before it starts.</TE>
<TE>   Mia solicits the player's help in finding four things necessary to
rebuild the time machine. Players shrink to Mia's size to accompany
her as she explores her world. Careful observation is the key to
success.</TE>
<TE>   Children wander with Mia through gardens, a tool shed, a mole hole
and other locales. That hole in the fence may lead to a new universe,
so don't miss it.</TE>
<TE>   Once the four parts are found, Mia and her friend Marty assemble
the time machine and travel back to the time right before the fire.
Players help Mia investigate her Victorian home to discover the cause
of the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the adventure, Mia encounters obstacles that can be
overcome only by playing some mathematical games.</TE>
<TE>   For example, to find the correct key to start the time machine,
players must click on a number that is "larger than 37,400 and
smaller than 37,700."</TE>
<TE>   There are nine excellent multileveled games, and they can be
played separately from the adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Mia's world is wondrous to behold. The graphics are lush and
detailed. She is charming and sweet, determined and clever--in short,
a fabulous role model for children.</TE>
<TE>   Her world is populated with fanciful characters including a
bumbling mole, a professorial spider, a fortune-telling gypsy mouse
and a bad-guy rat.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of the best interactive adventures on the market for
children and well worth their time.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mummy Mystery"</TE>
<TE>   Mercer Mayer's literary character, Little Monster, stars in this
mystery adventure set in ancient Monster Egypt. Little Monster
Private Eye and his sidekick Detective Kerploppus investigate the
disappearance of archeologist Professor Pickle.</TE>
<TE>   The professor appears to have locked himself inside the famous
Tomb of Thanxfurnuthen. As players join the detective duo in
sleuthing throughout Monster Egypt, they quickly ascertain that the
only way to open the Tomb is to find five legendary magic rings.</TE>
<TE>   Players search for the magic rings by visiting 25 locations,
including such exotic places as the tombs of Tootafroota and Pharaoh
Phaucett, and the lost city of Hamonrya.</TE>
<TE>   Embedded in these locales are 11 games and activities that require
children to use logical thinking. For example, youngsters may need to
match the outline of a hieroglyph to the picture, or listen to sounds
made by scarabs in a concentration-type game.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to searching for the rings, players need to find
scarabs (the currency of this virtual world) and other items to
collect. Scarabs can be used to purchase necessary items such as a
camel to ride. Items collected in one scene may be essential to
moving the mystery forward in another scene, so careful sleuthing is
a must.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mummy Mystery" is a wonderfully engaging mystery to solve. It
is ripe with humor, the mystery is complicated and intertwined and
the embedded games are fun and challenging. And, it is inexpensive at
$15.</TE>
<TE>   Although the box recommends a target age of 4 and older, this
software works best with children ages 7 to 10 since reading is
required to solve part of this mystery. If you want to play it with
younger children, be on hand to be the designated reader.</TE>

<LD>The Mac may be only a sliver of the personal computer pie, but
there's a banquet of online information sources for Mac users. The
Web is full of Mac-related Web sites of all types and credibility
levels, sites that have full-time editorial staffs and sites that are
based in spare bedrooms. Here are some of my favorites.</LD>
<LD>   For daily news and analysis that reflect the pulse of the Mac
community, there's no place like Ric Ford's Macintouch, at www.macin
touch.com. Online since 1994, Macintouch provides concise coverage of
new products and software updates as well as reader-submitted
opinions and tips.</LD>
<LD>   Another fine news site is MacCentral, at www.maccentral.com, whose
news is updated regularly during each business day. MacCentral is
published by the creators of Macworld magazine, which has its own
site at www.macworld .com.</LD>
<TE>   MacAddict magazine covers the Mac in an irreverent, unabashedly
partisan style. You can sample its attitude at its Web site, www
.macaddict.com.</TE>
<TE>   The granddaddy of Mac e-zines is Adam Engst's TidBits, which has
been published weekly since 1990. Distributed via e-mail and at
www.tidbits.com, TidBits contains thorough reviews of Mac products
and hard-hitting, well-reasoned analysis of news and trends in the
Mac world.</TE>
<TE>   For Mac troubleshooting advice, you can't beat Ted Landau's
MacFixit (www.macfixit.com). When a bug bites or a new operating
system update causes problems with existing programs, you'll often
hear about it here first.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Mac's many strengths is its longevity. Thanks to
accelerator cards and other upgrades, I'm still using Macs made 10
years ago. For tips on keeping an old Mac alive, check out Low End
Mac (www.lowendmac.com). The site is now running a series of articles
on installing OS X on elderly Macs.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a Mac geek exploring the Unix underpinnings of Mac OSX,
you'll like MacSlash (www .macslash.org) and Mac OS X Hints
(www.macosxhints.com).</TE>
<TE>   Mike Breedens' XLR8yourmac .com is a solid source of advice on Mac
performance tuning.</TE>
<TE>   Apple zealots cringe at the thought, but many Macs share office
space with Windows PCs. John Rizzo's MacWindows (www.mac windows.com)
provides news and advice on getting Macs and Windows on speaking
terms. Last week, the site published an article about the performance
problems that users are reporting with Connectix's VirtualPC 5, which
lets Mac OS X run Windows.</TE>
<TE>   For news and links relating to Apple's QuickTime digital media
technology, visit Robert and Judy Lettieri's Little QuickTime
Page(www.judyandrobert.com/quick time). For professional video
editors and DVD developers, 2-Pop (www.2-pop.com) provides articles
and discussion boards on Apple's Final Cut Pro and DVD Studio Pro
programs.</TE>
<TE>   There's no shortage of free or nearly free software for the Mac.
Two good places to explore the world of freeware and shareware are
MacDownload at www.mac download.com and VersionTracker
(www.versiontracker.com).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of free stuff, if you're the type of Mac user who likes
to customize your desktop and icons, you'll find decorating ideas at
Icon Factory (www.iconfactory.com) and Xicons (www.xicons.com).</TE>
<TE>   Out of the numerous Apple rumor sites, there is only one I'll
recommend. Crazy Apple Rumors (www.crazyapplerumors.com) is, in its
words, "dedicated to the fabrication of Apple rumors that defy
verifiability, grammatical convention or any basis in reality."
Believe it. Last month, before the most recent Macworld Expo, the
site broke this faux exclusive: "January 7th Keynote to Be a
Repeat--Apple to Re-Introduce iPod."</TE>
<TE>   And if you're a glutton for punishment, you'll find links to past
Mac Focus columns as well as all of the articles I write for Macworld
magazine at my humble Web outpost, www.jimheid.com.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've always been a bit skeptical of Microsoft's ".Net" strategy,
which would shift some computing tasks from the PC over to the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Now, I'm even more nervous after the company admitted that a human
error caused its servers to fail for five days, temporarily keeping
some customers from being able to get important security updates for
Windows XP. The update servers are designed to allow Microsoft to
keep your operating system up-to-date without having to ship out
CD-ROMs.</LD>
<LD>   Windows Update offers a peek at what .Net services will ultimately
offer. Eventually, Microsoft and other developers will serve up a
wide range of applications that will make Windows, Microsoft Office
and other PC programs dependent upon an Internet connection to
perform certain tasks.</LD>
<TE>   On the plus side, this strategy will make it a lot easier to add
new features, fix bugs and offer networking and software applications
that would be impossible or impractical on an unconnected computer.</TE>
<TE>   But these benefits come at a cost and at a risk. To take full
advantage of these services you have to be connected to the Net,
preferably using a high-speed connection such as DSL or cable. In
many cases, you will have to pay additional fees.</TE>
<TE>   With .Net, Microsoft sees the opportunity for an ongoing revenue
stream. Instead of trying to sell you upgrades every year or two,
they'll sell you a subscription.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, it's like watching movies on a cable or satellite
channel versus owning your own video tapes and DVDs. Getting your TV
programming from such a service can be great as long as the service
keeps working and you keep paying your bill.</TE>
<TE>   .Net and similar concepts are about using the Internet to enhance
or even replace your software.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I now use the free Atomica service (www.atomica .com)
as my electronic thesaurus and dictionary. If I'm using Word and need
a definition, I simply highlight the word, press a key, and Atomica
looks it up over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   I used to use Quicken as my sole program for paying bills and
keeping track of my finances. I now pay and receive my bills through
Paytrust. I like that I can view or pay my bills from anywhere, even
if I'm out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   But if my network connection or Paytrust's servers go down, I'm
out of luck. And, if the company were to go out of business, I would
no longer be able to view or pay those bills.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason why it's always a good idea to have a local copy
of your data on your own PC and why I would never use a service that
doesn't allow you to download your own data. Sadly, the dot-com
landscape is littered with companies that have abandoned their
business plans--and their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The new paradigm of Internet applications assumes a level of
trust. Users must not only trust that network companies will not
violate their privacy, but that they will have adequate security to
protect you against others.</TE>
<TE>   I've never seen any evidence suggesting that Microsoft would
deliberately peer into users' data, but there have been situations
where its security was lax, making it possible for hackers to break
in.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are aspects of the idea that make a great deal of
sense. The Internet is an excellent vehicle for keeping software up
to date.</TE>
<TE>   Online storage services such as www.backup.com can be a lot more
reliable and secure than local storage.</TE>
<TE>   Online collaborative tools make it possible for colleagues to work
together or for families to share photos, music and other group
calendars.</TE>
<TE>   Now all we need are infallible servers, network connections and
people.</TE>

<HD>Rounding Up a Posse</HD>
<DH>A bad EBay auction experience spurs an ad hoc Internet
manhunt by ordinary folk, who, like frontier vigilantes, find
themselves skirting the law in their quest for justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The posse dogging an online auction seller seized control of his
e-mail account, grilled his mother and even assumed his identity in a
nationwide hunt for a man they believe swindled as much as $125,000
from buyers through fraudulent Internet auctions.</LD>
<LD>   The members of this squad are not federal agents, police
detectives or even private investigators. They are salespeople and
investment advisors and registered nurses who say they were bilked
online by the 35-year-old Arizona man and used the Internet to track
him down.</LD>
<LD>   Like a modern vigilance committee, the 50 or so people
from Florida to Alaska seized the community-building power of the
World Wide Web both to prompt and to preempt investigation by
legitimate law enforcement agencies. Although most have never met,
members of the group swapped information daily on a Web site and divided
up investigative duties--most of which also were carried out online.</LD>
<TE>   Such a rapid, wide-ranging response by ordinary people would have
been virtually impossible just a decade ago, before the Internet gave
anyone with a cheap dial-up account instant access to e-mail and
massive public databases. They are growing increasingly common,
particularly in the realm of online gaming, where players gang up to
mete out punishment to miscreants.</TE>
<TE>   But like vigilante gangs of the American frontier, ad hoc
communities seeking justice on the electronic frontier sometimes
trample the very laws they seek to enforce, as their quest for
justice warps into a plot for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "You just end up with might makes right," said Jonathan Zittrain,
co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard
Law School.</TE>
<TE>   The group seeking the seller claims that the Arizona man and his
girlfriend sold 74 laptop computers on five EBay auctions. Winners of
the mid-December auctions said the seller accepted payments--which
ranged from $1,350 to $3,700--only by cashier's check or money order.
Payments made through PayPal or escrow, commonly used in online
auctions, were refused.</TE>
<TE>   "It should have tipped us off but it didn't," said John Cobin, an
investment advisor from Oxnard and the group's unofficial manager.
After sending their payments and not receiving their laptops, several
people grew suspicious and e-mailed the nearly 60 other winners,
inviting them to join a Yahoo message group and share information on
the seller.</TE>
<TE>   Within a day, at least three people reported that the Postal
Service tracking numbers they received were falsified.</TE>
<TE>   Winners scrambled to contact the couple, but the phone number they
had for the pair soon was disconnected, several people said.</TE>
<TE>   One person, who lives in Arizona, drove to the Phoenix address to
which the payments were directed. A man at the address said that the
seller and a woman had visited recently but that they did not live
there, according to a posting.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the worst, auction winners contacted officials at EBay,
who said they would not accept complaints until 30 days after an
auction's closing date. Local law enforcement officials in Arizona
said they did not have the resources to handle the case. And the FBI
told them to fill out a form and wait.</TE>
<TE>   So they took matters into their own hands.</TE>
<TE>   They began searching online databases for additional phone numbers
and addresses. Through various online records, they obtained personal
details about the seller, such as his birth date and Social Security
number. One man, Joseph Chahine of Ohio, said he even called the
Arizona man's mother and obtained his cell phone number.</TE>
<TE>   The Times made several attempts to contact the seller and his
girlfriend but was unable to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who said she was the seller's mother told The Times that
she did not know where her son was but that "he's checking all angles
that he possibly can to get this straightened out."</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, to begin with, that he had some problems with his
shipper," who was sending him the laptops from Florida, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time she spoke to her son, the woman said, he told her
that he had contacted the police. Her son had received money for the
computers but said he was returning some of the checks, the woman
said.</TE>
<TE>   He had been buying and selling items on the Internet since about
last March, she said. He was not otherwise employed and had been
living with her in Glendale, Ariz.,  until last month, when he
"wasn't coming home at nights anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Although she did not know where her son was staying, she said she
believed he was with his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the group seeking the seller formed, Cobin became
its informal leader and began handing out assignments. Laurie
complied Arizona ZIP Codes. Sue and Mike researched genealogical
records. Pam and Hugh and Pat called the neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Soon though, squabbles broke out over the direction of the
investigation. Some people wanted to hire a private investigator.
Others wanted to contact the media. A few wanted the less active
members to pick up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying tensions eventually gave way to the fear that spies had
infiltrated the group and were reporting to "the evil one." One man
even posted the transcript from an online conversation he had with
another auction winner who had not joined the message group, citing
it as evidence of a possible mole.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the confusion and paranoia, several in the group called
for patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Try to be a little subtle," one woman wrote, "and play the spy
game."</TE>
<TE>   So after exhausting basic Internet searches and online databases,
some members of the group decided to probe further--much further.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, I can get into his Yahoo mail account and his PayPal
account (want an instant refund?) right now if I have his mother's
maiden name, last 4 digits of his SSN," one man wrote on the site. "I
could also get more info if someone could get the first 12 numbers of
his Visa card."</TE>
<TE>   Later postings asked members if they knew anyone--"a jeweler or a
mortgage broker or real estate agent or banker"--who could run a
credit report on the seller. One message suggested that they lie to
obtain his birth certificate, which, they were told, only family
members can request.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't you tell them that we are doing genealogical research and
just want to get parental names and maiden names and DOBs???,"
another asked.</TE>
<TE>   The group even attempted to obtain the seller's driver's license
number from an Arizona transportation Web site using the personal
information they already had gathered to assume his identity online.
They had all the necessary details except for his eye color.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't stop there.</TE>
<TE>   Four days into the manhunt, messages from the seller's e-mail
account began appearing on the site. Initially some feared that he
had secretly joined the unsecured message group, but one member
assured them otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "We know who is sending the e-mails from jaybird's e-mail," he
wrote in a posting to the site. "No need to worry and it is taken
care of!!!!! You will still receive them periodically ... just read,
laugh and ignore them."</TE>
<TE>   Someone in the group gained control of the e-mail account, Cobin
said. He would not say if he knew who broke into the account except
that "We've got a lot of tech-savvy people on this list."</TE>
<TE>   Although law enforcement officials can gather massive amounts of
information on individuals, average citizens--and even licensed
private investigators--are limited in what they can obtain legally,
said Lee Curtis, president of the High Technology Crime Investigation
Assn. and managing director of high-tech investigations for Kroll
Inc., a risk consulting company.</TE>
<TE>   Private investigators, for example, cannot go undercover and
assume an alternative identity to gather information on an
individual. Pretending to be a member of someone's family or the
individual himself is illegal, Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their sophisticated databases, private investigators are
also restricted from collecting certain types of information. They
cannot pull credit reports or break into someone's e-mail account,
for instance.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it stays in the realm of public information, no
problem," Curtis said. "But if you generate a ruse, then you're
crossing the line."</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to obtain information about an individual that isn't
publicly available could be "considered criminal activity [on] its
own," said Pati Urias, a spokeswoman for the Arizona attorney
general's office. The best course of action for individuals who claim
to be victims of crime is to file a complaint with law enforcement
officials, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Potentially if you go too far you can get in trouble," Urias
said.</TE>
<TE>   This month the Arizona attorney general's office agreed to look
into the case, said Laurie Pringle, a registered nurse from Penryn,
Calif., who volunteered to be the group's unofficial liaison with the
office. The attorney general's office, though, would neither confirm
nor deny its involvement.</TE>
<TE>   EBay, which has received "a number of complaints" about the five
laptop auctions, also was reviewing the case, said spokesman Kevin
Pursglove. EBay suspended the seller from the site as well. Pursglove
would not disclose the reason for the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   If the auctions are found to be fraudulent, winners may be
reimbursed up to $200, minus a $25 deductible, through EBay's
insurance program.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of their own investigation has come to a halt, members
of the message group are supplying law enforcement officials with the
details that they have obtained on the seller.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the investigator for the attorney general] knows that
some of what we've done is not quite kosher," Pringle said.</TE>
<TE>   But what they've done may have worked.</TE>
<TE>   Although at least five people posted messages online that their
checks and money orders had been cashed, this month Pringle received
a plain, business-size envelope in the mail. It bore no return
address, only a Phoenix postmark.</TE>
<TE>   Her cashier's check was inside.</TE>

<HD>Innovations Come With Surprises for Unwary</HD>

<LD>Marina Dundjerski, a writer who lives in Los Angeles, bought her own
Internet domain name, just like millions of other Americans. She also
got, at no extra charge, a big scare.</LD>
<LD>   A domain name, latimes.com, for instance, is the stuff to the
right of the @ sign in an e-mail address.</LD>
<LD>   When Dundjerski set up her domain in 2000, she paid a fee good for
two years. When the name came up for renewal this month, she went to
the Web site of the company that manages her domain-name registration
and made a discovery that left her terrified.</LD>
<TE>   "My home address was up there on the Internet for anybody to look
up," she said, her voice still quivering days after the discovery.
"All you had to do was look for my name--and I have a very unusual
name--and you'd know exactly where I live."</TE>
<TE>   It was a bit much for a woman who pays for an unlisted telephone
number so that crazies won't be able to come a-knocking.</TE>
<TE>   Dundjerski said she had no idea that registering a domain name
would make information such as her address and home telephone number
public. That's a good example of the pitfalls of technological
innovation.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet's naming system was established at a time when the
only people likely to have a domain were university computer science
labs. In that environment, it didn't matter if the phone numbers and
addresses of domain name owners were available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there are good reasons for having such information easily
accessible. When a computer system starts spitting garbage out onto
the Net, it's important for technical experts to be able to contact
that system's administrator. Likewise, it's good public policy to
give Internet users the ability to track down who's behind a Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   But today, with more and more individuals owning domains, safety
and privacy issues also must be taken into account.</TE>
<TE>   Dundjerski contacted Verisign, which owns Network Solutions, the
original registrar for domain names that end in "com," and asked that
her personal information be removed from the "whois" database, which
allows for searches by individual name or domain name.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they didn't have any way to hide the information," she
said. "But they did tell me to just make up an address and put it in
there. So that's what I did."</TE>
<TE>   That solution, however, points to another problem: The database is
unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to put your home address or telephone information
in there," said Pat Burns, a spokesman for Verisign. "All that's
really needed is a billing or administrator contact." In this case,
the Internet service provider is adequate.</TE>
<TE>   All domain name registrars--there are about 100 of them
today--must maintain a customer database under the Internet's rules.
The system is designed to make the Internet less mysterious, hold Web
site operators accountable and keep the Internet a relatively open
public entity.</TE>
<TE>   But Dundjerski's surprise discovery demonstrates that the
technologies that have become so critical to our daily lives remain
mysterious to most of us.</TE>
<TE>   Skilled engineers have made our systems easy enough for nonexperts
to use. But if you're not an expert familiar with the ins and outs of
the system, you could fall over something unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes even experts get tripped up.</TE>
<TE>   "People have looked up my home number in the database and called
me up," said usability guru Jakob Nielsen. Nielsen, a principal of
Nielsen Norman Group, is an expert on why technology is hard to use.
Nielsen said he too had to go into the database and change his
personal information to avoid further intrusions.</TE>
<TE>   He said the reason people have such problems with cutting-edge
technology is our tendency to try to interpret new gadgets through a
familiar prism.</TE>
<TE>   "When you buy something in a store, you pay for it and leave and
the store has no way to get in contact with you again," he said.
"When you buy something at an Internet store, the store will often
come back to you and try to get you to spend more money there."</TE>
<TE>   The difference in those two experiences, and the failure of unwary
consumers to anticipate the difference, is caused by our tendency to
operate in metaphors.</TE>
<TE>   What is a word processor? Well, it's like a typewriter. Although
that metaphor helps people trust the new technology enough to try it
out, selling technology with a metaphor instead of an actual
description of what's going on means users often fail to understand
crucial differences between the old and the new.</TE>
<TE>   During the Iran-Contra affair, for example, White House aide
Oliver North thought deleting files in his word processing program
would destroy crucial evidence. He didn't understand that the system
also made back-up copies at another location.</TE>
<TE>   The new technology is never really like the old stuff. Eventually
the metaphors that we use to muddle through break down.</TE>
<TE>   Dundjerski was lucky. She found out the metaphor she was
using--this domain registration thing is like a telephone
directory--wasn't true. Although she was at risk, she corrected the
problem before anything happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping other people in similar situations hear about this,"
she said. "This has got to be fixed."</TE>

<LD>Question: I have a Compaq Pentium running Windows 95. Whenever I
reboot, I get the following message: "Nsched32. This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the problem
persists, contact the program vendor." What does this mean and what
should I do to correct it?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You're having trouble with Norton's anti-virus software.
The Norton scheduler launches each time you start your computer, but
there's something wrong with your system, which is why Nsched32 keeps
hanging.</LD>
<LD>   You can try reinstalling the version you have, but we'd suggest
upgrading to the latest version.</LD>
<TE>   Q: Is it possible to run Mac floppies on a Windows PC?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sort of. Apple machines can read, write and even format PC
disks. So if your Mac disk is actually a PC disk, no problem. If you
want to read a true Mac disk on a PC, there have been some software
solutions developed over the years, including MacSee, MacAccess and
DataViz. You can try one of those.</TE>
<TE>   Q: On e-mail that I receive, the attached text files all go to my
Adobe 6.0 program, which cannot open the text files. I have done the
folders option thing and the restore thing, but still they all go to
Adobe.</TE>
<TE>   A: Try uninstalling Adobe (make sure you back up any data files
you want to keep to make sure you don't lose them). Then, reinstall
and pay attention to the default settings; toggle off those you don't
want.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is it possible to download Windows updates in one computer and
copy it to another PC so I don't have to download twice?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's technically possible but so cumbersome, failure-prone and
time-consuming that there's no real advantage to it. The friendly
geeks at Q&amp;A labs advise you to bite the bullet and make two
downloads.</TE>

<HD>Hi, E-Mail Here Often?</HD>
<DH>Sites can help screen potential dates. But finding true
love online is another matter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last date I went on was in October. The one before that was in
May. And the one before that, well, I don't remember.</LD>
<LD>   It's been exactly one year since I've been involved in any sort of
substantial relationship, and considering the substance of the last
one, that's not saying much.</LD>
<LD>   I've tried the bar, the gym, the public library and grocery store.
Girlfriends have introduced me to co-workers and former classmates,
and my sister has even tried to talk her high school science teacher
into taking me out.</LD>
<TE>   Needless to say, on Friday night, I stayed home and cleaned the
bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   (For the record: I am not repulsive or socially inept, and I do
not smell bad.)</TE>
<TE>   With Valentine's Day approaching, my editors--who are married, of
course--decided it would be "fun" if I found myself a beau online.</TE>
<TE>   You know, that's exactly what I was thinking.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, most people who post personals are regular folks like
myself who are simply lonely and looking for companionship.</TE>
<TE>   There's the Bikini and Swimsuit Dating Service and the Gothic
Personals and the Meet People With Herpes Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Although services like Yahoo personals
(http://personals.yahoo.com) are more mainstream, the basic premise
of the sites is the same.</TE>
<TE>   Post your vitals (23 years old, 5'5," 125 lbs., green eyes, dark
blond hair), personal preferences (jazz, baseball and theater) and
some pithy plea (in search of individual to share Sunday brunch and
newspaper).</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else, of course, does the same. You check them out, they
check you out. If you're lucky, cupid's arrow strikes via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every matchmaking site boasts to have a clientele that's
brainier, brawnier and more beautiful than the others.</TE>
<TE>   If only that were true.</TE>
<TE>   Neodates (www.neodates.com), for example, sent daily e-mails with
descriptions of my supposed "matches."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each e-mail, Neodates noted that my matches were
based upon the age and geographic location of the most recent
sign-ups. By geographic location, however, they narrowed potential
matches by state.</TE>
<TE>   Don't think the guy from Sacramento and I will be getting together
any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Kiss.com (www.kiss.com) delivered similar updates with details on
men who were "keen" to meet me based upon my personal ad.</TE>
<TE>   "You might like to know that you are currently number 2 in
SEAN-TK's latest list of desirable women!" one e-mail read.</TE>
<TE>   Oh goodie.</TE>
<TE>   Although two other guys rated me second, my "desirableness"
appeared to drop from there. Two more men rated me No. 3, while the
remaining guys simply noted that I was "high" on their lists.</TE>
<TE>   Match.com (www.match.com) generated the greatest response from my
ad, since members can e-mail each other through the site. (The
service hides users' e-mail addresses so they don't appear to the
recipients.)</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, I had received more than a half-dozen
responses. Some of them even appeared to be normal.</TE>
<TE>   After a while, though, the ads from "Brain surgeon looking 4 sexy
patient" and "Prince looking for his princess" all sound the same.</TE>
<TE>   But if I wanted to find my true love--instead of sitting around
and waiting for him to e-mail me--I had to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Literally.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Internet services will post an ad for free, I had to
pay a membership fee to contact other users on the site.</TE>
<TE>   And quite frankly, not even the "strikingly unattractive
non-Danish-speaking geeky Germanic WASP with cheap toupee" was worth
the $19.95 a month.</TE>

<HD>Charge Hurts Amgen's Earnings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. said Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings fell 23%,
reflecting a $203-million charge arising from unsuccessful drug
collaborations.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks-based company, which is in the process of
acquiring rival Immunex Inc., said net income fell to $163 million,
or 15 cents a share, from $210.8 million, or 19 cents, for the fourth
quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue in the quarter rose to $1.12 billion, up 18% from a year
earlier, driven by gains in Amgen's anti-anemia and chemotherapy
drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen shares edged lower in after-hours trading after closing at
$58.46, up $2.40 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they were surprised by the size of the charge, which
stemmed from discontinued research collaborations with Praecis
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also said acceptance of Aranesp, Amgen's new anti-anemia
drug, is growing more slowly than they had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said sales from Aranesp in the United States and Europe
totaled $37 million for the fourth quarter and $42 million for the
year. About half the sales went into inventory at wholesalers, a sign
of sluggish demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, it is disappointing," said Fariba Ghodsian, an analyst
with Roth Capital Partners. Ghodsian had expected $60 million from
Aranesp in 2001. "But the drug is in the early stages, and it is
always hard to judge."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said sales of Aranesp are "on track" but it is taking steps
to speed adoption of the drug, a second-generation version of Amgen's
blockbuster drug, Epogen. Aranesp is aimed at kidney disease patients
in the U.S., where it competes against Procrit, a first-generation
product sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. under a license from Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Neupogen, used to prevent infections in chemotherapy
patients, rose 13% in the quarter to $353 million from $311 million a
year earlier. Neupogen sales rose 10% in 2001, to $1.3 billion from
$1.2 billion in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Study Adds to Benefits of Rituxan</HD>

<LD>A study appearing in today's New England Journal of Medicine said a
cancer drug co-marketed by Genentech Inc. and Idec Pharmaceuticals
Corp. improves survival among patients with an aggressive form of
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when administered with standard chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   The study is likely to spur the already substantial "off-label"
use of Rituxan among patients with the fast-spreading form of
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   Rituxan, among the best-selling cancer drugs and a key profit
driver for Genentech and Idec, is approved only as a treatment for
indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is incurable.</LD>
<TE>   However, an editorial signed by Dr. Bruce Cheson of the National
Cancer Institute cautioned oncologists from immediately adopting the
treatment regimen described in the French study.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the differences in survival rates between patients
treated with a combination of Rituxan and chemotherapy and
chemotherapy alone narrow after two years.</TE>
<TE>   A second disincentive cited by Cheson is the price of Rituxan,
which will add $24,000 to the cost of treatment. The standard
chemotherapy regimen, a combination of four drugs known by the
acronym CHOP, costs $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The study was financed by Hoffman-LaRoche, which markets Rituxan
in Europe and owns 58.4% of South San Francisco-based Genentech. U.S.
sales of Rituxan grew to $779 million in 2001, up 84% from $424.3
million the previous year..</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive, fast-moving form of the disease, though curable in
30% to 40% of cases with chemotherapy, is more prevalent, and thus
represents a significant opportunity for Rituxan.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech shares rose $1.98 to close at $50.03 on the New York
Stock Exchange. San Diego-based Idec climbed $3.32 to $65.06 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn charged imprisoned crime boss Vincent
"Chin" Gigante, 73, and four associates with infiltrating the
International Longshoreman's Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The Genovese crime family, which Gigante allegedly heads, used its
control of the union to extort money from companies operating on the
piers in the New York City-New Jersey metropolitan area and Miami,
according to an indictment announced by Alan Vinegrad, U.S. attorney
for the Eastern District of New York.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for Gigante and a spokesman for the union couldn't be

<LD>An antitrust research group said it plans to file a lawsuit against
Microsoft Corp. and the Justice Department, alleging that both failed
to fully disclose contacts that led to a proposed settlement of the
case against the software giant.</LD>
<LD>   The American Antitrust Institute has set a news conference for
today to release details of its suit and a request that the judge
overseeing the remainder of the antitrust case wait for full
disclosure of the communications before passing judgment on the
settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department and nine states have agreed to the
settlement, which is subject to judicial review under the Tunney Act.</LD>
<TE>   The institute said Microsoft and the Justice Department "have
deliberately avoided the disclosure requirements of the Tunney Act
process or offered incomplete or misleading information."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said, "We've made the disclosures
required by the Tunney Act, and we look forward to court review of
the settlement."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>   Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) said the Justice

ownership and pressuring performers to pay or buy advertising in
return for air time.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United Defense Industries Inc., controlled by Carlyle Group Inc.,
would get $4.1 billion from the Pentagon over the next five years for
its Crusader artillery system, according to internal budget
documents.</LD>
<LD>   United Defense got 16% of its sales last year from the Crusader
and went public largely in anticipation of the program, analysts
said. The Pentagon's budget calls for $475 million in fiscal 2003 for
research, with procurement increasing to $1billion by 2007.</LD>
<LD>   The Army argued that the mobile howitzer is vital to its
transformation to a lighter, more agile force. The Crusader was
criticized as too heavy, so United Defense cut its weight by 25% to
41 tons. Shares of Arlington, Va.-based United Defense rose 10 cents
to $20.85 on the NYSE.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most female managers earned less money compared with men in 2000 than
they did five years earlier, according to a congressional study of 10
industries.</LD>
<LD>   Full-time female managers earned less than their male counterparts
in all 10 fields in 1995 and 2000, the General Accounting Office
found.</LD>
<LD>   In seven of the fields, the earnings gap grew during the five-year
period.</LD>
<TE>   The report suggests that women still struggle to break through the
"glass ceiling" that historically has been a barrier to advancement
in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The report does not explain why earnings may have dropped for
women managers. It noted that the pay gap was widest among parents,
and that women find it harder to balance children and a career.</TE>

<LD>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco has
temporarily suspended the major record companies' legal claims
against Napster Inc., the controversial online song-sharing service,
to give the companies more time to negotiate a settlement. The
suspension, which was made public Wednesday and will last until
mid-February, came as Patel was considering the labels' request for
summary judgment against Napster.</LD>

<LD>The Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve an
order, possibly by Friday, to return most of the $3.2-billion down
payment made by mobile telephone companies in bidding for NextWave
wireless licenses, sources familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   The 13 carriers, including Verizon Wireless, VoiceStream Wireless
and partners of AT&amp;T Wireless Services and Cingular Wireless, bid
$15.85 billion for the licenses a year ago. The sale was left hanging
after an appeals court ruled the airwaves belonged to bankrupt
NextWave Telecom Inc.</LD>

<HD>Report: Steel Tariffs Would Cost $34 Billion</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proposed tariffs and quotas on U.S. steel imports would cost the
nation's consumers up to $12 billion and foreign producers $22
billion in lost sales in the next four years, according to a study by
a free-trade group.</LD>
<LD>   The study is being used by steel-consuming companies such as
Caterpillar Inc., General Electric Co. and Maytag Corp. to convince
President Bush not to protect the steel industry, a decision Bush
will make by March.</LD>
<LD>   Protection would save 10,000 U.S. steelmaking jobs while causing
"many times this number" of job losses elsewhere in the economy, the
report by the Institute for International Economics said.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. received a patent on a method to make complex
circuits for molecular computer chips as the company builds momentum
in an area analysts say could overhaul how semiconductors are made.</LD>
<LD>   The patent, awarded to HP Labs researchers and UCLA, is the
company's third in the area of creating molecular chips and making
them more complex, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The HP Labs team discovered how to use chemical processes to grow
wires on silicon, press the device against a bath of liquid to apply
switches and then lay the next set of wires to complete the circuit.
Though it's still years away from commercial production, the
technique could be cheaper and easier.</LD>

<HD>Sales to Ex-Enron Customers Help Dynegy Profit Rise 36%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. said fourth-quarter profit rose 36%, partly boosted by
electricity sales to former customers of insolvent Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Profit from operations climbed to $144 million, or 41 cents a
share, from net income of $106 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 13% to $8.74 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy's power sales more than doubled last quarter from a year
earlier, and costs from canceling its bid for rival Enron were less
than expected, executives said. Dynegy's stock gained after earnings
matched analyst estimates, rising $1.25, or 5.4%, to $24.55 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares fell 26% last quarter and had dropped
54% in the last year.</LD>
<TE>   Dynegy's trading and marketing profit rose 58% last quarter from a
year earlier, boosted by business from customers trying to lock in
gas and electricity prices. North American gas sales rose 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy wrote off $51 million, or 14 cents a share, in the quarter
for its trading business with Enron, which filed for bankruptcy last
month. Other costs included $7 million, or 2 cents a share, to end
its bid for Enron in November and $9 million, or 3 cents, for
severance costs related to its Illinois electric utility. That made
net income $77 million, or 21 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company had said Enron costs might reach $125 million. Dynegy
will pay a $65-million dividend over two years to Chevron Texaco
Corp. for its participation in the Enron bid.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco owns 27% of Dynegy and provided $1.5 billion to
Dynegy for its $23-billion bid.</TE>

<HD>Exxon Mobil Reports 49% Drop in 4th-Quarter Profit</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Other energy companies' results also tumble from
last year's record highs as the recession halts demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL THOMASCH</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company,
Wednesday reported a 49% drop in fourth-quarter profit as the
recession put the brakes on petroleum demand and sent prices tumbling
from their year-ago highs.</LD>
<LD>   The fortunes of Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil and other energy
companies have declined sharply in recent quarters alongside oil and
natural gas prices. Compared with the last three months of 2000, when
the industry posted record profits, oil prices fell by about a third
in the fourth quarter of 2001. Natural gas prices dropped more than
60%.</LD>
<LD>   With energy prices way down, Exxon Mobil's fourth-quarter net
income fell to $2.68 billion, or 39 cents a diluted share, from $5.22
billion, or 75 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue dropped 26%, to $47.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Especially hard hit was the company's exploration and production
business, where earnings fell 55%, to $1.67 billion.</TE>
<TE>   After a fourth quarter when U.S. crude prices averaged just more
than $20 a barrel, Amerada Hess Corp. also reported a roughly 85%
decline in profit Wednesday. Kerr-McGee Corp., an oil exploration
company, and Sunoco Inc., a refining and marketing company, posted
fourth-quarter losses.</TE>
<TE>   To combat low prices, OPEC and its leading export rivals agreed
late last month to cut nearly 2 million barrels per day of oil
production from the world market.</TE>
<TE>   It marked OPEC's fourth production cut in a year, and included
promises by competing exporters such as Russia, Norway and Mexico to
help by slicing their exports.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the cuts have done little to lift crude prices. Instead, a
mild winter has capped consumption of heating oil, leading companies
to slow down output at their refineries and creating a surplus of
petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, few experts see profits for companies such as Exxon
Mobil improving much from the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Exxon Mobil rose 88 cents to close at $38.90 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil's fourth-quarter results were slightly better than
experts had forecast, thanks in large part to earnings from its
chemicals and refining and marketing business that were "considerably
stronger" than expected, said Gene Nowak, an analyst with ABN Amro.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding $200 million of expenses relating to Exxon's 1999
acquisition of Mobil, profit slipped to 42 cents a diluted share from
73 cents a share the previous year. Analysts on average had been
forecasting earnings of 39 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   In the downstream--refining, marketing and transportation-- the
company earned $1.02 billion during the fourth quarter, compared with
$1.16 billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Its chemical earnings slipped to $209 million from $215 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other companies reporting earnings, excluding one-time gains or
charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. lost a record $1.3 billion in the fourth
quarter, its first unprofitable quarter since 1998, as the biggest
U.S. securities firm by capital paid for cutting jobs and closing
offices. Merrill lost $1.51 a share, compared with a profit of $422
million, or 44 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the
$1.7 billion in restructuring costs and including expenses related to
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Merrill had a profit of $461 million,
or 48 cents a share. The firm said costs associated with the attacks
were $43 million, or 3 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   * DuPont Co., the second-largest U.S. chemical maker, said
fourth-quarter profit fell 62% because of lower demand and reduced
prices for its paints, fibers and plastics. Profit from operations
fell to $98 million, or 10 cents a share, from net income of $261
million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell 17% to $5.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank of America Corp., the third-biggest U.S. bank, said
fourth-quarter profit rose 49% as falling interest rates boosted
lending. Net income increased to $2.06 billion, or $1.28 a share,
from $1.39 billion, or 85 cents, a year earlier. Mortgage-banking
income rose 15% to $167 million as consumers refinanced their homes
at a record pace. Credit card income grew 6% to $629 million.
Investment banking income rose 29% to $473 million. Total net
interest income, which the bank makes from lending, rose 16% to $5.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America wrote off $1.19 billion in loans in the fourth
quarter, up 11% from a year earlier. Charge-offs to commercial
borrowers, including Enron Corp., rose by $50 million. Consumer
charge-offs rose by $69 million from a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Calls for Japan to Push Ahead With Economic Reform</HD>
<DH>Asia: Treasury Secretary O'Neill's speech reflects a new
softer tone from Washington in an attempt to get its point across.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>An address by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill here on Wednesday
calling for reform, political resolve and an end to economic muddle
in Japan included many of the same messages voiced for years by the
Clinton administration. But in a nation where style is extremely
important, the tone and approach were very different.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese analysts said the Bush administration's softer line is a
welcome change as the war in Afghanistan wanes and Tokyo and
Washington refocus on increasingly critical economic issues.</LD>
<LD>   "Clinton's approach was not such a comfortable one for the
Japanese people," said Osamu Ishii, international relations professor
at Tokyo's Meiji Gakuin University. "He gave us pressure, issued
numerical trade targets [on the amount of foreign goods he wanted us
to buy], visited China for as long as nine days without stopping here
and seemed to ignore the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance."</LD>
<TE>   One argument O'Neill used in his address at the Japan National
Press Center was that Japan should follow the U.S. example.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with its own downturn, O'Neill said, the United States moved
quickly, cutting interest rates 11 times since early last year and
laying the groundwork for a major economic stimulus package, all of
which will produce a U.S. recovery soon, he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of Japan's citizens and the rest of the world, he
added, Japan should follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill also sought to appeal to Japan's pride, arguing saying the
country can return to former days of economic glory if it focuses on
productivity and follows through with well-reasoned policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Some commentators have given up hope that Japan can again be an
engine for world growth and prosperity," he said. "But I believe the
critics who are ready to write off the Japanese economy are wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he sought to express empathy for Japan's fear and pain.
All countries endure periods of difficult economic adjustment, he
said, including the U.S. starting in the late 1970s and the United
Kingdom several years later. Japan's experience weathering the two
1970s oil-price shocks despite job losses and company hardship show
Japan has the wherewithal to change, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. view is a factor, said analysts, the main show
is local.</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent, the U.S. always puts pressure on Japan," said
Yoichi Shinkai, a professor with Osaka International University. "But
the old guard just ignores the U.S. Ultimately, change will depend on
how the different political camps resolve their differences."</TE>
<TE>   On one side are those officials who argue that Japan's troubled
economy must first be revived before any thought can be given to
deep-seated structural reform. These tend to support public works
spending and resist any significant change in the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, a camp that in theory includes Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, are those who argue that bloated or unprofitable
factories, banks and semi-governmental agencies need to be scrapped,
stimulus spending cut drastically and higher unemployment and other
short-term pain tolerated if Japan hopes to get back on track.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. finds itself in a touchy position. Pushing the "no-pain,
no-gain" line too hard is problematic as Japan's economy is so
fragile, and a serious financial meltdown could endanger the global
economy. If that happened, all reform bets would be off as all sides
raced for short-term band-aids.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Washington's current calls for change and
those by past administrations partly reflects the growing awareness
among Japanese of just how bad their nation's problems are.</TE>
<TE>   A decade-long slump, steady downgrading of Japanese credit
ratings, the stock market's sharp drop, rising unemployment, the
highest government debt levels in the industrialized world and
deflation have made the point eminently clear. Increasingly,
Washington is making arguments more Japanese are making themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that makes it easier for Bush officials to speak in
a softer voice is Koizumi, whose direct, populist, even quirky style
represents a refreshing break from past, generally nondescript prime
ministers stage-managed by bureaucrats. And Koizumi and Bush appear
to to share common views.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan's glacial decision-making process and indirect responses
have frustrated every recent administration, no matter how noble
their initial intentions.</TE>
<TE>   "Koizumi has called for reform for a long time," said Meiji Gakuin
University's Ishii. "Increasingly, however, his ability to get things
done is a question."</TE>

<TE>   The Dow industrials inched up 17.16 points, or 0.2%, to 9,730.96.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 20 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 22 to 14 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have been under pressure in recent sessions as investors
have focused on a still-weak outlook for corporate earnings despite
more signs that the economy may be poised to recover in the first
half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about accounting practices--and the accuracy of corporate
earnings reports--also have weighed on the market in the aftermath of
the Enron debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is really in a digestive phase more than anything
else," said Marc Klee, portfolio manager for the John Hancock
Technology Fund. "It's had such a sharp move off the bottom [since
Sept. 21], and there's skepticism about where we go from here."</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index, up 30.1% in the fourth quarter, is
down 6.7% since Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, investors were buying in such sectors as
semiconductors, biotech, banking and retailing.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is a little bit of money being put back to
work as the market tries to grind away through earnings season," said
Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates.</TE>
<TE>   More insight on the economy is expected today from Greenspan, who
will testify before the Senate Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that Greenspan will sound more optimistic
than he did in a speech Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market was sensing as much Wednesday: The 10-year T-note
yield rose to 5.02% from 4.91% on Tuesday, in part reflecting doubts
that the Fed will feel compelled to cut interest rates again when it
meets Jan. 29 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds also suffered from relatively poor demand at the Treasury's
auction of a record $25 billion of new two-year notes, analysts said.
The yield on the notes was 3.04%.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the yen barreled through the 134-per-dollar
level, ending at 134.27 in New York, a three-year low, despite
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill's attempts in a speech in Tokyo to
sound upbeat about the Japanese economy.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials have encouraged the yen's slide in recent
months in an attempt to make the country's exports cheaper for
foreign buyers. The yen has fallen from a level of 122 per dollar in
late October.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks rallied in the wake of Kmart's bankruptcy filing,
as investors bet the move may be good for the battered chain's
rivals. Wal-Mart rose $1.85 to a 52-week high of $59.86, Target
gained 84 cents to $42.66, and Ross Stores added $1.51 to $34.20.
Kmart added 20 cents to 89 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Tech shares that rebounded included Apple Computer, up $1.20 to
$23.02; Intel, up 75 cents to $32.45; Cisco Systems, up 87 cents to
$18.93; and Siebel Systems, up $2.18 to $34.80. But IBM slid $2.60 to
$107.90.</TE>
<TE>   * Trucking stocks rallied. The industry would be a prime
beneficiary of a stronger economy. Roadway jumped $2.68 to $39.35
after reporting a smaller-than-expected earnings decline in the
fourth quarter. CNF gained $1.65 to $33.86.</TE>

<HD>Robust Drug Sales Boost Pfizer's Earnings 21%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drug maker, Wednesday posted a 21%
rise in fourth-quarter operating earnings on stellar pharmaceutical
sales, including cholesterol-fighter Lipitor.</LD>
<LD>   Pfizer reported profit of $2.11 billion, or 34 cents a share,
before unusual items--in line with forecasts. Pfizer, with a stable
of prescription drugs that also includes impotence pill Viagra, is
one of the few large drug makers not yet hit by patent expirations on
key products.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the quarter increased 38% to nearly $1.96 billion,
or 30 cents a share, from $1.42 billion, or 23 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   On a net basis, Pfizer faced an easier comparison because of lower
merger-related costs in the quarter than in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue jumped 12% to $9.03 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Pfizer's results look good and are a tribute to the company's
marketing strength. It has the biggest sales force out there and
almost all its major products did better than we expected," said
Prudential Securities analyst Tim Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Lipitor rose 31% to $1.88 billion for the fourth quarter
and reached $6.4 billion for the year. Epilepsy treatment Neurontin
had sales increases of 34% to $498 million during the quarter, while
antidepressant Zoloft generated quarterly sales of $646 million, up
10%.</TE>
<TE>   Norvasc, a treatment for high blood pressure, saw sales grow 4% to
$962 million. Another key medicine, antibiotic Zithromax, rose 7% to
$560 million.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to robust sales of medicines already on the market,
the company's pipeline of experimental drugs is regarded as one of
the strongest in the pharmaceuticals industry, featuring an inhaled
form of insulin for diabetes patients and a new anti-epilepsy drug.</TE>
<TE>   Other major drug makers, such as Merck &amp; Co. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., have been hit by patent expirations on key drugs,
dragging down sales as those drugs face generic competition.</TE>
<TE>   The company's consumer businesses, which include Listerine
mouthwash, saw sales rise 5% to $1.4 billion. Revenue from its animal
health unit rose 3% to $301 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer shares rose $1 to close at $41.80 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Edison International's Southern California Edison, the state's
second-largest utility, will be allowed to use $1.2 billion from
unpaid dividends for operating expenses, California regulators said.</LD>
<LD>   The state's Public Utilities Commission voted 5 to 0 for the
resolution. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, a consumer protection
arm of the PUC, had urged the panel to reject it, saying the money
should be used to pay debt.</LD>

<HD>Broadcom Posts Loss; Revenue Drops 33%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wires Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcom Corp., the Irvine communications chip maker, said Wednesday
it posted a fourth-quarter loss on a 33% drop in revenue amid the
slowdown in global technology spending. Its shares fell as much as
8.8% after the company forecast first-half sales below analysts'
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom reported a net loss of $329.6 million, or $1.27 a share,
compared with a net loss of $768.3million, or $3.28 a share, a year
ago.</LD>
<LD>   On a pro forma basis, which excludes items such as
acquisition-related expenses and payroll taxes on certain stock
option exercises, Broadcom's fourth-quarter loss was $28.8 million,
or 11 cents a share, compared with a profit of $58 million, or 21
cents a share, a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   The average estimate of 24 brokers surveyed by research firm
Thomson Financial/First Call was for a pro forma loss of 12 cents per
share.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter revenue was $226.8 million, down 33% from the
year-ago quarter, but up 6.2% from the third quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The company said first-quarter revenue will rise 3% to 4% from the
fourth quarter, and be in the "mid-single digits" in the second
quarter. Both were below analysts' estimates of 5% for the first
quarter, and 11% in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom shares fell to $42.15 in after-hours trading, after a
gain of 4.2%, or $1.83, to $45.38 in regular trading on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Activision Inc., the Santa Monica video-game publisher, said
fiscal third-quarter profit surged 91% thanks to a strong holiday
season. The company posted a profit of $39.1 million, or 66 cents a
share, up from a profit of $20.5 million, or 45 cents a share. That
beat a First Call estimate of 58 cents. Sales in the period ended
Dec. 31 rose 40%, to $371 million, from $264.5 million a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company also raised its financial estimates for the year
ending March 31, saying it will probably post $765 million in
revenue, up from previous guidance of $725million. The company's
shares hit $27 in after-hours trading. It closed at $24.80 in regular
Nasdaq trading. The results were announced after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   * BCE Inc., Canada's biggest telecommunications company, said its
fourth-quarter loss widened as operating costs rose almost three
times as fast as sales. The Montreal-based company's loss was $194.2
million, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $4.4
million a year earlier. BCE said it spent $248 million, mostly to cut
jobs at its Bell Canada and Aliant phone units and to write down its
analog cell-phone and paging networks. BCE also spent more to attract
new customers for wireless and other services, pushing operating
expenses up 23% to $2.41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Corning Inc., the biggest maker of optical fiber, said its
fourth-quarter loss widened dramatically on expenses for job cuts and
inventory write-downs and a 53% plunge in sales. The loss grew to
$655 million, or 69 cents a share, from $58 million, or 6 cents, in
the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell to $974 million from $2.08
billion. The company said it may see "improved demand in the second
half of this year," though it didn't give 2002 forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding $799 million in pretax expenses for job cuts, plant
write-downs, pretax acquisition costs and other items, Corning said
it would have had a loss of $261 million, or 28 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   * EarthLink Inc., the third-biggest U.S. Internet service
provider, said its first-quarter loss excluding some costs will be
wider than expected. Excluding acquisition-related costs,
Atlanta-based EarthLink said the loss will be 10 cents to 13 cents a
share on sales of $340million. It was expected to lose 8 cents a
share on sales of $347.8 million. EarthLink plans to increase its
marketing spending by 10% to 20% this year to attract customers to
its regular and high-speed Internet access. EarthLink said it lost
103,000 dial-up customers from a year ago, and that it would sign up
as many as 300,000 high-speed Internet customers this year, less than
forecast.</TE>
<TE>   * LSI Logic Corp., the biggest maker of custom semiconductors,
said it had a fourth-quarter loss on falling chip sales and
restructuring and acquisition costs. The loss was $250.1 million, or
68 cents a share, compared with net income of $61.7million, or 18
cents, a year earlier, the Milpitas, Calif., company said. Sales fell
46% to $405.8 million from $750.6 million. LSI said it expects
first-quarter sales of break even to 3% above the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * SAP, the largest maker of business-management software, said
fourth-quarter profit fell 13% on costs from an acquisition in the
United States, but expects sales will rise strongly in 2002. Europe's
biggest software maker earned $281 million in the three months
through December versus $322million a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to
$2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Profit would have risen but for costs stemming from its
$400-million purchase of portal software maker Top Tier last year.
Its results also were depressed by its share of losses at Commerce
One Inc., a U.S. maker of software for Internet exchanges in which
SAP has a stake of more than 20%. For 2002, SAP said revenue would
grow 15% and said it would increase its profit margins, mostly in the
second half of the year.</TE>

<HD>Audit: Millions in Costs Misreported by Verizon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc.'s California unit misreported more than
$100 million in costs, made excess profit and should return some
money to customers, a consumer advocacy group said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest U.S. local-phone company failed to comply with
California reporting regulations between 1996 and 1998, the Office of
Ratepayer Advocates said. The California Public Utilities Commission
should impose tighter rules and force New York-based Verizon to
return allegedly excess profit to its customers, the group said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're asking the commission to take strong steps to resuscitate
its regulatory oversight and set the stage to protect the financial
interests of consumers," the group's director, Regina Birdsell, said
in a statement. "The commission should make sure these dollars get
back to Verizon's customers."</LD>
<TE>   The advocates office is an independent arm of the state PUC.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon misallocated costs, exhibited weak internal controls and
failed to comply with the CPUC's rules regarding affiliate
transactions, said Dan Sanchez, who oversaw the audit.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon agreed with findings regarding the reporting of about $50
million, and it has agreed to change some "internal procedures,"
spokeswoman Julia Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon shares rose 85 cents Wednesday, to $49.15 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates released its
statement after trading closed.</TE>

<DL>LOS GATOS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Steve Wozniak, who helped usher in the personal computer era when he
co-founded Apple Computer Inc., emerged from semi-retirement
Wednesday with plans to create new wireless devices to help "everyday
people track everyday things."</LD>
<LD>   Wozniak, who in 1976 created the first Apple computers with high
school friend Steve Jobs, said he has formed a new company called
Wheels of Zeus, or wOz, a play on his nickname.</LD>
<LD>   The computer industry's most famous garage tinkerer said he
believes the time is right to develop a new class of consumer
electronics to take advantage of advances in satellite tracking,
wireless networks and more powerful computer chips.</LD>

<HD>Newport Corp. Plans to Acquire Micro Robotics</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Dow Jones</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to acquire Micro Robotics
Systems Inc., a private manufacturer of high-precision, fully
automated assembly and dispensing systems, for $55 million to $65
million.</LD>
<LD>   Newport said it expects the deal to boost 2002 earnings slightly.
The Irvine company makes components used in industries ranging from
fiber-optic telecommunications to aerospace.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the first
quarter, includes a combination of cash and stock and the assumption
and conversion of certain stock options. The final value will be
determined by the price of Newport's shares when the transaction
closes.</LD>
<TE>   Micro Robotics, which is based in North Billerica, Mass., had 2001
sales of $25 million but expects sales to drop to between $15 million
and $18 million this year because of a slowdown in its end markets,
Newport said.</TE>
<TE>   Newport shares moved up $1.02 to $22.45 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc. will pay biotechnology company EntreMed Inc. as much as
$41 million for rights to Panzem, an experimental drug to treat eye
conditions that can lead to blindness, the companies said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under a five-year agreement, EntreMed, based in Rockville, Md.,

In older people, such vessels can rupture and bleed, leading to
blindness.</LD>

the anti-wrinkle treatment Botox.</LD>

<HD>Broadcom Posts Loss; Revenue Drops 33%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Communications chip maker Broadcom Corp., saying Wednesday that the
worst is over for the company in the yearlong industry slump,
reported a sharp reduction in its fourth-quarter loss, even though
sales dropped 33%.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine-based company lost $329.6 million, or $1.27 a share, in
the quarter, compared with a loss of $768.3 million, or $3.28 a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $226.8 million from $340.2
million.</LD>
<LD>   But the company's news, released after the market closed, did not
cheer Wall Street. The stock gained $1.83 to close at $45.38 a share
on Nasdaq, but lost as much as $3.98 in after-hours trading.</LD>
<TE>   In an industry that suffered its worst year in 2001 with sales
falling more than 30%, analysts and money managers are looking mainly
at revenue growth from one quarter to the next, and Broadcom didn't
quite measure up, said analyst Kalpesh Kapadia at C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street had expected sales of $225 million to $230 million,
and Broadcom came in at the lower end. Executives said they expect
sales in the first three months to be up 3% to 4% over fourth-quarter
sales, but that also would be a few million dollars below what
analysts are anticipating, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter sales did grow 6% from $213.6 million in the third
quarter, when the company lost $1.6 billion, or $6.36 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom is banking on new products and increased sales of current
products to reach profitability, excluding special charges, by late
this year. Among those products are new chip sets for wireless local
area networks. The company's chief executive, Henry T. Nicholas III,
said he expects these LAN chips to be a major driver in the company's
growth this year.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Broadcom lost $2.7 billion, or $10.79 a share,
compared with the previous year's loss of $687.8 million, or $3.13 a
share. Sales fell nearly 13% to $961.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings reported Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * QLogic Corp., Aliso Viejo supplier of computer storage area
networking equipment, earned $17 million, or 18 cents a share, for
its fiscal third quarter, down 33% from last year's third-quarter
profit of $25.2 million, or 26 cents a share. Sales fell 14% to $83.6
million. Though revenue dropped year-to-year, sales grew 2% from the
second quarter, giving analysts hope of an upswing.</TE>
<TE>   * Activision Inc., the Santa Monica video-game publisher, said its
fiscal third-quarter profit surged 91% due to a strong holiday
season. The company posted a profit of $39.1 million, or 66 cents a
share, up from $20.5 million, or 45 cents a share. That beat a First
Call estimate of 58 cents. Sales in the period ended Dec. 31 rose
40%, to $371 million, from $264.5 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company also raised its financial estimates for the year
ending March 31, saying it probably will post $765 million in
revenue, up from previous guidance of $725million. The company's
shares hit $27 in after-hours trading. It closed at $24.80 in regular
Nasdaq trading. The results were announced after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   * BCE Inc., Canada's biggest telecommunications company, said its
fourth-quarter loss widened as operating costs rose almost three
times as fast as sales. The Montreal-based company's loss was $194.2
million, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $4.4
million a year earlier. BCE said it spent $248 million, mostly to cut
jobs at its Bell Canada and Aliant phone units and to write down its
analog cell-phone and paging networks. BCE also spent more to attract
new customers for wireless and other services, pushing operating
expenses up 23% to $2.41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Corning Inc., the biggest maker of optical fiber, said its
fourth-quarter loss widened dramatically on expenses for job cuts and
inventory write-downs and a 53% plunge in sales. The loss grew to
$655 million, or 69 cents a share, from $58 million, or 6 cents, in
the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell to $974 million from $2.08
billion. Excluding $799 million in pretax expenses, acquisition costs
and other items, Corning said it would have had a loss of $261
million, or 28 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   * EarthLink Inc., the third-biggest U.S. Internet service
provider, said its first-quarter loss excluding some costs will be
wider than expected. Excluding acquisition-related costs,
Atlanta-based EarthLink said the loss will be 10 cents to 13 cents a
share on sales of $340million. It was expected to lose 8 cents a
share on sales of $347.8 million. EarthLink plans to increase its
marketing spending by 10% to 20% this year to attract customers to
its regular and high-speed Internet access. EarthLink said that it
lost 103,000 dial-up customers from a year ago, and that it would
sign up as many as 300,000 high-speed Internet customers this year,
less than forecast.</TE>
<TE>   * LSI Logic Corp., the biggest maker of custom semiconductors,
said it had a fourth-quarter loss on falling chip sales and
restructuring and acquisition costs. The loss was $250.1 million, or
68 cents a share, compared with net income of $61.7million, or 18
cents, a year earlier, the Milpitas, Calif., company said. Sales fell
46% to $405.8 million from $750.6 million. LSI said it expects
first-quarter sales of break even to 3% above the fourth quarter.</TE>

<LD>A high-performance speedboat that capsized Jan. 11, killing all four
men aboard, was recovered from Castaic Lake on Wednesday by L.A.
County sheriff's deputies. County divers attached inflatable sacks to
gradually lift the 30-foot vessel to the surface in a process that
took nearly five hours. The boat was then taken to a sheriff's
storage facility, where detectives will further examine the craft.
The body of one victim was found immediately after the accident, and
the other three have since been recovered. "The boat was secondary to
the whole operation," Deputy Bryan White said. "It's not like it was
going anywhere, and the victims needed to be recovered first."</LD>

Islam's upcoming conference at the Convention Center will stand,
lawmakers decided Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The waiver--one of dozens the city routinely grants to community
groups for public events--had been challenged by the Anti-Defamation
League, which cited the "Nation of Islam's unwavering record of
racism and bigotry."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Councilmen Jack Weiss and Eric Garcetti asked the city
attorney to determine if the Feb. 13-17 event, an anti-gang
convention with Magic Johnson as an honorary co-chairman, met city
criteria for waivers. By Wednesday, they had their answer: The
conference, billed as educational rather than religious, appeared to
serve a public purpose.</LD>

<HD>Ready for a Final Change of Scenery</HD>
<DH>Blight: A city landscape architect's last assignment is to
beautify the grimy L.A. port area and Terminal Island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilbert Flores strode across a slab of cracked pavement beside twin
concrete domes blackened with soot. It was as ugly as could be, but
Flores could see the future, and to him it's beautiful.</LD>
<LD>   "Imagine what this place will look like with some Italian
cypresses and ficus trees," he said. "Spectacular."</LD>
<LD>   A month away from retirement, the veteran city landscape architect
is facing a final assignment few would envy: improving the scenery at
the Port of Los Angeles and Terminal Island with $3 million worth of
palms, flowering trees, bougainvillea, granite boulders and sod.</LD>
<TE>   To many, the name Terminal Island conjures infernal images of
flaming refinery towers, towering gray cranes, black mountains of
petroleum byproducts, and smelly fish canneries. Not to mention the
federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Flores, however, has found the few undeveloped strips of dirt and
asphalt to be sources of inspiration--and targets for his brand of
low-maintenance, high-impact landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "Lush, domed-shaped ficus trees will actually resonate with the
existing architecture," he said. "Palms swaying in the sea breezes
will seem to wave 'Hello there' to all who enter."</TE>
<TE>   Some might call that wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Flores, 59, presented his "port beautification plan"
to the Harbor Commission Wednesday. His proposal was developed from
among hundreds of ideas raised in community meetings in San Pedro,
Wilmington and Harbor City over the past two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Beautification is a very important aspect of our development
plan," said chief harbor engineer Stacey Jones. "And Gil is the right
man for the job because of his passion and talent in landscaping and
in dealings with people."</TE>
<TE>   Flores was raised on the city's Eastside and earned a master's
degree in urban planning from Pepperdine University. He launched his
career in 1970 when he joined the city Department of Public Works in
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he helped found Barrio Planners, an idealistic group
of environmental designers and activists responsible for a number of
landmarks celebrating Latino history and pride, including El Parque
de Mexico in Lincoln Heights and greenbelts at the Ramona Gardens
housing project straddling Boyle Heights and City Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   "Gil knows his way around," said Barrio Planners architect Frank
Villalobos, who is designing four Eastside light-rail stations for
the MTA. "If anybody can beautify Terminal Island--or at least hide a
little bit of all that steel--he can."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past three decades, Flores has overseen the greening of
more than 1,000 road medians, mini-parks and flood channels, as well
as downtown's Plaza de la Raza and the mayoral mansion grounds in
Hancock Park.</TE>
<TE>   He's used to a big challenge. In 1981 he took a leave of absence
to be landscape project manager at the then-new Saudi Arabian
industrial city of Yanbu.</TE>
<TE>   Suffering from severe jet lag shortly after his arrival, Flores
was snoozing in the aisles of a large auditorium when someone yelled,
"Where's Gil Flores?"</TE>
<TE>   "I slapped myself awake," he recalled. "Suddenly, they brought in
a big chair and sat me in front of then-Prince Fahd, who leaned
forward, looked me in the eye and said, 'I don't like desert
landscaping in the new city. I want tropical trees. I want you to fix
it."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Ay, caramba! How do I do that?' " he recalled with a
laugh. "But I said, 'Prince, no problem. We'll change it. But it'll
take time because we can't rush nature.'"</TE>
<TE>   When Fahd became king of Saudi Arabia a year later, Flores helped
transform a remote sand bar on the Red Sea into an oasis for a huge
royal summer palace.</TE>
<TE>   But can Flores green up the port's industrial zones?</TE>
<TE>   "Piece of cake," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   Along a half-mile stretch of Wilmington's Avalon Boulevard, a
seaside lane strewn with trash and lined with ship repair shops and
foundries slathered in graffiti, he'll plant palms on one side and
shade trees on the other.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed at a street corner marked by battered corrugated
fences, high-voltage lines, train tracks and big rigs spewing black
exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   "Right here," he said, "we'll add a row of poplars, some river
stone and lawn."</TE>
<TE>   And that was just for starters.</TE>
<TE>   "A stone mound with palm trees, flowering shrubs and vines will
look great on the southeast corner."</TE>
<TE>   Standing behind the former U.S. Customs headquarters on Terminal
Island, he surveyed a vacant lot. It was just a weed patch, but to
Flores it hid great promise. Just add water.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to be covered with Canary Island pines and
eucalyptus trees. It'll be one of the largest urban forests in
Southern California that is not a public park."</TE>
<TE>   "In 10 years," he predicted, "what we've accomplished here will
have a softening, welcoming effect upon all who enter the port. Like
cat's fur."</TE>

<HD>Jones Assails Riordan as Simon Stays on Sidelines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The leading Republican candidates for governor picked up Wednesday
where their Tuesday night debate left off, with Bill Jones attacking
Richard Riordan, and Bill Simon Jr. staying largely on the sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan laid out a plan to revamp school
budgeting by requiring districts to disclose how much they spend on
bureaucracy versus classroom instruction.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Jones lit into Riordan for police corruption,
the 2000 Metropolitan Transportation Authority strike and the San
Fernando Valley secession movement.</LD>
<TE>   Businessman Simon, curiously, shunned the attention that follows a
big political event like Tuesday night's debate, making no public
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   The man they want to replace, meanwhile, disputed their criticisms
of him. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, said his Republican challengers
were "light on specifics" about the looming budget deficit and erred
in their energy policy proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican debate at San Jose State was the highest-profile
event of a campaign that has been widely overlooked by Californians
unaccustomed to voting as early as the March 5 primary. Still, on
Wednesday the political landscape looked much as it did 24 hours
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan remains the candidate to beat, according to polls and
analysts; Jones and Simon are vying as the conservative alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "If one can shake the other out, we could have a fairly
interesting horse race between now and March 5," said Larry Gerston,
a political science professor at San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   Two debates are set to follow, but strategists for the
front-running Riordan were convinced that Tuesday night's session was
the one that mattered most. That is because the second debate, to be
held next month at the state GOP convention, won't be broadcast
statewide, and the third, Feb. 13 in Long Beach, will coincide with
the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   With so much focus on Tuesday night, the Riordan camp had pushed
for a format that would minimize confrontation between the candidates
by seating them in collegial fashion at a sort of Republican round
table.</TE>
<TE>   Though privately conceding that Riordan's performance was shaky,
campaign strategists were generally pleased that nothing apparently
happened to upset the status quo. As one put it, "It was a nonevent,
and from our perspective that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who played the aggressor Tuesday night, continued his tough
talk Wednesday at a Sacramento news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He questioned Riordan's assertion at the debate that lobbyists
"did not get in my office" during his eight years as Los Angeles
mayor. Jones cited Riordan's hiring of Webster Hubbell--a confidant
of former President Bill Clinton--and ex-City Councilman Richard
Alatorre to work as lobbyists for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "These two performed little or no work," Jones said of the
convicted felons.</TE>
<TE>   He challenged Riordan's management style. "Let's talk about the
MTA," Jones said, his voice rising as he scorned Riordan's assertion
that he hired talented underlings to help him as mayor. "When he was
in France bicycling while poor people in Los Angeles couldn't move
because of the strike, where were the best and brightest?"</TE>
<TE>   Taking issue with Riordan's statements that he cut crime, Jones
cited the Rampart police scandal. "He couldn't manage the Police
Department to the extent to keep them from getting into a personnel
disaster that is costing the city a lot of money," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones did not bring it up Wednesday, Riordan misspoke in
the debate when he said that he had not received campaign donations
from Enron, the embattled energy company. Actually, Enron's energy
trading arm gave Riordan's mayoral re-election campaign $500 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he had not known about the donation and his campaign
manager, Ron Hartwig, said he took responsibility for the campaign's
failure to uncover it. "We will happily write a check for $500 and
send it back to Enron tomorow," Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, resuming the stance he took much of Tuesday night,
largely ignored the criticisms. He denied direct responsibility for
the hiring of Hubbell and Alatorre, saying they were retained by
others in the city government. He did, however, acknowledge that he
approved keeping Alatorre on the payroll once he was brought on.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan focused on education in a speech to the San Jose Rotary
Club and Silicon Valley Commonwealth Club.</TE>
<TE>   He said public schools should have to list spending on
administration separately from spending on books, classroom supplies
and teacher salaries. By cutting back on bureaucracy, Riordan said,
districts could raise teachers' salaries without requiring additional
government funding.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, he was asked whether he supported school
vouchers or for-profit companies such as Edison Schools being hired
to run public schools. "I'm not an ideologue for or against
vouchers," said Riordan, referring to the use of taxpayer funds to
help subsidize private schools. "If it works for the children, I'm in
favor of it."</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan and Jones were stumping, Simon remained out of public
view, the biggest unknown in the campaign--literally and
figuratively.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to keeping a low profile on the campaign trail, he has
made only a modest investment in statewide TV advertising, the most
important means of communicating with California voters.</TE>
<TE>   A new spot featuring former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
airing in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but not with the frequency
that advertising experts said a little-known candidate like Simon
needs.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Simon is spending just about $150,000 on ads this
week--a quarter of what Gov. Gray Davis has sunk into the state's
costliest media market in the same time span.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Wednesday that his sparsely scheduled day was part of
the natural cycle of campaigning. "We felt that last night was a very
public event," he said in a telephone interview. "We do a mixture of
things."</TE>
<TE>   As for his limited TV buy, Simon vowed, "We're going to run a very
strong media campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan began his first TV advertising on his home turf--a
30-second spot that started in Los Angeles and is set for statewide
broadcast starting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The spot is perhaps most notable for what it doesn't say--that
Riordan is a Republican--and for whom it fleetingly shows--the GOP's
nemesis, Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The most gripping video footage is of damage inflicted by the 1994
Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan is shown on the scene, talking in a group with Clinton.
The former president is visible in a side view but is not identified
in the ad.</TE>

<HD>2 Brothers Shot, 1 Fatally, Trying to Stop Teen
Spray-Painting Graffiti</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A teenage security guard was fatally shot and his older brother was
critically wounded as they attempted to stop an armed teenager who
was spray-painting graffiti in South Los Angeles, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Gamez, 18, and his brother, Oscar, 21, were guarding the
Plaza Vermont apartment complex in the 900 block of 62nd Street when
they saw a young man vandalizing a home across the street.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers, who worked for their stepfather's security company,
Suarez Security, confronted the teen, who opened fire with an
automatic rifle shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday, said Officer Guillermo
Campos, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Both brothers were taken to a nearby hospital, where Luis died.
Oscar was listed in stable condition late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The stepfather, Alberto Suarez, witnessed the shooting and
struggled with the gunman before the assailant freed himself and ran.
Luis stood beside him during the struggle, Suarez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried to him, 'Put the handcuffs on him, son,' " Suarez said
between sobs.</TE>
<TE>   "But he was no longer saying anything. I told him, 'Why aren't you
putting the handcuffs on him?' But he had collapsed."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez said Luis died in his arms.</TE>
<TE>   "My son was beautiful. He was never in the streets, his free time
he spent with me. He was never with gangs. He was a wonderful
student," Suarez said. "I won't rest until they catch the person who
did this and until I see him with my own eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Luis was to graduate in June from Garfield High School in East Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to join the military and eventually take over the family
business, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar is a student at Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Police described the suspect, who remained at large late
Wednesday, as a teenager who used to frequent the area.</TE>
<TE>   Several residents of the apartment building said the brothers were
cheerful and respectful.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Smith, 28, said she was in her apartment when the
gunshots rang out. After they stopped, she rushed to the scene and
saw Oscar on the ground trying to call for help on a hand radio. She
said she saw his brother writhing in pain on the sidewalk near a
telephone pole.</TE>
<TE>   Some area residents said the shooting frightened them so much that
they are thinking of moving away. Others said they worried about
their children's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Warren, 23, who lives in the apartment complex, said he was
going up the elevator with his fiancee and his three children when he
heard the gunshots that smashed a glass door and left a trail of
bullet holes at Plaza Vermont's entrance.</TE>
<TE>   He was carrying his 6-month-old daughter when he left the elevator
and ran to his apartment. He said the neighborhood violence forces
him to keep his family inside as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even let them go outside and play with the other kids,"
Warren said, "because stuff can happen at night or during the day. I
don't want them to be dodging bullets."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Back State Plan to Help Insure More Poor</HD>
<DH>Dilemma: Move pleases health care advocates, but puts
Davis on the spot. He has proposed delaying program due to budget
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is poised to approve a California program to
provide insurance to 300,000 working poor parents, by far the largest
of its kind in the nation, administration sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The move, hailed by health-care advocates, would allow the state
to expand insurance coverage to parents of low-income children now
eligible for the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs.</LD>
<LD>   But the decision also places California Gov. Gray Davis in a tough
spot as he seeks reelection this year. The politically popular
expansion, though funded mostly by the federal government, still
requires hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from the
cash-poor state.</LD>
<TE>   Davis supported the expansion in 2000, when state coffers were
full. But late last year, faced with a $12.4-billion shortfall, he
proposed delaying the start of the program until July 2003. That is
projected to save $54.3 million in the current fiscal year and $160.5
million the following one.</TE>
<TE>   For every dollar the state saves by delaying, however, it would
sacrifice twice that much in federal matching funds--$430 million
over two years.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official said Wednesday that federal health
officials would not approve the expansion if they did not believe
California could afford it.</TE>
<TE>   The approval by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson is expected to be formally announced
Friday in Los Angeles. It comes about six months after he signaled
that the weakening economy might make it impossible for the Bush
administration to follow through on the president's vow to expand
coverage to 39 million uninsured Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The White House's decision to give the nod to California
immediately provided fodder in what is shaping up to be a tough
gubernatorial campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, one of Davis' GOP rivals
in the race, responded to the news by calling Davis' proposal for
delay "terrible."</TE>
<TE>   "People have a God-given right to health care," Riordan said while
on a campaign swing through the Salinas Valley. "How can a human
being like Gray Davis deny that to them? I think it's despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended the governor's decision
to delay the expansion. Davis, she said, designed his budget based on
"our best understanding and estimate of our budget realities."</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's proposal is not to walk away from this
[expansion]," McLean said, "but it's certainly to follow through on
the commitment to expand Healthy Families when we have the resources
to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Another Davis administration official questioned the timing of the
federal approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Where were the feds when we needed them a year ago?" asked Glen
Rosselli, the undersecretary of the state Health and Human Services
Agency who has overseen the expansion request.</TE>
<TE>   Through Medi-Cal and Healthy Families, California provides medical
coverage to about 1 million children whose families earn less than
250% of the federal poverty level. That comes out to $44,125 per year
for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to be approved by the Bush administration would
expand coverage to working parents earning up to twice the federal
poverty level, which equals about $35,300 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible parents would receive a benefits package similar to that
offered to children in the Healthy Families program, including
physician visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs and mental
health coverage. Families generally would pay premiums of $10 to $20
per month, depending on income.</TE>
<TE>   Children's advocates have argued forcefully that extending health
coverage to parents would increase the likelihood that their children
will be enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the brewing political controversy, news of Thompson's
impending decision was welcomed by California's Democratic lawmakers
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is true, it is very good news," said Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   The state initially requested approval from Washington for the
program in December 2000, at the end of the Clinton administration.
Advocates--and Davis administration officials--long had criticized
the federal government for moving slowly on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some advocates are parting ways with the Davis
administration, saying that any delay by the state would be
"penny-wise and pound-foolish." California has the fourth-highest
rate of uninsured people in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Davis administration can't say that the feds are presenting
any barrier," said Amy Dominguez-Arms, vice president of Children Now
in Oakland. "We would be able to do this now but for the fact that
the governor is saying, 'Let's delay it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jim Keddy, director of the PICO California Project, a faith-based
group that advocates for the poor, said his group recognizes that the
state is in a budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But "on the other hand, this is a program that the federal
government matches two to one with every state dollar. When you look
at the big picture, the benefits outweigh the costs."</TE>
<TE>   If California goes forward with the program, it would be by far
the largest expansion of health coverage to low-income parents in the
country. Arizona was granted federal approval last month to extend
coverage to about 25,000 uninsured parents eligible under new more
flexible federal guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Even amid a budget crisis and in the heat of a gubernatorial
contest, key state Democratic leaders were pleased at the expected
federal go-ahead. "Hopefully we'll be able to do this. It's something
I want to do. It's something the Democrats want to do," said Senate
Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), among the strongest
advocates of the program, said she "never agreed" to Davis' proposal
to delay the start of the program's expansion until 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative subcommittees working on the state budget had been
planning to vote today on Davis' proposal to delay the insurance
expansion. But once word spread that Bush was approving the federal
expenditure, at least some lawmakers were reconsidering their support
for Davis' proposed cut.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one of Davis' GOP rivals supported the delay given the
current budget woes.</TE>
<TE>   "Healthy Families is a worthy program that we'd like to expand,
but until we fix the mess that Gray Davis has put the state in,
unfortunately we can't afford it right now," said Jeff Flint, a
spokesman for businessman Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, another GOP candidate, could not be
reached.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Curb Jewelry District Hazards Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City officials Wednesday unveiled a plan to clean up environmental
and fire hazards in downtown's jewelry district, but acknowledged
that the plan mostly restates or weakens current laws.</LD>
<LD>   City officials--under pressure to sustain the economic life of the
jewelry district--presented the guidelines at a private meeting of
jewelry manufacturers, telling them that the rules were relaxed to
help them stay in business.</LD>
<LD>   Enforcing the "existing law would be much more stringent than the
guidelines. If we cited you based on the laws that exist now, we
would be much harsher," said Tara Devine, Mayor James K. Hahn's
representative to the industry-government task force that developed
the enforcement guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   David Keim, the city Building and Safety Department's head of code
enforcement, called the guidelines "somewhat relaxed interpretations
of the code."</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines presented Wednesday are meant to correct health and
safety hazards without shutting down jewelry businesses. About 700
jewelry makers operate in high-rise buildings downtown, employing
15,000 people, according to industry estimates. The district is the
nation's second-largest jewelry manufacturing and retail zone, after
New York's.</TE>
<TE>   The jewelry district has operated for decades despite being
basically illegal, due to chemical and fire hazards posed by the
manufacturing process. None of the 31 downtown high-rise office
buildings now occupied by jewelry makers is approved to house them.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown jewelry makers routinely use toxic chemicals such as
cyanide as well as torches and ovens in manufacturing processes that
by law are restricted to buildings rated for hazardous uses.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines will effectively legalize jewelry making by
amending building laws. Jewelry making will be placed in the same
category as less hazardous furniture manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines will require manufacturers to follow many safety
rules they now violate. The rules will allow some illegal
practices--such as the use of torches--to continue only with new
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines resulted from a series of meetings that began in
2000 between industry representatives and government officials. The
meetings were closed to the public and organized by the Downtown
Center Building Improvement District, a powerful group of property
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Schatz, who heads both the Building Improvement District and
the Central City Assn., a business lobbying group, praised the
guidelines as the product of "a true partnership" between business
and government. "We went to the mayor's office, they made a few
calls, and the rest is history," Schatz said of the help provided by
public officials beginning in the Richard Riordan administration.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the guidelines will be phased in over the next few
months. Alan Wendell of the Building and Safety Department told the
industry group that an outreach program will begin in February to
inform businesses of the guidelines. In March, inspections will begin
to ensure that businesses are complying with the guidelines, Wendell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wendell explained key guidelines to the group, including that "no
untreated hazardous waste should go into the sewer system" and that
an approved hazardous waste hauler should be used to dispose of toxic
wastes. Responding to an audience question, Wendell acknowledged that
the guidelines "come from the existing code. They are not new rules."</TE>
<TE>   Code enforcement head Keim said city officials "are hoping to get
100% voluntary compliance" from jewelry manufacturers through their
light-handed approach. "Our purpose is not to punish everybody. Our
purpose is to correct some unsafe conditions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That cooperative spirit was evident when a participant asked what
to do with cyanide, which is in numerous jewelry-district buildings
but will be prohibited by the guidelines. "I would highly recommend
you use it up," said city Fire Department Inspector Tobi Perkins.
Not all participants at the meeting were pleased with the guidelines.
Ronald Hartmann, a lawyer for a jewelry manufacturer concerned about
what he considers hazardous conditions in the district, said he was
upset that the task force met privately. (A manufacturers' flier
promoting the meeting said it was "closed to the public," despite the
presence of local, state and federal officials; a Times reporter who
attended was asked not to participate in the question-and-answer
segment of the program.)</TE>
<TE>   "In a state that prides itself on sunshine for government, it
looks like a covert attempt to make something illegal legal," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Names 2 for Judgeships in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Courts: The president's picks were also tapped by his
father, but no hearings were held.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday nominated two Republican attorneys from
Los Angeles who are former federal prosecutors for prestigious
positions as U.S. District Court judges.</LD>
<LD>   Bush tapped Percy Anderson, 52, a partner at Sonnenschein, Nath &amp;
Rosenthal, and John F. Walter, 57, senior partner at Walter,
Finestone &amp; Richter, a firm that he founded.</LD>
<LD>   They are the president's first nominations for the District Court
in Los Angeles, which has six vacancies and where judges are carrying
heavy caseloads. There are 21 federal trial judges in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Anderson and Walter were nominated for federal judgeships by
Bush's father in 1992, but their nominations died without a hearing
as the confirmation process ground to a halt in the closing months of
his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Anderson and Walter were unanimously recommended for
the judgeships by a six-member screening committee of Democratic and
Republican attorneys that was created by representatives of the Bush
administration and California's two Democratic senators, Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   The nominations were among 24 Bush sent to the Senate on Wednesday
for judgeships around the country. In recent weeks, Bush has
complained about the pace of the confirmation process. When the
Senate adjourned Dec. 20, it had confirmed just 28 federal judges.
Before Wednesday's action by Bush, there were 23 nominations to
federal appeals courts and 14 nominations to District Courts. Both
California senators issued statements praising the nominees, which
should enhance their prospects for a swift confirmation, said Gerald
Parsky, the West Los Angeles attorney who heads Bush's California
judicial screening team.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Walter and Mr. Anderson both demonstrated strong skills and
qualifications to the advisory committee and this bodes well for the
nomination process in the Senate," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer added: "Both are very well qualified to serve on the federal
bench."</TE>
<TE>   Walter, a native of Buffalo, N.Y., graduated from Loyola
University and Loyola Law School. He was a federal prosecutor from
1970 to 1972 and obtained a conviction in a well-known case involving
a group of sophisticated burglars who broke into a Laguna Niguel
bank, rifled every safe deposit box and got away with millions of
dollars. After his government service, Walter joined a large national
law firm and then founded his firm, specializing in complex civil
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, born and raised in California, graduated from UCLA and
UCLA Law School. He worked for two years at San Fernando Valley
Neighborhood Legal Assistance before joining the U.S. attorney's
office in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps his most noteworthy case as a government lawyer was the
successful 1985 prosecution of Thomas P. Cavanaugh, an engineer who
tried to sell the Soviets information about the U.S. Air Force's
stealth technology, which makes airplanes invisible to radar.
Cavanaugh received a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson recently has done civil litigation and white-collar
criminal defense work. In addition, he served on the Christopher
Commission, which investigated the Los Angeles Police Department in
the aftermath of the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Jan L. Handzlik, who knows both nominees,
said they deserve swift confirmation. "They were bridesmaids before,"
Handzlik said. "Hopefully, the ceremony will be completed this time."</TE>

<HD>Schools Told to Prepare for Cuts</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Facing a $133-million deficit, the district
orders principals at every campus to suggest reductions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hobart Boulevard Elementary School may have to give up a grant for
art education. Fairfax High might have to go without many of the
library books it planned to purchase. Children at Fair Avenue
Elementary might lose their music classes.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a $133-million deficit, the Los Angeles Unified School
District has ordered all principals to offer painful budget cuts in
the middle of the school year.</LD>
<LD>   If those plans are approved during a special Board of Education
meeting today, many schools will have to put off renovation projects,
leave counseling positions unfilled and even ration paper and
pencils.</LD>
<TE>   "We're being forced to do something irrational," said Joe
Zeronian, the district's chief financial officer. "We're having to
break our commitment to the schools because the state's commitment to
us has been broken."</TE>
<TE>   Other school districts around the state are contending with
similar shortfalls since Gov. Gray Davis announced earlier this month
his proposal to cut education funding by $843 million.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Los Angeles Unified may have to relinquish $74 million.
But raises for school support staff, workers' compensation claims and
special education costs have already ballooned the district's deficit
by $59 million. That amount will be taken from individual school
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   No cuts in permanent school personnel are expected.</TE>
<TE>   The current cuts are also intended to cushion another expected
shortfall next year. Rising employee benefit costs and state demands
could put the district as much as $300 million in the red, Zeronian
said.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials who are seeking salary negotiations are angry
because the district is proposing budget cuts before setting aside
any money for pay raises.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making cuts at every level," said school board President
Caprice Young. "Inevitably, some of the pain is going to come from
school sites since that is where 92% of our money goes."</TE>
<TE>   District superintendents met principals last week to tell them how
much they had to slash from their budgets. The cuts would be about
$59 per student.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody opened their folders and looked at the amounts," said
Susan Shaffer, principal of Calabash Street Elementary in Woodland
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   If the board approves the planned reductions, her school, one of
the district's smallest, would have to come up with $17,000 in cuts

<TE>   "I was just asking myself: 'How am I going to do this?' "</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer said she will cut into her school supplies account.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of Calabash students said they will organize a campus
walkout if the district approves the budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Most principals have attempted to take funds from areas that will
not directly affect instruction. But that is a difficult task for
many schools that are already strapped.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm spread so thin now it's unbelievable," said Maureen Melvold,
principal of Clover Elementary School in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   She would be giving up money she hopes to use for new computer
software and for new library books. She had only hours to decide on
the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Like many principals, Melvold said she understood the district's
need to pay its bills, but she said it was frustrating to lose money
she had saved so carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to do long-range planning that is meaningful
for my kids," she said. "But what's the point of saving for a rainy
day when it's just going to get taken away in the middle of the
year?"</TE>
<TE>   About 170 schools that managed to finish with a surplus last year
could lose most of that saved money. The district would keep a
$15-million surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Avenue Elementary School Principal Maxine Matlen has been
counting on that money to provide a music teacher for her students.
Her North Hollywood campus would have to come up with $109,000 in
cuts, and stands to lose an additional $229,000 in surplus funds she
saved from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some principals said they will hesitate in the future to be
frugal, and might be more apt to spend their money more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Accounts are vulnerable if they're not spent quickly," said
Belmont High Principal Ignacio Garcia.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Calls for U.S. Aid to Cities</HD>
<DH>Security: He says the federal government should help pay
for municipal security measures taken in response to 9/11 in L.A. and
elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn called on the federal government
Wednesday to help Los Angeles and other cities pay for the increased
security measures put in place since Sept. 11 and intended to help
thwart future terrorist acts.</LD>
<LD>   "It's real important for our expenditures to be recognized for
what they are," said Hahn, noting that police overtime costs Los
Angeles $1 million a day every time the city goes on tactical alert
in response to a terrorist threat. "We have been assisting on this
second front ... in this war against terrorism, this front here in
the cities."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn made his remarks during a meeting of almost 300 mayors
gathered at a downtown hotel for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</LD>
<TE>   After participating in the conference, he spent much of Wednesday
afternoon lobbying federal officials to assist Los Angeles with
security costs and economic stimulation.</TE>
<TE>   The plea from Hahn and other mayors for federal assistance came as
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge announced that the government is
setting aside money in next year's budget to help cities and states
bolster their emergency agencies to prepare for possible terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge did not specify how much money will be available. But he
said President Bush will announce new initiatives today that will
give cities and other local governments "unprecedented support" in
expanding their security equipment and emergency preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   A study released Wednesday by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
estimated that more than 1,000 cities will have spent a combined $2.6
billion on terrorism-related security measures by the end of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the tools, but it's draining money from other programs,"
Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said. "We can't afford that. We've got
revenue shrinking on the state side and on the city side. Any money
that's taken from our operating budget will diminish other programs
like education, parks and recreation and health care. All we're
asking for is fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick said that his city urgently needs
money to help cover costs of the Police Department's extra border
patrols.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of December, "we spent just under $3 million of our
general fund on protecting America," Kilpatrick said. "If we keep
this same rate up, we'll spend about $11 million this year on border
security alone. This is not neighborhood security."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has already spent at least $17 million on police
overtime, extra traffic patrols and other measures to protect the
airport, the city's water supply and the Civic Center, Hahn's office
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the fiscal year in June, that number is expected to
rise to almost $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of extra officers and hours on the street, and it's
really cut a real hole in our budget," Hahn said. "I don't think
anybody is expecting 100% reimbursement, but I think some
acknowledgement of that is what we're looking for."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the city is facing a $22.3-million revenue
shortfall because of the dip in the local tourism economy. Hahn has
frozen city hiring and asked all departments to make 10% cuts in
their budgets to deal with the budget situation.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn met with Ridge at the White House Wednesday afternoon, and
said he told the homeland security chief that cities are looking
forward to getting federal help in strengthening their emergency
preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn told Ridge he was disappointed that local municipalities
have not received money to help pay for the mounting tab so far.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that protecting our communities is a local
responsibility, but there have been so many additional burdens put on
us because we're now preparing for something that is more than what
community policing is all about," Hahn said as he was leaving the
White House. "We would like to see more assistance from the federal
government."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who is chairman of the conference's airport security task
force, conferred with local officials about other needs in Los
Angeles as well. He met with Department of Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Mel Martinez, who announced that Los Angeles
has been designated a "renewal community," a designation that allows
the city to share in $17 billion of tax credits intended to spur
business expansion and affordable housing development--and in the
process create jobs in poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, affordable-housing owners and businesses in the
city's six poorest council districts become eligible for thousands of
dollars in tax credits and other incentives if they hire local
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important step toward rebuilding communities,
sometimes communities that have been neglected too long," Hahn said
in a satellite feed broadcast back to the Los Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, the mayor met briefly with Carol Hallett,
president of the Air Transport Assn., an airline lobbying group. She
applauded Hahn's recent decision to accept federal airport funds.
Richard Riordan, Hahn's predecessor, had refused to take the money
because it constrained the city from using airport revenue for other
city services.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn needs the backing of the airlines as he unveils his plan for
the reconstruction of Los Angeles International Airport, a plan that
he said he hopes to complete in the next few weeks. The mayor said he
and Hallett did not have an opportunity to discuss that plan
Wednesday, but added that he expects the airlines will support his
concept of designing the airport around safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and the other mayors are scheduled to meet with President
Bush this morning, after which Hahn is expected to return to Los
Angeles.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO In its issue dated Feb. 4, 1974</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   In its issue dated Feb. 4, 1974--interestingly enough, the very
date of Patty Hearst's abduction from her Berkeley apartment by
members of the Symbionese Liberation Army--Time magazine reported a
bulletin from the culture front. The notorious "Generation Gap" of
the 1960s had gone missing.</LD>
<LD>   The magazine cited an academic study in which 1,000 American high
school students and their parents were surveyed, first in 1965 and
again eight years later. In the 1960s, responses had split sharply
along generational lines. The follow-up poll, however, had found what
Time called "a convergence of outlook" on everything from civil
rights to partisan politics.</LD>
<TE>   The article went on to quote a dance instructor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology--no, this is not made up--who
noted a surge of interest among 1970s collegians in such
old-fashioned steps as the rumba, waltz and tango.</TE>
<TE>   "These dances," concluded MIT's professor of fandango, "serve as a
contact point between generations. Kids are now interested in what
their parents experienced. Everything their parents did is no longer
looked down upon."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, as Hearst was busy taking part in bank heists and
other revolutionary "actions" with her captors, Time offered another
update from the American dance scene. There was a "hot" new step--the
"hustle." Yes, the disco era had arrived, wrapped in rayon and
mounted on platform heels.</TE>
<TE>   At the risk of dabbling in footnotes, let me underscore here what
these cultural morsels culled from back copies of Time suggest about
the SLA, so recently returned to the front pages: The weird, violent
saga of this group was not a part of that frenzied period described,
with less than perfect chronological accuracy, as "the '60s."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the SLA was a product of the 1970s, a distinction I
believe might be worth exploring for a moment. The middle 1970s were
an awkward time. I speak as someone who started college in 1973, who
came to San Francisco as a green reporter in the summer of 1976.</TE>
<TE>   To come of age in the 1970s was to be nagged by the realization of
having just missed out on history-making times. Reporters I worked
with in the Associated Press bureau told stories of wading through
Berkeley demonstrations in gas masks, of interviewing Black Panthers
and the like. I wrote about the explosion in custom van enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   The '60s had produced Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Byrds. We got
stuck with the brothers Gibb. The youth of the 1960s set out to stop
a war. We were dispatched to whip inflation, now!</TE>
<TE>   I suspect that members of the SLA might have felt cheated in a
similar way. By the time they arrived on the scene, the revolutionary
fires of the 1960s had all but expired. The big events--and the
massive crowds that came with them--were over.</TE>
<TE>   When Hearst was abducted, the draft already had ended, Woodstock
had given way to Altamont, and the national focus was on Watergate.
By the time of Hearst's capture, 20 months later, Nixon had been
pardoned, the last U.S. helicopter had flown off the embassy roof in
Saigon, Eldridge Cleaver was promoting a line of codpiece trousers
and Tom Hayden was gearing up to run for U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt a revolution was going to happen," Emily Harris wistfully
told The Times two years ago. "By 1972 and '73, we realized the world
wasn't going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Still they muddled forward, a band of Miniver Cheevys, born too
late. To some veterans of the 1960s, the SLA seemed to be a peculiar,
off-key bunch. They unleashed lethal violence on a promising school
superintendent in Oakland and a Sacramento churchwoman delivering
collection box proceeds to a Carmichael bank--the latter murder, of
course, is what led to the arrests of last week. Their slogan of
"death to the fascist insect" sounded like a parody of '60s
radicalism, a straight line, maybe, for "Laugh-In."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Siegel, a prominent Berkeley activist in the 1960s, recalls
being spirited to a meeting in 1975 with Bill and Emily Harris and
Hearst at their hide-out. They wanted to talk to Siegel, freshly
graduated from law school, about negotiating their surrender--and
maybe a book deal to boot.</TE>
<TE>   "They were incredibly naive and simplistic," said Siegel, who now
serves on the Oakland school board. "They had an attitude or view of
the world that reminded me of people who didn't read the newspapers,
or hadn't any sense of history. They actually believed that by
carrying out these so-called revolutionary activities they were going
to draw great support from a majority of the working class and poor
people."</TE>
<TE>   Siegel said that at one point the SLA put out feelers to fugitive
members of the Weather Underground, who by that time had quit their
bombings. The response, he said, was emphatic: "The Weather
Underground said, 'Hell no. These people are nuts.'"</TE>

<LD>I suspect that most of us, at one time or another, have felt like
answering the phone with the words, "Leave me alone."</LD>
<LD>   Crystal Kwok responds that way several times a day because that's
the name of the Chinese restaurant she manages in Torrance (see
accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   It was chosen, she explained (cheerfully), because "it's easy to
remember and it attracts people's attention."</LD>
<TE>   And she added, the place is not just for singles who want some
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   It does make for some confusion, though.</TE>
<TE>   Kwok said that when she utters the eatery's name into the phone,
some callers respond with, "What?"</TE>
<TE>   I bet it turns away a few telemarketers, though.</TE>
<TE>   A dining tradition: Leave Me Alone is the latest in a long line of
Southern California eateries with oddball names, dating back to
Ptomaine Tommy's in Lincoln Heights before World War II.</TE>
<TE>   More recent examples include La Poubelle (translation: The Garbage
Pail) in Hollywood, the Epicentre in the Civic Center, the
now-defunct Slander Coffee Shop in Whittier (did it die through bad
word of mouth?) and Redondo Beach's late Killer Grill, which diners
also left alone.</TE>
<TE>   The water's fine--stay out: Moving on to curious restaurant
features, Deke Houlgate wrote about Julie's, the longtime USC hangout
with the swimming pool that was closed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Julie Kohl, who died the other day at the age of 98, had
originally planned to build a motel on the property in 1941, Houlgate
said. Though she was encountering red tape she had the pool
constructed anyway. Then she was denied the permits.</TE>
<TE>   "She not only couldn't put in the motel, she couldn't get
permission to use the pool when the restaurant was in operation," he
said. "She had to install a rope barricade to discourage guests from
using the pool, and the 'no swimming rule' was vigorously enforced by
her football-playing customers."</TE>
<TE>   Now that he mentions it, I seem to recall receiving a warning from
a hulking gentleman after venturing too close to the pool during my
USC days. I didn't suggest that he leave me alone, either.</TE>
<TE>   A different spin: Regarding the ad for the "spin it" piano--it
should have said spinet--Sara Bajkowski of Canoga Park writes: "I can
think of two good reasons to have a 'spin it' piano. The first is for
concerts in a theater in the round. The second is for people who
aren't quite sure they want to learn to play the piano. They can give
it a whirl."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The other day I mentioned an artist named Nicolino,
who had melded more than a thousand brassieres into a "Bra Ball"
sculpture in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lake of Santa Monica was reminded of a presentation by the
Troubadour theater group of "Spamlet," which she described as "a
humorous musical, dancing, gymnastic interpretation of Shakespeare's
'Hamlet.'"</TE>
<TE>   She sent along a snapshot of an actor portraying Fortinbras, whose
costume consisted of, well, 14 bras (see photo).</TE>

<HD>Attacks on Chief Parks Criticized</HD>
<DH>LAPD: In a letter to the president of the police officers
union, Mayor Hahn says its ongoing campaign against reappointment is
divisive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn chastised the Los Angeles police union Wednesday
for its public campaign against the reappointment of Chief Bernard C.
Parks.</LD>
<LD>   "The attacks against the chief by the Police Protective League are
divisive and ultimately hurtful to the department," Hahn said in a
letter to Mitzi Grasso, league president. "Instead of trying to
constructively work with Chief Parks to solve problems facing the
department, you have simply determined that you will put all the
blame on the chief, and then walk away," Hahn wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Grasso said Wednesday that rather than respond to Hahn's letter,
she preferred to "focus on the issues.... "</LD>
<TE>   "Crime is going up," she said. "Community-based policing is dead.
Morale is at an all-time low. The LAPD is unable to attract new
officers or retain those already on the force."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's letter apparently was prompted in part by the league's
announcement last week that 93% of officers who responded to a poll
said they had no confidence in the chief. Grasso, who has been
calling for Parks' removal since late last year, accused him of
failed leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The union is at odds with Parks over several things, including his
changes in departmental disciplinary policy that have led to more
probes of misconduct charges against officers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Wednesday that he, Parks and Grasso had met Dec. 11 and
agreed to cooperatively address their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "The Police Protective League can be an important partner in the
effort to improve the Los Angeles Police Department and increase
public safety, but by its actions, the league has apparently chosen
to ignore that opportunity," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has told supporters he intends to seek a second five-year
term. Hahn said he expects the city's Police Commission to consider
his opinion in its deliberations over the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "My opinion ... will be determined on the merits, not on the basis
of a political campaign," Hahn told Grasso.</TE>

<HD>Suit Seeks to Halt Theater's Conversion</HD>
<DH>Court: A group sues Pasadena to reverse a decision to
remake a landmark into shops, offices and homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge will decide whether the curtain finally falls on Pasadena's
historic Raymond Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to overturn the Pasadena City Council's approval of the
owners' plan to convert the 80-year-old landmark to shops, offices
and apartments, an arts group has sued the municipality.</LD>
<LD>   The Foundation for the Realization of Contemporary Arts, Sciences
and Technologies and Pasadena resident Robert Frampton ask a judge to
set aside the council's Jan. 7 approval of zoning variances that OKd
the development of the 1,800-seat venue.</LD>
<TE>   Owners Gene and Marilyn Buchanan, with that approval, can turn the
balcony into offices and the main auditorium area into retail space,
and build 62 apartments in the parking lot and the 90-foot-high stage
house.</TE>
<TE>   But the suit alleges that approval amounts to special privileges,
which violate state law and local zoning ordinances and should be
invalidated. The city, according to the suit, failed to consider
evidence of economically viable alternatives for the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "We complied with all state, federal laws as well as local
ordinances," said Pasadena City Atty. Michele Beal Bagneris. The city
attorney, who had yet to be served with the lawsuit, said the city
did an extensive study of alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Buchanan said the suit, filed Tuesday, is a last-ditch
effort to stop new life from being breathed into the building at 129
N. Raymond Ave., which has sat vacant for a decade. "It is
embarrassing to walk past that building to me, and it's about time we
helped it come back to life," she said. "They have the right to sue.
But we think their case is without merit."</TE>
<TE>   The Buchanans' attorney, R. Scott Jenkins, said the suit's
accusation that evidence of alternatives was not considered is
ridiculous, given that there were hundreds of pages of economic
studies on uses such as theaters and nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   A council majority agreed that those other uses could not keep the
venue solvent.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing heavily on that finding was the failure last year of
lawyer Pierce O'Donnell and entrepreneur Harvey Knell to acquire the
theater and preserve it.</TE>
<TE>   After agreeing to buy it for a performing arts center, they could
not secure financing or a developer for an adjacent apartment
structure that they hoped would help fund the $3.5-million purchase
price.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that Gene Buchanan did not disclose to the
city that he had rejected offers to lease and buy the theater.</TE>

<HD>Suit Against Long Beach Gas Agency Will Proceed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has denied a motion by the city of
Long Beach to kill a lawsuit brought by a group of residents fighting
city gas rates.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr.'s decision last week allows litigation
to proceed on the class-action suit, filed on behalf of Long Beach
residents alleging that natural gas rate hikes imposed in December
2000 were excessive and illegal.</LD>
<LD>   Natural gas rates in Long Beach climbed as much as 600% during
last year's energy crisis, prompting consumer complaints about the
city's 75-year-old gas agency. The rates have since come down near
normal levels.</LD>
<TE>   "They wouldn't have lowered the rates without our pressure,"
Ronald Noe, one of the plaintiffs, said Wednesday. The suit was filed
last June by Citizens for Utility Reform.</TE>
<TE>   The suit argues that the city's Gas Department collected $38
million in excess of prevailing local rates, violating the city's own
charter rules designed to protect residents against excessive gas
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks compensation for gas company customers.</TE>
<TE>   Noe said McCoy's ruling means "we've won the first round of the
battle, but ...this is going to be a long, drawn-out process."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Shaw, deputy Long Beach city attorney, defended last year's
rate increases, calling them "reasonable and fair."</TE>

<HD>Incidents on Runways at LAX Decline</HD>
<DH>Safety: The number of serious near collisions between
aircraft drops from five in 2000 to just one last year, drawing
praise from an FAA official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM and RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dangerous incidents on runways at Los Angeles International Airport
leveled off last year and the number of serious near collisions
between aircraft fell to just one, a trend that officials called a
significant achievement.</LD>
<LD>   LAX recorded eight incidents last year in which airplanes violated
safety zones around runways being used by other aircraft--the same
number of "incursions" recorded in 2000, according to statistics
released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Only one of last year's incidents was classified by federal
officials as a serious matter in which there was significant risk of
a crash, compared with five such incidents at the world's
third-busiest airport in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   There were 12 runway incursions in 1998, 10 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Breaches of runway safety guidelines are considered one of the
most critical issues facing commercial aviation.</TE>
<TE>   LAX had the unfortunate distinction from 1997 to 2000 of having 13
serious near crashes, more than any of the nation's busiest airports.</TE>
<TE>   But LAX was eclipsed in 2001 in the category of all runway
incidents by several other major metropolitan airports, including
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Sky Harbor International
Airport in Phoenix, which both charted 10 near collisions last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, LAX officials said the numbers are a reminder that it's
important to keep an eye on runway safety, even as the nation has
become preoccupied with terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not happy that there were eight this year, at any level,"
said Michael DiGirolamo, deputy director of operations for the city
agency that operates LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a continuing effort by the FAA, the airlines, the pilots'
association and the airport to get the number down to zero."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in near collisions at LAX was mirrored in national data,
which showed that these incidents fell in 2001 for the first time
since the FAA focused on the issue as a major safety problem in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   There were 381 runway incursions last year, down 11% from 431 in
2000, according to FAA figures. Serious runway incursions at airports
around the nation also declined. In 2001, there were 50 such near
collisions, down 26% from 68 in 2000. While that is a notable
improvement, it still represents an average of nearly one serious
incident per week.</TE>
<TE>   Awareness Credited for Improvement</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the decrease in near collisions at the nation's
airports had already started before the terrorist attacks caused a
significant drop in air traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation officials attributed the nationwide improvement in runway
safety to greater awareness among pilots, controllers and airport
officials. Other improvements include better signs, lighting and
communication between controllers and pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Davis, director of the FAA's runway safety program, praised
LAX for its efforts to solve the seemingly intractable problem of
near misses on its 40-year-old airfield.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to imagine an airport that is more serious about this
problem than LAX," Davis said Wednesday morning. "They've got a
full-up focus on this problem."</TE>
<TE>   The city agency that operates LAX has spent $5 million since 1999
on a safety program that includes installing more lighting and signs
on taxiways and runways, enlarging markings at the end of taxiways,
and distributing posters showing problem spots to pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The airport is also moving forward with a plan to redesign part of
the south side of the facility to limit the number of planes crossing
active runways.</TE>
<TE>   Airport users say the configuration of LAX--which forces pilots to
drive airplanes from the outer runways across interior
runways--causes most near misses at the world's third-busiest
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Airplanes typically land on the runways nearest local communities
and take off on those next to the terminals to shield neighborhoods
from noise.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the incidents reported at LAX since 1997 have been on
the south side of the airfield. All of last year's runway incursions
occurred there.</TE>
<TE>   The plan to rework the south side of the airport would include
extending a taxiway so that planes can reach terminals without
crossing active runways.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the city's Airport Commission voted to request bids
from contractors to design and conduct environmental studies for this
taxiway extension, DiGirolamo said.</TE>
<TE>   A study released by the airport last summer found that using this
extension to change the way controllers direct traffic on the aging
airfield could help reduce the chance of airliners colliding at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots and controllers cautioned that even with improvements, near
collisions are likely to increase again when air traffic returns to
pre-Sept. 11 levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming we're going to add flights, it will become a problem
again," said Mike Foote, an air traffic controller at the LAX tower
and local president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn.
"It's not going to go away."</TE>
<TE>   Runways aren't the only safety hazard at LAX, where controllers
and pilots say that crowded gates and alleyways where aircraft exit
and enter terminal areas also compromise safety. A $12-billion master
plan was supposed to address some of these problems in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor's New Plan Concerns Experts</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor James K. Hahn scrapped this plan last year after the
terrorist attacks and called for an alternative that favors security
over expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation experts are concerned that the mayor's conceptual plan
lacks initiatives that would spread traffic out, such as more gates,
a longer runway on the north end, and parallel taxiways in between
the runways.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA also released figures Wednesday for near collisions at
other Southland airports. At Long Beach Airport, the total number of
incursions dropped to five in 2001, down from eight in 2000. None was
in the most serious categories.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank Airport also saw a decline in near accidents, charting one
incident last year, compared with two in 2000. These incidents were
considered less serious by the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, which handles a
complicated mix of big jets and small private planes, incursions rose
to 11 in 2001, from seven in 2000. There was no significant change in
the severity of incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys also recorded more runway problems. There were three
incidents in 2001, including one that led to an accident. That
compares with two incidents in 2000, and no related accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario International Airport had no incursions in 2001 and only
one in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Universal Studios Gives a Thumbs Down to Secession Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The current blueprint for creating new cities in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood generated a new opponent Wednesday: Universal
Studios.</LD>
<LD>   A Universal spokesman said plans now under consideration would
leave the studio's property split between two new cities and Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe this presents not only severe operating difficulties,
but also presents severe public safety issues," said William Delvac,
an attorney for Universal.</LD>
<TE>   Delvac made his complaint to a meeting of the Local Agency
Formation Commission, which is studying whether to put Valley and
Hollywood secession proposals on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the
commission, downplayed the problem, noting that Universal is
currently divided between the city of Los Angeles and the county and
has worked out coordinated police and fire services.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO agreed to meet with Delvac over his concerns after he said
Universal does not mind being split between two jurisdictions but
believes three would be too many.</TE>
<TE>   Boundaries for the proposed cities were also adjusted by the
commission Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The agency voted to move 3,000 Cahuenga Pass residents from a
theoretical new San Fernando Valley city to a theoretical new city of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "They prefer to be in the city of Hollywood, which they identify
with," LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, several homeowner groups and businesses have
asked to be excluded from the proposed city of Hollywood. The
projected population of a Hollywood city--206,000--would be cut in
half if all the requests were granted, Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   The groups wanting their neighborhoods removed include the Melrose
Neighborhood Assn., the Hancock Park Neighborhood Assn., the
Larchmont Village Homeowners Assn., the Beverly/Wilshire Homeowners
Assn., the Wilshire Homeowners Alliance and the East Hollywood
Community Assn. Developer Gilmore Co. also asked that the Farmers
Market be excluded.</TE>
<TE>   As a compromise, the commission tentatively proposed that all
areas south of Melrose Avenue be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also discussed a recent finding that a Valley city would
not be entitled to $30 million in property transfer taxes it now
receives annually as part of Los Angeles, creating another budget
hole that would need to be plugged. A Valley city would produce an
annual surplus of $7 million the first three years, according to
previous estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the secessionist organization Valley VOTE, Jeff
Brain, promised the commission that his group would deliver a plan
Monday that could cut $200 million from the $1-billion cost of
delivering services to a new Valley city.</TE>

<CX>   Secession plans--A headline on a story in Thursday's California
section about Universal Studios' reaction to Valley and Hollywood
secession plans was misleading. Universal objects to the blueprint that
would split its property among three jurisdictions. Universal does not

<HD>South Gate City Hall, 2 Officials' Homes Raided in
Corruption Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators searching for illegal firearms Wednesday combed the
home and City Hall office of South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles,
signaling a new phase in the ongoing political corruption probe in
the troubled city.</LD>
<LD>   While City Hall visitors watched, investigators from the district
attorney's public integrity unit scoured Robles' office for a
silencer and illegal firearms modified to accommodate the use of a
silencer. It was not clear if any illegal weapons were found. The
district attorney's office would not comment.</LD>
<LD>   Robles, who was not arrested, has admitted that he owns handguns,
but his attorney, Tom Brown, said the search for illegal weapons
would be futile. "They might as well be looking for a pink elephant
with white dots," Brown said as authorities searched Robles'
two-story townhouse.</LD>
<TE>   Brown said he thinks authorities suspect Robles of being involved
in the 1999 shooting of then-Mayor Henry Gonzalez, a political rival.
Gonzalez was not seriously injured in the crime, which has not been
solved.</TE>
<TE>   "Albert has absolutely no knowledge of who may have done such a
thing," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate probe, investigators served search warrants
Wednesday at the home of Councilwoman Maria Benavides, who they
suspect lied about her residency to qualify for the 2000 ballot.
Numerous documents were seized at City Hall, including a divorce
settlement in which Benavides stated that she lived in El Monte
during the 2000 campaign. The 29-year-old beautician was not
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The raids marked a significant expansion of the nearly yearlong
corruption investigation. Though several of Robles' supporters have
been charged with electoral fraud, Wednesday's actions signaled that
elected officials are now targets and that the probe has broadened
beyond election-related wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I screamed I was so happy," said City Clerk Carmen Avalos. "This
is a blessing for our city."</TE>
<TE>   Many residents in the community of 96,000 showed up at City Hall
to shake hands and take pictures of investigators, hailing them as
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   But others said the district attorney's office was being used by
Robles' political enemies. "I don't believe that Albert Robles would
ever own a silencer," said City Atty. Salvador Alva.</TE>
<TE>   The raids came a few days after Secretary of State Bill Jones
announced an unprecedented plan to monitor the city's elections. The
community has been rocked in recent years by electoral fraud
allegations and violent incidents that police suspect are politically
motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, widely considered to be the city's most powerful official,
has been a target of residents' protests since his allies assumed
control of the council in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Once a rising Latino political figure--Robles finished second in
the 1998 Democratic primary for state treasurer--his star has dimmed
under persistent allegations of misusing public funds. Last year,
residents launched a voter recall drive against him and his council
allies. In 2000, voters slashed his salary from $76,500 to $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Robles keeps a low profile at City Hall and hasn't been to a
council meeting in months. He has said that he sleeps with a
9-millimeter handgun next to his bed and wouldn't hesitate to use it
against an intruder.</TE>
<TE>   "If you knock down my door, chances are I'm going to put some lead
in between your eyes," he said in an interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said Robles' interest in guns stems from his desire to be a
law enforcement officer. Robles attended a police academy last year,
but did not graduate.</TE>

<HD>Proposal for Rooftop Ads Is Revoked</HD>
<DH>Billboards: West Hollywood reverses a decision to let a
builder erect signs atop the Sunset Millennium development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The West Hollywood City Council has revoked its decision to allow
builder Mark A. Siffin to erect lucrative V-shaped billboards atop
his Sunset Millennium development.</LD>
<LD>   Without discussion, the council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday night to
withdraw the approval.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, a longtime supporter of the Sunset Strip project late
Tuesday sued West Hollywood Mayor John Heilman and the council,
contending that Heilman should not be allowed to vote on any actions
related to the project because he lives within 500 feet of one of the
buildings.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of
West Hollywood resident Jehuda Renan, seeks to prohibit Heilman from
participating in any future decisions about Sunset Millennium and to
set aside any previous council votes in which he took part.</TE>
<TE>   The rooftop advertising--and the overall project--have become
highly contentious in the community, which is set between the
Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Critics have
complained that problems would outweigh any benefits to the city.
West Hollywood will receive a projected $8 million in annual tax
revenue from the project, which Siffin says will include a luxury
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have cited spoiled views and the potential for vastly
increased traffic along the already jammed stretch of Sunset
Boulevard running from Sunset Plaza to the Mondrian Hotel. In
addition, critics have warned that a street closure required by the
development could delay firetrucks and ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Siffin won authorization for billboards after
telling officials that revenue from the signs was needed to help
finance his $300-million project. Each eye-catching billboard was
expected to draw about $60,000 monthly from advertisers, for a
potential total of more than $4 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   But he contended Wednesday that the rescission would not stymie
his three-block-long development, which will include office and
retail space in addition to the planned hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on another lease right now," Siffin said of the
partially completed westernmost building, scheduled to open this
summer. "The project is a great project that will move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Siffin said he has lined up 17 of 28 tenants, including
L'Occitane, the tony purveyor of French bath and body products.</TE>
<TE>   The council had debated the billboard issue two weeks earlier, and
there had been speculation that Siffin and his supporters might have
prevailed on Councilman Sal Guarriello to change his no to a yes. But
Guarriello joined Heilman and Councilman John Duran in voting to
repeal the special authorization.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled," G.G. Verrone, a leading opponent, said after the
decision. "It has expressed the will of the people living in West
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't as if the vote would ensure a stretch of blank space in
the thicket of towering ads along the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin still will be entitled to mount billboards--more, in fact,
than under the waiver he had requested--but he will now have to abide
by limits outlined in a master plan for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Among other rules: The only products that can be trumpeted will be
those sold on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   That, billboard opponents predict, will reduce the size of the ads
and keep them more conventional.</TE>
<TE>   Renan, who sued the mayor and council, is an obstetrician whose
condominium association is scheduled to receive $120,000 from Siffin
for a new roof in exchange for its support of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Fredric D. Woocher, Renan's Santa Monica attorney, said Siffin had
put the two in touch. Woocher said the arguments in the lawsuit rely
on conflict-of-interest rules issued by the state Fair Political
Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this law is at all gray," Woocher said. "If you own
a property valued at more than $2,000--and Heilman's luxury
condominium is worth well more than $2,000--you are presumed to have
a financial interest in any decision involving a property whose
boundaries are within 500 feet of yours."</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood City Atty. Michael Jenkins said he had not yet read
the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he found it intriguing that "the very people who
contended there was no impact from their proposed change in
[billboard] content are now contending the exact opposite: that in
fact there was an impact on Heilman's condo even."</TE>

<HD>Mascot Monty Is No More</HD>
<DH>School: San Diego State's red-faced Aztec warrior, seen by
some as racist, is reborn as Montezuma, a dignified ambassador.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Before a group of admiring elementary school students, San Diego
State University's new campus ambassador made his debut Wednesday,
after months of controversy about longtime mascot Monty Montezuma.</LD>
<LD>   Monty Montezuma, the bare-chested, spear-throwing macho mascot, is
no more.</LD>
<LD>   In his place is Montezuma the diplomat, wearing a tunic rather
than a loincloth, the result of a compromise that university
President Stephen Weber hopes will calm a campus controversy that has
flared since fall 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm an educator, not an entertainer," said Alberto Martinez, the
student selected to portray the 16th century Aztec ruler. "There is a
lot of difference between an ambassador and a mascot."</TE>
<TE>   For $10 an hour, Martinez, 21, a political science major from
Mission Viejo, will give lectures at schools and make a variety of
public appearances in his carefully constructed regalia. He will be
at Saturday's basketball game between the San Diego State Aztecs and
the Runnin' Rebels of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of my culture and heritage and I want to share
that with everybody," said Martinez, whose parents were born in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   At athletic contests, he will be a greeter and regal presence and
will not, as Monty did famously for decades, exhort the crowd to
cheer for the Aztecs. He will not race wildly along the sidelines at
Qualcomm Stadium beating his chest and bellowing to the sky to excite
Aztec fans.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with being politically correct," Weber
said of the change. "It has to do with the responsibility of a
university to be historically and anthropologically correct. . . .
We're trying to give an accurate portrayal of a great, great
civilization and possibly spark the imagination of these students."</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego State group called the Native American Student
Activist Organization issued a statement to the campus newspaper, the
Daily Aztec, calling the new Montezuma as unacceptable as the old
one.</TE>
<TE>   "The former San Diego State mascot should never have been promoted
as the new university ambassador," the statement said. "The new
ambassador only reminds Native Americans that we are treated like
second-class citizens and are represented without dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Montezuma's debut at Rosa Parks Elementary School in the racially
diverse City Heights neighborhood was not accidental. Rosa Parks is
one of several inner-city campuses involved in a program run by the
university and San Diego school system to raise test scores and
encourage students from low-income families to aspire to college.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a president, a general and a priest, all in one," Martinez
explained to a gathering of wide-eyed first-grade students. "Pretty
amazing, wasn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Details about Montezuma's new costume, designed by a professor
from the theater department and one from Chicano studies, had been a
closely guarded secret.</TE>
<TE>   Montezuma's cape is made of regular leather and suede, with a
design at the edges that was permitted to be worn only by the most
exalted of warriors, said Holly Poe Durbin, an assistant professor of
costume design. His jewelry features metallic gold, jade, molded
brass and composite green stones.</TE>
<TE>   Even in seeking historical accuracy, some bows had to be made to
modernity. The headdress is made of turkey, duck and pheasant
feathers. The real Montezuma wore a headdress of quetzal feathers,
but the quetzal is an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   After months of debate, Weber opted to keep the Aztecs' nickname
for the school but revamp the Montezuma figure. Still unknown is
whether the new Montezuma will prompt another clash between Native
American activists who said the figure was a racist caricature and
the alumni and students who thought Monty was a cherished tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "What the alums wanted was to preserve the Aztec tradition," said
Tamara McLeod, president of the San Diego State Alumni Assn. "I hope
alums will see this Montezuma as continuing the tradition, but with a
lot more substance."</TE>
<TE>   Still to be decided is the tricky issue of how to portray
Montezuma on souvenirs and logos. The scowling, red-faced warrior was
seen as historically inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   Weber is also deciding whether the university needs a mascot to
adopt the traditional yell-leader role at sporting events and, if so,
what he/she/it should look like.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez has been coached on the appropriate behavior for a ruler
king.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing any cartwheels, no throwing flaming spears," he
said.</TE>

<LD>SAN JOSE</LD>
<LD>   Three Republican wannabe governors held the first televised debate
of the 2002 election season Tuesday night. And now we'll open the
envelopes.</LD>
<LD>   * Best performance: Secretary of State Bill Jones.</LD>
<TE>   * Best water-treader: former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   * Best eye-glazer: businessman Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   That's not quite the conventional wisdom. The common mantra is
that Riordan won by not losing. He's running so far ahead in the race
for the GOP nomination--28 points ahead of Jones, 37 ahead of Simon
in one nonpartisan survey (Public Policy Institute of
California)--that all he needed to do was not stumble noticeably. He
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan did slip a bit, once talking about "the minimum tax"
when he meant minimum wage. And he ventured into an area of state
government where he sounded over his head, sputtering vaguely about
consolidating all education leadership in one agency. He'd have to
persuade voters to change the state Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also was roughed up by Jones for being a liberal--by
Republican standards--and having donated $1 million to Democratic
causes. "I don't have a comfort level you would be there on basic
issues Republicans believe in," Jones told him. "You have to be a
Republican not just in name."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Riordan occasionally looked ragged, prompting some
adversaries, junkies and reporters to whisper that he was showing his
71 years.</TE>
<TE>   So he survived but suffered nicks that could hurt him down the
track--if GOP voters decide they can't tolerate his left leanings, or
the November electorate concludes that he doesn't stack up to Gov.
Gray Davis in experience, energy and ability.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what spin is applied, Riordan did not emerge the winner,
even if he didn't lose.</TE>
<TE>   But neither did Jones come out the victor. That's because he
doesn't have enough money to capitalize on his first-rate performance
by immediately buying TV ads. And the performance wasn't powerful
enough, on its own, to accelerate a campaign running low on fuel.</TE>
<TE>   While Riordan looked like a governor right out of Central
Casting--or maybe a former governor--Jones both looked and sounded
like one. The 20-year veteran of the state Capitol was the only
debater who always seemed to know what he was talking about. He
exuded confidence that here was one candidate who wouldn't need a
course in dumbbell governorship.</TE>
<TE>   And after a nervous start, Jones sounded calm, steady and
articulate--leadership characteristics, but not always his in the
past. He rose to the occasion by being himself.</TE>
<TE>   He had the most succinct mission statement: "My vision clearly is
this--fewer crime victims, better educated children, healthier
families and an economy that's strong enough to generate jobs for all
who want one."</TE>
<TE>   Jones also got the only laugh from the San Jose State audience. It
came as he belittled Simon's claim of being the "candidate of ideas"
and, as an afterthought, jabbed Davis. Said Jones: "Mr. Simon . . . a
governor proposes and the Legislature disposes. (Pause)
Unfortunately, in California now we have a governor who just
supposes."</TE>
<TE>   That was it for debate humor.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was the loser. The rookie pol seemed over-rehearsed, with an
incessant plastic smile. Or, maybe he was under-rehearsed. He came
across as insincere, as if he were reciting a script that hadn't
quite been internalized.</TE>
<TE>   This was Simon's chance to be discovered by voters, and he didn't
stand up.</TE>
<TE>   It was his opportunity to bloody up Riordan--his good friend--and
he couldn't bring himself to do that. Asked why, he cited Ronald
Reagan's old 11th commandment about not speaking ill of another
Republican. But Reagan never ran 37 points back in a poll. Simon's
main message was "I'm a proud conservative Republican." He and Jones
are targeting the same voters, the conservatives who normally
dominate GOP primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's message of inclusion--respect for different views--was
the most powerful and one that is at the core of the Republican
dilemma March 5. He is to the left of most GOP politicians and
activists, favoring abortion rights, gay rights, government services
for illegal immigrants. . . . But because of his broad ideological
appeal and name ID, polls show Riordan has the best chance of beating
Davis in November.</TE>
<TE>   He put it this way to Jones and Simon: "Your positions would turn
[the GOP] from an endangered species into an extinct species. . . .
We need a new Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   A party with mainstream candidates. That's the big debate in the
GOP--one Riordan still must win.</TE>

<HD>Pablo Antonio Cuadra, 89; Nicaraguan Literary Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a revered Nicaraguan poet, journalist and
essayist whose career and art survived decades of harassment and
censorship under opposing regimes, died of a respiratory ailment Jan.
2 in Managua. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Cuadra was a leading literary voice in a country where poets are
so prized that some have risen to high government office, such as
former president Daniel Ortega and his culture minister, Ernesto
Cardenal. Cuadra gave voice to his passionate beliefs about Nicaragua
not only through his poetry but as editor of the influential daily La
Prensa, a post he assumed in 1978 after Somoza forces assassinated
his cousin and the paper's co-director, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro.</LD>
<LD>   "In Nicaragua, he is appreciated for being a shaper of several
generations of writers and intellectuals of the most diverse
ideologies and literary tastes imaginable," said Steven F. White, a
professor of Spanish at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., who
knew Cuadra for more than 20 years and translated a volume of his
poems. "Everyone from Ernesto Cardenal to [poet] Francisco Valle ...
learned to see Nicaragua, in part, through Pablo Antonio's eyes.''</LD>
<TE>   In the 1920s he was a pioneer of a literary movement known as la
Vanguardia, which used conversational language, free verse, dialogue
and satire in an effort to create a poetry indigenous to Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Its members, who included poets Jose Coronel Urtecho, Joaquin
Pasos and Octavio Rosas, were influenced by European fascism and
supported the U.S.-imposed dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1934, when his first collection, "Nicaraguan Poems," was
published, Cuadra had begun to question la Vanguardia's political
underpinnings. In 1937 he was jailed by Somoza for opposing the
dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   He was jailed twice and continually harassed for exposing the
corruption and criminal violence of the Somoza family during its
three-decade reign. After the rise of the Sandinistas during the
Nicaraguan revolution, he worked clandestinely with the guerrilla
army, only to arrive at a new assessment that would again cast him in
the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his and his country's struggles, he said he remained
devoted to the principles of Nicaraguan nationalism, democracy and
self-determination. These concerns were echoed in his writing, from
his early "Poem of the Foreign Movement in the Jungle," in which he
railed against the U.S. occupation of Nicaragua in the 1920s, to the
more recent, mythic "The Calabash Tree."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s and '80s, when politics interfered in his own
free expression, he chose self-imposed exile in Costa Rica and Texas
for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "You need freedom to create," Cuadra once said. "The artist and
the poet must become personally engaged in the political struggle,
but he must not compromise his art."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Managua, Cuadra studied with the Jesuits and was briefly
enrolled in law school. He was 19 when he dropped out to co-found la
Vanguardia and edit its leading journal.</TE>
<TE>   He edited several newspapers and journals over the years but his
longest association was with La Prensa and its literary supplement,
La Prensa Literaria.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, La Prensa denounced human rights violations
under the Sandinistas and endured tight censorship and a yearlong
publishing ban.</TE>
<TE>   When the Sandinista regime was defeated in early 1990, Cuadra
stepped down as editor and devoted himself to poetry.</TE>
<TE>   According to White, he completed a new collection before he died
that, like previous works, blends history and myth in its exploration
of Nicaragua's origins.</TE>
<TE>   Among his literary honors were the Ruben Dario Prize in Poetry,
named for one of Nicaragua's major 19th-century literary figures, and
Spain's Ruben Dario Prize for Hispanic Poetry.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Adilia, and several children and
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Governor Defends Electricity Policy</HD>
<DH>Politics: Davis rejects GOP rivals' calls to disband power
agency, saying private sector can't be trusted. He also says foes
have offered few specifics on deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis defended his energy policy against criticism by GOP
candidates Wednesday, and accused his rivals of displaying a lack of
specifics about how they would handle California's $12.5-billion
budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to the Sacramento Press Club, Davis said he watched the
last half of the Republican candidates' debate Tuesday night and
called all three "light on specifics" about the deficit.</LD>
<LD>   And noting that at least some of his prospective opponents called
for abolishing the new California Public Power Authority, an agency
he approved to ensure an adequate supply of energy, the Democratic
governor said: "Our form of deregulation didn't work."</LD>
<TE>   "All three Republican candidates seem to think the answer lies in
more reliance on the private sector," Davis said, characterizing the
positions of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, California
Secretary of State Bill Jones and businessman Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "I say to them: In this business, you have to learn your lessons,"
Davis continued. "Reliance on the private sector got us into this
mess. The private sector has a role to play. But we shouldn't bet the
farm on it. We need the Public Power Authority to balance it."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the fallout of Houston energy giant Enron's
bankruptcy filing, Davis said: "There is nothing for certain when it
comes to energy deregulation. We are totally dependent on the whims
of the private sector to supply energy. If they do not, the lights go
out That is why I believe strongly that we need to be able to keep
the lights on if the private sector does not step up to the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jones called on Davis--and all politicians, including
President Bush--to donate their Enron contributions to a fund to
support Enron workers and shareholders who suffered financially from
the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis should immediately return, to the account I mentioned
the $117,000 [since 1998] he received from Enron," Jones said. "I
made a pledge and commitment not to accept money from energy
companies during the power crisis. Gray Davis made a similar pledge,
but, as is typical for Gray Davis, he broke it."</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not directly answer a question about whether he would
return $42,500 he has received from Enron since taking office in
1999. But he noted that he adopted a policy in 2000 of not accepting
contributions from independent power producers, including Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm holding to that policy," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor defended his energy policy, contending that his
efforts to promote conservation, preside over construction of several
new power plants and enter into long-term contracts to buy
electricity from independent producers are paying off.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that the state stabilized its energy markets in 2001
and that California paid $26.7 billion for electricity last year,
down from the $27 billion that utilities paid for power in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Record wholesale power costs in 2000 and early 2001 hobbled
California's two largest private utilities and led to the bankruptcy
filing of one of them, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. The state began buying
electricity early last year, when power producers would not extend
credit to PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   "My imperative last year was to keep the lights on," Davis said.
"We were able to do that at slightly less cost than the utilities
paid for power in 2000."</TE>
<TE>   On another issue, Davis said he intends to reach agreement within
a week or two on one of the longest-running issues in
Sacramento--whether to raise workers' compensation benefits for
employees who are hurt on the job. Davis said his goal is to overhaul
the system in a way that will lower employer costs while also
boosting benefits.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of business organizations, Davis vetoed bills backed
by organized labor for three years running that sought to raise
workers' comp benefits. Proponents of such a raise were so angry last
year that they threatened to place an initiative to increase benefits
on the November ballot. In recent weeks, Davis' aides have been
presiding over closed meetings in which union leaders and attorneys
who represent injured workers are pressing for benefit increases.</TE>

<HD>Singing Praises of a Labor Bill</HD>
<DH>Contracts: Rock stars lobby lawmakers to pass a measure to
help free musicians from long-term record deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A glittering brigade of rock superstars and top labor officials
launched a high-powered lobbying attack Wednesday on a state law they
said enables the record companies to shackle them to contracts of
"indentured servitude."</LD>
<LD>   Lines of startled schoolchildren and other visitors to the Capitol
gaped in delight as such entertainers as Sheryl Crow, Don Henley,
Stevie Nicks, Carole King and other artists turned lobbyists crowded
corridors in support of a bill that would abolish the law.</LD>
<LD>   Clutching binder paper and pencils, some children, who may have
expected their field trip to the statehouse to be just another
history lesson, filled the hallways in hope that the stars would
shake a pack of trailing television cameras and stop long enough to
give them autographs.</LD>
<TE>   Most left disappointed, as the entertainers stuck to their
lobbying mission for SB 1246, by Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City), a
former talent agent.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would repeal a provision of the state Labor Code that
exempts record companies from a seven-year limit imposed on personal
service contracts, the only such exemption in California labor laws,
proponents of the bill said.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference to announce the formation of a coalition of
labor and recording artists in support of the bill, Murray said the
exemption has the effect of extending contracts far longer than seven
years and prevents musicians from offering themselves on the open
market as free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should be obligated to this condition of indentured
servitude," said Art Pulansky, secretary-treasurer of the California
Labor Federation, AFL-CIO. He blamed the "power and wealth" of the
recording industry in 1987 for getting the exemption enacted.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference, several members of the newly organized
Recording Artists Coalition said their contracts typically call for
production of a certain number of albums. But they said they often
cannot produce all of them because they must spend huge blocks of
time promoting new releases.</TE>
<TE>   Henley, who has recorded as a member of the Eagles and as a solo
artist, and singer-songwriter King, told reporters that as a group,
musical artists are unsophisticated when it comes to understanding
legal contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Most artists, let's face it, don't understand the ramifications
of a record contract. We are very naive people," Henley said.</TE>
<TE>   King said the recording industry "got this by us because we, as
artists, are the type of personalities who are not generally united
with other people."</TE>
<TE>   The bill also got the endorsement of John J. Sweeney, president of
the national AFL-CIO, along with representatives of unions associated
with the entertainment industry, including AFTRA, the Hollywood
Entertainment Labor Council, and the professional employees unit of
the national AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, top executives of the industry, including some of the
biggest labels, defended the exemption in a three-page letter. It was
signed by presidents, chairmen and executive officers of such
producers as Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, Warner
Music Group and EMI Recorded Music.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that recording artists are in the unique position of
deciding whether to deliver their albums within seven years and are
free to take on other entertainment dates at lucrative fees while
they are under contract.</TE>
<TE>   They warned that if record companies lose their ability to sue for
recovery of damages from an artist who refuses to deliver, record
companies "will be unable to invest in as many new artists in the
future."</TE>

<HD>Davis Pledges $60 Million to Train Nurses</HD>
<DH>Health: Plan includes a campaign to attract newcomers and a
bid to make the application process easier. Experts say more openings
at colleges are needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis expanded Wednesday on his proposal of a day earlier
to set minimum nurse staffing levels in hospitals by pledging $60
million to train 5,100 nurses during the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   The money would come from special funds earmarked for work force
training, and from health-oriented foundations.</LD>
<LD>   Davis said the proposal includes additional training for nurses,
steps to make it easier to apply for nursing jobs and a statewide
advertising campaign designed to attract people into nursing. The
proposal includes $24 million for training in hospitals, community
colleges and state universities.</LD>
<TE>   "We cannot get by working the existing corps of nurses harder and
harder," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Plan Comes Amid Wide Nursing Shortage</TE>
<TE>   Health industry officials have said that if his proposal is to
work, the state needs to open more nursing school slots, increase
training for current nurses, recruit nurses from other states and
bring back California nurses who have quit hospital work.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is: Give us more nurses to hire," said Jim Lott,
executive vice president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern
California, a hospital trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The nursing proposal, which ultimately would prohibit hospitals
from assigning a nurse to more than five patients in general medical
and surgical units, comes amid a national nursing shortage that has
struck this state particularly hard. California ranks 49th among
states in its share of registered nurses, with 544 nurses per 100,000
residents, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital representatives say nursing recruiters in this state
sometimes stand in the hallways of hospitals as they close down, so
they can recruit the freshly unemployed nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "There just aren't enough nurses for anyone. We need to increase
the pool that's available for everybody," Lott said. "We can't
continue to steal from one another."</TE>
<TE>   But Sheryl Skolnick, co-director of research for the New York
brokerage Fulcrum Global Partners, said Davis' proposed staffing
ratios are fairly modest, so hospitals that offer good wages and
working conditions ought to be able to fill the positions.</TE>
<TE>   "It strikes a middle ground between what the nurses wanted and
what the hospitals wanted," Skolnick said. "And it gives the
hospitals enough time to prepare."</TE>
<TE>   Also key to recruitment, she said, would be making it easy for
nurses to transfer their licenses from other states--something Davis
has said he plans to address.</TE>
<TE>   Expanded Role for State's Schools</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the California Nurses Assn., a union that represents
44,000 nurses, agree that the new staffing levels themselves will
attract nurses. More and more nurses have quit after being burdened
with what they consider too many patients.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of nurses decided they didn't want to work in unsafe
hospitals and left the profession or decided to work in other
hospital settings that wouldn't jeopardize their licenses.
Increasingly, nurses lost faith in their employers," said Charles
Idelson, a spokesman for the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But Lott said hospitals are already offering as many employment
incentives--such as signing bonuses--as they can.</TE>
<TE>   The solution needs to come at the ground level, at the schools
where nurses are trained, he said. The governor needs to increase the
number of slots for nursing students at state universities, which
would increase the number of nurses in the job pool.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Cowan, dean of the school of nursing at UCLA, said that
every slot for nursing students is filled at the University of
California and that there is a backlog of students waiting for
openings. She said the state needs to expand baccalaureate programs
on the California State University campuses.</TE>
<TE>   But more than 70% of state nurses come from associate degree
programs, so community college programs must expand as well, said

<LD>The City Council endorsed a proposal to build a sewage treatment
plant in Tijuana that may help reduce river and beach pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted 7 to 2 on Tuesday in favor of the Bajagua
project, which calls for a secondary treatment plant that would
handle 50 to 75 million gallons of sewage a day in Tijuana. The
$84-million project will be built with private funds.</LD>
<LD>   Before construction, the U.S. International Boundary and Water
Commission must negotiate with Mexico to revise an old treaty that
governs waste-water treatment between the two countries.</LD>

<LD>California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer announced she will seek a
third term in 2004, saying the Sept. 11 attacks persuaded her it was
too early to end her 25-year political career.</LD>
<LD>   There had been speculation that Boxer, 61, regarded as one of the
most liberal members of the U.S. Senate, might step down. But now the
two-term Democrat is gearing up to raise $10 million to $20 million
for her campaign.</LD>

<LD>The state's inspector general has found widespread mismanagement,
fiscal irregularities and dangerous conditions for inmates as well as
city residents at Folsom's city-run prison.</LD>
<LD>   The audit was compiled last year despite Folsom's efforts in court
to thwart it. It was completed earlier this month and comes after the
retirement of its director and its takeover by the Sacramento County
Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The audit reveals lax supervision of inmates, visitors and
volunteers and easy access for inmates to supplies that could be used
as weapons. The report also shows the main door cannot be locked.</LD>

<HD>Sting of District's Budget Ax Brings School to Tears</HD>
<DH>Education: 'It's devastating,' one parent says, a day after
the Irvine board voted to close Los Naranjos Elementary. Drastic cuts
will be felt districtwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between math, reading and playtime, a lot of tears were shed
Wednesday as kids, their parents and teachers at Irvine's Los
Naranjos Elementary School grappled with the news.</LD>
<LD>   The night before, board members in the cash-strapped Irvine
Unified School District voted to close the 28-year-old campus, then
followed it up with a long list of drastic cuts to erase a projected
$5.2-million shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's devastating," parent Jennifer Alcaraz said of the plan to
close the school in June. "My kids have been here since kindergarten.
Now my fourth-grader is having a hard time adjusting."</LD>
<TE>   To balance the budget, board members Tuesday also eliminated
smaller class sizes in kindergarten, second and third grades
districtwide and cut back science and music programs. More than 120
teachers could receive layoff notices this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Those cuts hurt. But in a city designed around the concept of
small, community campuses at the center of village-like developments,
the loss of the first neighborhood school represents a major change
in philosophy. It would be only the second time the district has
closed a school. An elementary school at El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station was closed along with the base.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a double whammy," Los Naranjos principal Adelle Yeaton
said. Not only will her students and teachers have larger classes and
fewer arts and science programs, they will lose their campus and
their identity as a community. Students at Los Naranjos will get
first dibs in applying to other district schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful that their budget picture is not likely to brighten in the
near future, Irvine board members late Tuesday night warned that more
schools might be facing closure and appointed a task force to study
the viability of their trademark neighborhood campuses. Small
campuses are more expensive to operate than larger ones, and many
districts did away with them long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a departure from ... very, very small schools
that are, in some cases, a stone's throw from each other," Supt.
Patricia Clark White said. "We need schools that have a more robust
attendance and can weather the ups and downs of the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Parents, teachers and children say they are trying to accept
this--but it still stings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad," said Penny Knox, who has taught at the school for 16
years. "I feel like my family is being scattered.... We are losing
everything."</TE>
<TE>   One child even took matters into his own hands to try to save the
school. When Steven S. Choi, president of the school board, visited
Los Naranjos last week, Wesley Creighton, 6, ran up to him and
donated the entire contents of his piggy bank: $1.11.</TE>
<TE>   Choi brought the money to the school board meeting and donated it,
in Wesley's name, to the Irvine Public Schools Foundation.</TE>

<HD>His 80-Year Recess Is Over</HD>
<DH>Learning: After dropping out of school in the 1920s, Cecil
Smith, 94, of Westlake Village becomes the oldest known recipient of
the GED.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The topic was: What have you learned since leaving school?</LD>
<LD>   At first, the question rattled 94-year-old Cecil Smith, who, after
all, had last attended class when Warren G. Harding was president.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, he did well enough on the essay and four other test
segments to become the oldest known recipient of the GED--a
credential certifying knowledge equivalent to that of a high school
graduate and, in Smith's case, then some.</LD>
<TE>   A modest man with a strong voice and senatorial white hair, Smith
hadn't cracked a textbook since dropping out of MacLean Junior High
School in Terre Haute, Ind., at the age of 14. Eighty years later, he
slowly donned cap and gown for a special ceremony Wednesday at the
Conejo Valley Adult School in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an honor," he told an assemblage of friends,
relatives, school district officials and politicians' emissaries.
"It's certainly appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   An upholsterer by trade, Smith has never done much public
speaking. But he held his own at the school ceremony and has agreed
to give a brief pep talk for state prison inmates at Norco.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell them they can do the same thing if they'd put
their mind to it," Smith said. "It'd be a good thing for them."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1942, the General Education Development test has offered a
second chance to adults who leave school early. The average age of
the 865,000 people who took it in 2000 was 25, but record-keeping
through the years has been inconsistent, according to officials of
the American Council on Education, which administers the test.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ben Justesen, a director for the national GED Testing
Service, said he never has heard of a GED recipient older than Smith.
He knew of a 90-year-old man in Arizona who earned the credential,
and a woman who received it at 65 and got a doctorate 25 years later.</TE>
<TE>   "We've checked on it with all the institutional memories we could
put out a call to," Justesen said. "I found no one any older than
Cecil Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Smith didn't count on all the fuss--the chocolate cake,
the TV camera, the official proclamations, the commendation from
President Bush. But he appeared to relish the idea, dressing in a
tuxedo for the occasion and murmuring, "Well, this is just wonderful"
with the reading of each congratulatory note.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith didn't take the test to inspire others or prove a point
about the capabilities of the very old. It's just that his penmanship
had gone downhill, and he figured it was time to improve it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't write every day for 80 years, you get pretty
rusty," he said. "I was married for 61 years and my wife did all the
correspondence. About all I did was sign checks--and I was getting
pretty bad at that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1922, both of Smith's parents died, his mother from cancer and
his father from a lung disease picked up in the coal mines. One of 13
children, he bunked with relatives for a while before finding his own
room and a job. Within a few years, he was learning upholstery at a
furniture factory in Grand Rapids, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Like millions during the Depression, he and his young wife Joanne
came to California. They pitched a tent on the beach, found jobs, and
50 years ago bought two acres near Malibu's Paradise Cove for
$10,000. Peacocks roamed the little spread that would be Smith's home
even after Joanne's death in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We grew our own vegetables," Smith said, beaming at the memory.
"We had goats and chickens and ducks and bees."</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, Smith has lived with relatives in Westlake
Village. Age has chipped away at him; his vision is failing, he wears
three hearing aids, he has an artificial hip, and for 10 years he has
dealt with prostate cancer. Fascinated by electric cars, he bought
one just for the joy of it, although he can't drive it himself. He
has taken a fancy to Verdi's operas and savors a cocktail every
evening. When he can, he loves to waltz.</TE>
<TE>   For all his interests, he never had expressed a desire to complete
his education. But when his nephew Dick Kirkland mentioned that he
had read something about GED classes at the local adult school, Smith
was enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in his daily routine prepared him for this," Kirkland
said. "I suspect he has an ability to figure things out that we never
recognized."</TE>
<TE>   The GED test is given in sections that cover math, science, social
studies, reading and writing. Poring over study materials at home,
Smith came to school and relentlessly attacked each section.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to stop for lunch," said Melissa Nickles, a
supervisor at the school.</TE>
<TE>   So what has he learned since leaving school?</TE>
<TE>   Smith paused before he spoke, as if to assign the proper weight to
every word and the spaces between them.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I learned was to get a job and learn a trade," he
said. "Then in Malibu, I learned how to make chain-link fences, and
how to take care of goats and bees. You've really got to know what
you're doing to take care of bees."</TE>
<TE>   As for the future, he said he plans to pick up a few computer
skills. And to buy a three-wheeled bike for exercise.</TE>
<TE>   And college?</TE>
<TE>   "Not right away," he said, only half-joking.</TE>

<HD>Truants Ordered Back to Class</HD>
<DH>Discipline: A 17-year-old girl and the father of a
fourth-grader who must attend school with his son are the first
punished in Orange County's crackdown.</DH>

<LD>Pressing its campaign against truancy, Orange County punished its
first offenders Wednesday, including the father of 9-year-old who
must attend his son's fourth-grade classes.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Ayala must sit through his son's classes at an Anaheim
grade school at least once a week, Juvenile Court Judge Robert Hutson
said. Ayala's son has missed 45 days of school since August.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the judge's order sends a message that parents
will be held accountable for their child's truancy.</LD>
<TE>   "The father just hasn't done anything," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Danielle Augustin. "He must understand that it's his responsibility
to get his son to school."</TE>
<TE>   Hutson on Wednesday also ordered a 17-year-old girl accused of
missing more than 17 days of school to attend class.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's father thanked the judge for helping him with a problem
he said had gotten out of his control.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very aware of how important student attendance is," said Tim
Jones, a fourth-grade teacher. He said groundings hadn't stopped his
daughter from ditching class at Gilbert East Continuation School in
Anaheim. "This is a long time overdue. Schools have to take a more
aggressive approach."</TE>
<TE>   The high school student and the father of the 9-year-old face
fines, probation or even jail time if they fail to follow the judge's
orders. Both have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The District Attorney's Truancy Response Program began in August
with more than $200,000 in state and federal grants. Three deputy
district attorneys have been tracking hundreds of students with more
than two unexcused absences in any school year.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown is modeled after similar programs in San Diego,
Ventura, Los Angeles and Sacramento counties. Students face Juvenile
Court charges that could lead to probation, while parents can be
charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about punishment," said Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckus,
who is running for reelection this year. "It's about keeping kids in
school, keeping them straight. This is teeth for truancy laws."</TE>
<TE>   Augustin said that prosecutors are working with school officials
to identify habitual truants and that more students and parents will
be summoned to court soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Children who aren't in school are probably up to not much good,"
Augustin said. "There's a strong connection that truant kids commit
crimes or are victims of crimes."</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old girl pleaded not guilty to truancy charges and a
pretrial hearing was set for Feb. 20. If she starts going to class,
the charges could be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Patricia Redner, is divorced from the girl's father
and has custody of the teen. She was charged in January with
violating the state's education code, which requires parents to
ensure their children attend school through the age of 17. She
pleaded guilty, but a Superior Court judge didn't impose a sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala, who works nights, was charged with violating the state's
education code. Prosecutors said they charged the father because he
is his son's primary caretaker while the boy's mother works during
the day.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim City School District has tried to work with the
family, offering counseling and weekend classes and providing a
mentor. Police have even escorted the boy to school.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala, who pleaded not guilty, could face jail or a $100 fine if
his son continues to skip school. A progress hearing is scheduled for
Feb. 20 .</TE>
<TE>   "Like any other kid, he just doesn't like school," Ayala said
after the hearing. "It's boring. But I tell him he has to go because
it's the law."</TE>

<HD>Boeing Profit Drops 80% Amid Air Travel Slump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co., hurt by one of the biggest slumps in air travel in
decades, said Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings plunged nearly
80%, mainly reflecting a one-time charge to pay for massive cuts in
its commercial aircraft business.</LD>
<LD>   With airlines struggling to recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, which have kept skittish passengers off airplanes, Boeing
also revised downward its revenue projections for the next two years,
saying it could not predict when a recovery might occur.</LD>
<LD>   But the world's largest aerospace company said it is betting that
strong results from its growing defense and space communications
operations will help offset any drop in profit at its commercial
aircraft business.</LD>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, earnings fell to $100million, or 12 cents
a share, from $481million, or 55 cents, in the year-earlier period.
Without the anticipated one-time charge of $622million for severance
costs, writing down spare parts and other items, the company would
have posted a profit of $722million, or 90 cents a share, which was
in line with analyst expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the charge was related to company plans to slash as
many as 30,000 jobs, most of them in the Seattle area where the
company assembles most of its commercial jetliners. Boeing said it
has so far pared 12,000 from its payroll, and Chairman and Chief
Executive Phil Condit said there is only a "low probability" that the
company will make fewer cuts than planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a challenging period for commercial aircraft, but all
of our businesses are performing well," Condit said in an interview
Wednesday as he visited the headquarters for the company's space and
communication business in Seal Beach. "The real key is the breadth of
the company; that we can have one part of the business clearly
experiencing a real downturn and have other parts of the company
significantly balancing that impact."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the defense and space businesses, which have been growing
in prominence, added $502million to Boeing's operating profit in the
fourth quarter, up from $54million a year earlier. The two businesses
now make up 40% of overall sales for Boeing, up from less than 25% a
few years ago. Condit, who has been trying to diversify the
Chicago-based company, said the biggest growth may now come from its
space and communication operations.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects for its defense and space business also got a boost
Wednesday when President Bush announced he will propose huge
increases in defense and homeland security spending. Bush said he
plans to seek $38billion more for defense.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, which also is the world's largest satellite maker and the
nation's second-largest defense contractor, would be one of the
biggest beneficiaries of such spending increases, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the reaction was mixed among investors. After rising nearly
70 cents in early-morning trading, Boeing shares fell 45 cents to
close at $39.33 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing said that revenue for 2002 is expected to be about
$1billion less than initial projection and fall to about $54billion,
and that 2003 revenue is likely to fall to $52billion. In 2001,
Boeing posted revenue of $58.2billion, up 13% from $51.3billion.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's space and communications unit, California's largest
private employer, with 43,000 workers, posted fourth-quarter
operating earnings of $224 million, contrasted with a loss of $284
million. The year-earlier results reflect a one-time charge related
to the acquisition of Hughes Space &amp; Communications.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, General Dynamics Corp., benefiting from a buildup in
defense spending, said fourth-quarter earnings rose 11% on higher
sales at its combat systems unit. Sales at the unit rose 93%,
reflecting results from acquisitions and from sales of interim
armored vehicles and tanks. Fourth-quarter earnings for the Falls
Church, Va.-based defense contractor increased to $246million, or
$1.21 a share, from $219million, or $1.09, in the year-earlier
period. Revenue was $3.5billion, compared with $2.7billion a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass.-based maker of missiles, radars and
aircrafts, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $106 million, reflecting
higher tax payments and losses from discontinued operations. In the
year-earlier period, the nation's fourth-largest defense contractor
had earnings of $168 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales rose nearly
6% to $4.63 billion from $4.38 billion a year earlier, bolstered by
defense spending increases, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Conglomerates, Post Enron</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron's collapse is causing a fundamental change in the attitudes of
investors, lenders and credit rating agencies toward conglomerates
and companies carrying heavy debt.</LD>
<LD>   Conglomerate Tyco International's decision this week to split into
four companies was forced in part by investor unwillingness in the
wake of Enron's bankruptcy to support Tyco's complex accounting and
corporate structure.</LD>
<LD>   In Enron's wake, the market is looking with a skeptical eye at
General Electric, AOL Time Warner, Honeywell and other companies
built, as Tyco was, largely by numerous acquisitions.</LD>
<TE>   Investors and analysts are suddenly suspicious of the fact that
conglomerate and multi-industry companies consolidate profits and
losses and debts of many divisions in a single income statement and
balance sheet. Enron hid losses and debts; therefore all complex
financial statements are suspect, goes today's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco Chairman L. Dennis Kozlowski acknowledged the Enron effect
Tuesday when he said "a lot of people are suffering because of
Enron." Kozlowski built Tyco by hundreds of acquisitions in the last
decade into a company that took in $36billion in revenue last year
from burglar and fire alarms, surgical dressings and financial
services.</TE>
<TE>   What is happening is a fundamental change in the investment market
environment, according to analyst Nicholas Heymann of Prudential
Securities, who follows both GE and Tyco.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial concept that worked to build Tyco was that the firm
could tap debt markets to acquire small specialized companies, such
as Kendall Healthcare and ADT security systems.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco then reaped value by consolidating those companies and giving
them greater force in their own industries as well as a corporate
office that theoretically could finance their operations at lower
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "However, things have now changed fundamentally,'' Heymann wrote
Wednesday in a report on Tyco. Because Tyco stock has fallen--it
closed Wednesday at $45.10 a share, down $2.45 for the day and 28%
below its 52-week high--it cannot make more acquisitions without
diluting current shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   And with debt markets concerned about high debt levels, Kozlowski
is splitting the firm into four companies and selling 15% to 20% of
each company in public offerings to raise cash that can pay debt.</TE>
<TE>   GE also is under pressure because its stock, off almost 30% in the
last 52 weeks, remains at levels the company sold at in 1999. GE
closed Wednesday at $37.55, down 65 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts and analysts have long called for GE to spin
off some of its divisions to give shareholders a direct stake in
successful businesses such as medical services.</TE>
<TE>   But now the tone among analysts has changed to a skepticism over
GE's reported earnings and its corporate structure, which spans eight
industries, from aircraft engines to light bulbs to banking,
insurance and other financial services.</TE>
<TE>   GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt defended the GE structure
Wednesday. He told questioners in Boston at an impromptu news
conference that GE isn't likely to follow Tyco's example and split
the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We just feel like our business model offers investors superior
returns and gives us a chance to go forward," Immelt said, according
to wire service reports.</TE>
<TE>   The GE "model" is that the firm's trained managers can run any of
its businesses and generate strong profit returns. GE last year
returned 25% on shareholders' equity and 24% on total capital. The
firm has little long-term debt.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt even said confidently that GE would take a look at Tyco's
operations with an eye to possible acquisitions for its own
divisions. Last week, Immelt told security analysts GE would have to
make acquisitions if it was to meet targets for 17% earnings growth
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is a real question whether even GE can make
acquisitions. Last year, U.S. investment markets were not
enthusiastic about GE's proposed acquisition of Honeywell, which fell
through because of opposition from the European Union. GE's stock
price today does not encourage acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, GE's record of constantly rising earnings is being
questioned because 40% to 45% of the firm's $14 billion in net income
came from GE Capital, the giant financial services divisions that
last year had about $70 billion in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Enron environment, skeptical analysts question just
how much financial results can be tailored conveniently to cover up
poor performance in the industrial divisions. Immelt is conscious of
such criticism. He has said in recent interviews that he would like
to reduce the company's dependence on GE Capital.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, with the post-Enron environment putting pressure on
GE, Immelt was combative. Enron's collapse "has nothing to do with
GE," Immelt said. His company has 500 people who audit its books. "We
have hundreds of meetings with analysts and investors. We think we
are transparent," Immelt said.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the market's attitude toward GE and other conglomerates
has changed. What remains to be seen is how long the new skepticism
will last and what its effects will be on some of the most prominent
diversified companies in American industry.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Puts State Farm Unit on Credit Watch</HD>
<DH>Insurance: A downgrade of the insurer's California
subsidiary could lead to higher rates for homeowners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that may lead to higher homeowner insurance rates
statewide, a major rating agency threatened Wednesday to downgrade
State Farm's California operations because of serious losses in the
insurer's residential business.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's placed State Farm General Insurance Co., a
subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., on a credit
watch after losses eroded the insurer's reserves to $390 million from
$566 million a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said a downgrade would not be a direct financial blow to
State Farm, but S&amp;P's action makes it more probable the company will
seek significant rate increases--which could encourage other insurers
to follow suit.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P's move "is a pretty clear sign that the market is as bad as
insurers have said it is," said Brian Sullivan, an independent
insurance analyst and editor of Property Insurance Report.
"Regulators are going to have a hard time opposing [rate hikes] when
a rating agency has gotten nervous."</TE>
<TE>   State Farm's California operation is still financially sound but
would need a capital infusion from its parent company to maintain its
current AAA rating, the highest S&amp;P bestows, said S&amp;P analyst Charles
Titterton.</TE>
<TE>   A State Farm spokesman said the parent company would consider
beefing up the California operation's reserves, but warned that
additional premium hikes probably would be necessary to bolster the
company's long-term financial strength. Regulators approved a 6.9%
homeowner rate increase for State Farm last month, and the insurer
applied for an additional 6.9% hike this month.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the fact that [S&amp;P analysts are] confident in our
claims-paying ability, but we're concerned any time there's a warning
issued," said Bill Sirola, a State Farm spokesman in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Rate increases by State Farm, California's largest insurer, could
have a ripple effect throughout the state, analysts said. State Farm
had been trying to keep rates low to gain new customers, a strategy
that restrained other insurers from raising rates as much as they
wanted. The state's Department of Insurance said the rating action
would not directly influence its review of State Farm's latest
increase application or any future rate hike requests.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at everything, including [State Farm's] loss data and
their capital levels, but their data better support what they're
asking for or we won't approve the increase," said Nanci Kramer, an
insurance department spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kramer said State Farm's recent rate increase was justified
and the company, and other insurers, may be able to continue to win
premium hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of insurers have been discounting their homeowners'
policies," keeping premiums low to attract more lucrative auto
insurance business, Kramer said. "Now they're realizing losses are
bigger than they anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   State Farm's two largest competitors, Farmers Insurance Group and
Allstate Corp., have blamed higher claims costs when applying for big
rate hikes recently. Farmers, the state's second-largest insurer, has
asked for five rate increases ranging from 5% to 6.9%, while Allstate
applied for a 22.3% hike.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner insurance has been "a horrible, horrible line of
business" in recent years, S&amp;P's Titterton said.</TE>
<TE>   Although California's insurance operations have been somewhat more
profitable than the national average, big losses from Hurricane
Allison in Texas, rising mold-related claims in Texas and California
and flooding in the Midwest have all hurt insurers' profitability, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, S&amp;P downgraded a State Farm subsidiary in Texas because
of mold-related losses and a New Jersey unit because of fraud-related
costs. If State Farm fails to bolster its capital reserves in
California, it could face a downgrade "of one notch, maybe two" to
AA-plus or AA, Titterton said.</TE>

<HD>Umbrella Proposed for Labor Agencies</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new Cabinet-level labor agency that would coordinate the state's
scattered enforcement, job-training and research efforts is likely to
be functioning by mid-summer, according to state officials working on
the organization plan.</LD>
<LD>   The agency--proposed in various forms since 1980--would pull the
Economic Development Department, the Department of Industrial
Relations, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board and the Workforce
Investment Board under one umbrella, said Steve Smith, director of
the Department of Industrial Relations, whose staff helped write the
proposal. They now report to separate arms of government, an
arrangement long criticized for inefficiency and lack of
accountability.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis, who last year vetoed legislation calling for a
similar consolidation, surprised many when he proposed the creation
of a Labor and Workforce Development Agency this month in his State
of the State address. In it, he portrayed the current system as "a
$4.6-billion Goliath made up of 34 different programs in 13 different
agencies."</LD>
<TE>   Unlike last year's bill, the Davis plan would not pull the Fair
Employment and Housing Department, which handles complaints of job
discrimination, into the new agency.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said final details are being worked out and that in about
two weeks the proposal will be submitted for review by the Little
Hoover Commission, an independent state oversight group. It then will
be forwarded to the state Legislature. Unless legislators move to
stop it, which is considered unlikely, the reorganization will take
effect 60 days later.</TE>
<TE>   The new agency is expected to immediately improve cooperation
between the the Economic Development Department and the Industrial
Relations Department, which work on separate tracks in enforcement,
training and research.</TE>
<TE>   "When you find a violator, you often find somebody who violates
laws across the board--unemployment insurance, taxes, minimum wage,
workers comp," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The change also will facilitate the sharing of data such as
unemployment statistics and wage and hour violations, helping to
target industries for training or development, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Economic Development Director Michael Bernick said the move will
eliminate some duplication of efforts. "The governor feels very
strongly there is a need to maximize the use of this money,
especially in these times. This will allow us to work more closely
with the employer community, labor unions and other groups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Organized labor has favored such a consolidation for two decades.
"We think it will bring better enforcement of wage and hour and
workers' compensation and unemployment insurance laws, and we think
it will bring about better coordination of training programs," said
Tom Rankin, president of the California Labor Federation.</TE>
<TE>   The California Chamber of Commerce, which represents business
interests in the state, has not taken a position on the
consolidation, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Several officials familiar with the plan said a far more difficult
step will come when the agency attempts to consolidate state and
federally funded job training and vocational education programs, now
run by a hodgepodge of public and private groups. Davis' proposal
calls for the Industrial Relations Department to eventually run all
apprenticeship programs while California Community Colleges handles
vocational and adult education programs.</TE>

<HD>Ford Cutbacks Spare Luxury Auto Group</HD>
<DH>The Irvine-based unit is going strong despite its parent's
woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ford Motor Co. carries out a massive restructuring that involves
shuttering plants, cutting production, eliminating products and
slashing 35,000 jobs from its payroll, the bloodletting will affect
the Ford family around the world--except, it seems, in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   If Ford has a sacred cow, it is its Premier Automotive Group,
whose North American headquarters was moved to Irvine late last year
and whose London-based president, former BMW executive Wolfgang
Reitzle, has seen his empire swell even as Ford Chairman William Clay
Ford Jr. was drafting his corporate downsizing plan. Reitzle, in
fact, has the chairman's blessing to expand PAG aggressively even as
other Ford units are contracting.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy makes sense to most industry analysts, who point out
that the premier group's vehicles--from Aston Martin Lagonda's
hand-built $228,000 Vanquish at the high end to Volvo's safe-and-sane
sedans--are among the most profitable in Ford's stable. Moreover, the
luxury and performance car markets typically are among the last to
feel the pinch of a weakening economy--and are among the first to
reap the rewards of a recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, though the Ford and Mercury brands probably will see their
market share shrink again this year, the PAG marques--with the
exception of a rebuilding Lincoln--are expected to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "PAG is the least problematic part of Ford,'' said analyst Rod
Lache of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "The luxury end of the market has
the highest return, so it makes sense to pursue growth in that area."</TE>
<TE>   Ford earns an estimated $5,500 a vehicle from its luxury lines,
about the same as it makes on big pickup trucks and sport-utility
vehicles but double the profit on mainstream cars. The company has
said it intends to push its worldwide luxury vehicle sales to 1.2
million units a year by 2006, up from about 850,000 last year.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the loss of one model at Lincoln, PAG was
conspicuously absent as Bill Ford--as he prefers to be called--ran
down his hit list Jan. 11. Even elimination of the Continental model
from Lincoln's lineup is not a blow to the group. In fact, Ford's
domestic luxury brand is adding models, undergoing a brand redesign
and probably will resurrect the Continental in a few years as a new
flagship model.</TE>
<TE>   Vic Doolan, president of PAG's North American operations, noted
that Lincoln will get a new small SUV called the Aviator this year
and that each of its remaining models, including the Navigator SUV
and the Town Car sedan, has been redesigned for the 2002 model year.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mercury--which is part of Irvine-based Lincoln Mercury but
not part of PAG--is faring well in its association with the premier
brands. Though two of Mercury's models will be eliminated as part of
Ford's recovery plan--the slow-selling Cougar sports coupe and the
aging Villager minivan--the brand is getting a new van and a new
performance model called the Marauder.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury insiders said the marque remains a moneymaker for Ford,
and Bill Ford, Doolan and Brian Kelley, president of the Lincoln
Mercury unit, all have said publicly in recent weeks that Mercury
will stay.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Ford could never make up with Ford models alone the
sales it would lose by eliminating Mercury.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury dealers sell 115,000 units of the full-size Grand Marquis
sedan a year, 105,000 mid-size Sables and 45,000 Mountaineer SUVs,
said Jim Hall, Detroit-based auto industry analyst for AutoPacific
Inc. With virtually no advertising outlay on Mercury's part, the
Grand Marquis, popular with older male buyers, regularly outsells its
twin, the Ford Crown Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PAG Workers in Good Spirits</TE>
<TE>   So while faces are long at Ford's world headquarters in Dearborn,
Mich., and at manufacturing plants around the globe, the mood among
PAG and Lincoln Mercury employees, including about 1,000 at the
Irvine complex, has been fairly cheerful--insiders describe it as
relaxed and relieved. In all, Ford has about 1,300 employees in
California, most in Irvine and at its Western regional office in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for PAG call for introduction of 25 major new or redesigned
models during the next five years. The group's five marques--Aston
Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln and Volvo--accounted for about
18% of Ford Motor profit in 2000 but are expected to contribute a
third by 2006, said Nick Scheele, the auto maker's chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the corporate parent considers PAG to be untouchable
despite disappointing U.S. sales from several of its brands last
year--Lincoln was down 17% and Volvo's car sales dropped 12.8%--is
that acquiring and beefing up the Eurocentric collection in the past
decade represents an expenditure of about $15 billion. The company
isn't going to win points with investors for junking that kind of
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they spent that kind of money is so they can be strong
in the upper-crust vehicle segment, where they expect a lot of sales
growth to be in the next few years," said David Cole, president of
the Center for Automotive Research at the Altarum Institute think
tank in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Bill Ford, who sacked Chief Executive Jacques Nasser
and took over his duties in October, was instrumental in forming PAG
three years ago and in hiring Reitzle to run it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Group's Chief Says Problems Remain</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before Ford released his recovery plan, Reitzle--a
dapper Bavarian whose passions include cars and skiing and who
previously ran BMW's product development and marketing units--said he
was not worried that Nasser, his chief mentor at Ford, was gone and
that a corporate overhaul was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "PAG is such a convincing strategy, and I know from Bill Ford that
they are 100% fully supportive of the strategy," Reitzle said. "We
have enough problems in other areas [of the company], so why create
new problems where we have something which works?"</TE>
<TE>   Reitzle is a engineer who waxes poetic when he discusses
automobiles--"the car has to be like an animal ... almost as if it's
alive" is an oft-repeated dictum. He acknowledges, though, that PAG
must overcome problems.</TE>
<TE>   Land Rover's trucks regularly finish near the bottom of the barrel
in quality and customer satisfaction surveys; Volvo, despite its
reputation for safety, has quality problems as well; and Lincoln is
hurrying to change its entire image lest it die out along with its
customer base of over-60 males.</TE>
<TE>   Reitzle has drawn some criticism from within Ford for insisting on
keeping his headquarters in a London townhouse and surrounding
himself with a group of senior executives--many of them former
teammates at BMW.</TE>
<TE>   But he also is seen as a consummate product planner, an executive
who not only knows how to run a business but understands car design.</TE>
<TE>   Reitzle said that he is about more than spending money--that
organizing the premier brands into a centrally managed group will
realize tremendous savings by enabling him to consolidate support
services such as marketing, administration and engineering.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to stretch the use of common components so that
Jaguars can share platforms with Volvos and Fords or use Ford and
Lincoln components under the skin where they are unseen and make no
difference in the distinctive characteristics of the individual
brand. A single type of door-lock mechanism or light dimmer switch
might migrate from Ford to Jaguar to Land Rover, but each brand would
keep its own proprietary suspension springs and shock absorber design
to ensure unique handling characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   But job one, Reitzle said, is to improve quality at the factories.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at where we are at the moment, on J.D. Power
quality surveys with Land Rover, for instance, then you know we are
at the bottom," he said. "And we want to move up, so that has to be
changed."</TE>
<TE>   Land Rover sales, boosted by the late-year introduction in the
U.S. of the $26,000 Freelander, held steady in 2001. Reitzle said
plans call for sales to be propped up this year with a new high-end
Range Rover model, designed and built under new quality standards and
set to roll into dealerships this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Jaguar, which Ford acquired in 1991 and has spent considerable
time and effort improving, "is already nicely positioned," Reitzle
said. The brand's U.S. sales rose 1.8% last year, and the addition
late in the year of the X-Type, a so-called baby Jaguar priced to
start at less than $30,000, is expected to keep sales pumped up this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Aston Martin brand is a super-premier marque with just 1,500
sales worldwide last year--300 in the U.S. But the company had sold
the first two years' production of the V-12 Vanquish before the first
one rolled out of the factory, and the brand intends to quadruple
U.S. and worldwide sales over the next five years with its $150,000
Vantage models and a new small model to be priced about $100,000 to
compete with the Porsche 911.</TE>

<HD>SEC Chief Pushes Accounting Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt reiterated
Wednesday that in the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal, the accounting
profession needs an oversight body that is not under the industry's
control.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt's remarks at the Securities Regulation Institute's annual
meeting in Coronado, Calif., underlined the rift between Pitt and the
Public Oversight Board, the current industry supervisory panel.</LD>
<LD>   Upset at not being consulted before Pitt last week unveiled his
plan for revamping the accounting-oversight system, the POB's five
members voted unanimously Sunday to disband the panel, effective
March 31. POB Chairman Charles A. Bowsher contends that Pitt's plan
would increase the accounting industry's influence over the policing
process.</LD>
<TE>   The POB, founded in 1977, oversees peer reviews that auditing
firms do of one another's work. But the panel has been criticized for
never issuing an unfavorable report on an accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt and Bowsher met briefly Wednesday before Pitt's speech at the
Hotel del Coronado, where Bowsher is today's keynote speaker at the
same conference.</TE>
<TE>   The two men had what SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan called "a
useful and candid exchange," but Bowsher and the POB did not rescind
their decision.</TE>
<TE>   The POB and the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the main industry trade group, have scheduled a meeting
next week to discuss the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The POB's link with AICPA, which funds the board, is at the heart
of Pitt's objection.</TE>
<TE>   "While we believe that the POB provides a good model for us to use
to transition to a new disciplinary system," Pitt said Wednesday, "we
oppose any regulatory system that is directly under the control of a
profession it is designed to discipline, as the POB-overseen process
presently is."</TE>
<TE>   Although Pitt has not released details of his plan, he proposes
that the new oversight system be financed by companies whose books
are being audited, by financial markets and by other "people who use
and benefit from our disclosure and auditing system."</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher's concern is that a new panel "will come to be dominated
by the profession," Bowsher spokesman Cleve Corlett said. "It's not
the financing that worries Bowsher, it's the makeup of the group,"
Corlett added.</TE>
<TE>   None of the five current POB members has direct ties with the
accounting industry, although Bowsher, former head of the General
Accounting Office (Congress' investigative arm), and fellow member
Donald J. Kirk were trained at major accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has more-recent industry ties, having represented AICPA and
the Andersen accounting firm--Enron's auditor--as a lawyer before
taking the SEC job. Pitt successfully fought to blunt the effects of
proposed rules that would have barred auditors from doing certain
kinds of consulting work for the firms they audit.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Harlan also confirmed that Pitt has held a series
of meetings in recent weeks with chief executives of the Big Five
accounting firms to discuss proposed revisions in oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the sniping between Pitt and the POB points up
the difficulty of reaching a consensus on new accounting-industry
regulation. For years, the industry has successfully fought back
attempts at the federal level--including at the SEC--to tighten
oversight rules and reduce the industry's self-regulatory powers.</TE>

<HD>For Entertainment, Go Clippers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem with pulling for Los Angeles--not the Lakers, not the
Clippers, but the city--is it's hard to figure out the right rooting
interest.</LD>
<LD>   We want the Lakers to play the Clippers in the first round of the
playoffs. Oh baby, that would be fun. How great was it to see the
players and the fans go back and forth in the Clippers' 95-90 victory
Wednesday night?</LD>
<LD>   A playoff rematch would probably require a No. 1 seeding for the
Lakers and a No. 8 seeding for the Clippers. So did we want the
Lakers to win last night to go for the best record in the league? Or
did we want the Clippers to claw toward a playoff berth?</LD>
<TE>   Since the Clippers need to win in January just to think about the
playoffs, and since they're the only team in town playing that way
right now, it's not too hard to choose. The Lakers represent this
city's best chance for a championship and they can win one as the No.
2 or 3 seeded team. But the Clippers are the best entertainment until
then.</TE>
<TE>   Most in the crowd seemed to favor the Clippers in their designated
home game, having no trouble picking sides. The fans roared during
the Clippers' third-quarter comeback and booed the ticky-tack fouls
that sent Shaquille O'Neal to the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   It was almost as if the referees took my ideas about officiating
O'Neal to the extreme. They called little love taps and phantom
fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, I talked with O'Neal about his fight with Brad
Miller. He said there's a difference between a hard foul and a dirty
play, and that Miller crossed the line.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was sick of no-names trying to make a reputation
against him. He pointed to his surgically repaired right thumb, the
one damaged by a Matt Geiger hack in 1995, and said it's already
happened once before.</TE>
<TE>   He said he warned Miller he was going to get punished if he kept
pounding him, and he did. And O'Neal tried to avoid hitting him in
the back of the head. Watch the tape of the incident (if you're not
already sick of it), and notice that O'Neal holds his fist while
waiting for Miller to turn around. Miller turns briefly, O'Neal lets
it fly, and Miller turns back around, the fist whizzing by the side
of his head.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's coming along in his sheriff's training. He demonstrated
his frisking technique on an overwhelmed Stu Lantz before the game,
and reminded us that 245 is the penal code for assault with a deadly
weapon. And he's fully aware that the soft area in the back of the
skull is a "kill zone." So he wasn't aiming for it.</TE>
<TE>   I have yet to talk to one NBA player, coach or broadcaster who
blames Shaq for losing his cool. They know the game and they know
human nature. They know why it happened.</TE>
<TE>   Should he be responsible for his actions? Of course. I would have
suspended him for five games, not three.</TE>
<TE>   But if you're going to foul O'Neal--and it's tough to do so in a
way that won't give him a shot at a three-point play--there's a
responsible way to do it. Follow the example Sean Rooks set in the
fourth quarter. He wrapped both arms around O'Neal in a big bear hug,
held his arms down, then gave him a little pat on the side after the
whistle to let him know it was nothing personal, strictly business.
No need for all the "Street Fighter" moves of Miller and Charles
Oakley in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   So the Clippers didn't have to be afraid of any flying fists.</TE>
<TE>   If I'm the Clippers, right now I'm worried about the Bobblehead
Doll Jinx and what it could mean for Quentin Richardson. So far, no
player has been around on the originally scheduled night for the
giveaway of their likeness. Lamar Odom's night was Nov. 10, but he
was suspended for violating the league's drug policy. Keyon Dooling's
was supposed to be Dec. 4, but he went on the injured list with a
sprained right ankle on Nov. 15 and he still hasn't made his way back
to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's doll night is scheduled for Saturday's game against
the Dallas Mavericks. Burn them all. Now.</TE>
<TE>   The jinx might not be through with Odom, who has a sprained
ligament in his right wrist, which an MRI exam revealed Wednesday.
The wrist will be placed in a cast today, and he'll miss several more
games.</TE>
<TE>   His status probably won't be known before the Feb. 21 trading
deadline, so you should probably wrap up any talk of trading for the
time being as well. Besides, he's too cheap too trade for the next
couple of seasons as well. At $3.6 million this season, it would be
close to impossible to find a player of similar talent who makes
similar money (within 15%), as would be necessary to accommodate the
trade under the NBA's salary cap rules.</TE>
<TE>   That rules out such worthy and available players as Gary Payton
($12.9 million) and Jalen Rose ($10.9 million) without the Clippers
having to throw in other players to make it work.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers say they're not looking to trade Odom anyway.</TE>
<TE>   For now, with Odom and Dooling out, Coach Alvin Gentry's job
actually gets easier. Fewer players to divide the minutes. Wednesday
night, that meant more run for Corey Maggette, who lit up the Lakers
for 23 of his 28 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's see him shoot like that in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Please, let's see him get the chance.</TE>

<HD>Hingis Gets Another Shot</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Having gone three years without a Grand Slam title,
she reaches final by ousting Seles, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Martina Hingis was starting to waver toward the finish line, her mind
flying ahead of her body, imagining a sixth straight Australian Open
final appearance. Working in her favor, and against those hoping for
another happily-ever-after-comeback story, was a staggering Monica
Seles.</LD>
<LD>   Seles knew what to do. But her 28-year-old body couldn't get her
within reach of the finish line, lunging for it instead of speeding
toward it.</LD>
<LD>   Consequently, Hingis overcame the mental yips when Seles succumbed
to a physical dip. The third-seeded Hingis, who has not won a Grand
Slam event in three years, will get another crack at breaking the
drought as she defeated No. 8 Seles, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, in one hour 40
minutes today in the semifinals of the Australian Open.</LD>
<TE>   In the final, Hingis will play defending champion and top-seeded
Jennifer Capriati or No. 4 Kim Clijsters of Belgium. In their
semifinal, Capriati won the first set 7-5 and Clijsters the second
6-3 as this edition went to press. It was a rematch of their French
Open final last year, which Capriati won, 12-10, in the third set.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis and Capriati met in last year's Australian Open final, and
Capriati won convincingly, 6-4, 6-3, to take her first Grand Slam
singles title. This will be Hingis' sixth straight appearance in the
final here, winning the first three and losing the next two to
Lindsay Davenport and Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, there seems to be less baggage accompanying
Hingis since she lost the No. 1 ranking. After ankle surgery late
last year, she stayed at home in Switzerland and worked hard
physically, and it showed against Seles.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their last two matches on a hard-court surface in Southern
California--both won by Seles--Hingis survived the early barrage of
groundstrokes. Once it became clear that Seles was unwilling to
approach the net with any frequency, Hingis was able to loop the
balls back and play her trademark retrieving game.</TE>
<TE>   So often, Seles would set up the point and miss the opportunity to
seize it by making an unforced error. Case in point was in the fifth
game of the second set. Hingis got down 0-40 and Seles had three
break points, missing the third with a groundstroke just wide after
an excellent series of forcing shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Martina was more consistent through the match," said
Seles, who has not been in a Slam final since the 1998 French Open.
"I made too many unforced errors at key times. I thought I had a lot
of misses today, against a player like Martina you can't afford it.
Martina's a fast player and she does put pressure on you to make a
good shot."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis was relieved to see the final forehand from Seles float
wide, saying, "Thank God, she had me."</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old had started to fray in the final stretch, bouncing
her racket and missing an overhead in the last game, leading 30-0.
Hingis, out of the corner of her eye, saw Seles move slightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the sense she was going there," Hingis said. "It forced me
to go for too much. Nerves played a big-time role in it."</TE>
<TE>   She was asked about the last time she missed an overhead in that
manner--blasting it out at a key point.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when I was two years old," Hingis said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Hingis seemed to be just as confident, beating Serena
and Venus Williams to reach the final. Now, apparently, it was a
brave front, she indicated.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning of this year, I won Sydney and making the final
(here), I did a lot better than I expected. I feel better than in the
last few years," Hingis said. "I feel back where I used to be."</TE>
<TE>   It is never easy for any player to defeat Seles at the Australian
Open. Before this loss, she was 42-2 in Melbourne, winning the title
four times. Although Hingis was overpowered in their last two
meetings, she has done well against Seles in Grand Slams, winning
five of their six matches.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis had only 12 unforced errors to 40 for Seles, committing
only three in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I had to lift something," Hingis said. "Monica was playing
very well, not much I could do in the beginning. I felt like she was
on top of me. I was just trying to make her move."</TE>
<TE>   The game plan worked and now Hingis will try to win her first Slam
since she beat Amelie Mauresmo of France in the Australian Open final
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it now again and it's a nice feeling," she said.</TE>

<HD>All-French Duel Isn't for Birds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Eventually, a bird had to die at Melbourne Park. It was only a matter
of time before the curse of the Australian Open hit a flying object
too.</LD>
<LD>   Four Frenchmen were playing in the men's doubles semifinal
today--Julien Boutter and Arnaud Clement vs. Michael Llordra and
Fabrice Santoro. The birds were particularly active, especially since
the roof of Rod Laver Arena was opened.</LD>
<LD>   One bird swooped down to eat a stranded moth on the court but
missed ... unforced error. Later, in the third set, one of Boutter's
forehands smacked into a bird flying over the net, taking it out. And
no, despite the French theme, it was not a little sparrow.</LD>
<TE>   "It was either a swallow or a swift," said one Australian
reporter. "The problem is that there are some swifts that look like
swallows."</TE>
<TE>   This development led to questions from French reporters about one
of the more famous bird deaths in sports. Most recently, and
dramatically, Arizona Diamondback pitcher Randy Johnson's fastball in
a spring training game last year in Tucson killed a bird, sending its
feathers flying.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Llorda and Santoro prevailed in a marathon, winning
6-3, 3-6, 12-10, in 2 hours 55 minutes. In the final, they will play
second-seeded Americans Donald Johnson and Jared Palmer or No. 9 Mark
Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada. Johnson and
Palmer beat twins Bob and Mike Bryan, 6-4, 6-4, in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Palmer were attempting to reach their third
consecutive Grand Slam doubles final. Last year, they won at
Wimbledon and lost in the U.S. Open final.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany survived another tough test
in the quarterfinals, needing four sets and 3 hours 17 minutes to
beat Chilean Marcelo Rios, a finalist here in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Haas, who had played five-setters in his previous two matches,
defeated Rios, 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-6 (5). He had 22 aces to 17
for Rios.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the second Australian Open semifinal for Haas, who
lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999. He advanced despite the artistic
shot-making of Rios, and other distractions, including the loud
crying of Rios' infant daughter in the first set.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in a long rally," said Haas, who will play Marat Safin of
Russia in the semifinals. "My eye was kind of like [on] the baby when
I was playing, and then she [Rios' wife Juliana] was quite nice to
leave. So it was OK."</TE>

<LD>   Long Beach State (6-12, 2-5) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (9-6,
3-4), 5:30, KRLA (870), Fox Sports Net 2--Long Beach defeated
Pacific, 78-74, on Saturday for only its third victory in its last 13
games. Long Beach forward Travis Reed had 19 points and 11 rebounds
against Pacific for his sixth double-double of the season. Reed and
the 49ers will need the confidence playing Cal Poly, which has not
won in two weeks but is 6-1 at home.</LD>
<TE>   UC Irvine (13-5, 6-1) at UC Santa Barbara (11-5, 5-2), 7, KUCI-FM
(88.9)--First place in the Big West Conference is at stake. Irvine
leads Santa Barbara and Cal State Northridge by a game after having
its 19-game home winning streak end Saturday in a 73-72 overtime loss
to Northridge. Anteater guard Jerry Green leads the Big West in
scoring with a 21.5 average. Santa Barbara forward Adama Ndiaye had a
career-best 31 points and 13 rebounds Saturday in a 74-67 victory
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Gaucho guard Branduinn Fullove is
questionable because of a bruised thigh. Irvine has won the last
three meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (4-12, 1-6) at Cal State Northridge (6-10,
5-2), 7, KWRM (1370)--The Matadors have won three of their last four,
the last a 73-72 overtime upset at Irvine. Guard Markus Carr broke
out of his shooting slump with 22 and 31 points in his last two
games. Fullerton is coming off the most impressive victory in Donny
Daniels' 11/2-year tenure as coach, a victory against Utah State last
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside (6-9, 3-4) at Pacific (11-6, 3-4), 7, KPRO
(1570)--Riverside is looking to regroup after a tough week at home.
The Highlanders lost to Utah State before a packed house last
Thursday and then were beaten at the buzzer by Idaho, 60-58, on
Saturday. Sophomore center Vili Morton will be tested by an
experienced Pacific team that also lost twice last week at UC Irvine
and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (11-6, 4-0) at Santa Clara (7-10, 2-2), 7:30, KPLS
(830)--The Waves are sitting on top of the West Coast Conference,
thanks to their sweep of Gonzaga and Portland last weekend.
Pepperdine has won all five games since the return of forward Glen
McGowan and six in a row overall. McGowan is averaging 12.2 points
and 5.4 rebounds off the bench. The Broncos have rebounded well from
a 1-8 start. Forward Steve Ross comes off the bench but leads the
Broncos in scoring at 16.1 a game.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (9-9, 2-2) at San Diego (10-7, 2-2), 7, KXLU-FM
(88.9)--Loyola was burned for 34 first-half points by Gonzaga guard
Dan Dickau in a 94-60 West Coast Conference loss on Saturday. San
Diego is coming off an 86-77 loss to Santa Clara at home.</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   USC (10-8, 6-4) at Oregon (10-8, 5-4), 7--The Ducks lost at home
to rival Oregon State last week for the first time in nine seasons.
Oregon guard Shaquala Williams (16.7) is fourth among Pac-10 scorers.
Above her is USC's Aisha Hollans (18.2).</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (5-12, 2-6) at Oregon State (10-9, 6-3), 7, KACD (850), KEWS
(1350)--The Bruins will try again to slow down Oregon State guard
Felicia Ragland, the conference's leading scorer (20.5). Ragland
scored 32 against the Bruins in the Beavers' 79-65 victory on Dec.
22.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Riviera Seems to Be on Tiger's Busy Schedule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for the Tiger Countdown....</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks ago, Tiger Woods was on Maui in Hawaii playing the
season-opening Mercedes Championships.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, he was in New Zealand playing the country's Open
championship for no other reason than he was given $2 million to show
up and he wanted to do something nice for his Kiwi caddie.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, he was on the Gold Coast of Australia, just hanging
out.</TE>
<TE>   This week, he is in Orlando, at his home at Isleworth.</TE>
<TE>   And next week, Tiger will be back at work at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first of what appear to be four tournaments in a row for
Woods, who follows Pebble Beach with the Buick Invitational at Torrey
Pines, then probably the Nissan Open at Riviera (although he hasn't
made it official), and finally the $5-million Accenture Match Play
Championship at La Costa.</TE>
<TE>   It's a busy schedule, but it also doesn't involve much travel,
which should help Riviera's case. At Pebble, Woods will once again
team with former Stanford teammate Jerry Chang, plus buddy Mark
O'Meara and Irish businessman Dermott Desmond. Woods says he is ready
for Pebble Beach and the rigors of a celebrity pro-am.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be a long week, spiky greens, six-hour
rounds, the weather lousy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to go down there with the idea of trying to have
some fun."</TE>
<TE>   Woods tied for sixth in New Zealand and said there's nothing wrong
with his putting.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to putt on better greens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are he's not going to find them anytime soon because bumpy
greens are par for the course everywhere he might play before the
tour heads for Florida the first weekend of March.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke Signals</TE>
<TE>   They got lucky over the weekend at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic,
where Phil Mickelson had no problem with five days of play, 90 holes,
four courses, 127 other pros and even a one-hole playoff to win the
tournament, averaging seven birdies a round. He's a proven winner and
a good champion, but when you have a tournament such as the Hope that
is nothing but a flat-out race to see who gets to 30 under par the
quickest, you sometimes don't get that kind of winner.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, the Hope's board of directors is working behind
the scenes trying to come up with a way to make the tournament
tougher before somebody gets to 40 under. (A 40 under, by the way,
would look something like this: 64-64-64-64-64. At this time, the
golf is officially a joke.)</TE>
<TE>   What is being considered is sure to be controversial: Saying
goodbye to Indian Wells Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   The course is scenic, but short--at 6,478 yards, it's the shortest
course on the PGA Tour. Indian Wells also is historic, but outdated,
at least for big-time tournament play and all the extra tents and
hospitality and extra room required. Indian Wells has been part of
the Hope for 43 years, beginning with Arnold Palmer's victory in the
first tournament in 1960. But it is simply too easy, and it's also so
short that it takes the driver out of many players' bags.</TE>
<TE>   The other courses are acceptable, if not heavyweights, but that's
not so bad. The Palmer Course at PGA West and Bermuda Dunes are
regulars and La Quinta and Tamarisk take turns, and that's an
acceptable lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Joe Durant shot a record 36 under last year with the
Palmer Course as the host course and it's also where David Duval shot
59 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Milthorpe, the tournament director, says the Hope is what it
is, at least for the present time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something the event has lived with for 30 years, the low
scores," he said. "With the advancements in technology and the old
courses, there's not much one can do."</TE>
<TE>   Just what course the Hope could move to and eliminate Indian Wells
is not known and probably couldn't happen until 2004 at the earliest.
Tournament officials are paying attention to the times, though,
Milthorpe said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that's something the executive committee will
decide--where we want to be in five years."</TE>
<TE>   A good guess would be anywhere but Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Honk</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why did some officials at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic
say they were relieved David Berganio didn't win?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: He was wearing a cap with a Buick logo.</TE>
<TE>   (Nothing personal, just business, the Hope people say).</TE>
<TE>   Good-Time Charlie</TE>
<TE>   Is Charles Howell III the next big thing?</TE>
<TE>   It was pretty funny when Sports Illustrated predicted last week
that Howell, 22, is going to suffer a sophomore slump in his second
year on the PGA Tour ... especially when he already has tied for
fourth in his opener at the Sony Open and then tied for sixth (at 26
under par) at the Hope.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see that, but I don't think so," said Howell, one of the
most unusual players on the PGA Tour--unusual because he actually
likes reporters. What's not to like about writers who can't find
anything wrong with a guy? Howell absolutely splatters the golf ball.
He hits it so hard and far and draws rave reviews from peers such as
Fred Couples, Brandel Chamblee and Rocco Mediate.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me Mr. Chamblee," said Mr. Chamblee.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more unassuming characters on the PGA Tour, Howell had
enough reasons to come on a lot stronger in the ego department. A
two-time first-team All-American at Oklahoma State, Howell won the
Jack Nicklaus and Fred Haskins awards and set a record of 23 under
when he won the NCAA title. Last year, Howell made the cut in 20 of
24 events and won $1.5 million to earn his tour card for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Howell, who grew up near Augusta Country Club, had a storied
junior career that included a hard-fought loss to Woods in the 1996
U.S. Amateur at Pumpkin Ridge. Howell doesn't mind the pressure of
being singled out for potential stardom or being compared to Woods,
for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always expectations, but if people aren't saying it, then
they don't think you're very good," he said. "I like being in that
role. It won't change me a whole lot and hopefully it won't change
the way I look at things.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be some days where you think you're better than
Tiger Woods, there's going to be days you can't come close to him,
but overall, I take that as a compliment."</TE>
<TE>   Pop the Cork</TE>
<TE>   News item: Berringer signs on as the title sponsor of the Senior
PGA Tour event at Silverado Country Club in Napa.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: It's a good move for the often-grumpy senior pros, who
now have the chance to trade their Whine List for the Wine List.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Here is news that proves once again that there's never enough of
Woods to go around, virtual reality or the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   It's apparently not enough that he's on PC games, plus PlayStation
and PlayStation 2. Now Woods is heading for the video arcade.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, you can drop your tokens in the slot and play with Woods.
For replays, you probably have to beat him in the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Match Game</TE>
<TE>   The merits of match play are always a lively debate. The good
thing about match play is that so much rides on each match and if you
lose, you're out.</TE>
<TE>   That's also the bad thing about match play. Sometimes, the stars
are gone long before the weekend TV. The chance of going out early is
why Woods and so few of the top players traveled to Australia to play
last year's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   This year's tournament is back at La Costa, which will certainly
make a difference in the field. The $5-million Accenture World Match
Play event isn't until next month, but unless the official rankings
of the top 64 players change, the first round has some intriguing
matchups, including Woods-John Cook, John Daly-Colin Montgomerie,
Robert Allenby-Stuart Appleby and Paul Azinger-Hal Sutton.</TE>
<TE>   Riviera Update</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Nissan Open is getting an assist from the World
Match Play event at La Costa the week after Riviera. International
players who have signed up to play Riviera include defending champion
Allenby, Sergio Garcia, Vijay Singh, Darren Clarke, Bernhard Langer,
Jose Coceres, Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood, Nick Price, Paul McGinley,
Jose Maria Olazabal and Toru Taniguichi.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre is Bad</TE>
<TE>   Tom Purtzer, who turned 50 six weeks ago, is joining the Senior
PGA Tour next week at the Royal Caribbean Classic. Purtzer has long
been sought after for swing help by the pros and now he'll be able to
play with guys his own age.</TE>
<TE>   Purtzer says he'll have to get used to playing 54-hole events
instead of 72-hole events.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have that extra day to make up for a mediocre round,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Note to Tom: No offense, but what tour have you been watching
lately? Mediocre rounds don't cut it anymore on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point is Mickelson, who shot a two-under 70 on Friday
and dropped 13 places at the Hope. Good thing he went 65-64 on the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   And Jay Haas goes 63-68-68-63 and a mediocre 74 on Sunday drops
him from first to a tie for 16th.</TE>

<LD>Having a roster stocked with club soccer players is not mandatory for
fielding a successful team at the high school level.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena boys' squad has proved that this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Bulldogs are 12-0-4 and atop the Pacific League standings with
a 4-0-1 record before today's game at Glendale Hoover, but only three
players on their roster--sophomore twins Nelson and Elfego Villa and
freshman Yura Movsisyan--play at the highly competitive club level
during the off-season.</LD>
<TE>   Many of their other players take part in the Villa Park League, a
Pasadena parks and recreation league.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not really a team that progressed together [from the time
they were little kids]," Coach Cherif Zein said about Pasadena. "But
they play well together. We don't have a lot of club players, but we
play solid soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena, off to its best start in the program's 31-year history,
took a big step toward breaking Arcadia's eight-year hold on the
Pacific League title with a 3-1 victory against the Apaches last
week. But Zein said the Bulldogs played scared for the first 15-20
minutes of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They were giving ground," he said of his team. "They were
intimidated by the Arcadia aura. They weren't tackling great. But
then they started to settle down."</TE>
<TE>   Amilcar Ramirez, a three-year starter for Pasadena, said he and
his teammates knew they could play with an Arcadia team that was
13-1-2 at the time, but it took a while to get the jitters out of
their systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Arcadia has always been the big team in league," Ramirez said.
"Arcadia has always been the one that's done good in [the Southern
Section playoffs]. So for the first 10-15 minutes, we were nervous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home-field advantage: Team speed is one of Pasadena's strengths,
but a wet, muddy field slowed the Bulldogs Tuesday in a 0-0 tie at
cross-town rival Pasadena Muir.</TE>
<TE>   The field was a mess because the sprinklers were on for three
hours Tuesday morning, according to Zein.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was done on purpose," Zein said. "[Muir Coach
Mario Hernandez] and I both work at Pasadena City College and he told
me what happened. He said he told them not to water the field, but
they did."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team to watch: Chino Hills Ayala has been one of the big surprises
of the new year.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs were 4-6-2 in nonleague and tournament play, but had
won their first four Sierra League games before Wednesday's contest
at Damien.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala (8-6-2) defeated Rowland and West Covina each by 3-2 scores
in the first week of league play before stunning La Puente Nogales
and Diamond Bar by identical 1-0 scores last week.</TE>
<TE>   "They played totally different against us and Nogales than they
did earlier in the season," Coach Bill Zylstra of Diamond Bar said.</TE>
<TE>   "They played a very defensive game. Their coaches came up with a
game plan and their players did a great job sticking to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rankings update: Irvine Woodbridge heads a list of nine teams from
the region that are ranked among the top 25 in the nation in Student
Sports magazine's latest winter poll.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge, the preseason No. 1, is ranked third, with Long Beach
Millikan fifth, Los Alamitos sixth, Alta Loma 10th, Temecula
Chaparral 11th, Dana Hills 13th, Huntington Beach Marina 18th,
Fountain Valley 19th and Santa Margarita 21st.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes it's interesting to know what other people think of us.
Kristen Davis, in the Arizona Daily Star, is not very complimentary.</LD>
<LD>   "After another trip to the L.A. Sports Arena, I'm again left to
ponder what it is about USC that allures so many top [women's]
basketball players to its campus. The Sports Arena is a dump,
although the Trojans are to move into the new USC Events Center in
2003. Still, the team basically plays before its family and friends.</LD>
<LD>   "The Trojans average 649 fans. The Sports Arena is at 4.2%
capacity with that average. Remember, USC played host to NCAA Sweet
16 and Elite Eight games each of the last two years and attracted
only 1,000 a game."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the largest crowd for an NFL game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Swish: The Montreal Expos call slugging outfielder Vladimir
Guerrero "The Alien" because, as pitcher Troy Mattes said, "He does
things that no one has seen before. His bat speed is unbelievable. I
wish I could describe the sound his bat makes when he makes contact.
You never hear that sound because no one swings the bat that fast."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More on Guerrero: He is one of only four players to have three
consecutive seasons with 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in before
age 25. The others are Ted Williams, Jimmie Foxx and Joe DiMaggio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Self-critique: Hall of Fame golfer Lee Trevino, on the state of
his game:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying my golf game went bad, but if I grew tomatoes,
they'd come up sliced."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yo, Trojans: LaVell Edwards, when he was football coach at Brigham
Young, was asked by a reporter if he preferred speed or quickness in
his wide receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have both, but if they had both, they'd be at the
University of Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four is enough: Senior PGA pro Bruce Crampton is known as a man of
few words.</TE>
<TE>   At a pro-am, his amateur partner introduced herself and said, "A
friend of mine bet me $10 that you wouldn't say five words to me all
day. You will talk to me, won't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Crampton's reply: "Sorry, lady. You lose."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second thoughts: Said Janice Hough of Palo Alto in the San
Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we have misjudged Sebastian Janikowski. All this
speculation about what drugs and/or alcohol might have caused his
spill on the dance floor in October. It could have been a pretzel."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1960, boxing's original "Golden Boy,"
Art Aragon, announced his retirement. A knockout loss to Alvaro
Gutierrez on Jan. 21 at the Olympic Auditorium was responsible for
his decision to end his 17-year career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 112,376 for the Dallas Cowboys-Houston Oilers in a
Mexico City exhibition in 1994. The Super Bowl record is 103,985 for
the 1980 game at the Rose Bowl when Pittsburgh defeated the L.A.
Rams, 31-19.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The cheers were loud for James Stewart, Mike LaRocco
and Jeremy McGrath at the Edison Field supercross, but the loudest
may have been for a girl peewee rider on the victory stand.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank my daddy, my daddy's girlfriend and my mother,"
she said innocently.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is nearing the end of its football recruiting season, with
linebacker Wesley Walker of La Puente Bishop Amat becoming the
Bruins' 24th commitment.</LD>
<LD>   Schools are allowed to bring in no more than 25 scholarship
players in one year, but UCLA could end up asking a player or two to
defer their enrollment until January 2003 if any late-deciding
prospects pick the Bruins. Student Sports magazine has UCLA ranked
No. 3 in the recruiting race behind No. 1 Texas and Ohio State.</LD>
<LD>   The first day seniors can sign a letter of intent is Feb. 6....</LD>
<TE>   Running back Lorenzo Booker of Ventura St. Bonaventure has a new
suitor in San Diego State, where Tom Craft has taken over the
program. Craft, hired in December, was the offensive coordinator from
1994-96 when Marshall Faulk starred for the Aztecs. St. Bonaventure
offensive coordinator Tim Gutierrez, who has compared Booker to
Faulk, was a San Diego State quarterback then. Booker, who has
visited Florida State, Washington and Notre Dame, and plans to visit
USC, could not be reached for comment. Representatives from all five
schools have visited St. Bonaventure this week. "It's been crazy,"
Coach Jon Mack said. "Lorenzo doesn't have a free minute." ...</TE>
<TE>   USC has landed Indio linebacker Oscar Lua, who said he will sign
with the Trojans because he will be allowed to play baseball, too....</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back A.J. Martinez of Huntington Beach Edison enjoyed
his recruiting trip to San Diego State last weekend. He could play
football and baseball for the Aztecs. He's visiting Hawaii this
weekend with teammate Denny Flanagan, a receiver. Fresno State also
has entered the recruiting competition for Flanagan....</TE>
<TE>   Keith Howell, an All-Foothill League defensive back and receiver
at Newhall Hart, has committed to Harvard. Running back Tristan
Walker of Claremont has committed to Colorado State....</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita, ranked No. 1 by The Times in girls' soccer, had
three players commit to four-year schools. Sweeper Daniella Bosio is
headed to Pepperdine, stopper Tricia Regan to Colorado and fullback
Becca Mildrew to Harvard....</TE>
<TE>   Randy Poggio, a three-year varsity soccer player at Santa Ana
Mater Dei who has 22 goals this season, has committed to San Jose
State.</TE>

<LD>Chad Prewitt scored 22 points and Curtis Millage had 19, and Arizona
State ended a five-year drought against Arizona on Wednesday night
with an 88-72 victory over the 10th-ranked Wildcats at Tempe, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   The Sun Devils (11-7, 4-5 Pacific 10 Conference), who shot 54%,
beat a nationally ranked opponent for the first time in 24 tries in

<LD>   They were 0-10 against Arizona--0-6 under Evans--since sweeping
the Wildcats in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona (13-5, 6-3) had rallied from 21 points down to beat Oregon
State and 20 down to beat UCLA, but those comebacks were in Tucson.
The Wildcats couldn't pull it off in the hostile atmosphere of Wells
Fargo Arena, which was filled to near-capacity.</TE>

second. The Wildcats never got closer than 11 after that.</TE>

lost for the eighth time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Georgia 81, Arkansas 67--Jarvis Hayes had 21 points at

for the Huskies (13-3, 6-0 Big East) at Storrs, Conn.</TE>

<LD>John Savage spent the last 18 months helping to design everything
from UC Irvine's baseball facility to the Anteaters' uniforms.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night the coach who was selected to resurrect Irvine's
program finally puts his team on the field for the school's first
game since dropping the sport after the 1992 season because of budget
cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The Anteaters play San Diego in a nonconference matchup that opens
the college season in the Southland and is expected to draw a sellout
crowd.</LD>
<TE>   "We're inexperienced and young, but I think we'll be competitive,"
said Savage, a former assistant at USC and Nevada who is regarded as
one of the top recruiters in the nation. "Hopefully, we'll grow up in
a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   There are 21 freshmen, 12 juniors and one sophomore listed on
Irvine's roster. The Anteaters will compete in the Big West
Conference. Brett Smith, a pitcher and designated hitter from La
Habra Sonora High, is one of Irvine's top freshmen. Among the juniors
are catcher Chris Miller, a transfer from Cuesta College, and
left-hander Sean Tracey (Citrus College) and right-hander Paul French
(Sacramento City College).</TE>
<TE>   To ease the maturation process for his team, Savage scheduled 14
consecutive home games to start the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that anyone in Southern California, or in the
nation for that matter, believes that Irvine is going to be anything
less than very, very competitive--and maybe more--in its first
season," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a look at the other Division I teams in the Southland:</TE>
<TE>   USC</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 45-19, 18-6 in the Pacific 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, ranked fourth by Baseball America, open Feb. 8 at
Long Beach State and will play their first 23 games on the road or at
neutral sites as renovations at Dedeaux Field are completed. The
Trojans will play a three-game series against Baylor at Dodger
Stadium on Feb. 15-17.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Mark Prior is now the property of the Chicago Cubs after
producing one of the most dominant seasons in college baseball
history. The Trojans also lost Rik Currier, but they still have
plenty of pitching and enough offense to challenge for their third
consecutive trip to the College World Series. Junior right-hander
Anthony Reyes (5-4, 3.72 earned-run average) is projected as a
possible first-round draft choice. After another outstanding summer
in the Cape Cod League, junior right-hander Chad Clark (4-2, 6.39) is
expected to join the rotation. Sophomore left-hander Fraser Dizard
(3-3, 5.44) is another top prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Senior outfielder Brian Barre (.345, 13 home runs), junior catcher
Alberto Concepcion (.321), junior second baseman Anthony Lunetta
(.305) and sophomore third baseman/shortstop Michael Moon (.313) give
the Trojans an experienced nucleus. Third baseman Joey Metropoulos
and left-handed pitchers J.P. Howell and Matt Chico are the top
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 30-27, 9-15 in Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins expect to improve on last season's finish, but it will
be a challenge with a schedule that includes five of last season's
eight College World Series participants, including road series at
Tulane and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Junior left-hander Mike Kunes (3-2, 3.55) and junior right-hander
Kevin Jerkens (3-2, 5.00) are probably the most experienced members
of the pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Junior outfielder Ben Francisco (.309) and sophomore utility man
Brandon Averill (.333) are top performers on offense.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Wes Whisler and infielder Chris Jensen are freshmen
who could start. Outfielder Chad Concolino, a transfer from
Saddleback College, is another top newcomer.</TE>
<TE>   CAL STATE FULLERTON</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 48-18, 14-4 in Big West.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans, ranked 15th, are aiming for their second consecutive
trip to the College World Series despite the loss of right-hander
Kirk Saarloos, left-hander Jon Smith and their entire starting
infield.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Darric Merrell (8-4, 2.95) emerged as one of the
nation's top pitchers at last year's World Series, and sophomore Chad
Cordero (3-4, 1.83, 14 saves) is one of the top returning closers.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Stringfellow (.345) returns in the outfield and Jason
Corapci and Mike Martinez are regarded as outstanding defensive
players at second base and third base, respectively. David Munoz will
start at shortstop after transferring from Biola, where he batted
.372 with 12 homers.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton opens Feb. 1 at top-ranked Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   LONG BEACH STATE</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 35-23, 11-7 in Big West.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weathers takes over as coach of the 49ers, succeeding Dave
Snow, who retired after building Long Beach State into a national
power.</TE>
<TE>   Weathers was head coach at Chapman College from 1984-91 before
joining the Long Beach staff as an assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Jeremy Reed is one of the top players in the Big West
Conference. Reed played first base last season and batted .348 with
40 runs batted in and 23 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   He batted a team-best .366 for Team USA last summer and will move
to center field this season for the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Josh Alliston (2-3, 3.44) has saved 10 games in each
of the last two seasons and will move into the rotation this season.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach opens Feb. 8 against USC and will travel to Louisiana
State in March and Miami in April.</TE>
<TE>   CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 34-22, 9-9 in Big West.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors, ranked 22nd, are expected to challenge for the
conference title with a team that has six starting position players
and its entire starting rotation back.</TE>
<TE>   Senior first baseman Tim Arroyo (.365, 12 HR, 64 RBIs), junior
designated hitter Adam Nikolic (.357) and junior outfielder Eric
Verbryke (.300) lead the offense. Senior left-hander Andy Davidson
(8-4, 3.30), junior left-hander Bill Murphy (10-4, 4.12) and junior
Kameron Loe (5-1, 3.08) are the top pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge opens Feb. 1 at San Francisco and will participate in a
tournament with Oklahoma State, Delaware and San Diego at Shreveport,
La., later in the month.</TE>
<TE>   UC RIVERSIDE</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 19-35.</TE>
<TE>   The Highlanders will compete in the Big West after playing as an
independent last season. Coach Jack Smitheran is expected to achieve
a milestone in preconference play when he wins his 1,000th game.
Smitheran is 993-701-3 in 29 years at Riverside and won Division II
titles in 1977 and 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Jim Anderson (.292) is regarded as one of the best catchers
in the Big West. Junior outfielder Brian Wahlbrink (.297) and senior
outfielder Adam Seuss (.290) also return.</TE>
<TE>   Junior right-hander Julio Fernandez (6-6, 4.84) and sophomore
left-hander Drew Murphy (3-1, 6.47) are the top returning pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside opens Feb. 1 against Cal State San Bernardino and will
play road series at Oklahoma and Washington and in a tournament in
Hawaii in March.</TE>
<TE>   UC SANTA BARBARA</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 40-17, 12-6 in Big West.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos are hoping to build on last season, when they advanced
to the NCAA playoffs for the first time since 1996 and won 40 or more
games for the first time since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Ten players from that team signed pro contracts, but junior
outfielder Ryan Spilborghs (.375) returns to the Gauchos. Senior
right-hander James Garcia (10-4, 3.10) and sophomore right-hander
Matt Vasquez (5-4, 3.95) lead the pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara opens Jan. 31 against Loyola Marymount and will play
in the Las Vegas tournament in February.</TE>
<TE>   LOYOLA MARYMOUNT</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 21-37, 8-22 in West Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions experienced a reversal of fortune last season as they
struggled to offset the loss of several high-round draft choices from
the 2000 season. First baseman Kris Zacuto (.333, 42 RBIs) is the top
returning position player.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore left-hander Josh Muecke (5-7, 6.07), sophomore
right-hander Vince Cordova (3-4, 5.23) and junior left-hander Nick
Lovato, who was 2-4 with an 8.31 ERA at Cal State Fullerton last
season, lead the pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola opens Jan. 31 at Santa Barbara and will play road series at
Texas, Arizona State and Mississippi State.</TE>
<TE>   PEPPERDINE</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 42-18, 25-5 in WCC.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves advanced to a regional at USC last season and should
contend for another playoff berth despite the loss of pitcher Noah
Lowry, a first-round draft pick, and Daniel Haren, a second-round
pick.</TE>
<TE>   Junior right-hander Greg Ramirez (5-4, 4.95) is the top returning
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Senior left-hander Kevin Beavers (2-2, 3.45) and sophomore
right-handers Jacob Barrack (4-1, 6.75) and Brandon Boesch (0-1,
4.97) will also be counted on.</TE>
<TE>   Senior catcher Rock Mills (.307) and outfielder Chris Kelly (.269)
are experienced position players and shortstop Kevin Estrada, a
senior transfer from Florida who batted .351 last season, is a strong
addition.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine has been moved from the West to the Coast division of
the West Coast Conference this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves open against Nevada on Feb. 1. They will play in Hawaii
in February.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Face the Fax: 10 Offered for Trade</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Gauthier's letter to the league's 29 other teams
details Anaheim's intent to trade key players before March 19
deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is undoubtedly any number of Mighty Duck players who would
welcome a fresh start with a team in better shape then the Ducks. but
only 10 are being offered for reprieves at this point.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks came with in three seconds of a victory in regulation
Wednesday before Minnesota's Marian Gaborik fired a shot that went
off goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere's pad to force overtime. They then
won the game when Keith Carney chipped in a shot with 58 seconds left
in overtime for a 3-2 victory in front of 9,511 at the Arrowhead
Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Leclerc and German Titov scored to give the Ducks one-goal
leads.</LD>
<TE>   The victory ended a four-game losing streak by the Ducks, who
moved five points ahead of the Columbus Blue Jackets in the race to
stay out of last place in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   But some lucky Ducks may not be around to try to hold off the Blue
Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Pierre Gauthier recently sent a fax to general
managers of the other 29 NHL teams listing 10 players in the
organization the Ducks would be willing discuss trading, according to
a source.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jason York, right wing Marty McInnis, goalie Steve
Shields, center Matt Cullen, defenseman Pavel Trnka and defenseman
Niclas Havelid were the among the players dangled. But before any of
them start getting excited about being traded, takers have yet to
step up.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier has repeatedly said the Ducks are close to being a
playoff team. But the inclusion of York, McInnis and Cullen would
seem to be a move to a rebuild mode.</TE>
<TE>   The trade deadline is March 19. York and McInnis are veterans that
could be of interest to teams making playoff runs, but both are
having off-seasons and both have two years remaining on multi-million
dollar contracts.</TE>
<TE>   York signed a three-year, $6-million contract as a free agent last
summer and it hoped he would provide offense from the blue line.
Gauthier said that York was he was a key piece in a rebuilt defense.
But York has been bothered by tendinitis in his right shoulder and
has struggled defensively and offensively, with four goals and 16
points.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis signed a three-year, $5-million contract extension last
season and has been a consistent player on the second line. But he
has labored this season and has only two goals in his last 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen has been touted as one of the Ducks' up-and-coming young
players. But his second-half fades have become worrisome. He has one
goal and four points in the last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Shields, a restricted free agent after this season, has played
well, but the Ducks have depth at the goalie spot, making him
expendable. Havelid is still recovering from knee surgery and has
been a healthy scratch the last four games. Trnka has been solid, but
apparently is not considered essential.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, an offensively challenged bunch, had scored 25 goals in
their 14 previous games. But they caught a break to take a 1-0 lead
12:08 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc circled behind the net, then flip a shot into the crease.
Wild defenseman Benysek knocked the puck in with his stick, giving
him as many or more goals for the Ducks this season as five Anaheim
players.</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, Richard Park chipped in a rebound with one
second left on a Duck penalty to tie the score at 13:21. Titov
answered two minutes later, as Cullen and McInnis made slick passes
to set him up with an open net.</TE>

<HD>Enforcer Sawyer Is Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enforcer Kevin Sawyer was surprised Wednesday to receive a two-game
suspension for charging King goalie Felix Potvin during Monday's
game.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second suspension this season for Sawyer, who sat out
five games in December after running Calgary goalie Mike Vernon in a
fight-filled game Dec. 8.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Potvin went behind the net to retrieve the puck and
Sawyer skated in and dropped him. Sawyer received a five-minute
charging penalty.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm angry about it, to be quite honest, that I have sit another
two games in NHL," Sawyer said. "This is different than Calgary. I
didn't expect five, but I expected something [after that game]. I'm
angry about this, but it's the same old thing, I'll accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer and Coach Bryan Murray said that there was no intention to
hit Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "The normal goaltender is taught go in and return the puck where
it came from," Murray said. "Felix picked the puck up, turned and
opened up. Kevin doesn't stop very well and got a piece of him."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer is second in the NHL with 175 penalty minutes.</TE>

<HD>Bonita's Streak Ended</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonita High is streaky clean no more.</LD>
<LD>   The Bearcats had their 96-game winning streak in the Valle Vista
League ended Tuesday night in a 0-0 tie with San Dimas.</LD>
<LD>   The streak dated to the middle of the 1994-95 season, when the
Valle Vista League was formed, and stands as the Southern Section
record. Whittier La Serna is second with 61 from 1994-2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Bearcats (21-1-1, 8-0-1 in league), led offensively by
forwards Lisa Jensen and Lindsay Duke, outshot the Saints, but to no
avail. San Dimas played a physical game and converged in front of the
goalmouth at every opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Bonita Coach Bob Phillippe, whose team's only loss has been to St.
Lucy's in the Claremont tournament championship game, said his
players were disappointed with the tie but reacted well to the
streak's end.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be," Phillippe
said. "Our girls played hard. The score wasn't that way without
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "And you have to give credit to San Dimas. They left their hearts
out there on the field. They blocked the goal, and they kicked the
ball out of bounds a lot. But they did what they had to do, and they
were happy not to lose."</TE>
<TE>   So were the Bearcats, who still have a league unbeaten streak, now
at 97 games. La Serna holds the Southern Section record for league
unbeaten streaks at 111 set from 1991-00.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tenacious D: Ayala has a leg up in the Sierra League race after
the Bulldogs (12-5-2, 4-0) defeated defending-champion Diamond Bar,
1-0, last week, followed by the Brahmas' 3-0 victory over St. Lucy's.</TE>
<TE>   "St. Lucy's overlooked them," Ayala Coach Jeff Allen said. "This
is just what we wanted. It really helps to get that jump, with your
momentum, your confidence, everything."</TE>
<TE>   Ayala has done it primarily with defense.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers Karen Bardsley and Veronica Simonton have combined for
nine shutouts this season. Only one goal, given up by Simonton
against Nogales, had been surrendered in league play going into a
game Wednesday against St. Lucy's.</TE>
<TE>   Bardsley, a senior who will play at Cal State Fullerton next
season, and Simonton, a junior, have split time equally in the nets,
with Simonton starting and Bardsley playing the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "They go half and half, and they're awesome about it," Allen said.
"They handle it great."</TE>
<TE>   Simonton gets to start after playing in place of Bardsley last
year. Bardsley broke her left tibia as a sophomore and endured a
difficult recovery that sidelined her for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "It atrophied and I had to rehabilitate it all season," said
Bardsley, who doesn't mind sharing the workload.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't bug me at all, as long as I get to play."</TE>

<TE>   Marked improvement: La Verne Lutheran's 4-7-3 record, including a
1-4 mark in the San Joaquin League, may look unsightly, but to the
Trojans, it's not too bad.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when they consider last season. Lutheran, then a
freelance team in its first season, finished 0-13.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had only one goal, by Brittney Hafer in the
second-to-last game against Rolling Hills Prep.</TE>

<HD>Memo to Mike Is a Find</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On paper, Memo To Mike looks like one of the better claims of the
21-day-old Santa Anita meet.</LD>
<LD>   Debuting against $40,000 California-bred maidens Jan. 5, the
gelded son of Memo had early trouble in the field of 12, but moved up
into a perfect position around the turn under jockey David Flores,
swung to the outside in the stretch and kicked away to win by two
lengths. He completed the 61/2 furlongs in 1:162/5.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Ed and Natalie Friendly and trained by Richard Matlow
that day, Memo To Mike was taken by Dave Hofmans for the Legacy Ranch
and he will make his first start for his new connections in today's
opener at Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   Running against six opponents, Memo To Mike drew the outside post
and will be favored to remain unbeaten in the $26,000 starter
allowance race at seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   A race later, another California-bred of promise also will be
trying for his second victory in as many starts.</TE>
<TE>   Got The Message, who is also by Memo, will have only five
opponents as he seeks another victory for the Jacoby Family Trust and
leading trainer Bill Spawr.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the mare Miss Fuddy Duddy, which makes him a half-brother
to the stakes-winning mare Enjoy The Moment, Got The Message overcame
a bad start to beat maidens by four lengths under Laffit Pincay Jr.
His opponents today are Sombrio, who beat maiden claimers at 19-1 in
his first race on New Year's Eve; Gobi Dan, who was second in last
month's California Breeders' Champion Stakes; Vito Corleone, who was
fourth in that same race, and Green Team, who has one win in nine
starts while primarily racing in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Swiss Miss, a veteran mare who won last Friday,
is back in a hurry in today's seventh, an optional claimer at one
mile on the turf. Other notables in a wide-open race include Rhiana,
La Picara, Dynamous, Dynamistic and Walts Wharf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Gary Stevens. The rider won with all three of his
mounts Monday and nearly doubled his victory output at the meet. The
only mount he was named on today was Stetson Lady, who was scratched
Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Thunder Twice. The Thunder Gulch gelding, who will be a
longshot in today's eighth, is winless in 33.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Memo To Mike, using Got
The Message and Sombrio in the second and Dolfikar, Indiahoma, Prize
Giving and Rail Man in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 2/60. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $13/$393. Total money bet: $360.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Road Stops Sure Seem to Help</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Kings play the Minnesota Wild tonight at Staples Center, it
will be the 13th time in 24 home games that they've played a team
that had to play elsewhere the night before, usually at Anaheim, as
in this case.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings are 6-4-2 in those games, 4-5-1-1 in other home games.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if there's any real distinct advantage," Coach Andy
Murray said. "These guys are in such good shape. And quite often the
teams have come through Anaheim feeling pretty good about themselves.
We're a lot further ahead if they're coming in from Phoenix or
Colorado or San Jose or Vancouver."</LD>
<TE>   Actually, the Kings are 0-2-1 against teams that played at San
Jose the night before they played the Kings. They're 0-0-1 against
the team that played at Phoenix, and they're 6-2 against the teams
that played at Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   After tonight, the Kings play six more home games against teams
that will play elsewhere the night before, four coming from Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray, on the two-game suspension given to Kevin Sawyer of the
Ducks for decking King goaltender Felix Potvin in Monday night's
game: "I don't ever like to see a player get suspended ... but what
he did was wrong. It was a stupid play."</TE>
<TE>   Of the high stick by Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski that cut
Craig Johnson's right eye, Murray said: "I'm sure it was accidental."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger, sidelined since suffering a sprained left wrist
Jan. 15, will be told next week if he needs surgery to repair
ligament damage. Surgery would sideline him an additional six to
eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In practice Wednesday, a high stick by Kelly Buchberger opened a
cut on Brad Chartrand's face that required six stitches. Later, Ian
Laperriere got in the way of a puck off Chartrand's stick, opening a
cut on his nose that needed 10 stitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, he's married," Murray said of Laperriere. "His looks
don't matter."</TE>

<HD>O'Neal's Mood Mellows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal skipped the pregame media pleasantries for an 11th
consecutive day, allowing, "I'm still angry," though not really
looking it.</LD>
<LD>   A possible reason for O'Neal's gradual mood thaw: He told
teammates his ailing big toe is feeling better, in part because of a
new carbon-type plate in his shoe.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal experiences pain when his arthritic toe is bent back. The
plate, put on the bottom of the right shoe, stabilizes the toe, which
also is wrapped heavily before practices and games.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The playing time comes and goes for Derek Fisher, who in the last
10 days has played 21 minutes and 42 minutes and parts in between.</TE>
<TE>   As Phil Jackson continues to scrounge for back-court minutes for
Mitch Richmond, Lindsey Hunter and, sometimes, Brian Shaw, Fisher
attempts to maintain his shooting touch. So, he misses seven of nine
threes Tuesday night against Denver, six days after making five of
eight, eight days after making seven of 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as more about the bigger picture," Fisher said. "He's
won two championships with me and Kobe [Bryant] and Shaq and all of
us, and in some situations he wants to find out what Mitch Richmond
can do for us, and Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's learning more about those new guys."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he sometimes sees a bad streak coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a rhythm basketball player, a flow player," he said. "The
good thing about last year was coming back and playing 36 minutes a
night. I got into a good rhythm quickly and stayed in that rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker crowds have been typically subdued lately. Perhaps they,
too, are waiting for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Staples is a great place for people of L.A. to come and
meet and greet each other and have a nice time and talk to each
other," Jackson said. "If people yell, they may not be able to
converse with each other. No, I mean, the crowd was here to be
entertained [Tuesday] night [against Denver], not to encourage our
basketball team. And that's OK.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we're the ones who are supposed to provide that spark for
the team. But it was not a partisan crowd."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The trade deadline is Feb. 21 and the phones are starting to ring
in general managers' offices around the NBA. Like everyone else, the
Clippers are listening. "We're not trying to trade any of our
players, and I know that for a fact," Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"That's not to say we're not going to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The simple fact is that the Clippers, the league's youngest team
with an average age of 24.8 years, are not in a position to trade for
a player who could help bring them a championship. Or at least get
them deep into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be a championship team," Gentry said. "But we have so
many young guys that we have to grow into that. Patience has to be
the key word. It's not going to happen overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making strides. It's a work in progress. I think we've all
got to understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Tearing up the team's roster at midseason simply doesn't fit into
the big picture for the Clippers. Gentry is pleased with the strides
the team has made since the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a better team, but so are a lot of other teams," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Improving their 3-14 road record is Gentry's top priority. "We've
played well at home, we've been competitive at home," he said. "We
have to try to find a way to do it on the road. If we're going to be
taken seriously as a playoff contender, we have to find a way to do
it on the road.""Am I happy? Somewhat. The whole thing with us is
it's a maturation process. It will take time. I think our young guys
are getting better. We have the makings of a good basketball team
here. We're making strides."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Win Round Three</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After losing first two games to city
rivals, L.A. rebounds from halftime deficit for a 95-90 victory over
Lakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was as dull as your average morning shootaround. Well, maybe not
an average Clipper shootaround, but you get the idea.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers and Lakers played such polite basketball Wednesday
that you would swear you heard them saying, "Beg your pardon" as they
went through the motions.</LD>
<LD>   Then Corey Maggette went to work on Kobe Bryant in the third
quarter, and a decidedly pro-Clipper sellout crowd of 20,309 was up
and roaring its approval. Finally, there was something worth getting
excited about.</LD>
<TE>   Maggette torched Bryant for 18 points in the third quarter and the
Clippers roared past the Lakers, taking a 95-90 victory from their
suddenly sluggish co-tenants at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's loss was the Lakers' second in as many games and fifth
in their last seven. The Clippers have won two in a row and are 19-7
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has been struggling defensively lately, failing to stop
Maggette, Voshon Lenard of Denver, Wally Szczerbiak of Minnesota and
Ron Mercer of Chicago in recent games.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette scored on long-range jump shots, including four
three-point baskets, and on free throws. By game's end, Maggette had
28 points to 27 for Bryant. Elton Brand added 25 points, taking apart
Samaki Walker, his Laker counterpart at power forward. Shaquille
O'Neal had 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make Kobe Bryant defend a little bit," Clipper guard
Jeff McInnis said. "We know if he's allowed to relax on defense and
concentrate on playing offense only, he can go for 40 points every
night. He wasn't the same after that. I don't know if he was tired or
what, but he wasn't the same."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' first victory over the Lakers in three games this
season was tempered by news that forward Lamar Odom's injured right
wrist will be put in a cast today.</TE>
<TE>   Odom sat out his third consecutive game because of his wrist, an
injury suffered Dec. 16 and aggravated during the team's six-game
trip that ended last week. It's possible Odom could be out until
after the All-Star game Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers soldiered on without their most versatile player, but
seemed content to tag along behind the Lakers for most of Wednesday's
game. They were never really buried, but seldom within striking
distance.</TE>
<TE>   The end was far different from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant took off after one Clipper miss late in the first half,
slowed to receive the outlet pass, then all but walked to the hoop to
drop in a layup. No monster jam. It was merely an old-school hoop
that almost everyone in the sellout crowd could have duplicated.</TE>
<TE>   But it underscored the ease with which the Lakers edged away from
the Clippers right before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had drawn within 36-33 after center Michael
Olowokandi dunked Earl Boykins' missed jump shot. Olowokandi and
Brand were about all the Clippers had going for them in the first
half, but they were still in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Lakers took control.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George made a three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant made a jumper, then another.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal drove to the basket for an easy hoop.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored on his slow break.</TE>
<TE>   After Brand's jump shot from the wing, Bryant countered with a
jumper.</TE>
<TE>   At the half, the Lakers led, 49-35.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant tiptoed his way to 18 points and George added 10 in a
reserve role by halftime. George played more than he might have if
the Lakers had a healthy Robert Horry, but Horry sat out because of a
cramp in his right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi had 12 points and Brand 10 by the half, but no other
Clipper had more than five.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers depend so much on the energy they receive from
reserves Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles that they often increase
leads (or cut into deficits) when their second unit is on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Clippers faltered when their subs entered.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' 13-2 run to end the half gave them a 14-point lead
going into the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then Maggette took over.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Concerned but Not Panicking</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: As unexplainable losses mount, Kupchak
won't rule out trade and calls upcoming trip critical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson, swept in soothing blue on Wednesday night, stuck his
hands in his pockets and leaned back.</LD>
<LD>   His expression said he's sure he was born for such occasions, when
all around him are hemorrhaging their soothing blue, when the Lakers
couldn't beat a last-place team no matter how lousy, when everyone's
wondering why he just doesn't do something, for the love of Naismith,
and three-peat this instant.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, the general manager had observed, "He's had bigger
challenges," and then admitted he'd investigate a trade if things
don't change in the weeks leading to the Feb. 21 deadline.</LD>
<TE>   After all, schizophrenia might make for a beautiful mind, but it's
hell on the home-court advantage, and you can see what it does to a
man-to-man defense.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Kupchak said Wednesday that the coming trip--five games in
five cities beginning Sunday at Philadelphia--would be critical to
his sense of comfort in this team going into the final two months of
the regular season. While he insisted he would not be rushed into a
trade over a month of spotty results, neither would he ignore
unfathomable losses.</TE>
<TE>   "In our business," Kupchak said, "the next important date that
comes to mind is the trade deadline."</TE>
<TE>   This was easier to take, maybe, back when the next punch was more
likely to be thrown at a teammate than a foe, when the Lakers would
lose to the bubble gum on the bottom of their shoes because of Shaq
and Kobe and, well, you know. That was last year, and this, this is
just odd. They could use an athletic defender and a weighty back-up
for Shaquille O'Neal, but those aren't cheap or necessarily
available.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the group," Kupchak said. "We feel they'll work their way
through it."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he said, "I'm not going to rule out [a trade],
either."</TE>
<TE>   Since they were 16-1, when at least a few Lakers described
themselves as capable of breaking the Chicago Bulls' record of 72
wins if not necessarily likely to do it, the Lakers are 12-10. They
have endured lifeless home losses to Seattle, Toronto, Miami and, in
the worst yet, Denver on Tuesday night, by 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably the issue at hand," Kupchak said. "Our
concentration seems to wander."</TE>
<TE>   There aren't two nights in a decade in which that Nugget team is
16 points better than this Laker team on this home floor.</TE>
<TE>   But it happened, and Jackson sighed, and then he said, "Basketball
just turns on a trifle."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 28-11, three victories better than they were at the
same time last season, but about seven losses worse than could be
expected by now. In their last nine losses, all since Dec. 7, the
Lakers have allowed a field-goal percentage of 46.6. In the other 30
games, they allowed a shooting percentage of 40.4.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only alarming because it could mean something at the end of
the year," Kupchak said of home-floor games in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   So, it turns on defense, which turns on effort, which turns on
interest.</TE>
<TE>   And that, as it happens, turns on Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "You grow tremendously as a basketball team when the dust settles
and the players figure these things out for themselves," he said.
"Not what my imposed nature could be on this team, by restricting or
curtailing these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has two ways to take this. The Lakers had a lousy regular
season last year and won their second consecutive championship, so
there's no reason to change a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Or, the Lakers had a lousy regular season last year, were
fortunate enough to get hot at the end, and now think they can
rediscover the same passion when April 1 rolls around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of what can we do to get better, not about the fact
we're in the same rut we were in last year," he said. "As if [to
believe], 'Obviously when the time comes we'll be able to step it up
a different notch and go ahead like we did last year.' That's not
what we're trying to do, is replay last year. It's, 'Let's try to
find a way to be a better basketball club.' And, whatever it takes
during this period of time, we'll do it. Whether it takes less
shooting, less practice, more practice, more shooting, different
styles of shoot-arounds, whatever it takes, let's play up to our
potential."</TE>
<TE>   It's about them. They know it's about them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing about our opponents that's causing our problems,"
point guard Derek Fisher said. "You get concerned when you're getting
beat and you can't do anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a sense of, not exactly 'Wait 'til April,' but we
knew we have that ability. I mean, we're the ones trying to do this
for the third time in a row. Nobody else is."</TE>

<HD>Sprewell Stops Knicks' Slide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latrell Sprewell ended New York's misery.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell had 35 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and
the Knicks halted their eight-game losing streak with a 96-92 victory
over the Raptors on Wednesday night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell, scoreless in New York's 43-point loss to Charlotte on
Monday, held Vince Carter to 18 points. Sprewell was 13 for 25 from
the field to help the Knicks end their longest skid in 15 seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a tough stretch for us, so hopefully we can learn from the
way we played tonight," Sprewell said. "I wasn't happy. I was really
disappointed with the way that we lost as a team. I just didn't want
any letdowns like that again."</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Williams had 23 points and Antonio Davis had 21 for the
Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Knick President Scott Layden refused to say
whether Coach Don Chaney could be in danger of losing his job. The
Knicks are 5-16 since Chaney replaced Jeff Van Gundy.</TE>
<TE>   "They really stepped it up," Chaney said. "They played aggressive
and they fought."</TE>
<TE>   After former Knick Chris Childs missed a three-point shot,
Sprewell made a three-point play on a tough running jumper, giving
New York a 95-88 lead with 1:18 left.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a basket," said Sprewell, who pumped his fist after
making the shot. "Once it went down I felt it was important to make
the free throw to put pressure on them."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 104, Minnesota 83--Jerry Stackhouse scored 18 of his
season-high 40 points in the third quarter and the Pistons surprised
the Timberwolves at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota lost for only the second time in 13 games, committing a
season-high 24 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson scored 20 for Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 98, Indiana 94--Erick Strickland scored a season-high 22
points and Vitaly Potapenko had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the
Celtics at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time in the last 113 games that someone
other than Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce led the Celtics in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Anderson and Potapenko scored the final 11 points for
Boston. Anderson had 17 points and eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose scored five consecutive points to pull the Pacers
within 92-91 with two minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Miller had 26 points for Indiana, Rose had 20 and Jermaine
O'Neal had 19.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 111, Seattle 101--David Wesley scored 21 points and
Baron Davis had 20 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds to lead the
Hornets at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Baker and Gary Payton each scored 24 points and Rashard Lewis
had 22 for the SuperSonics, who trailed by 27 points in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 98, Utah 92--Steve Smith made five three-point shots
and scored 29 points, including 18 in the second quarter, to spark
the Spurs at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 26 points to give San Antonio its eighth
consecutive victory against the Jazz, which pulled within 90-88 with
two minutes to play on a jumper by Karl Malone.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs were 10 for 10 in free throws in the fourth quarter and
28 for 29 overall. They were 10 for 18 (55%) from three-point range
and 30 for 57 (52%) from the field, but became the first NBA team not
to have an offensive rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Malone had 23 points and 10 rebounds, John Amaechi scored a
season-high 18 and Andre Kirilenko had 16.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 107, Memphis 95--Antawn Jamison scored 30 points for
Golden State at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Fortson and Erick Dampier each had double-doubles for the
Warriors, who won for only the second time in their last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Fortson had 15 points and 12 rebounds and Dampier had 10 points
and 10 rebounds. Larry Hughes scored 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Pau Gasol recorded his 16th double-double, the most by any rookie
this season, with 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Grizzlies.</TE>

<HD>Tyson Issues an Apology for Fracas</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Tyson, facing a licensing hearing in Nevada for his April 6 bout
against Lennox Lewis, issued an apology through a publicist for
initiating a brawl that ended Tuesday's news conference in New York
before it even started.</LD>
<LD>   "There was obviously miscommunication between our camps, with
regards to the faceoff and chaos broke out," said the Tyson
statement. "After our skirmish, I was provoked by a member of the
audience who was shouting obscenities directed at me and I defended
myself as I saw fit. In the process, I said things that may have
offended members of the audience. To those people, I offer my
apologies.</LD>
<LD>   "As I mentioned previously, I came to New York to promote a fight
that I want and boxing fans want to see. I am not a role model or Mr.
Politically Correct. I am a boxer and, from now on, I will let my
boxing do the talking for me."</LD>
<TE>   Said Gary Shaw, Lewis' promoter: "I'm glad that Mike saw fit to
apologize. I hope that nothing like this ever happens again."</TE>
<TE>   When Tyson and Lewis approached each other Tuesday on the stage of
the Hudson Theater in the Millennium Hotel, Tyson rushed forward,
only to be stopped by a Lewis bodyguard. Tyson took a swing at the
bodyguard, Lewis took a swing at Tyson and a melee ensued.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' handlers claim Tyson bit the heavyweight champion on one
leg.</TE>
<TE>   After relative calm was restored, a member of the media shouted,
"Put [Tyson] in a straitjacket," eliciting an expletive-laced
response from Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   World Boxing Council President Jose Sulaiman, who fell and hit his
head during the brawl, revealed Wednesday that he had suffered a mild
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   But Sulaiman was able to attend a news conference Wednesday for
Saturday's welterweight title match at Madison Square Garden between
Shane Mosley and Vernon Forrest.</TE>

<HD>Douglas Hit With $35,000 Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia defensive end Hugh Douglas was fined $35,000 by the NFL
on Wednesday for the hit that knocked Chicago quarterback Jim Miller
out of last weekend's playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas plans to appeal the penalty.</LD>
<LD>   "The refs didn't call it and I don't think it's fair," Douglas
said. "That is how we have always been coached, that he's fair game.
I don't understand. He was right in front of me. I felt he was trying
to get around me to try and make the tackle and I blocked him.</LD>
<TE>   "In any other situation, a quarterback never moves. They run out
of bounds or get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia plays at St. Louis in the NFC championship game on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Miller separated his right shoulder during the second quarter of
the Bears' 33-19 loss to the Eagles when Douglas blocked him after he
threw an interception. Miller was replaced by Shane Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Washington, the NFL's director of football operations, said
Douglas violated a rule that prohibits a defender from contacting a
quarterback until he becomes an active pursuer on a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fullback Howard Griffith has told the Denver Broncos he's retiring
because of neck injury that forced him to miss the 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith spent 11 years in the NFL and played on Denver's Super
Bowl championship teams in 1997 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He was drafted by Indianapolis in 1991 and was on the Buffalo
Bills' and San Diego Chargers' practice squads in 1991-92. He played
two seasons each for the Carolina Panthers and L.A. Rams before
joining the Broncos in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith was the only fullback in NFL history to block for five
single-season 1,000-yard rushers: Terrell Davis, Olandis Gary and
Mike Anderson of the Broncos; Jerome Bettis of the Rams and Anthony
Johnson of the Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Ram offensive tackle Ryan Tucker, who missed Sunday's
victory over the Green Bay Packers because of a sprained ankle, said
he will return to the lineup for the NFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Jones started in place of Tucker, who was hurt in the
regular-season finale on Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated to watch the game from the sideline," Tucker said. "That
was terrible. You work all year to get there and then you can't go.</TE>
<TE>   "But the rest did me good and I'll be ready to go this week."</TE>
<TE>   The team's major injury concern is tackle Jeff Zgonina, who is
questionable with a hyperextended elbow. But Coach Mike Martz expects
Zgonina, an effective run stuffer, to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty swollen but it won't keep him out of it," Martz said.
"They've got a brace for his elbow and he'll play."</TE>

<TE>   The Washington Redskins, having given up trying to find a general
manager, officially split the job in two with the hiring of Joe
Mendes as vice president of football operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins will now hire a director of player personnel, with
Vinny Cerrato the favorite to return in that role.</TE>
<TE>   Mendes was the team's chief contract negotiator until he resigned,
citing burnout, just before the start of the 2000 season. He has
spent the last two years working with player agents.</TE>

<HD>Blues Win 10th in Row</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Blues used a little luck to stretch their winning
streak to 10 games.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Van Ryn scored his first NHL goal to break a second-period
tie, and the Blues beat the Buffalo Sabres, 5-2, Wednesday night at
Buffalo, N.Y., in a game filled with fluke shots and wacky bounces.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm excited about it. If the points come, they come," Van Ryn
said. "I'm happy to get the first one out of the way, but the biggest
thing is we lengthened our streak and we battled back from 2-0."</LD>
<TE>   Brent Johnson made 21 saves for his 10th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Weight, Dallas Drake, Sergei Varlamov and Mike Keane also
scored for the Blues, who rallied from a 2-0 first-period deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Miroslav Satan scored Buffalo's goals. Martin Biron made 22 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Drake scored his seventh goal on a power play with 3:43 remaining
for a 4-2 lead. Weight scored his 11th into an empty net with 28
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Varlamov tied the score, 2-2, late in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Keane cut the Sabres' lead to 2-1 when Al MacInnis' shot took a
strange bounce in front of the net. Biron, expecting to clear the
shot behind the net, stood by as Keane flipped the puck into an empty
net at 16:39.</TE>
<TE>   "When you win nine or 10 in a row, the confidence level is there,"
MacInnis said. "When things are going well, you get the bounces. We
just have to keep going, we just have to get better starts."</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 8, Boston 4--Theo Fleury had a goal and three
assists, and Jeff Toms scored a career-high three goals for the
Rangers at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Mike York had two goals and three assists for a career-best five
points, and Eric Lindros had four assists for the Rangers. Radek
Dvorak and Matthew Barnaby also scored for New York.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury was fined $1,000 by the league Wednesday for making an
obscene gesture at fans in the Rangers' 5-4 victory over the New York
Islanders on Tuesday at Uniondale, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Lapointe, Brian Rolston, Glen Murray and Sergei Samsonov
scored for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Washington 3--Joe Juneau scored the go-ahead goal with
3:23 left in the third period at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Savage, Gino Odjick and Richard Zednik also scored for the
Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Zettler, Ulf Dahlen and Matt Pettinger scored for the
Capitals, who have lost three of four.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Chicago 1--Backup goaltender Robert Esche stopped 23
shots and the Coyotes handed the Blackhawks only their fourth loss in
27 games at the United Center.</TE>
<TE>   Michal Handzus scored twice for Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 2, Carolina 2--Bates Battaglia scored with 31 seconds to
play and the Hurricanes rallied for a tie at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's Ron Francis tied Ray Bourque for second place in
assists with 1,169, behind Wayne Gretzky's 1,963.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Tampa Bay 1--Mario Lemieux moved into seventh place
on the career scoring list with a five-point night--two goals and
three assists--at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Martin St. Louis, Tampa Bay's top scorer, broke his right leg
crashing into the boards early in the first period and will be out
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Florida 1--Patrik Elias and Valeri Kamensky scored
third-period goals at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Detroit 2--Brett Hull scored twice for the Red Wings
and San Jose had two goals 80 seconds apart at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings had won 10 in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Dominik Hasek made 29 saves and San Jose's Miikka
Kiprusoff stopped 27 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 4, Dallas 2--In his first game, Alex Auld made 20 saves
for Vancouver at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Trent Klatt and Brendan Morrison each had a goal and an assist for
the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Sydor and Scott Pellerin scored for Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Edmonton 2--Adam Foote, Chris Drury and Ville Nieminen
scored in the first period at Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy stopped 28 shots for his 21st victory.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Gary Bettman said he is under contract through the
2007-08 season, but called the extension the Board of Governors
approved in June "old news." Bettman reportedly will earn between $3
million and $3.5 million per year.... Michael Nylander of the
Blackhawks was selected to replace injured Peter Forsberg of Colorado
on Sweden's Olympic team. Florida's Niklas Hagman was added to
Finland's Olympic team.</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>Borchardt Is Putting His Best Foot Forward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice, Curtis Borchardt's right foot ended his basketball season.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out it started something, too.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford's 7-foot center is engaged to Cardinal point guard Susan
King--out for the season for a second year in a row because of a knee
injury.</LD>
<TE>   "We met each other in the training room last year," Borchardt
said. "Her right knee, my right foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we both helped each other. The thing is, you know what
each of you is going through."</TE>
<TE>   Borchardt, finally over his foot problems, is playing the best
basketball of his career, leading the Pacific 10 Conference in
rebounding and blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   With No. 17 Stanford hungry for a scoring presence other than
Casey Jacobsen, Borchardt is averaging a double-double--16.1 points
and 10.3 rebounds--along with 2.5 blocks a game.</TE>
<TE>   He also has a surprising touch from outside that would make him
the conference's most accurate three-point shooter at 58.3%, if he
had enough attempts to qualify. (Be forewarned, UCLA and USC:
Borchardt has made seven of 12.)</TE>
<TE>   Borchardt is approaching the point where his previous seasons
ended. Oddly, it was the USC game of Borchardt's first two seasons
that became his last, making the Southern California swing to play
UCLA tonight and USC Saturday something of a milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "Both years, the 20th game of the season, both times against USC,"
Borchardt said. "Both games against USC, by the end, I couldn't push
off my foot."</TE>
<TE>   He had surgery last March for the stress fracture in his right
foot, with doctors implanting two screws to stabilize the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really not too worried about it happening again because it
does feel so good," Borchardt said.</TE>
<TE>   Borchardt isn't the first Stanford player to seem jinxed by
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Before him, Jason Collins twice had knee surgery in what would
have been his freshman season, then dislocated his wrist after seven
games the next season. But Collins recovered to become a first-round
pick in last year's NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely inspiring," Borchardt said. "Jason had two really
rough, unlucky years when he got here. Just to see him improve after
I got here was an example of what I could do if I keep fit and get to
that high a level."</TE>
<TE>   Though Borchardt has put up some startling numbers--29 points and
nine rebounds against Oregon, and 27 points, 10 rebounds and six
blocked shots against Michigan State--he is a work in progress.
Against California, the defense of Jamal Sampson helped hold him to
single digits.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his skills led Washington Coach Bob Bender to mention
Christian Laettner this week and UCLA's Steve Lavin to bring up Keith
Van Horn.</TE>
<TE>   But at 7 feet, Borchardt's future isn't on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "Curtis just needs to get into the weight room," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He is down to 230, and at 7 feet that is just
not the strength that you need in this league to finish. He is
shooting the ball from the outside and getting better at shooting
over people from the inside."</TE>
<TE>   Gaining weight might seem an odd problem for the son of an NFL
offensive lineman--Jon Borchardt played nine seasons for the Buffalo
Bills and Seattle Seahawks--but Curtis said his father also had to
work to reach his playing weight of 275 on a 6-6 frame.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't like eating in the first place," Borchardt said,
though he does enjoy drinking whole milk, up to a gallon a day.</TE>
<TE>   His fiancee is doing what she can to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Susan's force-feeding me at night, mostly things that aren't good
for you--cookies, shakes, popcorn. Lots of calories," Borchardt said.</TE>
<TE>   Some people around Stanford seem concerned Borchardt might decide
to jump to the NBA after this season--"I'm not really sure," he said.
"I'm just trying to concentrate on getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, the Cardinal has a secret weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Susan is only a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Oklahoma State's Loss</TE>
<TE>   Bells will toll 10 times Sunday at the Oklahoma State library and
Stillwater churches in memory of the 10 passengers who lost their
lives in the crash of a team plane a year ago Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a real tough time," guard Victor Williams told
reporters Monday in a special news conference at which three players
and Coach Eddie Sutton talked about the year since the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost 10 people who were very dear to all of us. We have a lot
of mixed emotions about it. Sometimes it kind of drives you to play
your best. But sometimes, when you're at home just thinking about it,
it kind of brings you down."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Andre Williams said he doesn't break down as often as he
did in the weeks after one of three planes carrying the team back
from a game against Colorado crashed. His roommate and teammate, Dan
Lawson, was among those who died.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Williams went to the site of the crash in Colorado for
the dedication of a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "It was real hard, especially going out to where the plane
actually hit," Andre Williams said. "The closer I got to it, the
heavier my heart felt. It was real hard, but it was something I
needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   The emotions this weekend will be heightened by Saturday's game
against Colorado, the team Oklahoma State played before the crash. A
moment of silence will be held at the game, but the school and the
victims' families will wait to hold a longer service in February at
the dedication of a 20-foot black granite memorial in the lobby of
Gallagher-Iba Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial will feature a likeness of each victim along with a
kneeling Cowboy and the words "We Will Remember."</TE>
<TE>   Those who died were players Nate Fleming and Lawson, radio
engineer Kendall Durfey, publicist Will Hancock, trainer Brian
Luinstra, director of basketball operations Pat Noyes, radio
play-by-play announcer Bill Teegins, manager Jared Weiberg and pilots
Bjorn Fahlstrom and Denver Mills.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden Update</TE>
<TE>   Jason Williams probably would have to get hurt not to win the
Wooden Award as the nation's best player.</TE>
<TE>   The competition behind him, however, is intense.</TE>
<TE>   Our favorite five:</TE>
<TE>   1. Jason Williams, Duke (21.9 points, 5.1 assists)</TE>
<TE>   2. Mike Dunleavy, Duke (17.5 points, 6.9 rebounds)</TE>
<TE>   3. Jason Gardner, Arizona (21.1 points, 5.0 assists)</TE>
<TE>   4. Drew Gooden, Kansas (20.4 points, 11.8 rebounds)</TE>
<TE>   5. Steve Logan, Cincinnati (21.5 points, 4.9 assists)</TE>
<TE>   Not in the Wooden midseason top 30, but playing as if they were:
UCLA's Matt Barnes, Arizona's Luke Walton.</TE>

<LD>A year after six Finnish cross-country skiers failed drug tests at
the World Championships and turned the sport upside down, doping
remains all too common, according to U.S. Olympians Justin Wadsworth
and Nina Kemppel.</LD>
<LD>   "If you take the results page and look at the top 30 ... up to 40%
of the top 30 could possibly be dopers," said Wadsworth, who will
compete at his third Games next month at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   "I try not to think about it too much because it's extremely
frustrating to the point where if you think about it at a World Cup
or the Olympics, it almost makes me sick, because it's so prevalent."</LD>
<TE>   Kemppel, a four-time Olympian, said Wednesday that testing and
sanctions have made few inroads against the problem and urged stiffer
penalties for athletes who test positive for banned drugs. The Finns
used HES, a plasma expander that increases the levels of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and athletes in other endurance
sports have toyed with EPO, a performance-enhancing drug.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltic News Service reported Wednesday that Estonian
cross-country skier Kristina Smigun, a potential medalist, tested
positive for a banned substance. Tests will be performed on a second
sample to confirm the results.</TE>
<TE>   The Finns retired or were banned from competition. But Russia's
Lyubov Egorova, a six-time Olympic cross-country skiing gold
medalist, has resumed competing after a two-year ban for taking
Bromantan, which enhances performance and can mask other drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they're making a little bit of progress," Kemppel said
of efforts by the World Anti-Doping Agency to root out drugs. "I
think they have to focus on better tests and tougher suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   "Egorova was thrown out in '99, and now she's back on the Russian
team. She was caught cheating at the World Championships and she
should have had a lifetime ban.... I don't speak very good Russian so
I can't talk to her, but it makes me very angry when I'm standing on
the starting line and I see her right behind me. I don't want to be
standing on the starting line with a drug cheat. You want to know all
your competitors are on an even field when the gun goes off."</TE>
<TE>   Wadsworth was among the skiers who circulated a petition asking
the International Ski Federation to allow WADA to conduct drug tests.</TE>
<TE>   WADA has since assumed that job--and it has expanded the scope of
its authority to include NHL players, who were not tested before the
1998 Nagano Games. However, as testing gets more sophisticated, so do
cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   To Kemppel, there's only one answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Italy has made it illegal to dope. If you get caught doping, you
go to jail. Those are the kinds of things we need," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Take a Flying Leap</TE>
<TE>   Only one U.S. athlete has won a ski jumping medal--and that came
50 years after the event, when a historian found an error had been
made in calculating scores at the 1924 Chamonix Games and Anders
Haugen was moved up to third.</TE>
<TE>   That drought probably won't end at Salt Lake City. However,
21-year-old Alan Alborn and 17-year-old Clint Jones have had
respectable results this season, providing hope they can eventually
break the European and Japanese dominance of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn, of Anchorage, Alaska, credits the U.S. training program at
Park City for his three top-10 finishes this season.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us have gotten quite a bit stronger, and that has
transferred over to the jumping hill," said Alborn, 5 feet 11 and 130
pounds. "Being in Park City gives us an opportunity for our training
to be pretty consistent.... Top 10 is kind of an average performance
in my mind. In a perfect world, I'd be the best guy. I know I can
perform at a high level at a high-pressure competition."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, of Steamboat Springs, Colo., started jumping when he was 5.</TE>
<TE>   "The adrenaline rush is what keeps me coming back," said Jones,
also slender at 5-9 and 120 pounds. "As you keep moving on and
refining your technique, the feeling gets more like flying.</TE>
<TE>   "You're flying at 50 mph. Nothing is holding you up.... You feel
the pressure of the wind on your body and your skis and on a good
jump, you feel the lift. It's basically the closest thing to being a
bird."</TE>
<TE>   Go Figure</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to know what to make of the European figure skating
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Alexei Yagudin won the men's title at Lausanne,
Switzerland, but was outskated in the long program by compatriot
Alexander Abt, who trains at Lake Arrowhead. Evgeny Plushenko wasn't
there, pleading the need to rest a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin had pulled out of the Russian national championships last
month because of an ankle injury, leaving the Grand Prix Final as his
last competition against Plushenko before the Games. Yagudin won the
Grand Prix Final, but Plushenko has since changed his music from a
disjointed medley to excerpts from "Carmen."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin missed the opening quad of his final free skate at the
European championship, landing one quad, six triples and two double
loops.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's not going to be enough to be an Olympic champion," he
said. "In 10 years, nobody will remember how I skated in the
Europeans, but my name is going to be in the results. Of course, it's
way better to win with a great skate. But still, if I'm going to be
Olympic champion with bad skating, I wouldn't be that upset."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the struggles of Irina Slutskaya, who finished
second to fellow Russian Maria Butyrskaya, at 29 the oldest European
champion ever. Slutskaya fell on a double axel in her qualifying
program and again on a triple flip in her short program, and reports
from Europe say she was generally lackluster. Coming after her flawed
performances in winning last month's Grand Prix Final, that's not a
good omen.</TE>
<TE>   Born to Luge</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin, the top-ranked U.S. luge duo,
won't be bunking at the Olympic Village.</TE>
<TE>   The two have been renting a place in Park City, near Utah Olympic
Park, and they plan to stay at their "luge house" during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Their decision is based on superstition and logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of distractions at the Olympic village," Grimmette
said. "At the '98 Games we stayed at a Japanese family's house and it
worked out well."</TE>
<TE>   Said Martin: "Not to mention they're predicting it's going to take
three hours to get from Salt Lake over the summit [to Utah Olympic
Park]."</TE>
<TE>   Grimmette and Martin won bronze at Nagano, and they're fifth in
the World Cup standings.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Chris Witty, the only U.S. long-track speedskater to win a medal
at Nagano in 1998, was relieved to learn mononucleosis was the cause
of her constant fatigue. When U.S. Coach Tom Cushman went to her
hotel room to tell her the diagnosis and hesitated before speaking,
she greeted him by saying, "I'm not sick and dying, am I?"</TE>
<TE>   She withdrew from last weekend's world sprint championships but
plans to compete at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skater Naomi Nari Nam of Irvine, plagued by injuries since
she finished second at the 1999 U.S. championships, plans to resume
full training at Aliso Viejo this week for the first time in more
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a lot of work to catch up," said her coach, John Nicks,
who also coaches Olympian Sasha Cohen. "She and Sasha used to enjoy
working together. They challenge each other, and we're all looking
forward to seeing her out there again."</TE>
<TE>   Sarajevo figure skating gold medalist Scott Hamilton, diagnosed
with testicular cancer in 1997, said he feels fine and must undergo
only one more scan to monitor his progress. "I still go for physicals
all the time," said Hamilton, who has become a spokesman for
self-examination and early cancer detection. "I have to practice what
I preach." Hamilton is taking a year off from Stars on Ice but hopes
to stage a show in Las Vegas in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach will host the U.S. Olympic Water Polo trials in June
2004. It was previously awarded the 2004 swim trials.... Although
North and South Korea agreed to let their athletes march into the
Games together, as they did at Sydney for the first time since the
nation was divided in 1945, no North Korean athlete has qualified for
the Games.... Japan's Olympic Committee scrapped a plan to have
athletes bring gas masks to Salt Lake City as protection in case of a
biochemical attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Given all the efforts going into security preparations, we just
thought it would be rude for us to take them," a spokesman said.</TE>

<DH>A sport-by-sport look at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City:</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alpine Skiing: Bode Miller insists he's not the favorite in the
Olympic slalom, even after recording his third slalom victory and
fourth overall World Cup triumph Tuesday at Schladming, Austria.
"Typically, the favorites haven't had that much success," he said.
His victories are the most since Phil Mahre won six races during the
1982 season. "I don't feel I have to do something.... [but] I'm
willing to risk everything," he said. "I feel ready for it. I feel
comfortable." ... The women's World Cup circuit moves to Cortina
d'Ampezzo, Italy, for a downhill, super-giant slalom and slalom this
weekend. The men will be in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany this
weekend for final races before the U.S. Olympic team is announced
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Biathlon/Cross-Country: Kristina Sabasteanski of Standish, Maine,
moved up from her start position of 53rd in a 60-competitor field to
finish 44th in a biathlon World Cup 10K pursuit at Ruhpolding,
Germany, last Sunday .... Among the men, faulty shooting by Jeremy
Teela of Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to his 31st-place finish in a
12.5K pursuit.... Nina Kemppel of Anchorage became the first
four-time U.S. cross-country Olympian. Justin Wadsworth of Bend,
Ore., and John Bauer of Duluth, Minn., will each compete in their
third Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   Curling: The Tim Somerville team, which is the U.S. men's Olympic
entry, was 6-1 at the Manitoba (Canada) Curling Assn. Bonspiel....
The Kari Erickson team, the U.S. women's Olympic entry, has been
training in Calgary, Canada, and will compete in the Lethbridge
Bonspiel starting Friday in Lethbridge.</TE>
<TE>   Figure Skating: Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, fourth at the U.S.
championships, declined an invitation to the Four Continents
competition in Seoul because her coach, Frank Carroll, is helping Tim
Goebel prepare for the Olympics. After competing without a coach for
a month after the death of her coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, Nikodinov
said she didn't want to be on her own again.... Kim Seybold-Catron, a
1988 pair Olympian with her brother, Wayne, will undergo surgery for
a recurrence of a brain tumor. She teaches hockey and skating in
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle Skiing: Eric Bergoust won his second consecutive World
Cup aerials title last weekend at Lake Placid, N.Y. Alla Tsuper of
Belarus won the women's event.... Jeremy Bloom, who passed on a
football scholarship to Colorado to pursue his Olympic dream, won the
last event in the World Cup moguls event last weekend at Lake Placid
to earn a berth. "It was time to put it on the line," he said. "I'd
be first or I was gonna be 12th, but I wasn't holding back." Jillian
Vogtli, who had knee surgery after last season, clinched a berth by
finishing third.... Aerialist Emily Cook, who dislocated two bones in
her foot last week at Lake Placid, will be examined by doctors from
the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Ski Team to determine if she
can compete at Salt Lake City. If not, she will be replaced before
Monday's deadline to submit Olympic rosters.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey: The Russian Hockey Federation is awaiting a ruling from
the Court for Arbitration of Sport on its request to allow San Jose
Shark goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to play for Russia at Salt Lake City.
Nabokov had been ruled ineligible because he played for Kazakhstan
when he was 19 ....The Florida Panthers will allow Robert Svehla to
play for Slovakia and Sandis Ozolinsh to play for Latvia in a
preliminary round game Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Nordic Combined/Ski Jumping: Bill Demong of Vermontville, N.Y.,
recorded his first nordic combined World Cup victory last Sunday by
defeating Pavel Churavy of the Czech Republic and World Cup leader
Felix Gottwald of Austria in a 15K race at Liberec, Czech Republic.
Demong and Todd Lodwick were among seven skiers named to the U.S.
Olympic team Wednesday.... The U.S. ski jumping team is the country's
youngest ever, with an average age of 19. Named to the team were Alan
Alborn of Anchorage, a second-time Olympian at 21; second-time
Olympian Brendan Doran, 22, of Steamboat Springs, Colo.; 17-year-olds
Clint Jones of Steamboat Springs and Brian Welch of Scarborough,
Maine, and 18-year-old Tommy Schwall of Steamboat Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding: Lisa Kosglow of Boise, Idaho, and Rosey Fletcher of
Anchorage clinched Olympic berths by becoming the top two Americans
in the qualifying round of a World Cup parallel giant slalom at
Bardonechia, Italy. Among the men, Chris Klug ended a streak of three
consecutive fifth-place finishes by winning a parallel giant slalom
and moving close to an Olympic berth. One event remains, today at
Kreischberg, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating: Canadians Catriona LeMay Doan and Jeremy Wotherspoon
won the women's and men's overall titles at the world sprint
championships last weekend at Hamar, Norway. LeMay Doan, who will
carry the Canadian flag into the opening ceremony at Salt Lake City,
beat out Andrea Nuyt of the Netherlands. Casey FitzRandolph of the
U.S. was second overall among the men.</TE>

<LD>Congenital Heart Defect Led to Runner's Death</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kortekaas, a 17-year-old varsity cross-country runner at
Victorville Silverado High who died Oct. 10 after being in a coma for
11 days following his collapse during a race at Yucaipa High, died of
a congenital heart defect, the San Bernardino County coroner's office
has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The report said "the most single abnormal finding from the autopsy
is the enlarged heart. It weighed 425 grams and in the high-end scale
of a boy his size, his heart should be no larger than 410."</LD>
<TE>   The report said Kortekaas' condition probably caused an irregular
heartbeat that led to a heart attack during the race, which was held
in temperatures approaching 100 degrees. The heart attack led to a
lack of oxygen reaching his brain.</TE>

Section council meeting at The Grand in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The council will vote whether to expand the number of allowable
games to 30 from 20 and whether to allow each league to decide upon
use of the 10-run mercy rule.</LD>
<TE>   The council also will continue to discuss a statewide proposal
that aims to curb the rise in transfers for athletic purposes by

<LD>I made meaningful eye contact with Bo Derek while the two of us sat
ringside at the Hearns-Hagler fight many years ago in Las Vegas, so
obviously I'm not here to tell you there's no value to the sport of
boxing.</LD>
<LD>   But I know there is going to be a lot of analysis and deep thought
given to Mike Tyson's biting Lennox Lewis on Tuesday, and the pro
wrestling manner in which fights are being promoted.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Saraceno, columnist and boxing expert for USA Today, reacted
immediately by scribbling: "[Tyson] is a bewildered, anguished,
tortured man for whom redemption never will find a safe harbor."</LD>
<TE>   I would think it would have been Lewis who was the bewildered,
anguished and tortured man unable to find a safe harbor after being
bitten on the leg while just standing there at a news conference--and
then being sent to the hospital for a tetanus shot.</TE>
<TE>   I know I've had the feeling I should get a tetanus shot after some
of the news conferences I've attended, but the editors always
insisted I make deadline and finish my stories about Disney's
ownership of the Angels and Ducks before doing anything else.</TE>
<TE>   That might explain, however, why USC Athletic Director Mike
Garrett tells everyone it appears I'm foaming at the mouth to talk
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway I don't normally pay that much attention to boxing,
treating it a lot like horse racing, women's basketball and bobsled
racing--three sports that would be helped tremendously by periodic
all-out brawls.</TE>
<TE>   It's the ruckus in New York, for example, that brought my
attention to boxing this week.</TE>
<TE>   So I opened The Times on Wednesday morning expecting to see Tyson
munching on Lewis' leg with the intention of draping the picture over
my wife's cereal bowl to help with her latest diet--only there was no
picture.</TE>
<TE>   I'm told Sports Editor Bill Dwyre was so bothered by the latest
boxing news conference melee that he refused to allow a picture from
the brawl to appear on the first page of the sports section. Instead,
the newspaper ran a photo of Shaq standing on his head and Monica
Seles making the kind of face she'd shred if it came out of her own
Polaroid.</TE>
<TE>   Seles' photo also showed what incredible muscles she has in her
arms, and imagine what a news conference melee between Seles and
Jennifer Capriati or one of the Williams sisters could do for the
sport of tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Tell me Dwyre wouldn't plaster those pictures all over the front
page of the sports section and ask for copies to hang on his office
walls.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyre put Steve Springer's story on the Tyson brawl in the
front-page spot normally reserved for serious news, which weakens his
"ban the boxing photo" argument, but I wouldn't want to make a big
deal out of that in case he's in the mood to ban something or someone
else from the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   He said the rash of disruptions at recent boxing news conferences
gave him the feeling the newspaper was being dragged into the
promotional world of professional wrestling. Without boxing pictures,
however, the first five pages of the sports section Wednesday
featured 10 photos--five of which were dedicated to tennis being
played in Australia--and not one of them Anna Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   Someone here must think Dwyre is partial to tennis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DWYRE'S CORRECT, of course, and I can't see myself ever writing
those words in a sentence again. Boxing has reached the stage where
the hype has to be hyped to get attention and sell more cable
hook-ups. But there's a thin line between hoax and macho
confrontations, Vince McMahon's experience as a scripted showman and
Tyson's apparent urge to be institutionalized again.</TE>
<TE>   In a sport orchestrated for the most part by Don King and Bob
Arum, and documented by broadcasters and sportswriters, who accept
aberrant behavior as good copy, it's going to be a difficult task
understanding just what is outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   After viewing Tyson on display at a news conference in L.A. last
year--the boxing scribes chirping with delight because he was filling
their notebooks with gutter talk about his mental condition--I was
stunned Wednesday to scan the Internet and find the following
headline atop the work of New York Daily News columnist Vic Ziegel:
"Tyson Boxing's Worst Enemy--Has Made Mockery of Sport."</TE>
<TE>   Now that's outrageous--boxing eating its own. Where would the
interest in boxing be the last decade without Tyson and the headlines
his antics have inspired?</TE>
<TE>   Tyson is what makes the sport so popular with boxing aficionados,
allowing them to rhapsodize about the destruction he delivers inside
the ropes, and then on occasion sounding off with moral indignation
when he has wronged his fellow man or woman outside the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Let's be honest: Horse racing should be so lucky to have a jockey
who is just crazy enough to punch his horse in the nose for losing.</TE>
<TE>   My guess is we would definitely run that picture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M TOLD L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn was on radio recently saying it would
be a good thing if the NFL returned here because it has to be awkward
for the league having only 31 teams.</TE>
<TE>   Houston is already the league's 32nd team, of course, beating out
Los Angeles, which makes me wonder what the mayor and NFL officials
were talking about when they met last month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Ho Yun:</TE>
<TE>   "I agree with you about trading Lamar Odom for an on-court leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Would an Odom-Latrell Sprewell trade make any sense?"</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely. I know there are times when I feel like choking Alvin
Gentry.</TE>

<HD>El Salvador Makes Most of Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In any soccer match, there is always one telling moment, one instant
when things go wrong for one team and correspondingly well for the
other.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Rose Bowl, in front of 12,906, that
moment came 58 minutes into the game between El Salvador and
Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   Guatemalan defender Alvaro Jimenez thought he was doing the right
thing, kicking the ball out of the penalty area and hopefully out of
bounds altogether. Trouble was, he didn't kick it hard enough.</LD>
<TE>   The ball fell to Salvadoran midfielder Santos Cabrera, and his
angled shot from about 15 yards flew into the lower left corner of
the net past Guatemalan goalkeeper Dany Ortiz. Having scored, the
Salvadorans' confidence soared and they had little trouble shutting
out their Central American neighbors for the final 30 minutes. Their
1-0 victory put them into the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup,
with a shot at beating the United States on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an historic victory," said El Salvador's coach, Carlos
Humberto Recinos, who pointed out that it was the first time his
nation had reached the quarterfinals in the 11-year history of the
biennial tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemala's coach, Julio Cesar Cortes, didn't think it was
historic at all.</TE>
<TE>   Having been beaten, 3-1, by Mexico on Monday and now losing to El
Salvador, he was in no mood to talk and boycotted the news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   That left time for Recinos to comment on the match against the
Americans. He was asked what El Salvador would have to do to win that
game.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see Sunday," was his curt reply. El Salvador should not
present an insurmountable obstacle for the U.S., despite the latter's
scoring difficulties of late. But the Salvadorans' defense should not
be taken lightly. It allowed Mexico only one goal and shut out
Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   A tie was all Recinos' team had in mind on a cold Wednesday night
that saw most players wearing gloves. Because of its better goal
difference, El Salvador didn't have to win, while Guatemala did.</TE>
<TE>   It took both teams time to settle down, with the players seemingly
more intent on fouling each other than creating scoring
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Rogger Zambrano of Ecuador cautioned El Salvador's Victor
Velasquez in the 20th minute and Guillermo Ramirez 12 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   It took 30 minutes before either goalkeeper had to make a save.
The second half started more brightly, as Guatemala showed more
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Albizuris, who came on as a replacement for Carlos Ruiz,
sent a shot wide left and a sharp header from Ramirez flew straight
at goalkeeper Santos Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there was always the danger of Guatemala falling victim
to a counterattack, and that threat became reality when the luckless
Jimenez failed to clear the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night's second game between South Korea and Cuba ended
in a 0-0 tie, with South Korea advancing, on goal differential, to
play Mexico in the quarterfinals at noon on Sunday.</TE>

<KH>AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME New England at Pittsburgh, Sunday, 9:30
a.m., Ch. 2</KH>
<HD>Man of Steel</HD>
<DH>Kordell Stewart Has Become the Steelers' Leader This Season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>He has always been Slash.</LD>
<LD>   Once upon a time, that stood for quarterback/running
back/receiver.</LD>
<LD>   But then, as Kordell Stewart's career took a serious downturn, it
came to stand for losses/interceptions/miscommunication.</LD>
<TE>   And for the growing number of Stewart critics, Slash ideally would
have stood for benchwarmer/NFL Europe/Arena League.</TE>
<TE>   Anywhere but behind center for the Pittsburgh Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's exactly where No. 10 will be positioned Sunday when the
Steelers play host to the New England Patriots in the AFC
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   And nobody with a Terrible Towel in his or her hand is complaining
these days.</TE>
<TE>   What happened? How did Stewart go from a man whose reputation, on
and off the field, had been slashed to the role of hero? How did a
man whose relationship with his teammates was cool at best, become
the leader on offense, ahead of even Jerome Bettis, on the road the
Steelers hope will lead to New Orleans and the Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   There was no miracle cure, no revelation through hypnosis, no
operation to repair some secret injury.</TE>
<TE>   All it took was a pat on the back and some tender loving care.</TE>
<TE>   All it took was an offensive coordinator, Mike Mularkey, and a
quarterback coach, Tom Clements, who were attentive, sympathetic and
supportive.</TE>
<TE>   And that's no malarkey, according to many close to the team.</TE>
<TE>   One incident best illustrates that. At the start of the season,
Clements took instant photos of the opposing defense before the snap
and after and took them to Stewart on the sidelines to study.</TE>
<TE>   No big deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always done that," said Clements, who had been a
quarterback coach with the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints
before joining Pittsburgh this season.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was no big deal for Clements, but Stewart said he had
never had a coach do that for him before.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if Stewart were a running back/receiver in college,
who tacked on the additional slash as a quarterback when he became a
Steeler. He was an established, accomplished quarterback at Colorado,
where he set all kinds of passing records.</TE>
<TE>   The lasting image of Stewart from his collegiate days is the
64-yard touchdown pass he threw to Michael Westbrook on the final
play of a game against Michigan to pull out a 27-26 victory.</TE>
<TE>   At first, there were plenty of highlights as well with the
Steelers, who selected Stewart in the second round of the 1995 draft.</TE>
<TE>   In the conservative world of the NFL, where everybody is a
specialist, the idea of a guy who could effectively throw a pass,
catch a pass or run with the ball was intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   Especially in Pittsburgh, where the strategy had so often been for
the offense to just hold onto the ball until the defense could come
up with a way to win the game. Since Terry Bradshaw was named to the
Pro Bowl in 1980, the Steelers had gone 13 seasons without a Pro Bowl
quarterback until Neil O'Donnell won that honor in 1993. But
O'Donnell was a shooting star at best. There was hope Stewart was
going to have longevity.</TE>
<TE>   He even added an extra slash in his first pro season, in a playoff
game against the Buffalo Bills, when he booted a 41-yard punt out of
the shotgun formation.</TE>
<TE>   By his third season, Stewart was the starting quarterback. He went
11-5, threw for 3,020 yards and 21 touchdowns and the Steelers made
it to the AFC championship game, which they lost to the Denver
Broncos, 24-21.</TE>
<TE>   Chan Gailey, the offensive coordinator that season, had a good
relationship with Stewart, whose fragile personality had always been
high maintenance. Gailey boosted Stewart's ego and praised him often.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble began when Gailey left to become coach of the Dallas
Cowboys. He was followed at offensive coordinator by Ray Sherman in
1998 and Kevin Gilbride in 1999-2000. Stewart's decline coincided
with their arrival.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 game at Tampa Bay, Steeler Coach Bill Cowher, seeing his
quarterback struggle and throw three interceptions, pulled him.
Stewart, the growing frustration finally bursting, very publicly
disputed Cowher's decision on the sideline, wagging a finger at his
coach. When Stewart's anger was spent, there were tears in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   But even that wasn't the low point. It came a year later when
Cowher removed Stewart from quarterback with five games to play and
made him strictly a receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Adding the ultimate insult, Cowher forbade Stewart from attending
the quarterback meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart figured he couldn't win with Gilbride looking over his
shoulder. The quarterback remembered a game in Jacksonville when he
took off out of the pocket and gained 34 yards. When he came back to
the sideline, he expected to be praised. Instead, Gilbride questioned
his decision.</TE>
<TE>   There were unsettling issues to deal with off the field as well.
Stewart was booed and he once had a beer thrown on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Cowher could have given up on his troubled quarterback. Instead,
he made an extra effort, not only bringing in Mularkey to replace
Gilbride this season, but also hiring Clements, the first time the
Steelers had had a quarterback coach since Babe Parilli 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other position player has a coach watching out for him,"
Clements said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not have one for the quarterback?"</TE>
<TE>   The results have been spectacular. After finishing 2000 strong,
Stewart has come back with his best season yet in terms of passing
yards (3,109) and passer rating (81.7). He was named to the Pro Bowl
for the first time, was named the team's most valuable player,
smoothly kept the Steelers on course at the end of the season when
Bettis was sidelined by hip and groin injuries, guided the club to a
13-3 record and home-field advantage throughout the postseason and
has them back in the AFC title game.</TE>
<TE>   "You can burn my house down," Stewart told the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette, "but that will not cause me to run or be afraid.... My mom
and dad did a wonderful job of raising me. I'm not going to change my
thinking because people in a stadium think I'm a bad guy or less than
an athlete. I won't allow that to happen. I'll just stand strong."</TE>
<TE>   He got that advice from Bettis.</TE>
<TE>   "He has developed and matured," Bettis said. "I told him when they
were booing him, he could either stand up or stand out. I told him,
you can't worry about what other people want. You got to do what you
got to do."</TE>
<TE>   Slash and burn?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Stewart now envisions completing a new slash: Team
MVP/Pro Bowl/Super Bowl.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Home Is Stanford Castle</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Cardinal, which has four consecutive
victories at Pauley Pavilion, visits Bruins tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somebody ought to inspect the grant deed, but the rightful owner of
Pauley Pavilion will pay a visit tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford has held title on the old fixer-upper for four years. The
Cardinal generously allows UCLA to reside there most of the time but
swings by every winter to make it clear who is boss, in case the
Bruins have forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   Last year UCLA rolled out the welcome mat, surrendering an early
15-point Cardinal run before falling, 85-79.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000 and in 1999, Stanford took residence in the paint and
controlled the boards, winning by 15 and 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1998, Stanford withstood a 15-0 second-half streak by UCLA
and won, 84-81, prompting Bruin senior Toby Bailey to say, "I hate
Stanford."</TE>
<TE>   It hardly matters to the Bruins that they won at Palo Alto the
last two years, and that on both occasions the Cardinal was ranked
No. 1. They are tired of another team being No. 1 in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the only team that beats us here like that," senior
Billy Knight said. "For the seniors, we have one more chance to set
things right."</TE>
<TE>   Which means not providing Stanford with all the comforts of
you-know-where.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake. Right at home is precisely how the interlopers
from the north feel. Like kicking their feet up on the couch, rifling
through the refrigerator and leaving their socks on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Says so right on the bulletin board in the UCLA locker room.</TE>
<TE>   There's a quote from Casey Jacobsen, Stanford's standout junior
from Glendora, affectionately referring to Pauley as his favorite
place to play. He says he looks forward to coming to UCLA the way
most college kids pine for mom's cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Just the way Jarron and Jason Collins did. And Arthur Lee did. And
all the other Cardinal players over the last few years who grew up in
the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Childress, a freshman forward from Lakewood, is the latest.</TE>
<TE>   Who is going to put a stop to it? Bruin freshmen?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want him and the other freshmen believing they can come
here and do what they've done the last few years," Cedric Bozeman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin seniors?</TE>
<TE>   "I've never beaten them at Pauley, so I guess they have a right to
say that," Rico Hines said. "But that's when we play better, after
people have said bad things about us."</TE>
<TE>   This Stanford team is less formidable than in the last three
years, when it came in with rankings of No. 1, 2 and 4. Only Jacobsen
is a returning starter, and although 7-foot center Curtis Borchardt
is an All-American candidate, several inexperienced players are in
key roles.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is still a bully on the boards, however, the best
rebounding team in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "They work hard to get good position in the paint," UCLA center
Dan Gadzuric said. "We need to play tight defense and not let them
have second and third shots."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric can't play Borchardt too tight because he has fouled out
of three games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably will play this game more cautious and not try to block
as many shots," he said. "I have to let them know it's not going to
be easy to make inside shots. But I need to make them alter their
shots without fouling."</TE>
<TE>   If Gadzuric can deny Borchardt shots, the scoring load falls to
Jacobsen, who averages 19.7 points and possesses almost limitless
range.</TE>
<TE>   "Borchardt and Gadzuric is a pivotal matchup because Curtis is one
of our two go-to guys," Coach Mike Montgomery said. "UCLA has more
scoring diversity with Knight, [Jason Kapono] and [Matt] Barnes as
their top three options."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes has averaged 20 points over the last five games and scored
32 in last year's loss to Stanford. Kapono is UCLA's leading scorer
at 18.6 points and Knight averages 15.9. All three will have a height
advantage over their counterparts in Stanford's man-to-man defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We match up well against them," Kapono said. "They are a
different team this year and so are we."</TE>
<TE>   The inference being that the outcome might also be different. But
more important to UCLA Coach Steve Lavin than beating Stanford is
continued balanced scoring, Gadzuric avoiding dumb fouls and Bozeman
improving at point guard.</TE>
<TE>   So he says.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is for us to be playing our best basketball six weeks
from now," he said. "For me, it's another weekend, another
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it was Bruin coaches who posted the Jacobsen quote on
the bulletin board along with the scores from the four recent losses.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bruin coaches who reminded the team that last year's loss
ruined Earl Watson's final home game. And that before 1998, UCLA
defeated Stanford in 30 of 32 meetings at Pauley.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is important for a variety of reasons," Kapono said.
"We need to win our conference home games. We are the home team."</TE>

<HD>It's Time to Do Some Zone Busting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given USC's problems against   Arizona's zone defenses  last week,
Trojan Coach Henry Bibby played it close to the vest when asked if he
would zone the Trojans if he were  coaching against them.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no comment on that one," Bibby said with a sly grin.</LD>
<LD>   The Wildcats employed a 3-2 zone with the 6-foot-8 Luke Walton
disrupting things at the top of the key. USC's point guards struggled
mightily and the Trojans  made only two of their first 22 shots while
getting easily beaten.</LD>
<TE>   "I have no problem with the zone; I think we're a good zone team,"
Bibby said. "We have several zone offenses that we can run. It's a
matter of getting behind the zone, driving the gaps of the zone,
ball-faking the zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably something that we haven't done enough of and I
blame the coaches and myself for not talking more about the
fundamentals of the zone, ball-fakes and driving the gaps."</TE>
<TE>   USC senior forward Sam Clancy has an idea on how to beat a zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Make some shots," he said. "That would help a lot of things,
solve a lot of problems."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby isn't sure what kind of defensive packages California will
use  tonight against the Trojans. But he knows they will be tough.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears boast four players at least 6 feet 10 and lead
the Pacific 10 Conference in five defensive categories--scoring
defense (60.8 points per game allowed), field-goal percentage defense
(38.3%), three-point percentage defense (31.1%), steals (9.19 steals
per game), and turnover margin (+5.88).</TE>
<TE>   USC leads the Pac-10 in one category, averaging 15.06 offensive
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not concerned with their height. They do a lot of
switching," Bibby said. "They really pack it inside, they try not to
let you get anything in the area under the basket and they put
pressure on you to shoot the basketball."</TE>
<TE>   At 14-3 overall, No. 23 USC is off to its best start since the
1991-92 team also began 14-3. Those Harold Miner-led Trojans started
the season  17-3 before  finishing 24-6.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears, who have been picking up votes in both the
coaches' and writers' polls but not enough to crack either  top 25,
are off to their best start since the 1959-60 season, when Cal opened
15-1 under Pete Newell en route to a 28-2 finish. Cal was the
national runner-up that season.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Records--No. 23 USC 14-3, 6-1 in Pacific 10; California 13-3, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--One of USC's losses this season came at Fresno State in
the preseason National Invitation Tournament, 65-58, on Nov. 15. Cal
thumped Fresno State, 97-75, on Dec. 11, though Bulldog center Melvin
Ely sat out that game. Cal is led in scoring by junior forward Joe
Shipp (14.8) and in rebounding by freshman center Jamal Sampson
(7.8).</TE>

<HD>Crime in Oxnard Drops Again in 2001</HD>
<DH>Report: Violence and theft take sharp declines. City has
become one of the safest for its size in the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crime in Oxnard continued a decade of steep decline last year due to
sharp drops in violence and theft, pushing the city's crime rate so
low it ranks as one of the nation's safest communities for its size.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard saw serious offenses drop 7% in 2001 from the year before.
That translates to a 47% decline since 1992, including a 50%
reduction in felony violent crimes.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly the homicides and robberies are ones we keep track of
very carefully," Police Chief Art Lopez said. "We're particularly
happy with that."</LD>
<TE>   Homicides in the city dropped from nine to six last year, rapes
from 60 to 38 and felony assaults from 422 to 374. Lopez said the
decline represents progress in a campaign to secure Oxnard's streets
and to establish the blue-collar community as exceptionally safe.</TE>
<TE>   Even before last year's reductions, Oxnard ranked fifth safest of
43 U.S. cities with populations between 150,000 and 200,000,
according to a Police Department analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The city's rate of crime per 1,000 residents now stands at less
than 30 compared with 67 in 1992, when Oxnard's crime peaked. That is
far below the state and national crime rates.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive, Oxnard's crime rate is now about the same as
Thousand Oaks' was in 1992, when the affluent east county community
was the nation's safest city with at least 100,000 residents.
Thousand Oaks' crime rate is also off sharply, as is Ventura County's
as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're safer than Thousand Oaks was in 1992," Lopez said. "We
like that comparison."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the comparison highlights a telling point in statistics that
cities report to the FBI each year: One murder is counted the same as
one theft.</TE>
<TE>   A truer comparison can come by comparing crimes by category. And
Oxnard, despite cutting its violent crime in half over the decade,
still had 811 incidents of serious violence last year, while Thousand
Oaks had 396 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   One category of violence increased in Oxnard last year, as
robberies went from 375 in 2000 to 393. Police analysts attributed
much of that jump to a handful of thugs, several of whom are either
dead or in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless ex-felon Larry Brown, 27, was believed responsible for at
least six robberies, allegedly holding up doughnut shops repeatedly
in June and July before he was shot dead following a police stakeout.
Brown was one of five people killed by Oxnard police last year. Those
five homicides are not counted by the FBI in Oxnard's total for the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Robbery prevention is targeted for extra attention by his
department this year, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   One new program aims at helping farm workers quickly get proper
legal identification, so they can open bank accounts and not carry
wads of money after cashing their paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   "They get paid and they go off into the downtown or Colonia and
they become targets of young thugs," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a violent crime task force established in 1999 has
begun to see success with a sharp reduction in assaults, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having the opportunity to get involved in very exhaustive
investigations of gang members we think are involved in these types
of crimes," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police are also advising shopkeepers of things to do to keep from
being robbed, such as removing advertisements from windows so
passers-by can see when a crime is being committed inside, he said.</TE>

<HD>'Anti-Crime' Coad vs. Anti-Airport Norby</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of the first face-to-face debates of the campaign, Supervisor
Cynthia P. Coad described herself Wednesday as a crime-fighter
cleaning up drug-infested areas, while her rival, Fullerton
Councilman Chris Norby, said Coad's pro-airport stand "has poisoned
politics" and divided the county.</LD>
<LD>   Coad aggressively highlighted her program to clean up blighted,
unincorporated areas. She downplayed her role as one of the three
pro-airport supervisors as well as her vote for a landmark pact that
guaranteed union labor on major public works projects to 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The incumbent board chairwoman said she has worked to make the
county "family-friendly" and responded to accusations that she has
been divisive.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been called divisive, yet I have endorsements of 24 out of
25 elected officials in my district," Coad said.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Emerson, who attended the Fullerton Republican Women's
debate at a Fullerton restaurant, challenged Coad during a
question-and-answer period.</TE>
<TE>   "You say you want to make the county 'family-friendly,'" Emerson
said. "But how do you justify that by supporting an airport for El
Toro that will force families to deal with jet exhaust and noise?"</TE>
<TE>   Coad responded that her definition of "family-friendly" means
having jobs that an airport will bring. She said that she raised one
of her sons with daily noise from combat aircraft when she and her
husband, a Marine dentist, lived at the El Toro base.</TE>
<TE>   "But you lived at El Toro when they had daylight flights only,"
Emerson countered.</TE>
<TE>   The debate marked one of the first times that Coad has gone before
a Fullerton organization since the city was moved into the 4th
District in last year's redistricting. By contrast, Norby was in his
political backyard, where he has been the city's top vote-getter
since he first won election to the council in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   If a candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the March 5
primary, he or she wins, and there is no general election. If Norby
wins, it would mean a significant transformation on the Board of
Supervisors, ending years of a pro-airport majority that consists of
Jim Silva, Chuck Smith and Coad.</TE>
<TE>   The debate format allowed the candidates to state their platforms,
but there was no direct dialogue between them.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't stop Norby from hammering Coad's support of a project
labor agreement, which the board majority approved, in part, to help
win labor's support against Measure F, a 2000 anti-airport initiative
that overwhelmingly won. A Los Angeles judge later declared the
measure unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Norby expressed skepticism and frustration with the board's labor
pact, saying that it hurts many Orange County nonunion contractors
and aids Democrats, who frequently receive campaign contributions
from unions.</TE>
<TE>   "The [pact] helps to elect people like [Assemblyman] Lou Correa
and [U.S. Rep.] Loretta Sanchez, where 98% of the union money goes,"
Norby said.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, Silva and Smith are also aligned against Measure W, a
countywide initiative in the March 5 primary election that would
replace airport zoning at the 4,700-acre base with zoning for an
urban park, university complex and sports fields.</TE>
<TE>   Norby favors Measure W and has received the bulk of his campaign
contributions from residents in South County.</TE>
<TE>   Coad told the women's group that she favors an airport because she
doesn't want to "cripple our economic engine." She added that Measure
W doesn't guarantee a park, but if it passes, she will abide by it.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Coad has said she wanted only to keep the county's
"option open for an airport."</TE>
<TE>   Norby said he is against an airport at El Toro, saying that he
believes a more suitable site would be March Air Force Base near

<LD>Ventura County's 160 Marine reservists are being activated for the
first time since the Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen officers, along with senior enlisted Marines and technical
experts, reported Wednesday to Port Hueneme and an additional 144 men
ages 18 to 41 will arrive in early February, Maj. Francis Grzymkowski
said.</LD>
<LD>   "They're leaving their jobs, they're leaving their families, but
they're willing and able," Grzymkowski said. "They're really
excited."</LD>
<TE>   Once assembled, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marine Unit will be sent
to Camp Pendleton to await orders as part of a homeland security
mission covering Region 9 of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   At Camp Pendleton, the unit will be joined by hundreds of other
2nd Battalion reservists from units based in Encino, San Bruno and
Los Alamitos, as well as Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a so-called Rapid Response Force, the battalion would
be available to respond to any terrorism-related crisis in the
region, which spans Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American
Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands,
Micronesia and Palau. The units could remain active for up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme-based unit last year received the Gen. Melvin J.
Maas Award, which designated it the top reserve unit in the nation
based on field exercises, shooting, athletic competitions and
training attendance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a 7-year-old girl who lost two-thirds of her index
finger while playing with a toy rifle at Disneyland has sued the Walt
Disney Co.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit says Priscilla Figueroa of North Hollywood snagged her
finger on the trigger of a fake rifle on Tom Sawyer's Island. The
accident occurred Jan. 21, 2001, as she fell from the rifle's mount.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed this week in Orange County Superior Court in
Santa Ana. The girl's lawyer said park operators failed to ensure the
gun was safe.</LD>
<TE>   A Disney spokesman declined to comment on the suit's specifics but
said the family has rebuffed company attempts to contact them.</TE>

<HD>50 Families Flee Fire in Holy Jim Canyon</HD>
<DH>Battle: High winds push the blaze, of unknown origin, over
100 acres in hilly terrain. One firefighter suffers minor injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 50 families were evacuated from their homes and mountain
cabins late Wednesday as a stubborn brush fire raged over 100 acres
of rugged hilly terrain at Holy Jim Canyon in the Cleveland National
Forest, northeast of Rancho Santa Margarita.</LD>
<LD>   Told to be prepared for evacuation were about 200 inmates of the
Joplin Boy's Ranch, a county probation camp for juvenile boys,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Kymbra Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire
Authority, said the fire was traveling southwest.</LD>
<TE>   Due to the erratic winds and the geography of the canyons, the
fire was shifting back and forth and remained out of control, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the steep terrain, firefighters were only able to fight
the blaze with hand crews.</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter sustained minor injuries. His identity and the
specific nature of the injuries were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, of unknown origin, erupted about 5:30 p.m. near Trabuco
Creek Road, Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire spread quickly, fueled by dry brush and gusty 30 mph
winds that had been blowing most of the day. "It's steep, rugged
terrain and thick brush," Fleming said, "but the wind is what's
driving the fire."</TE>
<TE>   An American Red Cross evacuation center was set up at Trabuco
Hills High School in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   They were expected to spend the night, according to Dave Romano, a
Fire Authority spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The evacuations were ordered, he said, in case the fire threatened
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   He said the boys at the probation camp were on standby because the
fire was moving in their direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's blowing pretty good out there, and the terrain is making it
difficult for us to contain," he said. "It was dark when it started,
and it's tough to see."</TE>
<TE>   About 75 firefighters, including some from the U.S. Forest
Service, were expected to battle the blaze throughout the night,
Romano said.</TE>

<HD>Coastline President Will Retire in June</HD>
<DH>Education: Under Leslie Purdy, the Fountain Valley college
became a U.S. 'telecourse' leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coastline Community College President Leslie Purdy, who won three
Emmys for instructional programming produced at the college,
announced she will retire in June after leading the Fountain
Valley-based institution for eight years.</LD>
<LD>   During Purdy's tenure, Coastline emerged as one of the nation's
top producers of "telecourses"--classes taught via television,
videotape or CD-ROM. She also presided over the building of a major
instructional center in Garden Grove and the opening of the Orange
County Regional One-Stop Center in Costa Mesa, which offers job
assistance.</LD>
<LD>   The 12,000-student college, which calls itself the "college
without walls," is part of the Coast Community College District,
along with Golden West College, Orange Coast College and KOCE-TV.</LD>
<TE>   Purdy joined the college district in 1975 as an instructional
designer and, when Coastline opened in 1976, she moved to the
department that produced and marketed the college's educational
programming. The Emmy-winning instructional programs she helped
produce were on astronomy, child development and art.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a quality product," Purdy said Wednesday. "I think we
have shown that students who take distance learning get a very high
quality education--an adult education."</TE>
<TE>   A typical Coastline "telecourse," which includes textbooks, study
guide and computer components, can easily reach 10,000 for-credit
students nationwide, with tens of thousands others watching for
personal enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   Purdy, 58, said she decided to retire so she can spend more time
with her family and travel but didn't rule out returning to teaching
or even college administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't made any commitments yet, but I will be looking at
other opportunities," Purdy said.</TE>
<TE>   The search for her successor has begun, and the district board is
expected to pick a new president by the end of the school year.</TE>

<HD>4 Face Charges in Simi Rape Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: The San Fernando Valley men are also accused of
drugging the 18-year-old student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four San Fernando Valley men accused of drugging and raping an
18-year-old Simi Valley student this month appeared in Ventura County
Superior Court on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Jafari, Yan Karim and Jeffrey Pineda, all 19, and Dejon Lee,
22, did not enter pleas. They were ordered back to court Feb. 25
after their attorneys told the judge they needed more time to review
reports in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The four men face charges of forcible gang rape, rape with the use
of drugs, robbery and related allegations that could send each to
prison for more than 45 years.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Los Angeles attorney Leonard B. Levine, who
represents Pineda, said the young men are innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully expect when all the evidence comes out they will be
exonerated," Levine said. "They adamantly deny any wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   The men were arrested by Simi Valley police near the Ronald Reagan
Freeway about 5:30 a.m. Jan. 11, about 1 1/2 hours after the alleged
victim's roommate called police to report a rape.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Pineda knew the alleged victim and had
arrived with his three friends earlier that night at the home where
she was renting a room. The woman let them into the house. The men
had an alcoholic drink and gave her a glass of water.</TE>
<TE>   They all went to her bedroom to watch television, police said. The
woman later became aware that she was disrobed and being sexually
assaulted by the men, who allegedly ignored her pleas to stop, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the men took some of her belongings.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's blood and liquids found at the scene were tested.
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. David Lehr said preliminary findings
indicate she had been drugged with Ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda, Lee and Karim are residents of North Hollywood; Jafari
lives in Studio City. They all remain free on $250,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>School's End: 'Devastating'</HD>
<DH>Education: A day after Irvine Unified voted to close Los
Naranjos Elementary, the campus' mood is grim. Cuts will hurt
districtwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between math, reading and playtime, a lot of tears were shed
Wednesday as kids, their parents and teachers at Irvine's Los
Naranjos Elementary School grappled with the news.</LD>
<LD>   The night before, board members in the cash-strapped Irvine
Unified School District voted to close the 28-year-old campus, then
followed it up with a long list of drastic cuts to erase a projected
$5.2-million shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's devastating," parent Jennifer Alcaraz said of the plan to
close the school in June. "My kids have been here since kindergarten.
Now my fourth-grader is having a hard time adjusting."</LD>
<TE>   To balance the budget, board members Tuesday also eliminated
smaller class sizes in kindergarten, second and third grades
districtwide and cut back science and music programs. More than 120
teachers could receive layoff notices this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Those cuts hurt. But in a city designed around the concept of
small, community campuses at the center of village-like developments,
the loss of the first neighborhood school represents a major change
in philosophy. It would be only the second time the district has
closed a school. An elementary school at El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station was closed along with the base.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a double whammy," Los Naranjos principal Adelle Yeaton
said. Not only will her students and teachers have larger classes and
fewer arts and science programs, they will lose their campus and
their identity as a community. Students at Los Naranjos will get
first dibs in applying to other district schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful that their budget picture is not likely to brighten in the
near future, Irvine board members late Tuesday night warned that more
schools might be facing closure and appointed a task force to study
the viability of their trademark neighborhood campuses. Small
campuses are more expensive to operate than larger ones, and many
districts did away with them long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a departure from ... very, very small schools
that are, in some cases, a stone's throw from each other," Supt.
Patricia Clark White said. "We need schools that have a more robust
attendance and can weather the ups and downs of the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Los Naranjos has suffered from declining enrollment, and
would have lost many more students in the fall when a new school
opens in the Oak Creek development. Oak Creek children now attend Los
Naranjos.</TE>
<TE>   Parents, teachers and children say they are trying to accept
this--but it still stings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad," said Penny Knox, who has taught at the school for 16
years. "I feel like my family is being scattered.... We are losing
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Many at the school Wednesday talked of the special role the school
has played in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Baron, who was principal for a decade before leaving four
years ago to head up Lakeside Middle School, said he could not stay
away from the school when he heard of its closure.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled how it rallied around its children during the Gulf
War. Back then, the Tustin Marine Corps Air Facility still was open
and many children whose parents fought in the Persian Gulf attended
the school.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents expressed shock at the problems besetting the
district.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea," said Terry Spidell, mother of first- and
fourth-graders. Spidell said her family just moved to California from
Texas and chose Irvine specifically for its vaunted school system.
After learning that the campus will close and her second-grader will
have 32 students in the class next year, she's not sure they'll stay.</TE>
<TE>   One child even took matters into his own hands to try to save the
school. When Steven S. Choi, president of the school board, visited
Los Naranjos last week, Wesley Creighton, 6, ran up to him and
donated the entire contents of his piggy bank toward the school:
$1.11.</TE>
<TE>   Choi brought the money to the school board meeting Tuesday and
donated it, in Wesley's name, to the Irvine Public Schools
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "When young children break their piggy banks, I wonder what their
parents should do," an emotional Choi told board members. "It broke
my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Avie Creighton, Wesley's mother, said Wednesday that her son cried
himself to sleep Tuesday night after learning his school would be
closed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go to any other school," Wesley said Wednesday,
explaining that he wanted Los Naranjos to stay open so badly he
donated all his money. "But it wasn't enough."</TE>

<HD>His 80-Year Recess Is Over</HD>
<DH>Learning: After dropping out of school in the 1920s, Cecil
Smith, 94, of Westlake Village becomes the oldest known recipient of
the GED.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The topic was: What have you learned since leaving school?</LD>
<LD>   At first, the question rattled 94-year-old Cecil Smith, who, after
all, had last attended class when Warren G. Harding was president.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, he did well enough on the essay and four other test
segments to become the oldest known recipient of the GED--a
credential certifying knowledge equivalent to that of a high school
graduate and, in Smith's case, then some.</LD>
<TE>   A modest man with a strong voice and senatorial white hair, Smith
hadn't cracked a textbook since dropping out of MacLean Junior High
School in Terre Haute, Ind., at the age of 14. Eighty years later, he
slowly donned cap and gown for a special ceremony Wednesday at the
Conejo Valley Adult School in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an honor," he told an assemblage of friends,
relatives, school district officials and politicians' emissaries.
"It's certainly appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   An upholsterer by trade, Smith has never done much public
speaking. But he held his own at the school ceremony and has agreed
to give a brief pep talk for state prison inmates at Norco.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell them they can do the same thing if they'd put
their mind to it," Smith said. "It'd be a good thing for them."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1942, the General Education Development test has offered a
second chance to adults who leave school early. The average age of
the 865,000 people who took it in 2000 was 25, but record-keeping
through the years has been inconsistent, according to officials of
the American Council on Education, which administers the test.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ben Justesen, a director for the national GED Testing
Service, said he never has heard of a GED recipient older than Smith.
He knew of a 90-year-old man in Arizona who earned the credential,
and a woman who received it at 65 and got a doctorate 25 years later.</TE>
<TE>   "We've checked on it with all the institutional memories we could
put out a call to," Justesen said. "I found no one any older than
Cecil Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Smith didn't count on all the fuss--the chocolate cake,
the TV camera, the official proclamations, the commendation from
President Bush. But he appeared to relish the idea, dressing in a
tuxedo for the occasion and murmuring, "Well, this is just wonderful"
with the reading of each congratulatory note.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith didn't take the test to inspire others or prove a point
about the capabilities of the very old. It's just that his penmanship
had gone downhill, and he figured it was time to improve it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't write every day for 80 years, you get pretty
rusty," he said. "I was married for 61 years and my wife did all the
correspondence. About all I did was sign checks--and I was getting
pretty bad at that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1922, both of Smith's parents died, his mother from cancer and
his father from a lung disease picked up in the coal mines. One of 13
children, he bunked with relatives for a while before finding his own
room and a job. Within a few years, he was learning upholstery at a
furniture factory in Grand Rapids, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Like millions during the Depression, he and his young wife Joanne
came to California. They pitched a tent on the beach, found jobs, and
50 years ago bought two acres near Malibu's Paradise Cove for
$10,000. Peacocks roamed the little spread that would be Smith's home
even after Joanne's death in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We grew our own vegetables," Smith said, beaming at the memory.
"We had goats and chickens and ducks and bees."</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, Smith has lived with relatives in Westlake
Village. Age has chipped away at him; his vision is failing, he wears
three hearing aids, he has an artificial hip, and for 10 years he has
dealt with prostate cancer. Fascinated by electric cars, he bought
one just for the joy of it, although he can't drive it himself. He
has taken a fancy to Verdi's operas and savors a cocktail every
evening. When he can, he loves to waltz.</TE>
<TE>   For all his interests, he never had expressed a desire to complete
his education. But when his nephew Dick Kirkland mentioned that he
had read something about GED classes at the local adult school, Smith
was enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in his daily routine prepared him for this," Kirkland
said. "I suspect he has an ability to figure things out that we never
recognized."</TE>
<TE>   The GED test is given in sections that cover math, science, social
studies, reading and writing. Poring over study materials at home,
Smith came to school and relentlessly attacked each section.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to stop for lunch," said Melissa Nickles, a
supervisor at the school.</TE>
<TE>   So what has he learned since leaving school?</TE>
<TE>   Smith paused before he spoke, as if to assign the proper weight to
every word and the spaces between them.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I learned was to get a job and learn a trade," he
said. "Then in Malibu, I learned how to make chain-link fences, and
how to take care of goats and bees. You've really got to know what
you're doing to take care of bees."</TE>
<TE>   As for the future, he said he plans to pick up a few computer
skills. And to buy a three-wheeled bike for exercise.</TE>
<TE>   And college?</TE>
<TE>   "Not right away," he said, only half-joking.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Library Addition Plan Advances</HD>
<DH>Services: City Council approves the blueprint for a
20,000-square-foot expansion. About half of the $10.5-million wing
will be for children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a new children's section and much needed extra seating at
Thousand Oaks' main library moved forward this week, with conceptual
approval of a 20,000-square-foot expansion for the Janss Road
facility.</LD>
<LD>   About half of the new wing will be dedicated to children's
services, which library officials hope will include a permanent story
time area.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2,000 people use the library each day, and 45% of the
book circulation is in the children's collection, said Stephen
Brogden, library services director.</LD>
<TE>   The current 3,000-square-foot children's area has been in need of
expansion for more than a decade, Brogden said, but the project was
delayed in 1991 when the Newbury Park branch library opened and again
in 1994 after the Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, Brogden presented the City Council with two
expansion options--one adding 20,000 square feet to the south side of
the library, and the other adding the same amount of space to the
north side.</TE>
<TE>   Council members voted unanimously to support the south-side
addition, partly because the other option would have required
reconfiguring the library's main entrance, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The option chosen will be less disruptive for patrons during
construction, fits better with the library and a nearby teen center
and is more likely to stay within the $10.5-million budget,
Councilman Andy Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The main disadvantage to the south-side expansion is that patrons
will have to walk farther from the main entrance to the new
children's section. It also may require the library to staff an extra
help desk.</TE>
<TE>   "Both have their pluses and minuses," Brogden said. "I just feel
we're very lucky to be able to add 20,000 square feet. It's an
example of how this community supports its library."</TE>
<TE>   The move should also resolve the noise problems that now occur
with the children's area being situated next to the reference
section.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want the children to stop making noise," Brogden said.
"We want to give them their own space to make the noise in."</TE>
<TE>   The addition's other 10,000 square feet will house staff desks
that will create more seating space on the library floor, Brogden
said. Several seating areas had to be removed in the mid-1990s to
make room for bookshelves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The council has set aside $6.5 million in capital improvement
funds to fund the project. The other $4 million will come from bonds
the city renewed in December.</TE>
<TE>   Killefer Flammang Purtill Architects will spend the next six to
nine months drafting plans for the new wing. Construction should take
nine months to a year, Brogden said.</TE>

<LD>A cold snap that dropped temperatures below 30 degrees Tuesday did
not damage local agriculture, but officials warn that continuing
frosty weather this week remains a threat to fragile strawberry,
avocado, citrus and flower crops.</LD>
<LD>   Temperatures fell below 30 degrees in Santa Paula on Tuesday night
but didn't stay there long enough to damage crops, said David
Buettner, chief deputy agricultural commissioner for Ventura County.
Serious damage occurs when temperatures stay around 26 or 28 degrees
for four to six hours, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Growers mitigated damage with wind machines that warmed the air
and by watering the soil under citrus trees to release heat.</LD>
<TE>   More sub-30-degree weather was expected Wednesday night and
tonight, but temperatures are expected to rise after that, said
meteorologist Terry Schaeffer, who provides forecasts for local
growers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there will be any damage in protected areas and
perhaps minor damage in unprotected areas," Schaeffer said.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura woman has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of
wrongfully possessing a person's confidential criminal history while
working at the Ventura Police Department, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   At her boyfriend's request, Kelly Lane Dean, 42, used a workplace
computer in October to access the criminal history of an unidentified
third party, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Temple.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of her job, Dean had access to the computer to
obtain criminal histories of drug and sex offenders in Ventura, but
the records she obtained in October were not part of her official
duties, Temple said.</LD>

<LD>A career criminal from Ventura County who served time in prison for
rape and shooting a police officer will stand trial on suspicion of
stealing $12 worth of goods from a grocery store and could receive a
life sentence, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Steven Herrera, 56, was ordered held over for trial on
charges of commercial burglary and petty theft during a preliminary
hearing Tuesday in Santa Barbara County Superior Court, officials
said. Because this would be his third felony conviction, Herrera
faces life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Herrera, formerly of Santa Paula, is accused of stealing a bottle
of wine, breath spray and lip balm from a Vons in Carpinteria on Jan.
5. He has pleaded not guilty and remains held in lieu of $250,000
bail.</LD>

<HD>City Gets Earful From Impatient Wal-Mart Patrons</HD>
<DH>Retailing: Huntington Beach City Hall fields hundreds of
calls after blocking the store's plan to open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach officials Wednesday bore the wrath of hundreds of
would-be Wal-Mart shoppers who called City Hall demanding to know why
the city wouldn't let the store open on schedule.</LD>
<LD>   "I tell them the store will open as soon as it satisfies the
requirements," said Mayor Debbie Cook, who fielded several calls.
Wal-Mart officials "are trying to strong-arm the city," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's scheduled opening of the Wal-Mart, long fought by
nearby residents because of traffic and noise concerns, was postponed
because the store failed an electrical inspection and didn't complete
several projects at nearby Lambert Park that were required by the
city, Cook said.</LD>
<TE>   The park improvements include adding some railing, improving
handicapped access and doing some sandblasting.</TE>
<TE>   "They set an artificial [opening] date," she said. "Why should an
emergency on their part suddenly constitute an emergency on our part?
Should we automatically give them a permit just because they're
Wal-Mart?"</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart spokesman Robert S. McAdam said he had spent most of the
day dealing with the "endless stream of cars" bearing customers who
had to be turned away. People were given fliers telling them to call
the city for more information.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been letting them know that we are waiting for a
certificate of occupancy from the city," he said, adding that the
store was "absolutely ready to go" with employees stocking shelves
and cleaning. "At some point they'll run out of chores to do."</TE>
<TE>   The electrical problems were corrected immediately after Tuesday's
inspection, and the park projects will probably be completed by
Friday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All we have to do is fire up our computers," McAdam said. "From
the time we get our certificate, it will take us about 30 minutes to
get up and running."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's response: When the company completes the required
work, "we'll be out there in 30 minutes to inspect."</TE>

<HD>Beware the Barbies at the Gate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense
of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to study terrorism</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experts have linked Enron's collapse and the resulting panic among
corporate insurers to the fall of Kmart, which just filed for bankruptcy,
the largest retail filing ever.</LD>
<LD>   The ramifications stretch wide and take in iconic spokesperson Martha
Stewart, the doyenne of American domesticity. Her company, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia, got up to one-third of its pretax profit from
merchandising, which is primarily the products sold at Kmart. What will
happen now is anybody's guess.</LD>
<LD>   This week, another blond goddess emblematic of 1990s opulence and
American cultural preeminence-the unsinkable Tina Brown-also came to
grief. The former Vanity Fair and New Yorker editor, Clinton lackey and
multimedia maven's latest project, the 2-year-old Talk magazine, just
sank.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, by itself, the downsizing of two Barbies doesn't presage
doom. But as only the most recent mishaps in the current market
plunge-the full force of which we've only just begun to feel-they matter.
Prosperity, the kind that fueled the Martha Stewart lifestyle and Talk
celebrity style, depends on security, both physical and financial. In
these days of corporate failure and ever-impending terror, we can't
forget that. American military presence abroad means the survival of much
more than markets. Nothing less than our continued existence is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Sound alarmist?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. But while we may not think that Osama bin Laden's grand plan
for our destruction has a prayer of succeeding, some of it already has.
Razing the World Trade Center was more than symbolic. Bin Laden intended
to hobble our economy, the basis for our global superiority and
dominance. And while it's true that we were heading into a recession
before Sept. 11, it is equally true that the disaster's fiscal ripple
effect has hurled us down a well where every drop in the water makes
waves.</TE>
<TE>   It might be instructive to remember that Britain once was just a swath
of weeds at edge of the Roman Empire. Back then, no one imagined that
Rome would ever fall or that Britannia would one day rule the waves. And
who could have foreseen that a few religious fanatics in a shabby colony
called New England would, in turn, shrug off their keepers and run the
world?</TE>
<TE>   Nations and empires come and go, and we in the United States cannot
assume that we will reign forever. Complacency often is the fatal flaw of
emperors, and we have of late been shaken out of ours. But have we been
shaken hard enough?</TE>
<TE>   In his 18th century masterwork, 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire,' Edward Gibbon wrote: 'The decline of Rome was the natural and
inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the
principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent
of conquest. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the
strength and courage of barbarians.'</TE>
<TE>   Who will be our barbarians? Bin Laden? Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay?
Miramax and Hearst, the corporate parents who pulled the plug on Talk
magazine?</TE>
<TE>   As Martha Stewart might say, a wake-up call is a good thing.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Argentine Leader Faces Bribery Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Swiss and Argentine authorities are investigating an allegation
that former Argentine President Carlos Menem received a $10-million bribe
from Iranian agents to cover up Tehran's alleged role in an anti-Semitic
terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires in 1994, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Swiss authorities opened an inquiry in Geneva last week based on a
request from Argentines investigating the van bomb attack that killed 85
people at the Argentine-Israelite Mutual Assn. community center,
according to Folco Galli, a spokesman for the Swiss Federal Justice
Office.</LD>
<LD>   In October, Swiss authorities froze nearly $10 million in two bank
accounts allegedly linked to Menem during a separate Argentine
investigation of an international arms trafficking ring, Galli said in an
interview.</LD>
<TE>   Now a magistrate in Geneva is pursuing testimony of a former Iranian
spy who told Argentine investigators that Menem was paid $10 million via
a Swiss bank in exchange for a promise to say there was no proof against
Iran in the terrorist attack, according to Swiss and Argentine officials.</TE>
<TE>   One frozen account is in a Geneva bank in the name of Menem's daughter
and former wife, Galli said. The other account bears the name of a
company allegedly linked to Menem, he said, and investigators want to
know whether Menem had additional Swiss accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In a post-Sept. 11 world focused on terrorism, the case contributes to
renewed concern about Iran's alleged sponsorship of Hezbollah and other
terrorist groups. Argentine, U.S. and Israeli officials are convinced
that the Jewish center bombing and an unsolved 1992 bombing of the
Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires were the work of Iranian spies and
Hezbollah with local accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the Swiss accounts comes after years of accusations
that Menem and his inner circle made millions from kickbacks and arms and
drug trafficking. He has repeatedly denied such charges.</TE>
<TE>Political Plans Sinking Under Claims</TE>
<TE>   But the allegation that Menem helped engineer a cover-up in the 1994
attack speeds the downfall of the former leader, who recently announced
that he will run for president again in 2003. His 1989-99 presidency was
a whirlwind of scandal and free-market transformation that spurred rapid
growth and made him a favorite of U.S. diplomats and investors. Weakened
by skyrocketing debt, however, the Argentine economy foundered in his
final years in office and has slid into all-out collapse in recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   Although Argentina's Supreme Court ordered his release from house
arrest in the arms case late last year, Menem remains the target of
corruption probes and public condemnation in a crisis-torn country
governed by his archenemy, newly installed President Eduardo Duhalde.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Menem, the son of Syrian immigrants, obstructed the Jewish
center and embassy bombing investigations to hide his government's ties
to Middle Eastern terrorism and organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We always had many obstacles of all kinds," prosecutor Jose
Barbaccia, who has worked on the 1994 case since the bombing, said in a
phone interview. "We never saw the supposed political will translated
into deeds. For example, the police anti-terrorist squad was created
three years after the attack. For a long time, we worked with only eight
police investigators."</TE>
<TE>   Argentine investigators will probably seek to question Menem after the
Swiss have had time to investigate, Barbaccia said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is true, we are not just talking about [corrupt cops] but
total political protection," Barbaccia said. "But the [Iranian] witness
did not give an exact date or an account number. That makes the
investigation more difficult. We have to interrogate this witness again
now that we know about the accounts. And we must see what the Swiss
find."</TE>
<TE>   No one was charged in the embassy case. In the Jewish center case, a
small-time gangster and a group of police officers are on trial for
allegedly providing the stolen van that was used as a rolling bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The new Iran-related investigation could be another in a series of
promising leads that ran into dead ends. It could even be attempted
retaliation by Duhalde against Menem, who has criticized the president's
handling of the economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "My first reaction was that it might be Duhalde getting back at
Menem," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which has followed the Argentine cases closely and has
pushed for answers. "You are always going to have to take what happens in
this case with not a grain of salt, but a quarry of salt."</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish center case figured in a brutal feud between Menem and
Duhalde that began in 1996 when Duhalde was governor of Buenos Aires
province and a presidential hopeful determined to thwart Menem's designs
on a third term. Many observers saw the federal indictment of police
officers from Duhalde's province as terrorist accomplices as a political
ambush by the Menem administration. Duhalde soon returned fire when
provincial authorities filed murder charges against a mysterious tycoon
close to Menem in an unrelated case.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, now there is a money trail to follow. And the Swiss
justice system is well removed from Argentine political intrigue.</TE>
<TE>   "If this turns out to be a smoking gun," Cooper said, "we want a
commitment from the Argentine judicial and political leadership that this
man goes on trial."</TE>
<TE>Latest Development Was Slow in Coming</TE>
<TE>   Like other developments in a glacially slow case, this one did not
happen overnight. The secret witness, who was once the No. 3 official in
Iran's spy service, first testified to Argentine investigators in 1998 in
Germany, where he lived under the protection of German authorities and
helped resolve Iranian terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   The witness, identified only as C, testified that Iranian agents
masterminded the 1994 bombing but said he had information he would
withhold until Menem left power, according to Argentine officials. Soon
after Menem stepped down, the witness testified again, this time in
Mexico. He told interrogators about the alleged bribe in Switzerland,
saying Iranian operatives paid it either directly to Menem or someone
close to him, Barbaccia said.</TE>
<TE>   The witness testified that the money changed hands as investigators
zeroed in on Iranian diplomats in Argentina--police eventually said a
cultural attache was the suspected mastermind.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Menem's comments about the case mixed promises of
justice with steadfast defenses of his government. The victims' families
complained that he never met with them to express condolences.</TE>

<HD>American Talib in U.S. Jail Awaiting Conspiracy Trial</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Citing need to reorganize, officials suspend transfers
of Al Qaeda suspects to Cuba.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As John Walker Lindh returned to U.S. soil to face conspiracy
charges, the Pentagon on Wednesday abruptly suspended all future
transfers of Al Qaeda suspects from Afghanistan to the Guantanamo Bay
Naval Base in Cuba, saying that U.S. intelligence officials need more
time to prepare for interrogations.</LD>
<LD>   Walker, the 20-year-old Northern Californian captured in Afghanistan
while fighting for the Taliban, arrived in shackles Wednesday night at
Dulles International Airport outside Washington and was taken to the
Alexandria, Va., city jail.</LD>
<LD>   He is to make his first appearance in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria at 9 a.m. EST today on charges of conspiracy to aid the
American enemy. Walker faces a possible sentence of life in prison with
no parole.</LD>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said they halted the transfers to Guantanamo Bay
until intelligence agents can assemble there and organize their efforts
to question the suspects about the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes and whether
any more attacks might be in the works.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 158 men are incarcerated in makeshift wire cages at the naval
base, and 270 more are being held in the Afghanistan region awaiting U.S.
military flights to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials sharply denied that the transfer postponement was
due to rising criticism of treatment of the detainees in Cuba, and
President Bush said that the American public "should be proud" of what is
being done to demobilize the terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lucas, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Southern Command in
Florida, which has helped coordinate the flights to Cuba, predicted that
the air transfers to Cuba will resume once intelligence officials are
ready to start interrogating detainees.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking a pause while we ensure that a joint interagency
intelligence apparatus is fully up and functional so they can start
gathering information at Guantanamo Bay," Lucas said. "But our military
base is ready to continue accepting the flow. We have a hospital in place
now, and we've expanded the temporary facilities for detainees."</TE>
<TE>   He said the federal agencies that will interrogate the detainees first
need "to make sure everything is in place so they can get to work. It's a
very important function, and some of it will undoubtedly be valuable and
productive."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas said the postponement also will grant workers at the Cuban base
more time to continue building holding facilities. Initial plans had
called for as many as 2,000 detainees to be held there.</TE>
<TE>   Although the detainees now are housed in outdoor cages, he said, work
will soon begin on permanent cells with roofs and three walls. He said
that configuration will make the cells safe for the detainees and also
permit guards to watch the inmates closely.</TE>
<TE>   The new base field hospital, Lucas said, will be similar to an Army
MASH unit with triage facilities, an operating room and other
accouterments.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also announced that a Muslim Navy chaplain is in Cuba to
minister to the detainees. He was identified as Lt. Abuhena
Saif-ul-Islam, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Bangladesh. Saif-ul-Islam,
the first Muslim chaplain to serve the Marine Corps, most recently was
assigned to Camp Pendleton in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The new developments at Guantanamo come as the military was hit with a
round of criticism by clergy, lawyers and civil liberties groups
complaining that detainees were being mishandled.</TE>
<TE>   The critics were upset after seeing photographs released by the
Pentagon showing detainees in leg shackles and hand manacles, with
surgical masks over their mouths and goggles covering their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the criticisms came from the International Committee of the Red
Cross, which in Geneva issued an "advisory" that the U.S. may have
unintentionally violated the Geneva Convention over the treatment of war
prisoners by releasing the photos. The Pentagon released the photos after
news media complaints about lack of access to and information about the
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not allowed to submit prisoners to public humiliation," said
Kim Gordon-Bates, a Washington spokesman for the international committee.</TE>
<TE>   He added that it "was just basically a soft advisory" to alert the
United States of the potential problem and that the committee was
unlikely to officially challenge the United States over the matter.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, in a meeting with Washington lawmakers, stressed that
the detainees are being treated humanely, a theme he has sounded for
several days as the criticism has heated up.</TE>
<TE>   Later, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush is "perfectly
satisfied" with the arrangement in Cuba, adding that if the detainees had
not been scooped up, "they would engage in murder once again."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was meeting with FBI
agents and Afghan officials in Kandahar, said the FBI and other U.S.
intelligence agencies have already gleaned critical information from war
prisoners that has prevented some attacks against U.S. targets worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. officials have made similar comments, including that
information from detainees helped foil a terrorist plot in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "Information we have picked up since the war has prevented additional
attacks around the world," Mueller said. "Interrogations from Al Qaeda
members detained here in Afghanistan as well as documents . . . [have]
prevented additional attacks against U.S. facilities around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller declined to be specific.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, attorney James Brosnahan of San Francisco, who was hired by
Walker's parents but has yet to meet with him, said the parents were
given a letter Wednesday from their son dated Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Brosnahan quoted Walker as writing to his parents: "It
is comforting to know that you have found a lawyer" and mentioning
Brosnahan by name.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said that John Walker, as he is named in court
documents, has waived his right to an attorney several times in the weeks
since his arrest in early December. He spent most of that time aboard the
warship Bataan in the Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview late Wednesday, Brosnahan criticized Bush
administration officials for suggesting that Walker did not know his
parents had hired a team of lawyers to represent him.</TE>
<TE>   "As far back as Jan. 8, John has acknowledged he was glad his family
found lawyers for him," the attorney said. "I don't know what this white
noise from the mahogany foxholes of the Defense Department is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan said: "His family is desperate to meet with their son. We
want to try and see him. But we're not going to confront anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan told Associated Press that he escorted Walker's parents,
Frank Lindh and Marilyn Walker, to the jail where their son is being
held, but they were unable to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Wednesday that the investigation of
the young man continues.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists did not compel John Walker Lindh to join them," Ashcroft
said. "John Walker Lindh chose terrorists. Our American system of justice
will allow Walker the rights and due process that the terrorists he
fought side by side with sought, and still seek, to destroy."</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks $48-Billion Defense Hike</HD>
<DH>Spending: President says the extra funding is needed next year for
the fight against terrorism, weapons and a pay raise. He vows to 'win the
first war of the 21st century.'</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Wednesday that he will ask Congress for a
$48-billion defense budget increase next year to help pay for the war on
terrorism, futuristic weapon systems and a military pay raise.</LD>
<LD>   "We will invest in more precision weapons, in missile defenses, in
unmanned vehicles, in high-tech equipment for soldiers on the ground,"
the president said in a speech to military reserve officers. "Whatever it
takes, whatever it costs, this patient, this resolved nation will win the
first war of the 21st century."</LD>
<LD>   Bush's proposed 14% increase from this year's $331-billion defense
budget would mark the largest spending boost, on a percentage basis,
since the defense buildups under Presidents Carter and Reagan two decades
ago. The $379-billion plan will be part of the 2003 budget that Bush
sends to Congress on Feb. 4.</LD>
<TE>   A defense official said the administration plans to request a
$10-billion contingency for war operations, suggesting that the Pentagon
plans to continue its war on terrorism at about the current pace.</TE>
<TE>   The 3 1/2-month-old war in Afghanistan has added $3.8 billion to the
defense budget, or roughly $1 billion a month. The three-month war in
Kosovo cost the Defense Department an extra $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have Congress and the rest of the world appreciate that
we'll still be engaged in the war on terrorism," a defense official said
on condition of anonymity. "This is our best appreciation of what we're
going to need to start to get there."</TE>
<TE>   The contingency fund would allow the Pentagon to carry the war to
other fronts, such as those often mentioned as terrorist host states:
Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq. Hundreds of U.S. military advisors are
already in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sizable chunk of money by historical standards," said Steven
Kosiak, director of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments. "It's a very significant and intensive involvement
in some kind of overseas missions that go above and beyond what we would
normally be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said Wednesday that he intended to ask Congress for "a major
new increase" in spending for homeland security, such as hiring 300 more
FBI agents, modernizing public health labs, stockpiling medicines and
earmarking funds for local police officers and fire and rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people are on watch against future attacks. And so with
their government," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He did not elaborate on spending for homeland security, but Mitchell
E. Daniels Jr., Bush's budget director, has been quoted as saying that
the amount would be $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>In Reversal, Deficit to Total $106 Billion</TE>
<TE>   Bush tipped his hand on the military budget even as Daniels reported
that the administration now estimates that the budget for this year is
$106 billion in deficit, a dramatic reversal from the $231-billion
surplus that the administration foresaw only a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The budget director also predicted that the deficit for fiscal 2003,
which begins Oct. 1, will be $80 billion rather than the $242-billion
surplus the administration had foreseen a year ago. Daniels also said the
budget would show a fiscal 2004 deficit of $14 billion before returning
to surplus the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has blamed the recession, which he insists began before he took
office, and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for the return to deficit
spending.</TE>
<TE>   "The tools of modern warfare are effective," he said. "They are
expensive. But in order to win this war against terror, they are
essential. Buying these tools may put a strain on the budget, but we will
not cut corners when it comes to the defense of our great land."</TE>
<TE>   Salaries would rise by at least 4% for military personnel, a Pentagon
official said. That comes on top of a 5% increase in 2002. Housing funds
would also increase.</TE>
<TE>   Bush urged Congress to approve the funds, which could also go far to
pay for the military modernization program launched under the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who review our budget must understand that we are asking a lot
of our men and women in uniform, and we'll be asking more of them in the
future," the president said. "In return, they deserve every resource,
every weapon needed to achieve the final and full victory."</TE>
<TE>   Although Pentagon officials "remain committed to missile defense," a
Pentagon official said, that budget would remain at the 2002 level of
about $8.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But as Bush made clear, it would also include money to buy equipment
that has proved itself in the Afghan war. A priority is replacing the
bombs and equipment being used in Afghanistan, defense officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The first unmanned planes armed with Tomahawk missiles and precision
weapons such as a wind-corrected cluster bomb made their debut there.
Stockpiles of laser- and satellite-guided weapons, never huge, have been
rapidly depleted as thousands rained on Afghan soil.</TE>
<TE>   "Ammunition is a key inventory," a senior Navy official said. "We do
not have and will not have the numbers we'd like to have in our
inventories for years. Is there a risk of running out? It all depends on
how quickly we use them."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials also want to replace aging ships and planes. The
Navy carrier John F. Kennedy, slated to replace the Theodore Roosevelt in
the Arabian Sea, failed an inspection last month. The B-52 bombers and
refueling tankers used in Afghanistan are more than 40 years old.</TE>
<TE>Hike Would Outpace Reagan Increase</TE>
<TE>   Some defense analysts remained skeptical of the Bush buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opening bid; the game is not over," said Gordon Adams, a
former Office of Management and Budget official in charge of defense
spending who is now director of security policy studies at George
Washington University. "It's not always clear that the Pentagon knows how
to spend money wisely when it gets this much all at once."</TE>
<TE>   John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, complained
that Bush's proposed defense spending increase outpaced even the spending
burst at the beginning of the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the increase from last year is greater than the military budget
of any other nation in the world," Isaacs said. "We now spend more on our
military than the rest of the world combined."</TE>
<TE>   Many members of Congress welcomed Bush's proposals, if only because
few dare speak ill of Pentagon spending at a time of war and domestic
anxiety about terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be we will even consider increasing it," said Sen. Ted Stevens
of Alaska, ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Even Democrats who have been critical of Bush for allowing deficits to
blossom did not speak ill of his defense proposal, even if they did not
immediately endorse it either.</TE>
<TE>   "Our top priority is to defend the nation," said Sen. Kent Conrad
(D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "We will provide the
resources to do it." But he warned that there would be no "blank check"
for defense.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said it was too early to
say how much Congress would provide for defense, adding, "We recognize
we're fighting a war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks to the 80,000-member reserve officers group, Bush also
renewed his call on Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill.</TE>
<TE>   'It's time to set aside all of the politics, all the posturing and
figure out how to take care of workers whose lives were affected because
of the attacks on 9/11,' Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said he intends to bring the bill to the Senate floor today,
although he failed to win a Republican agreement to limit the number of
permissible floor amendments. Without such an understanding, Republicans
can continue to offer amendments until Daschle gives up and pulls the
bill off the floor.</TE>
<TE>   After clearing the House, the bill stalled at the end of last year,
with Bush and Republicans supporting a version that would provide $90
billion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals as well as extended
benefits for unemployed people. Democrats opposed that version, saying it
would do too little for the unemployed and cut taxes too deeply for the
affluent.</TE>

<HD>Beware the 401(k) Gamble</HD>
<DH>Enron workers aren't the only ones rolling the dice with retirement
savings. But efforts to limit investment in employer stock meet bitter
resistance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Until recently, the flood of millions of working people into the
stock market, principally through their retirement accounts, was hailed
as evidence that Americans at all economic levels can make it on their
own.</LD>
<LD>   Then Enron Corp. collapsed, throwing thousands out of work and
destroying the retirement nest eggs of thousands more. While
investigators search for clues of foul play, Washington is rushing in
with legislative fixes--including proposals to limit how much company
stock can go into retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   For many, it is too late. The collapse of Enron's retirement
arrangements is only the latest in a series of similar financial fiascoes
during the last decade. But hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of
Americans continue to shoulder the same kinds of risk borne by Enron
workers before their savings evaporated.</LD>
<TE>   "We're fooling ourselves if we think Enron is a scandal that doesn't
have anything to do with the rest of us," said Norman P. Stein, a member
of the Labor Department's employee retirement advisory council and a
University of Alabama law professor. "What happened to Enron workers
could happen to you."</TE>
<TE>   The reason is a sea change in how Americans make financial provisions
for their old age. Working people have turned the stock market into their
retirement system, and themselves, rather than their corporate employers,
into retirement money managers.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals are now responsible for making the basic investment
decisions for half the nation's non-Social Security retirement savings,
rather than having those decisions made the old-fashioned way--by
employers who promise benefits no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   That is up from a little more than one-third in the early 1990s.
Individuals, together with big institutions, have pumped more than
two-thirds of the nation's $10 trillion-plus in public and private
retirement savings into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   So when the stock market takes off, as it did in the late 1990s, so
does America's retirement system. And when it tumbles, as it has in the
last two years, so do retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system that has succeeded in amassing a formidable pool of
capital and providing retirement benefits to millions of people," said J.
Mark Iwry, who as benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department until
last year was one of the most powerful regulators of the retirement
system in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, the self-direction of investments has shifted the
risk of retirement investment from employers to employees, and many
workers have ended up assuming imprudent amounts of it."</TE>
<TE>   They often have done so without even knowing what they did.</TE>
<TE>Retirees Look Back at Costly Errors</TE>
<TE>   Bill Quinlin certainly didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The 65-year-old Robstown, Texas, resident retired from Enron several
years ago, after nearly three decades as a gas pipeline operator, to care
for his dying mother. He had nearly all his retirement savings, save a
small pension and Social Security, in 25,000 shares of Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   When the stock was at its height at better than $80 a share and
Quinlin was a paper millionaire, a friend suggested he sell some of his
holdings.</TE>
<TE>   But Quinlin said he could not bring himself to do it, largely because
the place was being run by Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, who
resigned late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lay had saved a utility where Quinlin once worked. And the executive
had come down every year or so while Quinlin was at the Corpus Christi
pump station to take the men out for barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that guy walked on water," Quinlin said recently of Lay.
"Why, if he walked in here this minute, I'd probably sit right down and
talk to him." Quinlin's shares have gone from being worth about $2
million to a couple of thousand.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Boyce said he didn't understand the risks he was shouldering
either, even though he is sophisticated in financial matters.</TE>
<TE>   The 67-year-old Minneapolis-area resident retired from Enron in March
2000 after almost two decades as a benefits executive and another decade
as a safety and security manager.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce said he was well aware that the world of retirement savings was
changing when Enron stopped offering old-fashioned pensions in the late
1980s and replaced them with plans such as 401(k) accounts, to which it
contributed fixed amounts of stock, but made no promise of what benefits
employees could expect when they retired.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to manage these accounts, and I was aware the best
protection was diversification" out of Enron stock and into other stocks
and mutual funds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Boyce ended up pumping about two-thirds of his retirement savings
into Enron because of the company's rapidly rising stock. In any case, he
reasoned, with the company in so many lines of business it represented a
diversified investment all on its own. Even if one business line failed,
another would take its place.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a normal person's question is: 'How stupid could you be?' "
But it was difficult to resist, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Quinlin, Boyce saw his Enron stock tumble almost $2 million in
value. He and his wife, Marilyn, have been forced to scrap the idea of
setting up trusts for their six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tough to swallow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that employees relied for retirement income on pensions
in which employers managed the funds, promised retirees a "defined
benefit" and kept excess profits or losses to themselves. The shift to
401(k)s, IRAs and employee stock ownership plans--in which employee
contributions are defined but benefits are left to market forces--is
usually portrayed as part of a titanic struggle between an old, dying,
paternalistic, industrial order and a new, freedom-filled,
entrepreneurial economy. And, in part, it has been just that.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first tried to sell the idea of the 401(k) to Bethlehem Steel
in 1981, they said, 'You don't understand; it's part of our culture to
take care of our people,' " recounted Ted Benna, a Bellefonte, Pa.,
consultant who is widely considered the "father of the 401(k)."</TE>
<TE>   "That paternalistic attitude has been blown away" by new technology,
globalization and Reaganite politics, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem with the old-versus-new portrayal is that it
overlooks two crucial facts. The first, as even Benna will concede, is
that 401(k)s and similar accounts were not originally intended to replace
traditional pensions and grew in a piecemeal fashion. The second is that
it was government tax subsidies, as much as market forces and individual
choice, that produced the new accounts. According to a variety of
regulators and lawmakers, that gives Washington a big responsibility for
making sure they are run well.</TE>
<TE>   "Society has a lot riding on people's retirement savings," said Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored legislation to restrict the
proportion of company stock such as Enron's in retirement accounts.
"We're paying for them with big tax breaks."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the tax break for pensions and retirement savings is the very
biggest that Washington offers, topping such giants as the mortgage
interest deduction and the employer tax exclusion for employee health
insurance, and amounting to about $100 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle Sam is the largest single investor in the retirement system and
has a legitimate interest in how it works," said Iwry, the former
Treasury official.</TE>
<TE>   Only it didn't work in the case of Enron. And, according to critics,
it could fail in the same way at some of the nation's other big
companies.</TE>
<TE>   In the investment world and at the casino, putting most of your chips
on one color--or most of your money in one stock--is a gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Before the fall, fully 60% of the money in Enron's 401(k) plan was in
Enron stock. But that hardly qualified the company for the top slot when
it comes to packing retirement plans with company stock.</TE>
<TE>   At consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble, the portion of P&amp;G stock in
the unusually generous retirement plans exceeds 90%, according to D.C.
Plan Investing, a financial newsletter. At Coca-Cola and General
Electric, it is about 80%. At McDonald's and Home Depot, it is just below
75%.</TE>
<TE>   "The single-largest source of excessive risk for employees in
retirement plans is undue concentration in employer stock," Iwry said.</TE>
<TE>Investment Industry Balks at Reform Efforts</TE>
<TE>   Most congressional proposals for what to do about the problem run
along one of two lines: imposing limits on the amount of company stock
allowed in plans or encouraging more investor education. Key critics,
including 401(k) inventor Benna, say that neither will work. In the case
of stock limits, even some of the authors concede the measure falls far
short of what is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer and Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) want to impose a 20% cap on
company stock and reduce the tax break that companies would get when they
contributed stock instead of cash. A similar House bill would reduce the
cap to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Both proposals have met with howls of protest from the investment
industry, which argues that individuals should have the right to invest
their money as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer is well acquainted with the argument; many of the same
objections were raised when the California Democrat tried to win similar
restrictions after floor retailer ColorTile Inc. went bankrupt five years
ago, wiping out employees' 401(k) savings. Her measure was eventually so
watered down it made almost no difference.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the investment industry enthusiastically supports a bill
by Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) that would encourage companies and
401(k) providers such as mutual fund groups to offer education and
financial advice by limiting their liability if their advice turns out to
be bad.</TE>
<TE>   Boehner acknowledged that his measure could pave the way for conflicts
of interest such as mutual funds advising employees to buy the fund's
products. But he said the danger could be limited by requiring that the
conflicts be disclosed. He asserted that there were no parallels with
Enron and others encouraging workers to invest in the companies' own
stock.</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson of Enron is diversify, diversify, diversify," Boehner
said. "What we've got to do is get that across to people by giving them
broader knowledge and access to advice." Critics say the Boehner bill is
an invitation for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Old-fashioned "defined benefit" plans follow diversification rules
that go beyond company stock and a requirement that retirement savings be
converted to an annuity, or fixed annual payment, when people retire to
ensure that they don't outlive their own finances and end up in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   To date, no lawmakers, even sharp critics, have publicly proposed
giving the same kind of protections to 401(k)s and the "defined
contribution" world.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is clear: Such restrictions would fly in the face of the
individual choice that has made 401(k)s so popular.</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs that some people are beginning to move in that
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Corzine, for example, said last week that the cap he and Boxer are
proposing for company stock should be extended to all assets in 401(k)
plans so that individuals could not put more than 20% of their retirement
savings in any one investment. Benna is pushing a plan to give companies
new protections against employee lawsuits over retirement accounts if
firms agree to effectively direct employees' investment options to a few
prearranged diversified portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes to say it, but people who don't know the difference
between stocks and bonds are being asked to pick particular ones," said
Stein, the Alabama law professor. "People are being given too many
decisions to make."</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1990s when the stock market was climbing 20% and 30% a
year, such views would have been dismissed out of hand. But with stocks
stumbling, the country under assault and polls showing Americans
increasingly concerned about "personal security," some believe there is a
chance for change.</TE>

<HD>Kenneth Lay Resigns as Enron Chairman</HD>
<DH>Probe: Creditors panel urges the move so new managers can oversee
reorganization.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Kenneth L. Lay was ousted Wednesday from Enron Corp., the Houston
company that he spent 15 years building into the world's largest energy
trader only to watch it crumble amid allegations of financial trickery.</LD>
<LD>   Enron announced it is beginning a search for a turnaround specialist
to save what is left of what was once the nation's seventh-largest
company, but which now holds the dubious distinction of having filed the
largest-ever bankruptcy petition.</LD>
<LD>   Lay said his decision to resign as chairman and chief executive was
reached in cooperation with Enron's board and the 15-member creditors'
committee selected as part of Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. Enron filed
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, listing more than $50 billion in assets
and more than $31 billion in debts.</LD>
<TE>   The bank-dominated creditors' committee had been pushing for Lay's
resignation so that new managers could oversee Enron's attempt to
reorganize and repay the money it owes, sources familiar with the
situation said. The decision was reached Wednesday morning during a board
meeting with Enron's far-flung directors checking in by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "The creditors just want a green-eyeshade guy who gets their money
back for them," one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay will remain a director of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone
at the helm who can focus 100% of his efforts on reorganizing the company
and preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay
said in a statement. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and
investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to
Enron's stakeholders."</TE>
<TE>   Lay, 59, has been named in more than 50 lawsuits, and his company's
disintegration is being investigated by several congressional committees,
the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   That Lay was tossed out comes as less of a surprise than the leisurely
time it took to do it, Enron watchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay held on as a series of damaging financial disclosures about murky
off-balance-sheet partnerships and overstated earnings hammered Enron's
stock price, wiping out billions of dollars of investor holdings and the
retirement savings of Enron employees.</TE>
<TE>   Lay survived a failed last-ditch merger attempt with cross-town rival
Dynegy Inc., which fled claiming that it hadn't realized the depths of
Enron's troubles. He lasted as Enron's debt plunged to junk status and
lenders turned their backs, causing an all but fatal cash crunch that
pushed Enron into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But the heat rose in the last few weeks with revelations that Lay and
other Enron executives contacted Bush administration officials late last
year seeking help for the flailing company, that Lay was touting the
stock to employees and urging them to buy shortly before Enron announced
its worst quarter in corporate history, that Lay was warned in August by
a company vice president of a possible corporate implosion if details of
the off-balance-sheet transactions became known and that documents were
shredded by Enron employees and those of its auditor, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever value remains in Enron to be realized, Lay's resignation
was necessary," said Edward Muller, an investor in energy ventures and
former president of Irvine-based Edison Mission Energy. It was necessary
because "Lay's presence, with an obvious personal interest, stood in the
way of decisions being made to realize value for creditors and move the
organization forward."</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said the decision comes too
late and is likely to play poorly on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "When Wall Street was calling for Ken Lay's head, it was early in the
game," said Coale, who is based in Houston and has followed Enron
closely. "Wall Street thought that would be the responsible thing for the
board to do. But at this point, it makes him look guilty."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the market's going to react favorably to that," she
said, noting that the company's stock took a steep plunge when CEO
Jeffrey Skilling resigned abruptly in August. Enron, which little more
than a year ago traded at nearly $90 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, closed Wednesday at 34 cents in over-the-counter trading, down
9.5 cents. Lay's resignation was announced after markets closed.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction from Enron employees, current and former, was bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bound to happen," said Maritta Mullet, a former 10-year
employee who lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement
benefits. "I'm surprised he's been able to face up to all these people
and stay in there so long.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terribly betrayed by him," added Mullet, who said Lay was
"blushing over with how good everything looked" in a September online
chat with employees.</TE>
<TE>   That enthusiasm cost her and others dearly.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors had swirled in recent days that a new management team was about
to be named, perhaps to be led by Jeffrey McMahon, Enron executive vice
president and chief financial officer. McMahon was named to those posts
in late October, replacing Andrew Fastow, who helped engineer the
off-balance-sheet partnerships that greased Enron's slide into
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon was treasurer in 2000 and reportedly objected to the conflicts
of interest caused by Fastow's twin roles as Enron chief financial
officer and manager of two of the partnerships. McMahon then moved to a
small Enron subsidiary but was brought back in a futile attempt to calm
investors.</TE>
<TE>   With Lay's departure, McMahon would be the only remaining member of
Enron's three-person office of the chairman. The third member, Enron
President Lawrence Greg Whalley, is leaving Enron to run the trading
operation that Enron is selling to UBS Warberg in a noncash
profit-sharing deal.</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials have touted the pending sale of the company's trading
operation to UBS as the beginning of a new future. The deal was blessed
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday, and UBS has already extended job
offers to 640 Enron employees.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if Enron management believes the company can move forward more
smoothly and reorganize without Lay, Mullet and others are doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think the company could survive with him staying. But I
don't think the company can survive either way," she said. "I don't see
what's left."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," said one former Enron vice president who spent four
years at the company. "I think he's entirely culpable. He knew what was
going on. He was responsible. He was captain of the ship."</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president, who asked not to be named, said the board
of directors has been passive and should have acted sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I was wondering when they were going to get around to it. I've been
shocked that the [Bankruptcy] Court allowed the same management to stay
in place. It seems like the shredded documents were the last straw."</TE>
<TE>   One current Enron finance executive said, "Good. Now they can start
cleaning house. He's a great guy, but he fell asleep at the wheel a bit.
There has to be someone taking some responsibility here, and he's
chairman."</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he did not know what kind of
retirement package Lay was being given, but noted that any agreement
would have to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Lay earned hundreds of millions of dollars at Enron, primarily through
lucrative stock options in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Lay exercised options worth $123.4 million, according to
Enron filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His base
salary that year was $1.3 million, and he was given a $7-million bonus.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, Lay held 5.1 million options worth $257.5 million,
and an additional 1.5 million options worth more than $100 million that
were scheduled to vest in coming years, according to the SEC documents.</TE>
<TE>   However, the plunge in Enron's stock price probably renders any
unexercised options worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Lay received a $3.6-million bonus in January 2001. The company has not
released figures relating to his 2001 salary and option grants.</TE>

<HD>Iran Casts Shadow on Afghan Political Map</HD>
<DH>Central Asia: Provincial official says Tehran sent military
officers to undermine Kabul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Iran has sent senior military officers into three southern
provinces of Afghanistan in an attempt to undermine the fragile process
of this war-torn nation's reunification, a respected member of Kandahar's
provincial government charged Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Yusef Pushtoon, a close aide to Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha
Shirzai, said senior Iranian military officers have been operating in
Farah, Nimruz and Helmand provinces for the last two weeks, trying to
lure local warlords away from commitments to back the new central
government in the Afghan capital, Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   Pushtoon identified two of the officers as Iranian army generals using
the names Afghani and Baghani and claimed that both were still in
Afghanistan as of four days ago.</LD>
<TE>   He claimed that the generals had offered warlords incentives,
including what he termed "goods and materials," in return for withholding
backing from the new government, adding that he had also received
unconfirmed reports that cash and arms had been offered.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush this month pointedly warned Iran not to meddle in the
internal affairs of this country, long a geopolitical playground where
empires and great powers have vied for influence.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States has previously voiced alarm about reports
of Iranian government activity in Herat and Helmand provinces, Pushtoon's
comments marked the first public accusations that Tehran is also
operating in Nimruz and Farah. The four provinces make up a broad swath
of western and southern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran has broken some basic international norms by sending high
military officers into the country without our permission and even
without informing the central government," Pushtoon charged. "They've
spent weeks in these provinces, visiting previous warlords, encouraging
them to stay out of cooperating with the central government."</TE>
<TE>   Kandahar's new provincial government, located in the city of the same
name that is the country's second-largest, claims overall administrative
responsibility for the six southernmost Afghan provinces, some of which
border Iran.</TE>
<TE>One Afghan Warlord Has Ties to Iran</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon also said that reports from the western city of Herat
indicated an even deeper Iranian involvement in the affairs of Herat
province. The province, which borders Iran, is controlled by a legendary
warlord named Ismail Khan. The warlord, a Shiite Muslim, spent years in
exile in Shiite-dominated Iran before returning to power in November
after the Taliban's retreat from the region.</TE>
<TE>   Kandahar is deep in Afghanistan's "Pushtun Belt." Pushtuns, who make
up the country's largest ethnic group and were the Taliban's chief
supporters, are Sunni Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooperation between the Herat administration and Iran is already
beyond all logical involvement," Pushtoon said. "Their contact should be
with Kabul, not Ismail Khan."</TE>
<TE>No Formal Action From Interim Government</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon said the interim government in Kabul has been informed of the
activity but indicated that it had yet to take any formal action.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon's comments, made in an interview, came in response to a
request for clarification of persistent reports that Iranian government
representatives were in Helmand and Herat working to establish their
influence.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely there's truth in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing all areas of the country under the control of one government
is viewed as one of the most difficult, yet important, tasks in making
the new Afghanistan a viable nation-state. Rugged geography, a diverse
ethnic mix and Afghans' free-spirited nature have historically made it
difficult for any government in Kabul to exercise its control over the
entire country. The centuries-old struggle over Afghanistan among foreign
empires was immortalized by Rudyard Kipling as "The Great Game." In a
recent incarnation, for example, it was Pakistan's attempt to secure
Afghanistan as a client state that led to the rise of the Taliban eight
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. air campaign commenced against the Taliban in October, so
too did the next round of this Great Game. Tehran, many argued, wanted a
friendly government in Kabul to facilitate new north-south trade routes
from the landlocked, mineral-rich former Soviet republics of Central Asia
to Iran's Persian Gulf ports.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other theories too.</TE>
<TE>Guessing at Iran's Motives</TE>
<TE>   One, for example, is the grand prize of oil routes. Iran and
Afghanistan are competitors for the preferred next route for getting the
Caspian Sea's recently discovered oil riches to lucrative Asian markets.
As long as Afghanistan remains weak and unstable, Iran keeps its chances
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory, voiced by Pushtoon, rests on the belief that Tehran
has been unnerved by America's military might and by the continued
presence of U.S. forces in southern Afghanistan. About 3,600 U.S.
soldiers and Marines are stationed at Kandahar airport as part of
longer-term efforts to consolidate the ouster of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   To these oft-heard reasons for Iranian activity, Pushtoon adds a
fourth: the likely return to favor of Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad
Zaher Shah, as a kind of spiritual political figurehead could rekindle
the hopes of Iran's royals.</TE>
<TE>Fears That Tehran Is Consolidating Influence</TE>
<TE>   The shah of Iran was overthrown in a 1979 revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, some in Kandahar believe that Shirzai is playing up the
fears about Iran to tighten his grip over the entire southern part of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons, some recent visitors to Tehran said Iranians
appear convinced that the end of the Taliban's extremist Sunni Muslim
rule meant that Afghanistan had fallen into Iran's political orbit.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani academic Rasul Bakhsh Rais, who recently attended a seminar
on Afghanistan in the Iranian capital, said he was surprised by the mood
of those present.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole tenor of the conference was that Afghanistan was now in
Iran's sphere of influence," he said. "The question was how to deal with
this reality."</TE>

<HD>Most Hahn Appointees Are From Wealthy Areas</HD>
<DH>Politics: The city's poor neighborhoods have few representatives on
citizen commissions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The majority of city commissioners appointed by Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn live in the wealthiest parts of the city, while poor
neighborhoods are supplying few of the members for the civilian panels
that help govern the city, a Times analysis has found.</LD>
<LD>   The disparity is so significant that the five poorest City Council
districts combined are home to fewer commissioners than the richest one
alone.</LD>
<LD>   A computer-generated map of the residences of the 114 commissioners
Hahn has appointed since taking office illustrates that the
administration's appointees reside mostly in the Santa Monica Mountains
and well-to-do areas of the northwest San Fernando Valley. Poorer
communities in the northeast Valley, South Los Angeles and the central
city have few representatives on the citizen boards. Only five
commissioners live in South-Central Los Angeles, an area near where Hahn
grew up and where his father served as a county supervisor for decades.</LD>
<TE>   So far, Hahn has appointed only about one-third of his commissioners,
and said that he hopes to reach out to poorer areas as he continues to
staff the civilian panels.</TE>
<TE>   The makeup of those commissions is important in part because it
represents one way in which mayors engage the public in the job of
running city government and reach out to neglected areas. Indeed,
geographic diversity is considered so important in effectively
representing L.A. that the new City Charter, passed in 1999, mandates
that mayors seek to achieve it. According to the charter, "The mayor . .
. shall strive to make his or her overall appointments to appointed
boards, commissions or advisory bodies . . . reflect the diversity of the
city, including, but not limited to, communities of interest,
neighborhoods, ethnicity, race, gender, age and sexual orientation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hahn, who won overwhelming support from South-Central during
last year's mayoral campaign, has not drawn heavily on his home
neighborhoods or other poor communities for key city positions.</TE>
<TE>   He is not the first mayor to lean heavily on wealthier communities for
his commission appointments. But Hahn's background and the new charter
language urging special consideration for neighborhood diversity on
commissions had led some to conclude that Hahn might pay special
attention to that issue.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, however, Hahn's commissioners generally have demonstrated
their support for him: Roughly half have donated to Hahn's various
campaigns for public office, most notably his recent mayoral victory.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, his commissioners have contributed more than $107,000 to his
campaigns, almost all of it in the recent mayoral election, though some
donated to his earlier campaigns for city attorney. The average amount
each donor commissioner gave was about $1,900. Several gave $7,000, the
most allowed under city rules governing the last mayoral campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the appointments were not a reward
for donations, noting that at least 5,000 people gave money to Hahn's
mayoral campaign. "The mayor is simply looking for the very best people
who are willing to serve the city, whether they were donors or not," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hahn has tapped appointees for more than 100 positions, he
still is faced with many more vacancies. The mayor has yet to name
commissioners to roughly 200 posts, and as a result those spots still are
occupied by appointees of his predecessor, Richard Riordan, who left
office on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 60 civilian panels, from the Affordable Housing Commission to
the Board of Zoo Commissioners, advise and run city departments in Los
Angeles, one of the only cities with such an extensive commission system.
Many of the boards hold significant sway over the city's policies,
especially over the services the city provides to its neediest residents.</TE>
<TE>Commissioners Serve at Behest of Mayor</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners at the Department of Water and Power make decisions that
affect discounts to low-income households, for example, and the Housing
Authority sets policies regarding the city's housing projects. Police
commissioners set the rules for Los Angeles Police Department officers
and soon will make the decision about whether to reappoint Chief Bernard
C. Parks to a second five-year term. Most city commissioners serve at the
behest of the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   With wealthy communities disproportionately represented on those
boards, several council members who represent Los Angeles' poor
neighborhoods urged the mayor to appoint more representatives from their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest challenges we have in this city are represented in these
very districts," said Councilman Ed Reyes, whose 1st District, which
includes parts of Chinatown, Highland Park, Mt. Washington and
Pico-Union, is home to just two commissioners. "It requires that we have
this perspective on the commissions. Quite frankly, this disparity issue
has gone on for decades. I'm just watching the mayor and hoping that as
time goes on we can correct this."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' citizen panels were Progressive Era reforms originally
designed to diffuse power and ensure public participation in government
business. Over the years, the commissions have been largely shaped by the
political agendas and patronage of mayors attempting to reward their
allies and remake the face of city government.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Tom Bradley used his appointments to transform mostly
white, male commissions to more diverse boards. Riordan filled the
commissions with many business and civic leaders, and urged them to bring
a more business-oriented approach to city departments.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hahn said he has strived for diversity in his
appointments, but added that it is not always easy to find the right
match for each commission. "What I'm more concerned about is finding the
best people I can [to] serve on the commissions," he said. "I am very
interested in having diverse geography and socioeconomic backgrounds and
different points of view represented, and we're just doing the best job
we can."</TE>
<TE>   About 45% of the mayor's appointees are white, almost a quarter
Latino, about 15% African American and 10% Asian American. One issue
contributing to the disproportionate representation of wealthy
communities, according to Hahn and others, is that the commissions
generally are volunteer positions, making it difficult for some people to
donate their time. The Public Works Commission is the only full-time,
paid panel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no big surprise that the common people are not terribly
included," said Frank Gilliam, director of UCLA's Center for
Communications and Community. "At some level, you have to at least
concede, this is who they would ask: the people who have both inclination
and the resources and the time. . . . But what it may be doing is
institutionalizing the elite presence in city government."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the small number of Hahn commissioners from South-Central
surprised local officials and community leaders, who said they expect the
mayor to appoint more people from those neighborhoods, especially
considering his long family ties to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no sense in which he can afford or would be inclined to so
blatantly disregard his most loyal support base," said Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area. "It's just not in the cards."</TE>
<TE>Hahn Pledges to Name More From South L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he will appoint more people from the southern part of the
city, adding that his sister, a councilwoman whose district includes
Watts, has already raised the issue with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I am looking to get more people from the southern part of the city
because it's important for me and important for the city to have each
part represented," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   A Hahn aide said last week that the mayor was in the process of naming
another round of people to area planning commissions, including five from
South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley, meanwhile, is home to about a third of Hahn's
commissioners--roughly mirroring its overall place in the city
population. One of Hahn's top priorities is defeating a drive in that
part of the city to break away from the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Activists who work in the communities not well represented on the
citizen panels said the disparity in appointments means that the very
people the city is supposed to be helping the most are being left out of
the decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't know anything about the other areas of the city, you
don't live in a poor area or work in a poor area, you're not going to be
thinking about the impact on a poor area," said civil rights attorney
Connie Rice, a former Water and Power commissioner under Bradley and
Riordan. "Those issues usually get left off the table."</TE>
<TE>   Others joined in rejecting the notion that there are not qualified
candidates in those neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people who live in these communities who are very
educated, very smart and would be very willing to serve," said James
Elmendorf, staff director for Coalition LA, a multicultural, grass-roots
organization based in the poorest council districts. "One of the
challenges of governance is that once a group is excluded, it's that much
harder to get them in. It's not a problem started by Mayor Hahn. But it's
a problem everyone in the city needs to start thinking creatively about
how to fix."</TE>

<HD>A New Kind of Party for North Korea</HD>
<DH>Asia: A huge festival to mark the birthdays of its leaders may
bring unprecedented numbers of tourists to the reclusive nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>North Korea is organizing two months of massive celebrations this
spring to mark the birthdays of its late founder and its current leader,
with events that could bring unprecedented numbers of tourists--including
South Koreans--to the secretive country.</LD>
<LD>   In a departure from their usual reclusive style, the North Koreans
recently printed colorful tourist brochures and set up Web sites in
English, Japanese and Korean to promote what it calls the Arirang
Festival, after a popular Korean song.</LD>
<LD>   "Such a wonderful event, which will be regarded as the greatest
performance of the 21st century," boasts one pitch to tourists. "All the
agents who are capable of organizing audiences worldwide, please do not
hesitate to contact us as soon as possible."</LD>
<TE>   "Welcome to Pyongyang," exclaims another advertisement, which shows
vintage socialist-style posters of gymnasts and dancers striking heroic
poses.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation to visit the North Korean capital is expected to be
extended as well to South Korean tour groups, which have been coming to
the socialist state by cruise ships for the last three years. Those tours
go only to a small enclave around Mt. Kumgang, on the east coast, and are
under strict supervision. The festival would be the first time that
significant numbers of South Korean tourists would be permitted in
Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>'Mass Games, Culture Performances'</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai Asan, the South Korean company that runs the tours, said its
chief executive was surprised last weekend when the North's tourism
officials said they would soon send the company a formal invitation to
bring visitors to the festival.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be mass games, culture performances. I'm sure many [South]
Korean tourists would be interested not only in the festival, but in
seeing Pyongyang," Jang Whan Bin, a Hyundai director, said Tuesday. "But
we haven't seen the details yet, so we don't know how it will work."</TE>
<TE>   The festivities will honor the birthday of the late Kim Il Sung, the
founder and chief ideologue of the communist regime who would have been
90 this year, and the 60th birthday of his son, Kim Jong Il, who took
power after the elder Kim's death in 1994. The events run from April 29
to June 29 and will involve 100,000 performers.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics suspect that the large-scale festivities are designed to steal
some of the limelight from South Korea, which along with Japan will host
the World Cup soccer games in May and June. The North also organized a
festival in 1988, when the Summer Olympics were held in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   More practically, the opening of Pyongyang to tourists could provide
the communist regime with desperately needed hard currency. The Hyundai
tours to Mt. Kumgang once provided $12 million a month, but those
revenues have largely dried up as the number of tourists has declined.
The North's weapons sales to such countries as Iraq and Iran have
suffered because of the heightened concern over terrorism since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket prices for the events are relatively steep. According to
advertisements on a Japanese-language Web site, seats start at $50 and
run up to $300.</TE>
<TE>   "Their main justification is money," said Lee Sang Man, an economics
professor at Chungang University in Seoul. "I don't think there is a
great change of direction inside North Korea."</TE>
<TE>North and South Are in a Deadlock</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the invitation comes at a time when discussions between the
peninsula's two governments are deadlocked. South Korean conservatives,
who oppose President Kim Dae Jung's overtures to the North, are poised to
score political gains in elections this year. They probably would reverse
some measures taken by Kim, who won the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize for his
efforts to improve relations.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats have their doubts that South Korean tourists will be
permitted in Pyongyang, given the strained political climate. North Korea
is so wary of its people having contact with outsiders that it bans
foreign aid workers from the country if they speak Korean.</TE>
<TE>   "It boggles the mind to think of South Koreans touring around
Pyongyang, talking to people. That would be too dangerous to the regime,"
said one Western diplomat, who requested anonymity. He noted that a large
turnout of South Korean tourists in the northern capital could be a
fiasco as well for Kim Dae Jung's government in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   "If South Koreans were seen and photographed celebrating the birthday
of Kim Il Sung, it would be as embarrassing to this government as it was
for the Americans to find that guy [John Walker Lindh] fighting with the
Taliban," the diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   North and South Korea are still technically in a state of war, despite
the armistice that ended their 1950-53 hostilities. Southerners still
need permission from their government to have contact with the North.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a political intention behind this festival, people should
not be allowed to travel to North Korea," said Kim Jung Ro, a spokesman
for South Korea's Unification Ministry. "But if it is just the
entertainment business to earn money, that is different."</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans have not released a detailed program of events. The
festivities are to be held at the May 1st Stadium, which seats 150,000
people. North Korean youths have been holding rehearsals since August.</TE>
<TE>   "'It will be quite spectacular--socialist kitsch--folk songs and
acrobatic performances in total synchronicity. This is something really
unique," said Nick Bonner, who runs a small travel agency out of Beijing.
His agency, Koryo Tours, is one of the few that bring foreign tourists to
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>Agency Won't Take U.S. Citizens</TE>
<TE>   The agency is advertising a one-week trip to see the festivities for
$1,590 from Beijing. It does not take U.S. citizens because poor
relations make it virtually impossible for Americans to obtain tourist
visas from North Korea. It is unclear whether that will change for the
festivities; the tourist literature seems aimed primarily at Japanese,
Chinese and South Korean tourists.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the political complications, it is unclear how North
Korea, with its limited tourist infrastructure, would handle a surge of
visitors. Pyongyang has balked on earlier promises to open land routes
through the demilitarized zone that separates the North and South,
although there were reports in the South that the communist regime might
do so on a two-month trial basis for the festivities. Tourists now take a
circuitous route by boat to Mt. Kumgang. From there, it is another five
to six hours by bus to Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government is hopeful that the North will resume work
on repairing a railroad that would connect the countries. There have been
media reports as well that charter flights could shuttle tourists between
Seoul and Pyongyang for the World Cup and Arirang festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats note that that would not require any great engineering
feats, but perhaps more political will than either side can muster at
this time.</TE>

<HD>Libya Is Told to Turn Talk Into Action</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: U.S. officials are encouraged by discussions with
Tripoli. Major hurdles, however, stand in the way of normalized
relations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials have had "positive discussions" with Libya, but the
country hasn't agreed to take the steps that would prompt the
administration to remove it from the list of states that support
terrorism, administration officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The North African country has recently been seeking to cultivate
better relations with the United States. Representatives of the
government in Tripoli have been talking to U.S. and British officials
about complying with U.N. requirements aimed at forcing Libya to renounce
terrorism and own up to past acts.</LD>
<LD>   The government in Tripoli has also been in compensations talks with
families of victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, for which
the United States holds Libya responsible.</LD>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said that while the United
States and Libya have had discussions, Tripoli has not agreed to
apologize for the Pan Am bombing or to pay compensation to the victims.
"Libya knows what it has to do. . . . That has not taken place yet,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that although Libya
has been working to improve its public image, "what we're looking for is
action. We haven't seen it."</TE>
<TE>   He added that recent talks with the Libyans in London don't "represent
any kind of new initiative or shift in our relationship. . . . There's
been no change in our policy toward Libya."</TE>
<TE>   Repairing relations with Libya would be a major step and offer a
variety of benefits for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   For the United States, it could bring some intelligence help in its
war on terrorism and would demonstrate to other countries in the region
that they can take steps to return to America's good graces. It would
mean substantial economic benefits for Libya, which badly wants U.S. oil
industry expertise and has been under a U.S. trade ban.</TE>
<TE>   Normal relations could enable U.S. oil concerns and other companies to
recover valuable assets that they left in the country when relations
deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Libya has demonstrated in the past that it is willing to pay
compensation to victims of terrorism and is willing to acknowledge
responsibility. Experts close to the situation believe that Libyan
officials will ultimately do what is necessary to satisfy the United
Nations and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Kreindler, a New York lawyer who has been negotiating with Libya
on behalf of some families, said he is optimistic that a compensation
agreement can be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are complications. Some relatives of the 270 bombing victims
insist that the United States take firmer action to punish Libya and say
there should be no compensation deal. Their point of view has some
backing in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   There are also legal questions about whether Libya would agree to a
compensation settlement with some families if the deal left unresolved
the question of other potential legal claims stemming from the crash over
Lockerbie, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Walker, a former U.S. assistant secretary of State, said
questions remain about how the Libyans could acknowledge responsibility
for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he said he believes that the Libyans will find a way to reach
an agreement "because I think the relationship with the United States is,
in the last analysis, important for them."</TE>
<TE>   Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi denounced the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
in the U.S., and officials of his country have called publicly for an
improvement in relations with the United States. He has already cracked
down on militants in his country and has forced some to leave Libya.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's list of countries that support terrorism now
cites Libya, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sudan was a target of U.S. cruise missiles after the 1998
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, that country has also been
trying to mend relations with the United States. Syria has also taken
steps to show its opposition to terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted a Libyan
intelligence agent of killing the 259 people aboard the Pan Am jet and 11
more on the ground.</TE>

<HD>Israel Targets Sites in Lebanon</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Air raids in the Shabaa Farms area come after Hezbollah
guerrillas attacked outposts.</DH>

<DL>KFAR CHOUBA, Lebanon
</DL>
<LD>Israeli warplanes attacked suspected Hezbollah positions in
southern Lebanon on Wednesday after the guerrillas fired rockets and
mortar shells at Israeli outposts in a disputed border area.</LD>
<LD>   In the first such air raids on Lebanon in three months, witnesses said
Israeli jets swooped repeatedly over a hill in the Shabaa Farms area,
firing at least six air-to-surface missiles. The Israelis also shelled
guerrillas suspected to have targeted Israeli positions with rockets and
mortars earlier.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement issued in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, Hezbollah said
guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol in the Shabaa area, scoring a
direct hit. The militant organization said the attack was "in response to
repeated Israeli violations."</LD>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said Hezbollah fired missiles
at a number of outposts, but no one was injured. He said the army
responded, but would not say how.</TE>
<TE>   Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Israelis fired about 50 artillery shells at a valley near the Lebanese
villages of Halta and Kfar Chouba, close to the Shabaa Farms area on
Lebanon's border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Three homes in
Kfar Chouba were hit by shrapnel, the Lebanese officials said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word of casualties on the Lebanese side.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Hezbollah
is "trying to cause deterioration and serious escalation in the region."</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah considers Shabaa Farms Lebanese territory and has vowed to
liberate it, a position supported by the governments of Lebanon and
Syria.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations, however, considers Shabaa Farms part of Syrian
territory that Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War, meaning that
its status should be negotiated in any future Syrian-Israeli peace talks.</TE>

Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, by accusing judges of
misunderstanding and misinterpreting evidence when they found the Libyan
guilty in the 1988 airliner blast.</LD>
<LD>   Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi was sentenced to life in prison last January
for killing 270 people with a suitcase bomb that blew up the plane.</LD>

<LD>Indian police charged three Bangladeshis and three teachers from an
Islamic school with murder for an attack at an American cultural center
in Calcutta that killed five guards.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they were trying to determine the motive for the attack.
The Indian government, apparently backing down from earlier claims, said
it was too soon to say whether the shooting was conducted by Islamic
militants sponsored by its chief rival, Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Calcutta police Supt. Shivaji Ghosh said 55 other people had been
detained for questioning about Tuesday's attack, which wounded 20 people.</LD>

<LD>Indonesian troops killed the military commander of the separatist
Free Aceh Movement in a raid on his jungle base, the military said.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah Syafei was shot in the head and chest Tuesday during fierce
fighting in northern Aceh, Lt. Col. Supartodi said.</LD>
<LD>   The death of the charismatic Syafei would deal a serious blow to the
independence movement, which has been under severe military pressure
since President Megawati Sukarnoputri ordered a crackdown last July.
Rebels said they had heard reports of their leader's death but were
unable to confirm it because security forces were surrounding the area.</LD>

<HD>Genocide Trial Begins for Two Bosnian Serbs</HD>
<DH>Courts: They deny killing hundreds in the drive to create a

<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Two Bosnian Serbs went on trial here before an international
tribunal Wednesday, accused of masterminding the genocide of hundreds of
Croats and Muslims during Bosnia-Herzegovina's 1992-95 war.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Momir Talic and his political ally, Radislav Brdjanin, are
charged with 12 counts of war crimes, including genocide. If found
guilty, they could face life terms in a European prison.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accuse Talic, 59, and Brdjanin, 53, of responsibility for
the torture, murder and expulsion of Croats and Muslims in northwestern
Bosnia during the war.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects took part in a "joint criminal enterprise," which aimed
to forcibly and permanently remove Muslims and Croats in order to create
a Serbian state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   "Muslims and Croats were object of the crimes for no other reason than
that they were Muslims and Croats," prosecutor Joanna Korner said in her
opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   Talic and Brdjanin both pleaded innocent to all counts. They have been
in the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1992, Talic was an army commander and Brdjanin was the
president of the Bosnian Serb "crisis staff" for Krajina, which
controlled 16 municipalities in northern Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Brdjanin facilitated the ethnic cleansing of Bosanska Krajina "by
securing all instruments of state power," the indictment said, while
Talic's troops killed hundreds of unarmed Muslims and Croats.</TE>

<HD>Reward Doubled in Anthrax Probe</HD>
<DH>Attacks: The offer of $2.5 million is part of stepped-up efforts to
catch the attacker who mailed the bacteria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal officials Wednesday urged the public--particularly
residents of the Trenton, N.J., area--to take another hard look to see
whether anyone they know fits the FBI's profile of the anthrax killer.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly four months since the death of the first victim of the
bioterrorist attack that was launched by mail, federal authorities also
doubled the reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of the anthrax sender. The amount now stands at $2.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   And in an effort to jog memories, officials announced the mass mailing
of fliers to postal customers in the Trenton area, where at least four
anthrax-laden letters were mailed.</LD>
<TE>   The initial mailing of 500,000 fliers will contain photographs of the
block-lettered envelopes addressed to the New York Post, NBC News anchor
Tom Brokaw, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sen. Patrick
J. Leahy (D-Vt.). An FBI "profile" of the attacker will be included.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials believe the sender is an adult male--they have described
him as a "lone wolf"--who has a "scientific background/work history" and
a familiarity with Trenton. The authorities also have said they believe
the source of the anthrax was domestic, not foreign, although they have
not ruled out other possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at your neighbor and see if he fits this profile," said Kevin
Burke, postal inspector in charge of northern New Jersey, at a Trenton
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which says it has "vigorously followed to their logical
conclusion" thousands of leads from the public so far, also asked people
to step forward even if they think someone else may have already called
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reaching out to you to ensure there are no more victims," FBI
agent Kevin Donovan said. "I don't believe this person is as elusive as
the Unabomber," he added, referring to the case of convicted bomber
Theodore J. Kaczynski, who evaded capture for years and eventually was
turned in by his brother.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said it may take "one piece of information" to help them
solve the case.</TE>
<TE>   The redoubling of traditional investigative efforts came the same week
that scientists working for the federal government said they have been
able to identify genetic differences in the strain of anthrax sent in the
attacks and the Ames reference strain. The hope is that such differences
may lead investigators to the source of the lethal bacteria, or least
allow them to rule out some possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to five deaths--including one woman in New York and
another in Connecticut with no known connection to an anthrax source--at
least 13 other people have been sickened by the rare disease. The mail
attack began in September shortly after terrorists crashed hijacked
planes in New York, near Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry Begins of EPA's Role in Senate Offices' Reopening</HD>
<DH>Health: The agency's watchdog will look into concerns about the
chemical smell pervading the Hart building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Citing a "potential serious health risk," the Environmental
Protection Agency's internal watchdog launched an investigation Wednesday
into whether the EPA erred in allowing the Hart Senate Office Building to
reopen.</LD>
<LD>   The focus of the inquiry is not the anthrax that contaminated the
building last fall but the chlorine dioxide, the chemical used to kill
the anthrax, said Robert J. Martin, the EPA's independent ombudsman.</LD>
<LD>   The building, which houses the office suites of 50 U.S. senators,
reopened Tuesday after three months of anthrax decontamination. But a
strong bleach-like smell hung heavy in the air, and soon after
reentering, several staff members said they had minor headaches and sore
throats. Two anonymous callers contacted Martin's office with concerns
about the chemical smell that was the talk of the beleaguered building,
said Hugh B. Kaufman, chief investigator for the ombudsman's office.</LD>
<TE>   In a memorandum to EPA officials, Martin said that "tremendous
quantities" of chlorine dioxide gas used on at least three occasions were
"far in excess of lethal doses . . . [and] could be in the air for a
significant period of time."</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry is the second opened by the ombudsman regarding the
agency's performance in connection with the terrorist attacks. Already
under review is EPA Administrator Christie Whitman's assurance that there
were no dangerous levels of hazardous materials inside buildings around
lower Manhattan that were showered with asbestos when the World Trade
Center towers fell.</TE>
<TE>   "In investigating the ground zero case, we found EPA giving people in
apartments and offices in that area the assurance that everything was
safe, but they never took any samples," Kaufman said. "We're concerned
they did the same thing here in the Hart building. And if they didn't, we
want to see the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   But EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said the agency has measured chlorine
dioxide levels "numerous times" since the beginning of the year and has
detected none. The EPA used an instrument that records traces as low as
0.1 part per billion, well below federal safety standards; the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration sets as acceptable 100
parts per billion, eight hours a day for a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever is going on at the Hart building, it is not the chlorine
dioxide," Martyak said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hart building was declared "safe and clean" when it reopened its
doors, three months after a letter laced with finely milled anthrax
arrived in the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Displaced workers eagerly returned to their cubicles Tuesday, but the
chemical smell was hard to miss. Soon, staff members were reporting minor
symptoms. About half a dozen visited the Capitol's first aid office, the
Office of the Attending Physician said, but Lt. Dan Nichols of the
Capitol Police would not disclose their complaints, citing patient
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Hart building, workers talked about the sudden onset of
curious, unexplained symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to a couple of colleagues who are feeling pretty poor,"
said a Republican Senate aide who requested anonymity. "One woman said
every time she gets up from her chair she gets dizzy. Another woman's
eyes were watering--and she doesn't wear contacts."</TE>
<TE>   Other aides dismissed the maladies as a cold, the flu or an active
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a few people who had odd minor ailments, but there have been
bad colds going around," said Dan Kunsman, press secretary to Sen. Craig
Thomas (R-Wyo.). "It wasn't anything to send anybody home. We talked
about it and frankly thought it was in our heads."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have held
briefings this week for Hart staffers, assuring them that the building
was safe in terms of exposure to anthrax or chlorine dioxide. Whitman
herself met with senators Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Although health officials never went as far as to declare the
million-square-foot building "risk free," several who attended the
meetings said they felt assured it was safe to go in.</TE>
<TE>   The odor was still detectable Wednesday, though less than when the
doors first opened. "It's not the repugnant odor that we smelled when we
first walked in the building," Kunsman said.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the ombudsman has asked the EPA to explain what actions
were taken to assure that no contaminants were present in the air before
the building's reopening, particularly chlorine dioxide and the
hydrochloric acid it can create when mixed with water.</TE>
<TE>   He said his office advised Whitman and EPA managers in November that a
nonchemical treatment for anthrax would be "less expensive, more
effective and would not create the health risks inherent in use of
chlorine dioxide."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who has held the post since 1992, is charged with responding
to public complaints and has been an outspoken critic of some of the
agency's decisions, including those rendered during the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman attempted to move him to the EPA's Inspector General's Office
last fall, which Martin said would have effectively abolished the
authority of the congressionally established post. A federal judge
granted a temporary restraining order this month, blocking the move until
a hearing can be held.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa welcomed the ombudsman's
interest. "The taxpayers are paying for a safe building for staff and
visitors. They deserve a good return on their investment."</TE>
<TE>   Grassley has questioned the $14 million the EPA spent through December
on the Hart cleanup, and has asked the agency and the Senate sergeant at
arms for a detailed accounting by Friday.</TE>

<LD>The United States is shortsighted not to use the Geneva Convention
in handling Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the
national chief of Amnesty International said Wednesday at Pepperdine
University.</LD>
<LD>   William F. Schulz, answering questions from students after addressing
an assembly of 1,900 in more general terms, said that if the war on
terrorism proves as long as President Bush has forecast, U.S. soldiers
are bound to be captured.</LD>
<LD>   Then, he said, Americans will surely want them treated with the
rigorous standards that apply in the Geneva Convention for war prisoners,
even if it doesn't consider Al Qaeda fighters to be legitimate
combatants.</LD>
<TE>   Some human rights groups say prisoners from Afghanistan should be
tried in civil courts. U.S. authorities contend they are illegal
combatants who, though treated humanely, are entitled to neither civil
trial nor status as prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   Schulz, a Unitarian minister who has served eight years as the
executive director of Amnesty International's American office in New
York, received a respectful hearing from the students, even when it was
evident some disagreed with him.</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking as part of a weeklong series of events on the Malibu
campus devoted to "Peace, Justice and Hope."</TE>
<TE>   A high point of Schulz's appearance here was his defense of Amnesty
International's opposition to the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that a majority of the American people support the death
penalty, he acknowledged, and some hark back to the "eye-for-an-eye"
philosophy of the Old Testament.</TE>
<TE>   But, he contended, this often does not make sense. "What rational
person would want a rape for a rape?" he asked. "No one would say there
ought to be an official rapist raping the people who commit rape."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how Osama bin Laden should be punished, Schulz said life
imprisonment would be fair. Also, he said Bin Laden might fairly be
killed in combat before being captured.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a punishment is proportional to the crime, Schulz said, is an
important concept that Amnesty International and other human rights
organizations use in deciding what laws are unjust.</TE>

<HD>Despair Heads Curriculum for Afghan Teachers</HD>
<DH>Education: A recent wait for handouts points to the dire straits of
those in the profession. Classrooms have no books, supplies or heat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The sun hovered low in the east and a deep chill gnawed the bone as
more than 2,000 teachers gathered in a schoolyard to fetch their promised
treasure: two plastic jugs of vegetable oil.</LD>
<LD>   They hadn't been paid in more than six months. A well-to-do Afghan
merchant living in the United Arab Emirates had paid for the cooking oil
and arranged for it to be distributed to teachers here in Kabul, the
Afghan capital. Some schools called off classes for the day so people
could wait in the oil line.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the last of the teachers had received the bounty, the sun
had dipped low in the west and good cheer about the handout had turned to
disappointment. Each person got only half of what was promised: one
3-liter jug of oil, worth about $2 in the market.</LD>
<TE>   The educators had waited at least four hours--and some as long as
nine.</TE>
<TE>   When officials from the United States and other nations gathered in
Tokyo this week and pledged $4.5 billion for Afghanistan's
reconstruction, they ranked education among the most important tasks.
Less than half of Afghanistan's men and only 15% of its women can read
and write.</TE>
<TE>   But as the oil handout shows, the people on the front lines of the
education system are struggling just to eat. The teachers are among
285,000 Afghan civil servants--from police officers to hospital
workers--owed a total of at least $70 million in back pay, according to
the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Promising billions of dollars is one thing; handing it over is quite
another, if recent pledges are any indication. Last November, various
countries promised about $100 million to an Afghan emergency fund, but so
far, they have come through with only $16.8 million. Still, it allowed
Afghanistan to dole out a month's back wages to some government employees
beginning Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We thank you for your [future] billions, but we need your millions
[now]," Ahmed Fawzi, a spokesman for the U.N. in Afghanistan, said before
the Tokyo meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Kabir, 38, bicycled 70 minutes from his home to the oil
distribution site, once a prestigious girls' school with classical
columns that now serves as the city's education administration center.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are the most unfortunate people in society," he said. "We
are candles producing light for others. But now, our lives are so
miserable, we are simply burning down and can't even cast a glimmer."</TE>
<TE>   Kabir teaches the literature and grammar of Dari, one of Afghanistan's
two national languages, to high school students. He is owed about $300 in
back wages; his monthly salary is supposed to be $40.</TE>
<TE>   Noor Ahmad, 56, said he and other teachers owe so much to local
shopkeepers who have given them goods on credit that "we don't dare to
show our faces."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many have continued to teach, even without pay. "We had to,"
said Mohammed Hasan, 32, an English teacher. "We had nothing else to do,
and it was our homeland."</TE>
<TE>   It's amazing that they even bother because conditions are so
deplorable. At nearby Esteqlal High School, teachers huddle with students
on cold floors. Built by the French, the school was once a model
facility, with a swimming pool and state-of-the-art laboratories. Now,
there isn't one desk or chair; all were plundered and sold in Kabul's
bazaar by warring clans in the early 1990s, before the Taliban took over.</TE>
<TE>   There are no textbooks or pencils. There is no electricity. The little
warmth there is comes when sunlight streams through the huge window
frames, most holding giant shards of broken glass that hang like icicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank Allah it's sunny," said Tajuddin Seddeqi, the newly appointed
chief of Kabul's school system. "If it were snowing, it would kill them."</TE>
<TE>   Seddeqi views education as the only hope for this society long divided
by warring factions. "If there was even average literacy, would there
have been any fighting?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Although most schools traditionally are closed from November to March,
many are offering special "winter sessions" this year.</TE>
<TE>   Esteqlal High enrolled girls again and hired back female teachers
after the Taliban fled the city last November and a ban on teaching girls
was lifted. But the school has sent female students home in recent days
because it considers the freezing temperatures too harsh for them.</TE>
<TE>   To support their families, teachers often moonlight. Many push wooden
carts at the bazaar, selling items such as oranges, soap and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Kabir, the Dari literature teacher, hawks used shoes from his cart,
earning about 20 cents for each pair he sells. On a good day, he pockets
$2.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Karim, 45, a janitor in a school, lugs things for people in the
bazaar. "Even if I'm carrying boxes," he said, "I should be proud because
I'm not stealing or getting money the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   But operating a cart requires a small amount of capital for
supplies--money that some instructors, such as physics teacher Mohammed
Amin, can't afford. "Every day, my five children ask me for one packet of
crackers," said Amin, who wears thick glasses because of an eye injury
sustained in an accident. "But I can't even buy that."</TE>
<TE>   By noon at the distribution center, not one jug of the cooking oil had
been handed out. A group of about a dozen education officials and
teachers conferred in a classroom with the donor's representative, Haji
Mohammed Dullah. So many teachers, almost all of them men, had shown up
that there was not enough oil to give each the promised two jugs--the
amount that female teachers had received the day before.</TE>
<TE>   The men discussed what they should do and considered handing out three
jugs for every two people, forcing teachers to share. Finally, they just
decided to give one jug to each educator.</TE>
<TE>   Milling in the crowd of hundreds outside, Kabir grew peeved about his
wasted time. "Why didn't they count it before and figure how many cans
were needed so we didn't have to wait here from morning to midday?" he
asked. "We could have worked in the bazaar to make at least enough money
for lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Shah Rahman, 38, a high school science teacher, says he had expected
the U.S. to do more to provide food. "We were given promises on the radio
[on U.S. broadcasts directed at Afghans during the war] that after
terrorism was annihilated, there wouldn't be any more starvation," he
said. "Now, we're even more scared because the U.S. is doing nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The oil was being distributed on behalf of merchant Haji Mohammed
Sharif. For each of the last three years, he has helped the teachers: Two
years ago he gave each about $5 in cash, and last year about $2.</TE>
<TE>   Why oil this year? "When they have oil, they can cook meat,
vegetables, eggs and use it with flour or rice, to cook potatoes or
ordinary food," said Dullah, his representative. They also hope that
expanding the supply will drive down the price of oil in the market.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 p.m., the first of the oil jugs made its debut, as each school
was called in turn. Attendance sheets were checked, signatures compared
and a mark resembling a "C" drawn on each teacher's hand. A wait in
another line finally secured the sought-after jug of Healthy brand oil. A
slash was drawn across the "C."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, the science teacher, strapped the oil to the back seat of his
ramshackle bicycle. "I waited from morning till 1:45 for one can of oil,"
he said. "I feel ashamed of this. But at least I can have some
cauliflower tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Many hadn't eaten lunch. "If I sold this, it wouldn't even cover my
car fare and my foot ache," said one man who had walked nearly five
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Sayed Sadeq, 47, another Dari language teacher, was among the last to
get his oil, at close to 4 p.m. "What is the value of teachers in your
country?" he asked. He listened intently as an American described how the
status of teachers in the U.S. has improved in recent years along with
their salaries, with many represented by powerful unions.</TE>
<TE>   He was asked in turn: And what about the status of teachers in Afghan
society?</TE>
<TE>   "This is the value of teachers in Afghanistan," he retorted, hoisting
the yellow plastic container toward his face in disgust. "One jug of
cooking oil."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Promises Cities Anti-Terror Aid</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Homeland Security Director Thomas J. Ridge assured mayors Wednesday
that his anti-terrorism plan will include provisions to help cities
shoulder some--though not anywhere near all--the costs of additional
police officers, equipment and training.</LD>
<LD>   Offering few details, Ridge gave a broad preview of the strategy being
designed by his office, parts of which were to be announced by President
Bush today.</LD>
<LD>   The plan and Bush's budget that is being proposed next month would
offer "unprecedented support" for cities to pay for police, firefighters
and emergency medical technicians, Ridge told about 300 mayors gathered
for the U.S. Conference of Mayors' annual winter meeting.</LD>
<TE>   That came as good news to the mayors' group, which Wednesday released
a new tally of what cities are spending to bolster themselves against
future attacks. Based on a sample of 192 cities, the conference estimated
that the nationwide cost to cities of additional terrorism-related
security will hit $2.6 billion by the end of 2002. At the end of last
year, the bill had totaled more than $525 million in overtime for police
and firefighters, training, new equipment and other needs, the survey
found.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier survey sponsored by the conference pegged the total amount
much lower, at $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Tightening security in the aftermath of Sept. 11 threatens to break
the bank for many cities' budgets," said New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial,
president of the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the expenses are forcing cities to
cut basic services such as health care, parks and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "This unprecedented support that I'm talking to you about in this
year's budget isn't a one-year-and-out initiative. This is a major
investment," Ridge said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ridge acknowledged the money will only go toward
future costs and will not meet cities' entire need. For the budget year
beginning Oct. 1, Bush is expected to request roughly double the current
$13 billion for a variety of homeland security efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The president will propose flexibility for cities to use some funds
toward overtime expenses, one of their largest cost categories, Ridge
said. But the majority of the money directed toward cities will be
earmarked for such items as new personnel, hazardous-material equipment,
bioterrorism training and emergency communication systems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Morial, Menino and other mayors pronounced themselves pleased
after Ridge's speech.</TE>

<HD>Woman Gets Prison in WTC Hoax</HD>
<DH>Crime: Defendant falsely claimed her husband phoned from rubble.</DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A woman was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison for
falsely claiming her husband had called her on his cell phone from
beneath the rubble of the World Trade Center, setting off a frantic and
fruitless search.</LD>
<LD>   Sugeil Mejia, 24, earlier pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment,
admitting she had concocted the story and lied about being married. She
had faced up to seven years if convicted but now will be eligible for
parole after serving one year.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Richard White said Mejia claimed three days
after the Sept. 11 attacks that her husband was a Port Authority police
officer trapped in the rubble with 10 other officers. Hundreds of police
officers and firefighters were killed by the towers' collapse.</LD>
<TE>   White expressed relief at not having to call police officers to
testify.</TE>
<TE>   "Many officers broke down in tears in the grand jury," White said. "It
would have been difficult to have them relive this incident."</TE>
<TE>   Mejia's lawyer, Eugene Byrne, said his client had asked him "to extend
her sincerest apologies to the firefighters and police officers who
perished, and also to the civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Byrne said Mejia had lost a friend in the terrorist
attack on the twin towers, and the hoax resulted from her distress.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia, of Union City, N.J., the mother of two children, told her story
to a police officer who then drove her to the trade center area,
authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Notes Loophole in Baggage Screenings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A loophole in the baggage screening measures that took effect last
week is creating a higher risk for passengers departing on connecting
flights, the Transportation Department inspector general told Congress on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a gap in this process, and . . . it needs to be closed,"
Inspector General Kenneth Mead told a House panel holding the first
oversight hearings on the new security measures. The loophole allows a
bag to be loaded on a connecting flight without ensuring that the
passenger has also boarded, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Mead, a frequent critic of the department, testified that, in general,
he is impressed by the "diligence and aggressiveness" the new
Transportation Security Administration has shown in improving airport
security. But he warned that the agency faces a major challenge in
meeting a Dec. 31 deadline for screening all bags with
explosives-detection machines and is also confronting a budget shortfall
that could exceed $4 billion this year.</LD>
<TE>   Security in the passenger cabin has notably improved since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, government and industry officials agree. Airlines
have fortified cockpit doors and instituted new training for pilots and
flight attendants. Air marshals are on many more flights. And many
passengers appear ready and willing to physically tackle potential
troublemakers. But U.S. airliners are still considered vulnerable to a
bomb in checked baggage.</TE>
<TE>   The requirement that went into effect last week was aimed at reducing
that vulnerability. Airlines were required to screen every bag with at
least one of several techniques, including hand searches, trained dogs,
explosives-detection machines or matching the bag to a passenger who
actually boards the plane. The requirement is in effect until Dec. 31,
when all baggage must be screened with the detection machines that are
considered more effective but are in limited supply.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines opted to meet the new baggage requirements primarily by using
bag matching, Mead said. A standard procedure employed around the world
to deter would-be bombers, it had previously not been applied to domestic
flights in the United States because of airline concerns about possible
delays. In a concession to the industry, security officials only required
the airlines to match passengers and bags on originating flights.</TE>
<TE>   But Mead said that compromise defies logic. "By definition, if the
passenger is not on the same aircraft as his or her checked baggage, then
it is not a positive passenger bag match," Mead testified.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics indicate that about 15% of passengers--75 million air
travelers a year--make a connection to another flight. That proportion is
much higher at major hub airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "These connecting passengers would not have their checked baggage
subject to any screening when departing the hub airport," Mead said.
"This creates a higher risk for flights departing hub airports, which are
the largest airports in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Newly appointed transportation security chief John Magaw said the
agency will pursue the issue with the airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Achilles' heel of aviation security," warned Rep. James
L. Oberstar (D-Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   While bag matching would not prevent a suicide bombing, its advocates
say that, along with other measures, it can serve as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Mead also warned that the new security agency faces its toughest
challenge in meeting a Dec. 31 deadline for explosives detection
machines. Even if enough machines can be manufactured, there may not be
enough space at many airports to install the units, which are the size of
a pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   "Integrating explosives detection equipment into the airport
environment will be much more difficult and expensive than many people
realize," said Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the aviation
subcommittee. "If the aviation industry and the flying public were
concerned about the chaos created when a new baggage system was installed
in Denver [in 1995], imagine the challenge of retrofitting 400 major U.S.
airport baggage systems in the next 11 months."</TE>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A close associate of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar
surrendered his weapons and vehicles to Afghan authorities in the
southern city of Kandahar on Wednesday, a government spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Khalid Pushtoon said the warlord of the Noorzai tribe, Haji Ba-shar,
handed over about 1,200 firearms and 30 vehicles to Gul Agha Shirzai,
governor of Kandahar province.</LD>
<LD>   "Negotiations took place over a period of 12 days," Pushtoon said.</LD>
<TE>   Bashar is widely known as a wealthy figure with houses in Kandahar and
Quetta, Pakistan. He fought the Soviet forces that occupied Afghanistan
from 1979 to 1989 and made a fortune by trading cloth, tea and opium
across the border with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "He pledged to live peacefully and to cooperate with the new interim
government," Pushtoon said. "He has also promised to give up his opium
smuggling operations."</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon said Bashar was expected to provide information about his
former allies and cooperate with Afghanistan's interim government,
installed after the fall of the Taliban last year.</TE>

<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai
on Wednesday that China would do what it could to help rebuild its
war-torn neighbor, where instability and a growing U.S. presence have
made Beijing uneasy.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Karzai arrived in Beijing from Tokyo, where
international donors had promised $4.5 billion in aid. Afghan and Chinese
foreign ministers signed agreements on Beijing's own modest aid package.</LD>
<LD>   "The Chinese government has followed with a great interest the peace
and reconstruction process in Afghanistan. Our two countries are
neighbors to each other, although our border is a short one," Zhu said.</LD>
<TE>   China offered $1 million for rebuilding Afghanistan in addition to
$3.6 million in humanitarian aid due to arrive soon.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah, who was accompanying Karzai, said he
was optimistic that Chinese President Jiang Zemin would offer more
pledges of aid when he meets Karzai today.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, backing Beijing's claims, said he had "no doubt" that Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda network had links with militants accused of
terrorism in the Muslim region of Xinjiang in western China.</TE>
<TE>   He did not rule out the possibility that the Afghan government might
repatriate any captured suspected Chinese terrorists to face justice at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Although Washington has rebuffed a connection, China has tried to
portray opponents of Chinese rule in Xinjiang as part of the global
terror threat being fought by the U.S.-led coalition.</TE>
<TE>   China's leaders were likely to ask Karzai about Afghanistan's position
on the U.S. military presence in his country, a Western diplomat said.</TE>

<LD>A 76-year-old Hasidic man pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud
government agencies out of tens of millions of dollars in schemes
involving four people who won controversial clemency deals from former
President Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plea agreement, Chaim Berger, who had been a fugitive living
in Israel, could face up to six and a half years in prison. He pleaded
guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Berger, who prosecutors said was one of the leaders of the schemes,
and six others including his son, Benjamin, were originally named in a
1997 indictment charging them with 64 counts of defrauding the federal

<HD>For N.Y. Fiscal Savior, It's Time for an Encore</HD>
<DH>Economy: Felix G. Rohatyn devised a plan that saved the city in
'75. His expertise is again sought for the projected huge budget
deficits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The week before his inauguration as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg
lunched with Felix G. Rohatyn, principal architect of the strategy that
saved New York City from bankruptcy in the mid-1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The discussion at the Paper Moon, a midtown Manhattan restaurant,
focused on a major problem facing New York's 108th mayor: how to bridge
budget gaps of almost $4 billion in the years ahead, the biggest
projected deficits in more than two decades.</LD>
<LD>   It was deja vu--but with a difference.</LD>
<TE>   No banker or political official believes the nation's largest city
will teeter as it did in 1975 on the brink of insolvency--but there will
be pain, magnified by large budget gaps faced by New York state.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw the situation. He was very realistic," Rohatyn said of their
discussion, an opinion validated by Bloomberg's inaugural address.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in stark terms from a podium outside City Hall, the mayor
said: "The facts are clear. We will not be able to afford all that we
want. We will not even be able to afford everything we currently have."</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the same message was delivered by former Gov. Hugh L.
Carey during the fiscal crisis decades earlier: The days of wine and
roses are over.</TE>
<TE>   It was Carey who picked Rohatyn to lead the effort to rescue the city
in 1975. As a leading partner at the investment bank of Lazard Freres &amp;
Co., Rohatyn had earned the respect of the financial institutions that
would have to play a key role in any recovery plan. He was known as a
highly creative deal maker who could cut to the core of problems and
possessed a keen sense of the politics of the possible.</TE>
<TE>   As a bridge between eras, Rohatyn provides perspective to New York's
current difficulties. His opinion has been sought not only by Bloomberg
but also by Gov. George Pataki, who is seeking to deal with the state's
projected budget gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Rohatyn, who will address the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors on Friday, also occupies an unusual vantage point as a member of a
coalition that is seeking federal help for states and municipalities with
serious budget problems. The panel's members include the top financial
officials of New York and California, plus representatives of major
public employee pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   New York is not alone in its budget bind.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities across the country definitely are feeling the financial pinch,
both because the recession has depressed revenues and [because], in the
wake of Sept. 11, cities are experiencing significantly increased costs
for public security and sometimes for public health too," said Andy
Solomon, a spokesman for the mayors conference. "Cities that already had
tight budgets are in some cases being pushed over the edge by the
additional cost."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six states are facing budget gaps, according to the National
Governors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   New York City's problems were spelled out last month by the New York
State Financial Control Board, created to ensure prudent practices when
the threat of bankruptcy loomed.</TE>
<TE>   Even before terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center, revenues
showed the effects of the economic downturn, the board said. Business
profits were declining along with the stock market, and an aggressive
multiyear program to reduce taxes had further curtailed revenue growth.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 only worsened the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The deterioration of the economic outlook has had a profound impact
on the city's tax revenue projections," the board concluded. " . . . This
sudden compression of the tax base has no historical precedent and is a
major factor contributing to the budget gaps in future years."</TE>
<TE>   The board said sufficient revenues were available for the city to end
the current fiscal year with a balanced budget. But it warned gaps
approaching $4 billion--or 10% of future budgets--could occur for the
next three years.</TE>
<TE>   New York state also faces a 10% shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Rohatyn, 73, who recently returned to Manhattan after serving as
ambassador to France during the Clinton administration, spoke about New
York City in the library of his Fifth Avenue apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I find the city putting a brave face on still a very painful wound,"
he said of the World Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on the city's budget problems, he said: "I think one of the
biggest differences between now and '75 is that in '75, the state was in
a very strong fiscal and financial position . . . to help the city. . . .
I think the state could be of significant detriment this time because the
state's fiscal condition is roughly as bad as the city's. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Half the economy of the state is the city. So it is hard to see how
the state can deal with its budget gap without inflicting some pain on
the city."</TE>
<TE>   When New York City faced the pain of near bankruptcy in the 1970s,
Rohatyn helped piece together a complicated financing package to pull it
back from the brink. It included the creation of a new entity, the
Municipal Assistance Corp., that refinanced the city's debt by purchasing
bonds guaranteed by streams of city revenue that were set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the answer to today's widespread city and state budget
problems, Rohatyn believes, lies in bringing together a broad coalition
of interests to deal with national issues of deficits, unemployment and
lack of investment.</TE>
<TE>   "In an ideal world, you would come up with a multiyear, combined city
and state plan," he said of New York. "I am not sure that is practical. I
am not sure how you do it. But that is really conceptually what you look
at. Can both of these entities close their budget gaps without inflicting
pain on the other?"</TE>
<TE>   Before Christmas, Rohatyn met in Manhattan with state financial
officials and pension fund managers representing about $700 billion in
assets.</TE>
<TE>   The group included H. Carl McCall, New York state comptroller,
California Treasurer Phil Angelides and Alan Hevesi, who was New York
City's comptroller at the time. Also present were representatives of
public employee pension funds from Florida, New York and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   They discussed lobbying for federal guarantees for state and municipal
infrastructure bonds, which the pension funds would then purchase. The
money would be used for badly needed projects, such as repairing school
buildings, improving mass transit and upgrading security at nuclear power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about public construction," Rohatyn said. "The
physical state of our schools is worse than the physical state of our
sewer systems. We're teaching kids in public schools that have leaky
roofs and rats running around."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the coalition plan to travel to Washington to share its
financing ideas with members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Time has diminished memories of just how close New York came to
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The attitude of the White House, which eventually changed, contributed
to the tension in the 1970s. President Ford's administration was openly
hostile, prompting a headline in the New York Daily News: "Ford to New
York: Drop Dead."</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the crisis, the United Federation of Teachers
threatened to walk away from its commitment to buy hundreds of millions
of dollars of city bonds. The situation became so tense that Rohatyn
arranged for a bank to remain open until midnight in case the teachers
changed their mind.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute--well past the hour banks normally close--the union
relented.</TE>
<TE>   "They took us right to the edge and practically over the edge,"
Rohatyn recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Mayor Abraham D. Beame's administration seemed unable to
comprehend the dimensions of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is much more confidence today that the city is in
control of its facts, that we know the numbers, which we didn't in 1975,"
Rohatyn said. "And that there is willingness on the part of city
administrations to manage the city for fiscal prudence and economic
growth. Nonetheless, the problems are serious."</TE>

<HD>Eagles on the Mississippi Give Midwesterners a Lift</HD>
<DH>Nature: The raptors thrill winter tourists who flock to the
riverside and watch their aerial ballet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST ALTON, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>The bald eagles dipped, swooped and splashed down into the
Mississippi River. On shore, three generations of the Mathews family
squinted into binoculars and narrated an excited play by play.</LD>
<LD>   "Look, that one's going to get a fish!"</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, he dropped it! Now they're fighting over it!"</LD>
<TE>   "That one knocked it right out of his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   "He fish-jacked him!"</TE>
<TE>   The thief, victorious, retreated to a tree to enjoy his catch. His
victim wheeled to scour the river for other prey. And the Mathews family
swung their binoculars to follow a new eagle drama.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty to choose from. The upper Mississippi, from
Minneapolis to this crook of the river in central Missouri, attracts
thousands of bald eagles each winter. It's an amazing resurgence for a
species that was critically endangered just 40 years ago, hunted for
sport and ravaged by DDT. The insecticide, released into the environment
by agricultural users, so weakened eagle eggs that the shells would
shatter when the mother bird hunched over her nest to keep them warm.</TE>
<TE>   The use of DDT was phased out starting in 1972. And penalties for
hunting bald eagles were stiffened, giving the bird a chance to rebound.
In 1963, there were just 417 breeding pairs in the continental United
States. Now there are more than 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   From December on, many of them can be spotted here, roosting in the
bare trees along the riverbank bluffs or hunkered down on patches of ice.
Their bulky bodies form a distinctive silhouette against the hard white
of the winter sky.</TE>
<TE>Churning Water Attracts Eagles</TE>
<TE>   The Mississippi attracts them because the locks and dams built to
speed navigation keep the water churning. Pockets of the river remain
unfrozen even in the harshest winters. It is in these open stretches that
the eagles fish. Their keen eyes can spot the glint of a meal up to two
miles away. They plunge toward their prey at 60 mph, then grab the fish
with 2-inch talons.</TE>
<TE>   It's quite a show.</TE>
<TE>   And the eagles have quite an audience.</TE>
<TE>   As the bird population has surged, so has the number of eagle
spotters. Most are not avid bird watchers; they wouldn't know a hawk from
a heron. But they are drawn nonetheless to spend a chill morning tracing
bald eagles across the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "The power of them," marveled Rosa Owsley, a once-a-year eagle watcher
from St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty," added Teresa DeGrand, scanning the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The swell of patriotism since Sept. 11 may be spurring more Americans
to look for the eagles this winter, conservationists say. Certainly,
river towns up and down the Mississippi are using that angle in marketing
their annual eagle festivals. Tourism officials in Dubuque, Iowa, for
instance, recently sent postcards to thousands of Chicago residents,
inviting them to "come see the nation's symbol in its winter home."</TE>
<TE>   In truth, even without the patriotic zeal, the bald eagle has fans
aplenty. "It's a real success story, and people like to see that
success," explained Russ Engelke, a specialist at the Two Rivers National
Wildlife Refuge just north of St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, several Internet sites feature Web cams trained on eagle
nests. Newlyweds have been known to spend the honeymoon bundled up in
earmuffs and scarves, watching eagles. The Quad Cities Bald Eagle Days
drew a record 25,000 visitors to central Iowa this year. As Joe Taylor,
president of the Quad Cities tourism bureau, put it: "It's become a cool
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   So it was that on a recent school holiday, three generations of the
Mathews family hopped aboard an old-fashioned trolley for five hours of
eagle watching guided by Greg Gelzinnis, president of Bluff City Tours in
Godfrey, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Setting up a spotting scope here and there along the river, Gelzinnis
pointed out a dozen other impressive species, from an American kestrel to
a white pelican to an exquisite trumpeter swan paddling in a pond behind
a gas station. But the eagles were the undisputed hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think they're beautiful," said Kaye Mathews, 72 and the
matriarch of the clan. "I love to watch them fly."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, a few of the grandkids grumbled that they would rather be
sleeping or hanging out with friends. But a few eagles in, most were
hooked.</TE>
<TE>   Just before lunch, 7-year-old Meghan DeGrand skipped into the trolley
from a turn at the spotting scope, her cheeks nipped pink by the cold.
"C'mon! C'mon!" she said, tugging at her mom, her grandma, her uncles--at
any adult more inclined to huddle in the warmth of the trolley than scan
the sky for birds.</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon!" Meghan insisted, dragging the grown-ups to the scope. "I just
saw another eagle!"</TE>

<HD>Gigante, in Prison, Accused of Running N.Y. Mob Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Imprisoned mob boss Vincent "The Chin" Gigante, who dodged
prosecution for nearly seven years by claiming mental illness, was
indicted Wednesday on new charges alleging he runs the powerful Genovese
family from behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Gigante, 74, and Genovese members allegedly infiltrated the
International Longshoremen's Assn. and ran extortion rackets against
companies operating at piers in New York, New Jersey and Miami, the
indictment said.</LD>
<LD>   "Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante is truly the boss of the Genovese crime
family," said Barry Mawn, head of the FBI's New York office. "He is a
'hands-on' leader who remains actively involved in the running of the
organization."</LD>
<TE>   Gigante's attorney, Michael Marinaccio, said he could not comment
because he had not read the indictment. His client remains in a federal
lockup in Fort Worth, serving 12 years on a 1997 conviction on charges of
racketeering and murder conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante was dubbed "The Oddfather" for his habit of wandering New York
City in a bathrobe and mumbling to himself. Authorities have long alleged
that his behavior was a dodge to avoid prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Also indicted on racketeering, extortion and money-laundering charges
were Gigante's son, Andrew Gigante, 45, and six other alleged Genovese
members. The indictment said the son relayed orders from his father.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gigante pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in federal court
in Brooklyn. He was ordered held without bail until a hearing next week.</TE>

<HD>Identity Theft Tops Fraud Reports</HD>
<DH>Crime: The FTC finds that 42% of complaints involve the tactic,
which can be tough to prevent and costly to correct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Identity theft was the leading consumer fraud complaint reported
last year, far exceeding gripes about Internet auctions and services.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 204,000 complaints compiled by the Federal Trade Commission,
42% involved identity theft, the agency said Wednesday. The figures come
from a government database of more than 200,000 complaints collected in
2001 from more than 50 law enforcement and consumer groups.</LD>
<LD>   Privacy advocates say the number of people victimized by identity
theft may be as high as 750,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   "We've seen an explosion in this crime, and it's not going away," said
Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San
Diego-based consumer group.</TE>
<TE>   Givens said consumers should look at their credit reports twice a
year, shred personal documents before throwing them away and cleanse
wallets of old receipts and printed Social Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   However, she cautioned, "you could take all the [preventive] steps and
still become a victim."</TE>
<TE>   One identity thief's actions made the world believe that Chicago
attorney Ted Wern was not only a deadbeat but a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "He took my name and information and started running amok with it,"
Wern said. He thinks the thief went through his mail or garbage for the
information in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Using Wern's name and Social Security number, the ID thief applied for
and got at least four credit cards and ran up nearly $50,000 in bills.
The thief also opened a checking account with a Georgia bank and wrote
thousands of dollars in bad checks.</TE>
<TE>   Then whenever the thief was pulled over for a traffic violation
without a license, he started giving out Wern's information, building a
litany of charges including a drunken driving arrest in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He was released, but that encounter led authorities last year to
arrest Terre A. Stevens for the identity fraud crimes. This month he was
sentenced to six months in prison and four years' probation, according to
court officials in Mansfield, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "I am angry, but in many cases theft of your identity is something you
can't control," Wern said. "You have to just do your best to clear it
up."</TE>
<TE>   It cost the average victim more than $1,000 to clean up the mess left
by identity thieves, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   The high number of identity theft complaints last year may partly
reflect the FTC's increasing emphasis on investigating this kind of fraud
and its use of a toll-free number to receive those complaints, said
Howard Beales, the agency's director of consumer protection. That is why
the complaint numbers can't be compared with previous years to show a
trend, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After identity theft, the top consumer fraud complaints of 2001 were
problems with Internet auctions, deceptive trial offers and charges from
Internet and computer services.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card fraud accounted for 42% of identity theft complaints,
followed by scams in which phone or utility accounts were created in a
person's name without his or her knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, hackers have been able to penetrate big corporations'
databases and download credit card numbers and other information.</TE>
<TE>   The District of Columbia had the highest rate of identity theft in
2001, with 77 victims for every 100,000 people. California and Nevada
followed with 45 and 41 victims per 100,000 people, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ann Mills, 52, had her identity stolen from her home in Columbus,
Ohio, when two burglars broke in and stole her purse, which contained her
driver's license and Social Security card.</TE>
<TE>   She called to cancel her credit cards, but not before the young
thieves tried to use her cards to buy PlayStation video game consoles.
They were never caught.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very scary situation," she said. "They don't want your
furniture or your crystal; they want your identity."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Parents' Calls for New Columbine Hearing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>A judge on Wednesday refused to reconsider lawsuits filed by
families who want a new hearing because of allegations that a police
officer fatally shot a Columbine High School student.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Daniel Rohrbough have said they believe police Sgt. Dan
O'Shea accidentally shot their son as he fled the 1999 school shooting.
O'Shea has said he arrived at the school after Rohrbough was slain, and a
sheriff's report concluded the boy was killed by a student gunman.</LD>
<LD>   Even if O'Shea did fire the fatal shot, he is still protected by
governmental immunity, U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock said in
Wednesday's ruling.</LD>
<TE>   He gave the same reason in dismissing all but one of the Columbine
lawsuits in November, saying that authorities responded reasonably to a
"rapidly evolving violent situation."</TE>
<TE>   O'Shea told Denver television stations Wednesday that video from a
KMGH-TV news helicopter on the day of the shootings showed Rohrbough was
already shot when O'Shea fired his weapon for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Daniel Rohrbough was shot by [Dylan] Klebold and [Eric] Harris right
at the outset of this, before anybody had a chance to dial 9, much less
911," O'Shea told KMGH.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough's parents have said shell casings from O'Shea's gun that
were found near their son's body indicate O'Shea shot him. O'Shea said
the news video indicates he fired those shots to provide cover for
rescuers trying to reach Rohrbough.</TE>
<TE>   Harris and Klebold shot and killed 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves.</TE>

<HD>Artificial Heart Changed to Address Clotting Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WALTHAM, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>The maker of the world's first self-contained artificial heart said
Wednesday it has removed a piece of the device because of fears it may
cause clotting.</LD>
<LD>   Deposits that can cause clotting were found on a plastic cage in the
artificial hearts of two patients who died. So the cage has been removed,
said Edward Berger, spokesman for Danvers-based Abiomed.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of recipients of the AbioCor heart have had clots, called
hematomas, removed, Berger said. Also, one of the patients who died had
suffered a stroke, apparently caused by a blood clot, but doctors
attributed his death to other causes.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors are concerned the plastic cage is touching the tissue and
restricting the flow of blood, which some doctors fear could lead to
clotting, said Dr. David Lederman, Abiomed's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we can definitively make any conclusion," Lederman
said. "Since we don't need it, we removed it."</TE>
<TE>   The plastic cage was created for early devices that were tested on
cows. The cage was meant to prevent heart tissue from obstructing blood
flow into the replacement heart.</TE>
<TE>   But the cage is not needed on humans because surgeons are attaching
the device in a place where there is no concern about blockage, Berger
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plastic-and-titanium device has been implanted in six patients who
were all dying of heart failure and too sick for heart transplants. Three
have died, two of organ failure and one of bleeding during surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The first recipient of the device, Robert Tools, suffered a stroke
four months after receiving it. The hospital said Tools' death in
November was unrelated to the stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors had said all along that strokes were among the risks for
artificial heart patients.</TE>

<HD>Parties Debate War's Role in Crucial Midterm Election</HD>
<DH>Politics: A key Bush advisor urges candidates to press the issue,
but history contradicts him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Can Republicans wield the war against terrorism as a weapon against
Democrats in this year's midterm elections?</LD>
<LD>   Karl Rove, President Bush's top political advisor, is arguing that GOP
congressional candidates can build their campaigns around the
administration's success in prosecuting the war. But history suggests
that won't be easy.</LD>
<LD>   In the first election after the beginning of each of the five major
U.S. wars in the last century, the president's party has lost seats in
Congress. That's been true whether the war at the time was going well (as
in World War I) or badly (as in World War II, Korea and Vietnam) or just
gearing up (as in the Persian Gulf).</LD>
<TE>   This year might be different, some analysts say, because terrorism
represents a more direct threat to voters on the home front than any of
those earlier conflicts. But the precedent is that, in congressional
elections at least, traditional domestic concerns have tended to
overshadow war.</TE>
<TE>   "It really gets back to [former House Speaker] Tip O'Neill's
observation that all politics is local," said presidential historian
Robert Dallek.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if Democrats can limit the war's influence in the midterm
election, some key party strategists fear that Rove's argument could
prove powerful two years from now, in the 2004 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent polls have found Bush opening huge leads over Democrats
on issues demanding toughness, such as safeguarding national security and
combating terrorism. And that could signal a reversion to the partisan
alignment that existed during the quarter century before Bill Clinton,
when Democrats led on the issues of social compassion often critical in
congressional races but were found wanting in the tests of strength that
loom larger in presidential contests.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans "are trusted to lead, and we are trusted to comfort," said
Al From, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.</TE>
<TE>Rove Sees Voters Trusting GOP</TE>
<TE>   Rove ignited the debate over the war's potential political influence
with a speech at last weekend's meeting of the Republican National
Committee in Austin, Texas. Rove told the RNC that GOP candidates should
stress the administration's record on the war and homeland security in
this year's campaign, when 36 governorships, 34 Senate seats and all 435
House seats are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "We can go to this country on this issue because they trust the
Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and strengthening
America's military might and thereby protecting America," Rove said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats reacted with outrage, accusing Rove of politicizing the war.
But with the rhetorical fireworks subsiding, professionals in both
parties are beginning to analyze whether Rove mapped out an effective
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest evidence for his argument is polls showing that
terrorism remains a top national concern and that voters express much
more faith in Bush and the GOP to combat it. In a Gallup/CNN/USA Today
poll earlier this month, Americans gave the GOP a mammoth
38-percentage-point advantage when asked which party they trusted more to
deal with terrorism. Republicans also held a 41-percentage-point lead on
military and defense issues and a 26-point advantage on foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   GOP pollster David Winston said those attitudes will inevitably
benefit Republican candidates. "You have many more people focused on
defense, foreign affairs and terrorism," he said. "And if that is how
people are making decisions and using those issues, that context is
beneficial for Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Democrats remain cautiously optimistic that success in Afghanistan
won't tilt the electoral battlefield toward Republicans. That optimism
rests on two central beliefs. One is that voters look to the president,
not Congress, to provide leadership on the war. The other is that, since
the war has enjoyed almost unqualified bipartisan support, few races are
likely to feature meaningful distinctions between the candidates on the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Those two arguments fuse into a widespread Democratic belief
that--absent a major new terrorist incident--November's election will
pivot on traditional domestic issues such as the economy. For example,
when voters were asked what issues would be most important to their
choice in the congressional election, about twice as many cited the
economy as cited terrorism and homeland security in a poll released
Wednesday by EMILY's List, a Democratic fund-raising group.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about it: What kind of debate can you get into [in a campaign]
about terrorism and national security?" said John Anzalone, a Democratic
pollster. "So at the end of the day, you are going to see the dialogue in
October 2002 be about the same old . . . differences in philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schmidt, the communication director at the National Republican
Congressional Committee, disputed such assertions. Although there has
been little dissension on the war itself, he said, Democratic members who
had voted to cut defense spending "may be vulnerable . . . in a political
environment where the American people once again understand the
importance of a strong defense."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republicans seem to be hedging their bets. Notwithstanding
Rove's declaration, Bush this year has focused mostly on domestic
concerns, particularly the sputtering economy, in an aggressive schedule
of travel around the country.</TE>
<TE>   If the White House is to make the war a winning issue in congressional
elections, it will have to buck the trend formed after the last century's
five major wars. For good measure, the Democrats were trounced in 1946,
the first election after winning World War II, and Republicans were
spanked in 1954 after settling Korea a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   No common cause explains all of these losses, historians say.
Dissatisfaction with the war contributed to some of the reversals (such
as in 1942, 1950 and 1966), but in all cases domestic dissatisfaction
(such as an unpopular farm bill in 1950 or urban race riots in 1966)
loomed large too. The most consistent pattern is that even battlefield
success hasn't protected presidents against the usual voter inclination
to reward the party out of the White House during midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the closest precedent to the strategy Rove suggested came in
1918. On the brink of Germany's surrender in World War I, President
Wilson publicly asked the country to elect a Democratic Congress as proof
that Americans "wish me to continue to be your unembarrassed spokesman in
affairs at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats promptly lost 19 House seats and six in the Senate,
giving Republicans control of both chambers.</TE>
<TE>Presidents Haven't Fared Much Better</TE>
<TE>   The initial presidential elections that follow the outbreak of war
haven't been kind to the commander in chief's party either. The party out
of the White House won the first presidential election after the onset of
hostilities in every major war in the 20th century except in 1944, when
Franklin D. Roosevelt won his fourth term.</TE>
<TE>   Historian John Milton Cooper said that record probably results from an
accumulation of wartime frustrations--from higher prices and increased
government control over the economy to lengthening casualty lists.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many analysts believe that a Bush reelection campaign would
benefit from the war on terrorism much more than his party may in 2002.
Though terrorism may fade somewhat as an issue if the country is not
attacked again, Bush's handling of the conflict has largely erased public
doubts about whether he has the qualifications to be president, polls
show. And the lingering sense of vulnerability to terrorism could prompt
voters to weigh a challenger's credentials as a potential commander in
chief much more heavily than they have since the Cold War's end.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2004, the Democratic nominee has to cross a security threshold we
haven't had to cross since the fall of the Berlin Wall," From said.</TE>

<HD>Gephardt Takes the Long View in Democratic Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Democratic election-year offensive on economic issues continues
today, as House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) offers what
he calls a "long-term growth" agenda days ahead of President Bush's State
of the Union address.</LD>
<LD>   According to a summary of his scheduled speech provided by aides
Wednesday, Gephardt will seize on Enron Corp.'s financial collapse--in
which many employees lost their life savings--to urge creation of a
universal pension system that moves with employees from job to job.</LD>
<LD>   Gephardt also will call for more spending to develop alternative
energy sources, to help reduce American dependence on foreign oil, and a
new tax deduction for families with children in college.</LD>
<TE>   Notably absent from the summary of the speech: any criticism of the
Bush tax cut. If the speech steers clear of the tax debate, it will be a
departure from the path chosen by other prominent Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) earlier this month charged
that the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut enacted in June had contributed
to the recession. Subsequently, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called
for a delay of about $350 billion worth of cuts scheduled to take effect
in a few years for wealthy taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans vehemently--and somewhat gleefully--attacked those
speeches as a return to what they call an ingrained Democratic habit of
taxing and spending.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself declared that "not over my dead body" would the tax cut
be rolled back.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt's speech aims to steal some of the thunder from Bush's
nationally televised address Tuesday night to a joint session of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, the question before us today is not just what is the state of
our union, but what is the state of our vision?" Gephardt said in advance
excerpts from the speech. "Where do we want to go as a nation, and what
are we doing to make that vision come true--not just in our own time but
in our children's time?</TE>
<TE>   "In this city, it's sometimes hard to take the long look ahead. It's
so easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day details of the current
debate that we never lift our eyes and look ahead to the next
decade--about how we want our country to look, not just in one year but
in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   As an example of a long-term goal, Gephardt cited his pension reform
proposal. With Enron's fiasco in mind, he also proposes strengthening
corporate accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   His other proposals include:</TE>
<TE>   * A program to develop renewable energy sources over the next decade,
such as fuel cells, to wean the nation from dependence on oil.</TE>
<TE>   * A deduction for taxpaying families of up to $10,000 a year for each
student they have in college.</TE>
<TE>   * A "teacher corps" to recruit 2 million teachers in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * A tax credit for children to help them build funds for college or to
buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   * A new federal fund to help states meet the higher costs of
protecting against terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * More spending to track material used for nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * A campaign to cut the cost of broadband Internet access across the
country.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Memo Cites Objections</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A fired executive with Enron Corp.'s accounting firm, Andersen,
warned the energy trading company that some of its public statements
might mislead investors, a memo obtained Wednesday shows.</LD>
<LD>   As Enron was preparing to make the first public disclosure of its
financial problems, David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who oversaw the
Enron account, advised Enron that language in its news release "could be
misconstrued or misunderstood by investors," according to an Oct. 15 memo
written by Duncan.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan is expected to be called to testify today at the first
congressional hearing to examine why Andersen destroyed thousands of
documents related to the Enron account. Andersen, claiming Duncan acted
against orders in shredding documents, fired him last week.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan has contended that Andersen executives in Chicago were aware of
Enron's problems and that he was singled out as a scapegoat.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a $1.2-billion charge against shareholder
equity. In his memo a day earlier, which he prepared for his files and
copied to Andersen attorney Nancy Temple, Duncan said he raised
objections to Enron's characterization of some of the charges as
"non-recurring" in a company news release. He noted that the Securities
and Exchange Commission had been cracking down on companies that
improperly used the term.</TE>
<TE>   Temple wrote back and suggested that Duncan delete her name from the
memo due to a concern that the reference to Andersen's legal department
might be viewed as a waiver of attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   "If my name is mentioned, it increases the chances that I might be a
witness, which I prefer to avoid," Temple wrote on Oct. 16, according to
a copy of her e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who was fired by Andersen for allegedly orchestrating the
destruction, has pointed to an "unusual" Oct. 12 e-mail from Temple,
reminding employees to abide by the company's policy for deleting old
files.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the Enron investigation say the new memos show that
Andersen was concerned in mid-October about its own legal liability in
the Enron scandal, including the possibility that Temple might later be
called as a witness.</TE>
<TE>   But the company did not advise its workers to preserve Enron documents
until Nov. 9, after it was subpoenaed by government investigators.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman called the memos standard and appropriate. He
said Temple didn't want a reference to her conversations with Duncan
because they were covered by attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Duncan declined to comment on the memo.</TE>
<TE>   But in a contentious opening salvo to the government's burgeoning
inquiry, Duncan plans to refuse to testify today before the House Energy
and Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The public standoff between Duncan, who wanted immunity in exchange
for his testimony today, and the committee, which refused his request for
a temporary postponement of his appearance, are the first examples of
what Washington experts predict could be several months of
finger-pointing and legal maneuvering.</TE>
<TE>   "He's flying from Houston to Washington to assert the 5th [Amendment]
and leave," said Duncan's attorney, Robert J. Giuffra Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the committee Wednesday, Giuffra expressed frustration
that the committee would not allow Duncan to postpone his testimony in
order to review two boxes of Andersen documents that were not provided to
him until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that it was unusual to require a potential witness to
appear before a congressional committee and be sworn in, merely to invoke
his constitutional right to refuse to testify. Duncan had offered to
provide the committee with a sworn statement invoking the 5th Amendment
in lieu of appearing at the televised hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time, these things are worked out," said Jack Blum, a
Washington attorney and former Senate investigator. "But if the effect
you want is drama, you bring them in to take the 5th."</TE>
<TE>   Committee spokesman Ken Johnson noted that Duncan spent 4 1/2 hours
talking to committee investigators behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're asking is that he provide the same information to the
committee under oath."</TE>
<TE>   The committee also planned to subpoena Andersen Chief Executive Joseph
F. Berardino but reportedly has agreed to allow an Andersen partner,
