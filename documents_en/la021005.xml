<DL>NEW BRITAIN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>John Falter's painting of country boys flying kites over sun-dappled
fields evoked nostalgia for a simpler America when the Saturday
Evening Post used it as its cover on March 13, 1950.</LD>
<LD>   Now this minor gem of American art has evoked something from a
harsher America: a lawsuit for ownership.</LD>
<LD>   An Indiana company that owns the Saturday Evening Post is suing
the New Britain Museum of American Art, which got the painting as a
gift in 1977 from Kenneth Stuart.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit claims that Stuart, the Post's art director from 1942
to 1963, took the Falter piece without permission and didn't legally
own the work when he donated it. Stuart died in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the piece was missing. We searched and found it in New
Britain," said Anthony Lo Cicero, the lawyer for the Saturday Evening
Post Society, a division of Curtis Publishing. "We aren't saying the
museum knowingly did anything wrong by accepting the gift. But this
is a valuable piece of artwork. It belongs to us. We want it back."</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots of documentation for this painting and its
donation," museum director Douglas Hyland said. "It's not like we
kept this a secret. We've shown it since 1977. We've loaned to other
museums."</TE>
<TE>   Hyland calls "Boys and Kites" an important work by an outstanding
artist, "a charming example of America in an easier period of its
society. We hope to retain it."</TE>
<TE>   Falter's work was recently appraised by the museum at $30,000 to
$40,000--a price that reflects a fast-growing interest in original
magazine artwork.</TE>
<TE>   It's a class of artworks on paper called ephemera, overlooked for
decades until collectors began searching them in the 1970s. Top price
for a magazine cover painting is the $4.5 million paid in auction
last year for "Rosie the Riveter" by Norman Rockwell, whose paintings
also graced the Saturday Evening Post.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday Evening Post Society always retained reproduction
rights to Falter's "Boys and Kites" and all other cover art it
featured by Rockwell and others. Those rights allow the society to
create posters of works and sell use of the copyrighted images for
ads and other purposes.</TE>
<TE>   But now the market for illustration art has come out of the
dustbin. In some cases, the original artwork is now worth more than
the reproduction rights.</TE>

<LD>We gotta get out of this place, if it's the last thing we ever do.</LD>
<LD>   --Barry Mann and Cynthia</LD>
<LD>   Weil's song, "We Gotta Get Out</LD>
<TE>   of This Place"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The yearning of small-town residents to experience something more
than their thwarted lives belongs in any catalog of the recurring
themes of American fiction, drama and cinema. "I'm suffocating in
this dead-end town. No one understands me," their lament goes. "I was
meant for something better, wasn't I?"</TE>
<TE>   Such frustrations are at the heart this year of both "The Good
Girl," a surprisingly well-received independent film starring
Jennifer Aniston, and "Empire Falls," a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
by Richard Russo. But although the novel revels in the foibles of its
colorful townies, "The Good Girl" is consistently dour and shallow,
failing to find the humanity in characters it can only ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   That the book brings existence in a moribund Maine town so
entertainingly to life and that the movie is as dreary as its scruffy
Texas burg and the banal residents stuck there can't be attributed to
Russo taking nearly 500 pages for his tale. If "The Good Girl" were a
16-hour miniseries, it would still lack what "Empire Falls" has in
abundance--affection for its characters.</TE>
<TE>   That crucial difference in attitude raises a question: Can
Hollywood portray real people, especially everyday working people, or
is every attempt destined to be poisoned by condescension? The task
is more difficult in comedies, where the line between laughing with
the downwardly mobile or at them is frequently crossed.</TE>
<TE>   Russo acknowledges that avoiding patronizing unsophisticated
characters is as important as it is tricky. "If you buy into the
notion that small towns are nothing but jerkwaters, and if you can't
find it in yourself to believe that there are smart, decent people
who live there, then you are in very dangerous territory," he says.
"You can't be dismissive."</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Picture Show," Peter Bogdanovich's film based on a Larry
McMurtry novel, had compassion for its lonely characters as well as a
vivid sense of place. But that was released in 1971. More recently,
the Coen brothers have successfully built comedies around rural
rubes, including the loving if misguided young couple played by
Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter in "Raising Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Home Alabama," last weekend's box office champion, rests
its revulsion for small-town life on the shoulders of Reese
Witherspoon, who is so likable that she doesn't wither under its
weight.</TE>
<TE>   A romantic comedy sprouting from another chestnut of a
theme--there's no place like home--"Sweet Home" does a poor job of
persuading us that Alabama's worth returning to for Witherspoon, who
fled her humble past so emphatically that she left skid marks. After
dumping on life in the boonies, the movie in its final moments
becomes a fairy-tale testimonial to the power of animal attraction:
The only thing in recliner country that doesn't sicken the nouveau
city slicker heroine is the hunky honey she left behind.</TE>
<TE>   As nasty as she is, it's amazing the locals let her stay. But of
course they would; they're just loser hicks.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 film of Russo's novel "Nobody's Fool" took place in an
unlovely town in upstate New York. "One of the reasons 'Nobody's
Fool' did so well," the author says, "is it began with a novel that
was not condescending to its characters. Both [director] Robert
Benton and [producer] Scott Rudin would have caught any whiff of
condescension."</TE>
<TE>   Lead Paul Newman "is an American icon movie star, but he's also
really the boy who ran away from Cleveland so he wouldn't have to
work in the sporting goods business," Russo says. "We had an oddly
perfect team on that movie. It's pretty rare that Hollywood gets it
right."</TE>
<TE>   For the wisecracking cast of "Nobody's Fool," poverty and wit are
not mutually exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   But director Miguel Arteta's "Good Girl" is humor-impaired. The
character may be intrinsically decent, but smart? Not so much. In
fact, intelligence seems to have been all but eliminated from the
gene pool from which Justine Last (Aniston) and everyone she knows
sprang. The movie finds her a depressed 30-year-old Texan who spends
her days at the cheerless superstore she hates and her nights in
front of an unreliable TV with the pothead housepainter husband she
tolerates.</TE>
<TE>   Justine begins to register a pulse when a goo-goo-eyed
post-adolescent comes to work at the Retail Rodeo. They exchange
soulful looks, progress to stumbling stabs at conversation that they
eagerly interpret as meaningful and, before you can say Madame
Bovary, Justine and Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) are canoodling in cars,
motels and at work. She wouldn't be the first woman to mistake mental
instability for depth.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's nominally a comedy (written by Mike White), several
of "The Good Girl's" attempts at humor induce more cringes than
chuckles, including her husband's difficulty producing a sperm sample
at a fertility doctor's office and her acquiescence to trading sex
with a creep for his silence about her affair.</TE>
<TE>   The most egregious examples of the film's tendency to tinge gags
with cruelty occur when Justine and a co-worker in the cosmetics
department subject elderly women to makeovers that transform the
clueless women into Halloween grotesques.</TE>
<TE>   "The Good Girl" got a measure of positive attention because it
seemed to be Aniston's breakout role, proof that she had more to
offer than a cute figure and responsive hair. But anyone who could
see "Friends" and not be aware of her superb comic timing should be
sentenced to watching a marathon of badly cast, inferior sitcoms.</TE>
<TE>   Her authentic performance in "The Good Girl" struggles against a
weak screenplay. There is no movement from dark to light, only from
hapless to hopeless. Justine's behavior lacks internal logic. After
realizing that her young lover is, in the worst way, a child, she
still agrees to run away with him. Her dilemma isn't funny, only
pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Justine and the movie suffer from the same problem: a paucity of
ideas. Jake's parents and Justine's husband and his best buddy are
almost always parked in front of a flickering TV screen. The habit of
staring at the tube might work to define a character or two, but is
there no other way to show that the town is full of people who are
boring and disengaged?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Justine's depressed. She has no drive. If she longed to
be a beach volleyball player, to become a hostess on QVC or to bump
into Carson Daly in Times Square, the contrast between her ambition
and reality would chafe. (Hence "we gotta get out of this place" can
give way to another reliable plot, the American penchant for
self-reinvention. See Gatsby, Jay.) Justine fails to break our hearts
because she doesn't even have enough energy to dream.</TE>
<TE>   "Empire Falls" is set in the graveyard of broken dreams. A
Northeastern industrial town in decline, it was the place that
42-year-old Miles Roby, manager of the Empire Grill, was supposed to
escape. Hard luck and loyalty have kept him there, surrounded by a
sarcastic ex-wife, the teenage daughter he adores, and assorted
townsfolk so venal, dumb or vain that no other place would have them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the people I write about as boring," Russo says. "I
think they're fascinating. It takes me three or four years to write a
novel. I have no more desire to spend three or four years with boring
fictional characters than I'd want to be with real boring people that
long. I had a wonderful time sharing company with all those folks.
Even people with limitations are complex. People's limitations often
make them interesting."</TE>
<TE>   They do in Russo's fiction. They don't in "The Good Girl." If it
was easy to create characters like Miles' father, Max, an alcoholic
rascal who lives to take advantage of anyone careless enough to let
him, everyone would do it.</TE>
<TE>   Like Justine, Miles is too passive for his own good. It seems
happiness will always elude them both. But by the end of the novel,
Russo says, "Miles has become that thing that we all hope to be one
day, a fully vested grown-up. He has put away childish things. He
decides he'd rather be an adult in Empire Falls and he knows what's
important to him. That's a fair definition of a grown-up, in this
society."</TE>
<TE>   If only "The Good Girl's" filmmakers didn't feel so superior to
their characters, they might have found some wit, depth and a
believable ending too. But perhaps they delivered just what they
intended, a wallow in a place where the word "good" has dark
connotations. They wouldn't be the first artistes to mistake cynical
for clever.</TE>

<HD>A Few Blemishes in This Beauty Battle</HD>
<DH>As a larger-than-life, fictionalized tale of Mary Kay Ash's
effort to fend off a home-sales rival, 'Hell on Heels' runs out of
steam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the snowy wigs that crown her head to the cosmetics empire she
runs, the Mary Kay Ash depicted in CBS' Sunday-night movie is a woman
who thinks big.</LD>
<LD>   Even her dreams are oversized, as suggested by a black-and-white
opening sequence in which she stars in her own "Citizen Kane,"
enigmatically whispering, "Rosebud." (This time, it's a shade of
lipstick.)</LD>
<LD>   No hagiographic biography here. Right away, "Hell on Heels: The
Battle of Mary Kay" (at 9 p.m.) announces that it, too, is going to
be larger than life.</LD>
<TE>   In the title role, Shirley MacLaine sets just the right pitch,
moving with regal grace and behaving like a queen, yet keeping her
emotions grounded in truth. Her performing partners--Parker Posey as
a rival who seems to be stealing all of Mary Kay's best ideas, and
Shannen Doherty as a zealous Mary Kay convert--get to go further over
the top. Indeed, it's difficult to imagine how the crew suppressed
its laughter during the filming of some of these scenes.</TE>
<TE>   So if the movie seems to lose momentum before it's quite over,
it's not the actresses' fault.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Patricia Resnick and directed by Ed Gernon, the movie
presents a fictionalized version of events in the 1990s (Mary Kay
died in November 2001 at age 83), as the rival BeautiControl company
makes a run for her home-sales territory.</TE>
<TE>   At a gathering of her sales associates, Mary Kay arrives on stage
in a Cinderella carriage and imparts aphorisms to the cheering crowd.
Across the street, the executives of BeautiControl ponder how to keep
their company afloat. The arrival of perfectly put-together executive
wife Jinger Heath (Posey) gives them an idea: Present her as a
younger, hipper Mary Kay, to inspire their own sales force.</TE>
<TE>   A beauty battle brews as Jinger and her husband (Barry Flatman)
move into Mary Kay's Dallas neighborhood, horn in on her charities
and make an extravagant gift to her beloved church. Outside the
church, the theme from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" whispers in
the wind as Mary Kay and Jinger narrow their eyes challengingly at
each other.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sales forces are causing their own mayhem as a
grocery store encounter between Doherty's Lexy and a BeautiControl
rival devolves into a food fight.</TE>
<TE>   The fun keeps building, like air being forced into an overfilled
balloon. But instead of exploding magnificently, the movie just
deflates.</TE>
<TE>   The Mary Kay faithful may feel this movie takes her too lightly.
But one thing comes across quite clearly: She became a model of
elegance and success, and she created an environment in which her
home-sales agents could do the same.</TE>

<HD>Holland Band Overcomes Sound Woes</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be time for UCLA to post a "caveat emptor" sign whenever there
is a jazz concert at Royce Hall. Buyer beware, that is, for anyone
expecting Royce's audio engineers to allow an accurate sound image of
what really takes place on stage when a jazz ensemble is performing.</LD>
<LD>   In less than a month, two superb jazz orchestras have had their
performances distorted by sound mixes appropriate for rock music but
completely wrong for jazz.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 15, the victim was the Luckman Jazz Orchestra, whose
concert of Duke Ellington's sacred music was presented in a fashion
that buried the subtle ensemble textures beneath the sound of an
over-amplified tuba.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday night, Dave Holland's Big Band had a similar
experience: Much of what it played was trapped within bottom-heavy
sound reproduction. Ironically, it was Holland's bass work--superb in
its own right--that was over-amplified to the point that it became a
muddy undercurrent, blurring the airy open spaces that he had so
carefully laid out in his orchestrations.</TE>
<TE>   It was to the credit of Holland, his players and his imaginative
compositions and arrangements that the performance was nonetheless a
state-of-the-art example of contemporary jazz artistry. Some of the
pieces traced to the group's just-released first album, "What Goes
Around," others to a work commissioned for the Monterey Jazz
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   The album's title track, with its shifting rhythmic meter, was
delivered with confident ensemble mastery, driven by the supercharged
engine of Holland's bass and showcasing a sterling solo by drummer
Billy Kilson. On "Time Remembered"--and in other pieces--the soloing
of trumpeter Alex Sipiagin had the hallmark of a rapidly emerging,
potentially major talent. And alto and soprano saxophonist Antonio
Hart shifted from gorgeous lead work in the saxophone section to
wildly inventive soloing.</TE>
<TE>   This brilliant performance required discretionary listening,
focusing past the turgid qualities of the audio and attempting to
hear what was happening on stage. With a string of important jazz
events scheduled for the rest of the UCLA Live season,
someone--performing arts director David Sefton?--should take steps to
assure a respectful audio setting.</TE>

<LD>Comedy pilots don't get any funnier than Sunday's "Bram and Alice" on
CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Nor do sitcom actors come more accomplished than its
Tony-nominated male star, Alfred Molina, whose versatility runs from
Shakespeare to broad TV comedy.</LD>
<LD>   One of those rare Brits working on American TV as a Brit, Molina
has had his prime-time clunkers, most notably as a badly miscast
Hercule Poirot in a CBS remake of "Murder on the Orient Express."</LD>
<TE>   But here he's a showstopper, thanks to writing by executive
producers and "Frasier" alums Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd,
direction from James Burrows, and Molina's own precision timing and
flare for comedy, at once physical and urbane.</TE>
<TE>   "Bram and Alice" is more evidence that even the stalest of sitcom
premises--the disruptive move-in by a relative--can seem fresh when
executed with skill. In this case, big laughs are generated by ample
helpings of caustic wit.</TE>
<TE>   Compare it with two of this season's charmless new comedies that
have already aired. We've seen Uncle Bill and his sniffy butler
reluctantly take in his nephew and two nieces on the WB's "Family
Affair," and a teenager turning her older sister's life topsy-turvy
on the same network's "What I Like About You."</TE>
<TE>   Much higher on this food chain is "Bram and Alice," with aspiring
writer Alice O'Connor (Traylor Howard) rooming with on-the-skids
once-celebrated novelist Bram Shepherd (Molina) after he learns she
is his daughter from a one-night fling he had all but forgotten. A
mid-50s drunken lothario with a glib line, he instinctively tries to
seduce her before discovering who she is and lets her move into his
swanky Manhattan apartment only because she agrees to share costs.</TE>
<TE>   Molina is an effortless cad, epitomizing the "one-hit wonder who
can't even pay his rent" described here by his loyal assistant (Roger
Bart). He's ably supported by Howard, and there are two other
characters here with potential. One is a neighbor (Katie Finneran),
the other a barkeep (Michael Rispoli) who quit the priesthood, he
explains while ogling a gorgeous woman, when "I just found myself
praying for the wrong things."</TE>
<TE>   Premieres, often gleaming hood ornaments, can be unreliable as
previews of the full chassis, and it remains to be seen where the
producers will take Bram. If the writing falls off dramatically,
he'll become a one-night wonder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Bram and Alice" will air at 8:30 p.m. Sundays on CBS. The network
has rated it TV-PGL (may be unsuitable for young children, with an
advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Putting a New Gloss on Mary Kay</HD>
<DH>Television* Playing the cosmetics queen in the satiric
'Hell on Heels,' Shirley MacLaine finds inspiration in her
contradictory qualities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shirley MacLaine is on the phone from her home in New Mexico talking
about "Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay." Her delectably satiric
CBS Sunday movie is based on the true story of a nasty corporate war
in the mid-'90s between the late cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash and an
ambitious newcomer, Jinger Heath (Parker Posey), who launches a rival
company.</LD>
<LD>   But MacLaine actually has a few questions to ask. "What did you
think of the laugh at the end?" inquires the Oscar-winning veteran of
such films as "The Apartment," "Irma la Douce," "The Turning Point"
and "Terms of Endearment."</LD>
<LD>   "What did it mean to you?"</LD>
<TE>   The comedy concludes with Mary Kay, sans her customary white
bouffant wig, elaborate makeup and froufrou outfits, looking at the
audience and breaking out into a deliciously sly laugh.</TE>
<TE>   I thought her laugh signified that she was in on the joke--she
didn't take her image seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, good," MacLaine says. Director Ed Gernon "and I really
agonized over that. We wanted to make it enigmatic but let the
audience take what they wanted to from it. What we were trying to do
and see if you got this, we were trying to tell a story of how
capitalism impacts and informs the female in relation to independence
and ambition and what you are going to do with your life."</TE>
<TE>   After working for several years in direct sales, Mary Kay Ash
retired in 1963 after being overlooked for a promotion. The
retirement lasted just a month when she decided to write a book about
how women could thrive in the male-dominated business world. At her
kitchen table, she compiled two lists: one that featured everything
she liked in companies she worked for and the other pointing out
where companies needed improvement. Looking at the list, she realized
she had created a marketing plan for a successful company. And with
her life savings of $5,000 and her then-20-year-old son, Richard, she
launched the direct sales company Mary Kay Cosmetics in September
1963.</TE>
<TE>   "She was responsible for making more female millionaires than
anyone in the world," MacLaine says. "Mary Kay was sort of a
capitalist evangelical person."</TE>
<TE>   Ash's golden rule for herself and her employees was that God came
first, family was second and career third. Several of her "revival"
meetings, when she rallied and inspired her employees, are depicted
in the movie. Her motivational techniques work. Top-selling Mary Kay
employees were rewarded with a big pink Cadillac. The company became
the largest direct seller of skin care and color cosmetics in the
U.S. And even now, a year after Mary Kay's death at age 83, there are
more than 800,000 beauty consultants in 37 markets in five
continents.</TE>
<TE>   A Role That Resonates</TE>
<TE>   MacLaine loved playing the outrageous and flamboyant Ash. She
relished the woman's contradictions. "I just stay away from doing
anything until I find a part that resonates in all of those
qualities. Since we are all so contradictory on some level, that is
what makes us human. I adore this character. I don't even know what
this means, but I don't feel like I'm finished with her."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, MacLaine says, she can't explain how she approaches
acting. "It's a very difficult thing to try to explain, all the other
things I do like dance, sing and write, I can explain my process. I
can't explain how I act. I don't know where it comes from. I don't
know how it really works."</TE>
<TE>   "Hell on Heels" boasts a powder-puff visual style that recalls
such Doris Day movies as "Pillow Talk," and a clever opening sequence
that spoofs the famous "Rosebud" scene from "Citizen Kane."</TE>
<TE>   It was MacLaine who suggested that Gernon, the film's producer,
direct. "He's one of the big powers at [the production company]
Alliance/Atlantis. He's the one who ran around the world and got
great stories."</TE>
<TE>   "Shirley and I have done two movies together before, 'Joan of Arc'
and 'The Salem Witch Trials,' which is coming in February," Gernon
says. "During those two films, we got fairly close and had a strong
meeting of the minds. When I called her about this film, she was
interested, but when she read it she wasn't particularly
enthusiastic. I think she felt at first the social satire of the
piece was more acerbic than she would have liked. But during our
conversations together she began to see the warmth and heart that was
buried in the piece, but wasn't actually yet on the script. She said,
'I'll do it if you direct it.' She made it a condition for her
starring in the film."</TE>
<TE>   It was MacLaine's suggestion to add the character of a
sophisticated New York TV journalist named Annika (Rachael Crawford),
who arrives at Ash's empire to do a story on her. MacLaine sees her
as sort of a Greek chorus reporting on the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the Annika character to be a contemporary,
fresh-scrubbed feminist who can sort of be a silent witness to the
absurdity of this whole environment," Gernon says. "Then, strangely,
she comes to realize at least on the Mary Kay side of it, that women
like her are essentially standing on the shoulders of women like Mary
Kay, who was a feminist before there were feminists. There were women
like Mary Kay who didn't do it for a cause. They originally did it
because they knew what it was like to put food on the table and take
care of kids."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay" can be seen Sunday at 9
p.m. on CBS. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for
young children).</TE>

<HD>Peter Gabriel Takes the Test of Time</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The '80s superstar breaks a 10-year recording
hiatus with 'Up,' making no apology for working until satisfied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KOT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where have you gone, Peter Gabriel? A founding member of Genesis who
became a rock superstar in the '80s with hits such as "Biko," "Shock
the Monkey" and "Sledgehammer," Gabriel last released a studio album
of pop-oriented songs in what seems like a different world:</LD>
<LD>   Bill Clinton was running for the presidency against the father of
the current president, George W. Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Fledgling Mouseketeer Britney Spears hadn't even filmed her first
episode of "The New Mickey Mouse Club."</LD>
<TE>   Guns N' Roses was the planet's biggest rock band.</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. Gabriel has been hunkered down in a studio
on and off for the last decade, tinkering with songs and plotting his
next move.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, "Up" (Geffen), was finally released, a 10-song concept
album about "death and birth and things that are above and beneath
life," Gabriel says in an interview, "the stuff outside the main view
of the windshield."</TE>
<TE>   Would that be a literary conceit or something he says just to
satisfy nosy journalists? Even Gabriel, who treads cautiously through
interviews with a blend of monkish calm and an undertaker's dourness,
has to laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the sort of [stuff] I start coming up with when I
start doing interviews," he says. "The theme of the album usually
doesn't emerge until I talk to a few journalists, and one of them
comes up with a good theory and I think, 'Yeah, that's it!' "</TE>
<TE>   The advent of home-recording technology has given artists more
freedom than ever to produce music at their own pace, rather than at
a record company's. Without having to worry about mounting studio
costs, musicians are free to explore myriad options at a pace that
makes rockers of the past appear even more dizzyingly prolific than
they actually were.</TE>
<TE>   In the '60s and '70s major acts like the Beatles and Elton John
were recording and releasing as many as three albums a year, but the
pace has slowed dramatically in the last decade. Now big-name
performers are expected to take their time between studio releases.</TE>
<TE>   But the more deliberate pace demanded by these promotion schedules
also promotes creative hand-wringing. Axl Rose has been working on
"Chinese Democracy," the 11-years-in-the-making sequel to Guns N'
Roses' "Use Your Illusion" albums, so long that he has become a punch
line for rock-star excess.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen similarly has recorded and scrapped countless
tracks and at least one finished album over the years; "The Rising"
is his first studio album since 1995 and only his fifth in 17 years.
Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor took five years to create "The
Fragile," the follow-up to his 1994 breakthrough "The Downward
Spiral," and he found himself struggling to reclaim his audience.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel has also been working at an increasingly deliberate basis.
His first four solo albums came out in five years, but his next three
required 20, with progressively diminishing artistic results. It's
not that he's been dithering. His Real World Studios, near Bath,
England, has become a workshop, sanctuary and meeting place for
musicians from around the world. While developing the songs for "Up,"
Gabriel completed two other projects: "OVO," the multiethnic score
for the Millennium Dome Show, and "Long Walk Home," the soundtrack
for the Australian movie "Rabbit-Proof Fence."</TE>
<TE>   "There were 130 songs in various stages of completion the last 10
years," Gabriel says. "I guess I just enjoy the business of making
music better than selling it. I didn't have a producer on board
whipping me into shape, and so deadlines become things you pass
through on the way to finishing."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel brushes aside the notion that isolation breeds a lack of
outside input that hampers his ability to make decisions quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Real World isn't an isolated lighthouse, it's a bit more like a
train station with people coming from all over the world, so there is
always a lot of stuff to inspire me, and a few musicians to try and
kidnap."</TE>
<TE>   A few of them appear on "Up," including the late Pakistani sacred
singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the gospel group the Blind Boys of
Alabama. They bring a richness to the recording that is undeniable.
But Gabriel's songwriting lacks the sense of surprise and
subversiveness that marks his finest work.</TE>
<TE>   If Gabriel feels daunted by that legacy, he doesn't let on.</TE>
<TE>   "Music has never been a problem for me," he says. "If I had to
produce a song a day, as the songwriters were required to do in the
old days of the Brill Building [a New York City office building
filled through the early 1960s with songwriters and music
publishers], I think I could do that. The problem comes when I try to
strap some words on top. And then to get something that I am
satisfied with, or even half-satisfied with, will take a week or two
weeks. I have to go away. I can't do it at home or in the studio,
because I'm a master of distractions. I could make a career out of
distractions, and I wouldn't get anything done."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel says he does not work with collaborators because he is
after something specific, if elusive, when he writes songs. "I think
of the songs like journeys, a train journey," he says. "You've got to
decide what place you want to go, and then try to make it interesting
and real for you. It's not something that necessarily lends itself to
sharing with others."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it's a lonely process, and as the incubation time
lengthens between albums, the audience an artist has taken a career
to cultivate may no longer be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what sort of audience there will be for me
anymore," he says. "It's been a long time since I've had a radio song
out. On this album, at the last minute I pulled a track ['Burn You
Up, Burn You Down'] for a future project because it didn't seem, on
reflection, to come from the same family as the rest of the songs on
the album. I got a few protests about that from the European label,
because they think it's a radio-friendly song. But I have a history
of doing that sort of thing. If this album dies a horrible death, the
record company will be at my door."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel doesn't sound particularly concerned. Because of his
stature, the weight of his previous accomplishments, he is an artist
who has earned the luxury of making his own decisions in his own good
time.</TE>

<LD>Summer is over, but the bright and bouncy rock that blared from
outdoor gatherings such as the Vans Warped Tour continues to heat
things up. Thursday was a school night, but the sold-out crowd at the
Hollywood Palladium for New Found Glory, Something Corporate and
Finch (all Warped alumni) made it clear that the bratty brand of punk
popularized by Blink-182, Sum 41 and the like is more popular than
ever, especially with the under-21 set.</LD>
<LD>   Headliner New Found Glory demonstrated why it's risen to the top
of the spunky heap, delivering harmonic, bubblegum nuggets about
youthful tribulations.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its name, there's not much that's really new about the
Florida-bred, L.A.-based quartet. Like most bands of this ilk, the
musicians need to pull their pants up (and in the case of bassist Ian
Grushka, put a shirt on) and temper the wisecracks. But their tunes
are solid and well-crafted, deftly balancing the kind of noisy
mischievousness young male fans love with enough sugary themes and
melodious vocals to please the girls. Indeed, the Palladium audience
appeared to be mostly female, suggesting that while the gentler, more
expressive approach to punk has nothing in common with the genre's
testosterone-fueled beginnings, it continues to have a wider appeal.</LD>

<HD>New Confidence, New Songs From Luminous Susana Baca</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her bare, cinnamon-colored feet stepping softly on the stage of the
Knitting Factory on Thursday, Susana Baca began her emotional show
Thursday with "Toro Mata," the anthem of Afro-Peruvian music.</LD>
<LD>   A lot has happened since this classic tune was featured on Luaka
Bop's 1995 compilation album "The Soul of Black Peru." In the
intervening years, Baca has become a world-music diva along the lines
of Cesaria Evora or Mercedes Sosa, turning her unlikely dream of
rescuing the black roots of Peruvian music into reality.</LD>
<LD>   Recognition has done Baca plenty of good. Her Knitting Factory
Hollywood performance was luminous, her powerful yet delicate voice
resonating with remarkable purity. Backed by her longtime quartet,
the singer presented material from "Espiritu Vivo," a stirring,
uplifting album she recorded in New York City during the week
following Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Older Baca staples such as "Valentin" and "Zancudito" were greeted
with shrieks of delight by the capacity audience. But the evening's
most flavorful moments came courtesy of the new songs, such as a
revised version of Mongo Santamaria's classic "Afro-Blue," which adds
lyrics to its sensuous melody.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the singer's previous Los Angeles engagements suggested a
timid, restrained performer, Baca was relaxed Thursday, dancing
wildly whenever the music picked up steam and projecting an
effervescent energy that had an almost healing quality.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's persona is recognizable by anyone familiar with Latin
culture. With her warm smile and soothing movements, she evokes the
archetypal image of the nourishing mother, the powerful priestess.
She represents the indestructible Latin American woman who,
metaphorically speaking, has for centuries supported an entire
continent on her tireless back.</TE>

<LD>It is, no doubt, commendable when actors stand up for their
colleagues in other countries ("Vietnamese Actor Under Fire for U.S.
Film Roles," by Anita M. Busch, Sept. 30).</LD>
<LD>   However, before we get too critical of Vietnam, we should consider
how we would react toward an American actor featured prominently in
an Iraqi film portraying Iraqis as the good guys!</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I appreciate Emory Holmes II's articulate defense of the
controversial "Barbershop" character ("A Subversive Clown Uses Lies
to Get at the Truth," Sept. 28), but I'm very sad that such a defense
was even necessary.</LD>
<LD>   At many times in our history, freedom was something Americans gave
up their lives for. Freedom means being able to say things that other
people don't like. The comments made in "Barbershop" never should
have needed so much defending in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   But if the Rev. Al Sharpton wants to go to the barricades over
free speech, he's still going to find people willing to defend
freedom with their lives, even in these cynical, politically correct
times.</LD>
<TE>   PATRICIA SCHWARZ</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whoever authorized the commentary by Emory Holmes II should be
fired. Holmes didn't criticize "Barbershop" so much as he wasted a
column calling Cedric the Entertainer's character names.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes called the character, who had the temerity to hold contrary
views from the slaves who inhabit the civil rights plantation, a
clown, a liar and a fool. What he really is saying is that the truth
hurts.</TE>
<TE>   I should think that a movie written, produced and directed by
blacks that shows different views among blacks should be applauded. A
story in which all the characters agree is not only false, it's
boring.</TE>
<TE>   ROBERT S. RODGERS</TE>
<TE>   Culver City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is right on the money. Perhaps Jesse Jackson and Al
Sharpton should take a course in Drama 101 so they might better
understand the role of the clown, the foil and the provocateur.</TE>
<TE>   You would think that Sharpton--of all people--would already know
this, having played those parts so often.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Howard Rosenberg's review of CBS' new show "Still Standing"
("Working-Class Palooka Delivers Crude Zingers in 'Still Standing,' "
Sept. 30): I don't quite understand what actor Mark Addy's "big belly
fronting a slobby body that looks like an unmade bed" has to do with
the quality (or lack thereof) of the television show.</LD>
<LD>   What I do understand is why actors are constantly under pressure
to be rail-thin and model-perfect. Their reviews depend on it.</LD>

<LD>I enjoyed your article regarding the price increase for the Los
Angeles Philharmonic ("Philharmonic Prices Jump," by Christopher
Reynolds, Sept. 28), except I don't think you should be comparing
their prices to staged performances and basketball games. It is a bit
like comparing apples and oranges.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic was already the most expensive
orchestra in town. My orchestra-level subscription seat will be going
from $65 to $120, an 85% increase.</LD>
<LD>   I will not be renewing my subscription, but I hope to attend the
L.A. Philharmonic for their annual visit to the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, where the orchestra-level seats are still
around $60, and even less for subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   I know there are music lovers who would not have to drastically
alter their lifestyle to accommodate the increase in subscription
ticket prices. I only hope there are enough of them to keep the
Philharmonic's already declining attendance from dropping any
further.</TE>

<LD>We echoed Daryl H. Miller's sentiment as we sat through last Friday
night's performance of "Mamma Mia!" at the Ahmanson: We spent $150
for this ("Sure, It's a Boogie Fest, but Is It Worth the Price?"
Sept. 27)?</LD>
<LD>   However, Miller was being charitable in his review. He only
commented on the amateurish nature of the scenery and book. The
performance that we saw included dancers out of step and singers off
the beat. The songs were all in one dynamic range: loud. The sound
mix was such that the actors' words were muffled by the music.</LD>
<LD>   Shouldn't we be able to expect that a production brought to the
Ahmanson Theatre by the Center Theatre Group will at least meet a
minimum standard of professional performance?</LD>

<TE>   Talk about picking on minutiae for a critique. "Mamma Mia!" was
fun, the audience loved it, the music is great but the set didn't
appeal to him and the story line wasn't deep enough? Give me a break.</TE>

more could you ask for the price of a ticket?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It should be easy to live proudly, without regret--and when the time
comes, to die that way too.</LD>
<LD>   But for Moises, who's about to make that big exit, the situation
has become complicated. His closest friends and family are gathered
for one last party when secrets come bubbling up, scattering people
to separate parts of the house. Aware of things crumbling around him,
Moises slips into another fog bank of AIDS-related dementia, where a
new clarity emerges.</LD>
<LD>   Other plays would collapse under the weight of all the issues that
Evelina Fernandez piles onto "dementia," receiving its world premiere
as a Latino Theatre Company presentation at the Los Angeles Theatre
Center. Yet Fernandez's story keeps getting stronger as the load
increases.</LD>
<TE>   The production marks a dazzling return for the Latino Theatre
Company, which got its start as the Latino Theatre Lab at the center
in the mid-1980s and has passed through other incarnations on its way
to the present one. The company has remained largely out of sight in
the six years since its presentation at the center of Fernandez's
"Luminarias," which was then made into a movie.</TE>
<TE>   A sense of purpose drives the return. AIDS, same-sex desire and
other topics in "dementia" are taboo in much of the Latino community.
Before Thursday's opening performance, company artistic director and
"dementia" director Jose Luis Valenzuela said he wanted to get people
talking, because in the silence, the number of AIDS infections just
keeps increasing.</TE>
<TE>   The story unfolds against a two-story backdrop of dark, brooding
clouds and fluttering black birds (designed by Laura Fine). While
Moises (Sal Lopez) lies in bed, hooked to an IV drip, a drag queen
(Richard Coca) in a dazzling indigo gown materializes on a grand
staircase that cuts through the troubled sky. She may be Moises'
alter ego; she may be his angel of death. But one thing is certain:
She has come to bring people together and prompt them to face
unresolved issues, before it's too late.</TE>
<TE>   Those who gather are Moises' pregnant, husbandless 16-year-old
niece, Tamara (Tonantzin Esparza), who has become his caretaker; his
gay buddy since their childhood together in East Los Angeles, Martin
(Danny De La Paz); and his theater-making collaborator and best pal,
Eddie (Geoffrey Rivas); and Eddie's wife, Alice (Lucy Rodriguez).
Finally, there is Moises' former wife, Raquel (playwright Fernandez),
whom he hasn't seen in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to keep the mood light, Moises turns old movie dialogue
into one-liners--at one point evoking the hissing voice of Darth
Vader as he speaks through his oxygen mask.</TE>
<TE>   The troublesome drag queen, however, keeps whispering questions
into the air. That is, when she isn't otherwise busy singing
disco-diva anthems or Spanish-language torch songs (which Coca
delivers in a deliciously smooth, sultry voice).</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Martin tearfully explains how taunts and beatings
drove him from the Eastside and his Latino heritage. Raquel describes
the pain of loving Moises, only to be cast aside when he could no
longer live a lie.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS has been addressed in gay plays since at least 1984 and these
other issues for still longer. So, in some ways, "dementia" feels
almost old-fashioned in its insistence on bringing up these topics at
this late date. The Latino Theatre Company, however, feels a need to
pull together people of all kinds and whisper questions into the air.
In this way, it's behaving a lot like Lupe, the drag queen in the
story.</TE>
<TE>   To judge by the audience gathered Thursday, the mission will be
accomplished. As in the old days, the Los Angeles Theatre Center's
immense lobby became a meeting place for people of many
cultures--straight and gay, theater lovers and first-time attendees.
And they couldn't stop talking.</TE>

<LD>   'Presidio Med' Regroups in Danner's Absence</LD>
<LD>   Blythe Danner, a co-star on the new CBS drama "Presidio Med," will
be taking a leave from the series, requiring the producers to shoot
around her character.</LD>
<TE>   Danner's husband, producer Bruce Paltrow, died Wednesday while on
a trip in Italy with the couple's daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   The medical series features an ensemble cast that includes Dana
Delany and Anna Deavere Smith. Those characters' story lines likely
will be expanded to offset Danner's absence. A spokeswoman for Warner
Bros. Television, which produces the show, said the producers were
working to accommodate Danner's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   'Saturday Night Live' Juggles Cast Members</TE>
<TE>   There will be two new cast members when NBC's "Saturday Night

Will Forte will replace Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, longtime cast
members who've left the show.</TE>
<TE>   Armisen has appeared on NBC's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" and
HBO's music show "Reverb." Forte comes from the Los Angeles improv
outfit the Groundlings, as have "SNL" cast members Jimmy Fallon,
Chris Kattan, Chris Parnell and Maya Rudolph.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC Has Slated 'Countdown: Iraq'</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC confirmed Friday that it will launch a program devoted

<TE>   Beginning Monday, the hourlong "Countdown: Iraq" will air weekdays
at 4 p.m., replacing "Nachman," which will move to the 2 p.m. hour.
That show is hosted by MSNBC's editor in chief, Jerry Nachman.</TE>

<TE>   Smoke and Fog Effects Worry Artists' Guild</TE>
<TE>   Worried that its members' health is at risk, the American Guild of
Musical Artists will try to convince opera and ballet productions to
adopt new policies about the use of smoke and fog on stage.</TE>
<TE>   As part of future contract negotiations, Back Stage reports, the
union will seek to require producers to use only dry ice or steam to
generate fog and smoke, and to give guild members at least two weeks'
advance notice that such stage effects will be used.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Gordon, national executive director of the guild, said the
policy is needed because of concerns that performers and musicians
are damaging their health by being exposed to the amount and type of
smoke and fog used on stage. Actors' Equity Assn. already has an
agreement in place with the League of American Theatres and Producers
on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra Money Woes Know No Borders</TE>
<TE>   The financial woes besetting classical music groups continue.</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Orchestra, which had a $1.3-million deficit last
season, has canceled its five-concert Chamber Music Series and will
reduce salaries for some senior staff, including 10% cuts for music
director Franz Welser-Most and executive director Thomas Morris,
according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Canada's CFCN-TV reports that musicians at the Calgary
Philharmonic Orchestra have offered to take a 12.3% pay cut to help
make up for a $1.1-million deficit there.</TE>

<HD>Jazzy Language for Complicated Times</HD>
<DH>Poetry* Against a background of political tensions, Quincy
Troupe gives his first reading as the state's poet laureate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're a poet, you're supposed to choose words carefully. And if
you were Quincy Troupe on Friday morning, you were choosing really
carefully.</LD>
<LD>   Troupe, a 62-year-old UC San Diego professor who was named
California's poet laureate in June, stood at a lectern at the Omni
Los Angeles Hotel downtown, facing a crowd of diplomats and cultural
officials from 39 countries. He was there to give his first official
reading, and they had gathered to talk about global cooperation and
arts exchanges--a delicate chore with the U.S. on a war footing, the
United Nations and President Bush at odds, and immigration officials
here cutting back on visas for visiting artists.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we need to stop and have a pause here," Troupe had mused
before the reading. "War, as far as I am concerned, has never solved
a problem. We think it's going to, but it never does."</LD>
<TE>   The poet's pacifism wasn't the only complication. By odd
coincidence, Amiri Baraka, a poet-professor friend of Troupe's from
days gone by in New York, landed his own poet laureate post two
months ago, in New Jersey. And just two weeks ago, Baraka stunned a
poetry festival audience by hinting in a publicly read poem that
Israel had advance warning of the Sept. 11 attacks. Soon New Jersey's
governor was calling for Baraka's resignation (the poet declined),
and Jewish groups and others were denouncing Baraka as an
anti-Semite. The events troubled Troupe--he sees Baraka as a good man
whose words were twisted--and now here stood the California poet with
his chance to make international waves.</TE>
<TE>   Two strides from the podium sat Barry Hessenius, California Arts
Council director. Three steps from him sat Gov. Gray Davis' secretary
of foreign affairs, Michael Flores. Neither had seen or discussed
what Troupe would read.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a series of poems," Troupe began, peering at a page
through reading glasses, his dreadlocks draped on the shoulders of
his black jacket.</TE>
<TE>   We enter the language of poetry</TE>
<TE>   in the same way we enter music:</TE>
<TE>   through rhythms of imagination...</TE>
<TE>   The poet's voice darted ahead, as if keeping up with a bebop
rhythm section, and the lyrics jumped from John Coltrane's circular
breathing to the hum of didgeridoos to the prospect of Magic Johnson
in flight, dealing out passes "like the juju man that you am, / like
sho-nuff shaman man that you am, 'Magic,'/ like the sho-nuff spaceman
that you am."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe invoked the tolling of bells, the miracle of
reconfiguration, the moments "when we are what we think we are." At
no time did he utter the words "Israel," "Iraq," "Bush" or "war," nor
did he read aloud the line about the seductive sweet strides of the
dancing women, or the other line about making sweet love. But he did
pause from the reading to tell the audience that "with all these
kinds of people that are in California and the world, I think one
should talk about healing.... What are governments for, if we're not
about bringing things together?"</TE>
<TE>   Beforehand, offstage, Troupe had laid out his intentions and dealt
with the Baraka question he knew was coming. "Some people are
provocateurs," he said. "I see myself as a healer. If you were
catching me when I was 25 or 30, it might be a different story." As
for Baraka, "he has the right to write whatever kind of poem he
wants, to read whatever kind of poem he wants. I don't believe in
censorship."</TE>
<TE>   Baraka was appointed Aug. 28 by a committee selected by New
Jersey's Council on the Humanities and Council for the Arts. He set
off the controversy at a Sept. 19 poetry festival in Waterloo, N.J.,
where he delivered a six-page poem, written in late 2001, titled
"Somebody Blew Up America." It included the following lines:</TE>
<TE>   Who knew the World Trade Center</TE>
<TE>   was</TE>
<TE>   gonna get bombed</TE>
<TE>   Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers</TE>
<TE>   To stay home that day</TE>
<TE>   Why did Sharon stay away?</TE>
<TE>   A widely celebrated poet, playwright and professor emeritus of
Africana studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook,
Baraka won attention as an author and activist in the early '60s. (He
was known as LeRoi Jones until his 1968 conversion to Islam, which
was later tempered as he turned toward Marxism.)</TE>
<TE>   When the furor erupted over his poem, Baraka declined to apologize
or resign his laureate post, and told reporters that Web accounts had
persuaded him that Israel, Bush and the FBI all knew in advance about
the attacks. New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey, who had approved Baraka's
appointment, called for the poet's resignation, but state officials
discovered that legislation creating the poet post didn't empower the
governor or anyone else to fire the poet.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Amiri Baraka for many years, and I don't believe him
to be anti-Semitic," Troupe said. He noted that the controversial
poem was framed as a series of questions, not definitive answers.
Baraka "might disagree with some of the things going on in Israel.
But there are a lot of Jewish people who disagree with that too," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As for his own position, Troupe said, "I feel very honored and
privileged that Gov. Gray Davis appointed me. I'm not going to run
around trying to find ways to embarrass him. But I don't think that
he has the right to tell me what to write."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe's job, one of 24 state poet laureate posts nationwide,
includes a $10,000-a-year stipend, and as a gubernatorial appointee,
he serves at the pleasure of the governor. If the position included
limits on his freedom of expression, Troupe said, "I wouldn't have
accepted the job."</TE>
<TE>   Up at the lectern, Troupe's spell lasted about 10 minutes, all
jazzy delivery and intimate tone. He wound it up with three short,
spare lines:</TE>
<TE>   beauty all places</TE>
<TE>   here, look inside yourself now,</TE>
<TE>   look deeper, it's there.</TE>
<TE>   Then, amid enthusiastic applause, he retreated to the head table,
placed a hand upon his wife's knee, and smiled when the arts
council's Hessenius took the microphone to voice the sort of
perplexity every poet laureate wants to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "I've now followed you three times on three different occasions,"
Hessenius said, nodding to Troupe, "and I will not follow you again.
It's not fair."</TE>

<HD>Benigni Unveils Top-Secret 'Pinocchio' to Italian Press</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Roberto Benigni, whose "Life Is Beautiful" won three Oscars, has now
put his puckish, high-energy stamp on a figure dear to Italians
--Pinocchio--causing many here to wonder how he'll make their beloved
puppet come to life.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Benigni gave the Italian media their first look at
"Pinocchio."</LD>
<LD>   While boldness has been his trademark--the Holocaust story "Life
Is Beautiful" employed whimsy and comic touches--Benigni apparently
decided to play it safe with "Pinocchio," according to those who saw
the preview.</LD>
<TE>   "This 'Pinocchio' doesn't seem to have any intention to astound
but only to tell a story that everyone knows in the simplest and most
entertaining ways possible," the Italian news agency ANSA said.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which opens in Italy next week and in the United States
at Christmas, is the costliest Italian production ever, at more than
$40 million. It was shot in virtual secrecy at the former
chemical-plant-turned-studio that Benigni used when making "Life Is
Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   While many Americans' image of Pinocchio and his story might come
from Walt Disney's 1940 animated classic, Italians tend to have a
different image, based on the books they had as children. For them,
Carlo Collodi's 1880 book "The Adventures of Pinocchio" is more than
just a classic tale for children. For generations, the story of how a
naughty, headstrong puppet transforms itself into a responsible
little boy has been a rite of passage, a kind of morality primer on
how to grow up.</TE>
<TE>   As he did in "Life Is Beautiful," Benigni doubles as star and
director in "Pinocchio," and his wife, Nicoletta Braschi, returns
here as his foil as the blue-haired fairy.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian media have given the film a big buildup, with one
newsweekly, Panorama, predicting that "Pinocchio" will "launch a
debate on our national character," which it said resembled the
puppet's qualities: "A puppet outside of the rules, clever, lying and
highly reckless. But in the end, he squeaks by."</TE>

<HD>A Premiere Week for Egypt</HD>
<DH>Television* Three documentaries set in the ancient country
debut. A stylish 'King Tut' is followed by shows on dinosaurs and
lost tombs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three nights, three documentaries and three topics--a dinosaur that
stands 100 feet tall, a 2,500-year-old murder mystery and a cache of
headless mummies--would seem to be worlds apart except for one common
denominator: all are set in ancient Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   Call it Egypt Week on television. "The Assassination of King Tut,"
"The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt" and "Egypt Eternal: The Quest for Lost
Tombs" make their television premieres this week.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday night on Discovery, "The Assassination of King Tut" is a
feature-length take on A&amp;E's "Cold Case Files" with an "Unsolved
Mysteries"-style soundtrack. Easily the most stylish of the three
documentaries, it features actor William Hurt narrating striking
dramatizations that give form to decades of fact and fantasy about
royalty and riches, court intrigues and curses--everything associated
with the boy king, Tutankhamen, owner of the world's richest tomb.</LD>
<TE>   Since Howard Carter first entered the tomb in 1922, countless
theories about the young king's death have been proffered, but the
investigators in this case are not Egyptologists, they are detectives
Gregory Cooper, a former FBI agent, and Provo, Utah, police chief and
Mike King, a former director of the Utah criminal Tracking and
Analysis Project in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically a death investigation looks at four different forms of
evidence: physical or forensic evidence, circumstantial evidence,
eyewitness and confession," Cooper explains, noting how the partners
used forensic science and techniques developed by the FBI to identify
the murderer of Tutankhamen.</TE>
<TE>   "We were given access to the actual X-rays of Tutankhamen--the
X-ray of the skull first sparked rumors of possible homicide," King
adds. The detectives' forensic team concludes that the king suffered
a blow to the head. Some Egyptologists, however, question such
conclusions. Salima Ikram of the American University in Cairo wonders
"how the scientist can be sure that it was an ante- and not a
postmortem blow to the head?"</TE>
<TE>   Egyptologists likely will continue arguing this point for years.
But the detectives provide psychological profiles that, despite
analysis from behavioral and legal advisors who seem bent on
overlaying 21st century geopolitical interpretations on 18th dynastic
reality, make persuasive cases against the usual suspects: the wife
(Ankhsenamun), the man-behind-the-throne (advisor Ay), the commander
of the army (Horemheb) and the treasurer (Maya). And the detectives
name the perpetrator.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, A&amp;E's "The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt" reaches past
pharaohs and pyramids 90 million years into prehistory to the time of
dinosaurs. A&amp;E's programming conveniently moves from its weekend
offering of science fiction about dinosaurs, "The Lost World," to the
very real science of paleontology and dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Smith, a 30-year-old graduate student at the University of
Pennsylvania, leads an expedition of 14 scientists into Egypt's
western desert to pick up where a little-known scientist, Ernst
Stromer, discovered the fossil remains of an unknown species of
dinosaurs in 1911. Specimens of Stromer's find were destroyed during
World War II, and the scientist would have remained a footnote in the
annals of paleontology were it not for Smith, who, with fellow
scientist Matt Lamanna, resumed Stromer's quest.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the team are stymied by a landscape reshaped by
shifting sands and are caught in a sandstorm. They suffer through
days of backbreaking work, picking through gravel and fragments of
bone, and even have a few "Survivor" moments when frayed nerves and
fatigue lead to arguments. But, with only days remaining on their
mission, the Penn University team comes across a dinosaur humerus: an
upper arm bone that measures more than 67 inches long. The program
then uses animatronics to bring to life the 100-foot-tall, 70-ton
dinosaur that is named Paralititan Stromeri.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Quest' on PBS</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's PBS documentary, "Egypt Eternal: The Quest for Lost
Tombs," retraces the progress of parallel excavations by National
Geographic teams in the Bahariya Oasis and in the funerary complex of
Saqqara some 13 miles south of Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Alain Zivie heads the Saqqara excavation in sight of Egypt's first
pyramid, the Step Pyramid of Djoser. After years of work, the French
archeologist's patience was rewarded with his discovery in 1997 of
the tomb of Maia, the wet-nurse of Tutankhamen. Perhaps the most
significant find in the program is Zivie's discovery of Netjerwymes,
an emissary of Ramses the Great. Cameras follow the archeologist as
he revisits Netjerwymes' tomb for a look at the stunning 19th dynasty
statuary that accompanied the king's man into the afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary switches between Saqqara and Bahariya, where
Egyptologist Zahi Hawass explores with his team another of the
incredible Greco-Roman burials in a maze of underground chambers. En
route to the most recent excavations, the Egyptologist stops to
explore a tomb filled with headless mummies. These mummies were
likely victims of tomb robbers. But in their haste, the robbers left
behind an extraordinary collection of gold and precious stone
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   Though the scientific breakthroughs and certain conclusions of
these documentaries will doubtless be debated in scientific circles,
some findings will find their way into history books. In any case,
the experience of seeing the face of Tutankhamen, hearing the scream
of the Paralititan and witnessing the up-close-and-personal views
into the riches and mysteries of the ancient world and its
spectacular riches and mysteries more than make up for any
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Assassination of King Tut" will be shown Sunday at 9 p.m. on
Discovery. "The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt" will be shown Monday at 8
p.m. on A&amp;E. "Egypt Eternal: The Quest for Lost Tombs" will be shown

<LD>Four local theater companies at Japan America Theater and seven
additional companies or performers--including four from other
countries--will appear at the Frida Kahlo Theatre in the first
International Theatre Festival of Los Angeles, Nov. 1-10, festival
organizers announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The acronym for the festival is FITLA, which is taken from the
Spanish: Festival Internacional de Teatro, Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. companies and artists who will appear at the 841-seat
Japan America Theater in Little Tokyo are Teatro de Sinergia
performing its long- running "Frida Kahlo," Herbert Siguenza of
Culture Clash in his new solo show "eforeCantinflas!," East L.A. Classic
Theatre in its conquistador-era version of "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" and Culture Clash in "Culture Clash in Americca."</LD>
<TE>   The plaza in front of the Japan America Theater will host a
carnaval celebration on Nov. 1 and a Day of the Dead celebration on
Nov. 2 before the evening performances.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities of the adjacent Japan American Cultural and
Community Center will be used for workshops as part of an educational
convocation in conjunction with the festival.</TE>
<TE>   The little Frida Kahlo Theater, just north of MacArthur Park, will
be the venue for Guillermo Gomez-Pena's "Etno-Tecno," Colombia's Mapa
Teatro in an untitled performance, Mexico City's Coincidencia in "No
ser Hamlet," Puerto Rico's Taller de Otra Cosa in a performance that
includes dance and video, the Costa Rican American performer Elia
Arce in "First Woman on the Moon," the Cuban-born but recently
Argentina-based Teatro del Obstaculo in "Aplaude con una Mano" and
Peru's Yuyachkani in "No me toquen ese Valse." Teatro de Sinergia, a
resident company at the Frida Kahlo, also will perform "Frida Kahlo"
there, as well as "Kiss of the Spider Woman."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, a performance of the Bilingual Foundation of the
Arts production of "The Mayor of Zalamea" at the company's 99-seat
theater in Lincoln Heights will be included on the festival schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the performances are in Spanish, others in English; those
by Siguenza, Culture Clash, Arce and Taller de Otra Cosa are billed
as bilingual.</TE>
<TE>   The festival was organized last year by Jorge Folgueira's local
company, Folgueira's Itinerant Theatre. A Cuban-trained artist who
worked in Mexico and came to the United States in 1998, Folgueira is
the festival's president and artistic director. William Flores, a
Salvadoran emigre, is its executive director and a member of
Folgueira's troupe.</TE>
<TE>   The Folgueira group's tours to festivals in other countries
inspired Folgueira and Flores to create a festival in Los Angeles,
Flores said. The festival's budget is $150,000, of which only $50,000
is in cash, with the remainder in-kind donations.</TE>
<TE>   All of the companies are donating their services, Flores said,
although some of the foreign performers will receive lodging and
per-diem payments. The festival received $7,000 grants from the Los
Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and the National Performance
Network.</TE>
<TE>   Single ticket prices will be $8 to $15 at the Japan America
Theater and $13 to $15 at the Frida Kahlo, but passes to all of the
performances at each venue also are available at a lower per-show
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said the festival is envisioned as "a bridge to theater
around the world." He hopes local arts presenters will see some of
the foreign companies and invite them back for longer runs.</TE>

<HD>From Playful Salonen, a Little Night Mischief</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are few places where programming Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana"
will raise an eyebrow. However much this boisterously popular setting
of secular medieval Latin poems is viewed as splashy junk fare, many
of today's respected conductors--including James Levine, Christian
Thielemann and Franz Welser-Most--have recorded it in recent years.
The latest is a sound spectacular from the Atlanta Symphony led by
Donald Runnicles, who is currently doing a fine job in San Francisco
conducting Messiaen's uncompromising opera, "Saint Francois
d'Assise."</LD>
<LD>   Still, it was quite a surprise Thursday night that Esa-Pekka
Salonen opened the Los Angeles Philharmonic's new season with
"Carmina Burana." This was the last opening-night concert in the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion before the Philharmonic moves to the Walt
Disney Concert Hall next season, and Salonen, one of the most
intellectually curious and imaginative conductors in the business,
tends to shun the obvious, of which there is much in "Carmina
Burana."</LD>
<TE>   But after 10 seasons in L.A., Esa-Pekka Salonen has also lightened
up a lot, letting his mischievous side out more and more in public.
And what better way to thwart expectations than for him to approach
his first time with the Orff score with the kind of winning relish
that only accompanies a guilty pleasure? Provocatively pairing
"Carmina Burana" with the suite to Bartok's ballet-pantomime "The
Miraculous Mandarin," the Philharmonic decided to save the big,
serious orchestral statements, of which there will be no shortage,
until later in the season. First let there be kinky sex and games,
which, if you think about it, is very L.A. after all.</TE>
<TE>   As the savory before the sweet, Bartok's music did much to help
make Orff's considerably more palatable and interesting. Written in
1924, "Miraculous Mandarin" vividly describes through music a brazen
scenario. Three thugs compel a prostitute to lure an old man and a
student to her room for a shakedown. The third victim is the
spectral, supernatural Mandarin. They try to murder him, but he can
die only through the cathartic force of physical love.</TE>
<TE>   The suite, which does not include that final catharsis, is
slightly less sensational than the full work, but still ripe with
seductive sounds, instrumental violence and some of Bartok's most
striking orchestral effects. And Salonen got the Philharmonic
reveling in it, with thrilling massed climaxes. The men are lured
with the sounds of increasingly lurid wind solos, and clarinetist
Michele Zukovsky and oboist David Weiss made them marvelously
effective.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with "Miraculous Mandarin," "Carmina Burana" can seem
like an idealized Middle Ages Oktoberfest--Latin poems about love,
drink, gambling, clergy and fickle fate all given beery Bavarian
cheer in Orff's music.</TE>
<TE>   But for the blustery simple-mindedness of this 1936 German score,
written in a time and place where the definition of decadence was
extensive, there is also a subtle craft at work. The simple
directness of much of the score has an unmistakable elegance and
individuality.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was highly entertaining. Salonen played everything
for good-natured theatrical effect. The three soloists seemed to be
having a fine time. Rodney Gilfry was the highly expressive baritone,
manipulating his melodies as lyrically as he could. Tenor Sanford
Olsen made a funny drunk and produced an exhilarating sound. Soprano
Harolyn Blackwell, after a slight initial unsteadiness, floated some
startlingly effective high notes. The L.A. Master Chorale sang with
gusto and clarity; the L.A. Children's Chorus added to the liveliness
and good nature.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing that good nature, however, with ears prepared by the
Bartok's nasty tale, was instructive. It reminded us that "Carmina
Burana's" wide appeal is not only its surface innocence, but also the
recognition that Orff's musical merrymaking had a necessarily
provocative, unspoken edge to it.</TE>

<LD>Grandma never met an illness she didn't like and reads the grandkids
disease-of-the-week bedtime stories. Work-at-home product-tester Dad,
an unreliable helpmate, worries about why his 2-year-old son sits
down to go potty. Mom juggles a thankless job, her irresponsible
husband, housework, kids, Grandma and guilt.</LD>
<LD>   In tried-and-true fashion, "Committed," a weekly animated series
premiering Sunday at 7 p.m. on WE: Women's Entertainment, mines the
ups and downs, lunacy and bliss of domestic life and related
real-world stresses for humor.</LD>
<LD>   Based on Michael Fry's syndicated comic strip, which has legions
of fans, the series stretches the parent-centric humor thin, despite
the top-notch voice cast--an "SCTV" reunion of sorts, with Catherine
O'Hara as put-upon Mom, Eugene Levy as Dad, Andrea Martin as Grandma
and Dave Thomas as Bob the dog, who observes it all.</LD>
<TE>   In the first three episodes, the running jokes lose steam fast:
the put-downs of Mom's sexist boss and the manipulations of her
unscrupulous male colleague, Dad's willingness to have Mom shoulder
most of the load, not to mention his persistent angst over his
toddler's masculinity; and Grandma's unpleasant hypochondria--she
walks around in a germ-free "bubble" and at one point makes this
response to what she considers an obvious question: "Is colonoscopy a
pain in the butt?"</TE>
<TE>   Not even the show's few moments of genuinely resonant parental
reality can overcome forced plotlines involving a confrontation with
a cookie-peddling Mafioso and the boss' wife blackmailing Mom into
becoming the poster-child for her "women who can't afford a nanny"
campaign.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Says It Will Take a Charge of $158 Million</HD>
<DH>Planes: Manufacturer also is extending a price freeze on
commercial aircraft spare parts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign that the commercial aircraft industry won't be
recovering any time soon, Boeing Co. said Friday that third-quarter
earnings would be cut by a $158-million charge, reflecting a sharp
drop in the value of commercial jets it helps finance.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Boeing said it is extending a price freeze on
commercial airplane spare parts to help the airline industry. Prices
for parts, produced by Boeing as well as independent suppliers, will
remain at 2001 levels, Boeing said.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of suppliers in Southern California make Boeing parts,
and the move could further exacerbate declining profits.</LD>
<TE>   The world's biggest commercial aircraft maker also operates one of
the largest aircraft-financing businesses, which has been hurt by
shrinking demand for jets after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The value of aircraft that the Boeing Capital Corp. unit helped
buy or lease has shrunk by as much as 40% in some cases. At the same
time, credit ratings for the struggling airlines have been reduced,
raising financing risk and cost.</TE>
<TE>   The unit had $11.5 billion in financing assets at the end of the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In taking the charge, Boeing said it was expecting airline traffic
and profitability to gradually recover after the attacks, but "recent
announcements by the major domestic airlines and credit rating
agencies indicate that this recovery will not be as rapid as
anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the company said it decided to bolster reserves to
account for the reduced value of the aircraft. Boeing said older and
out-of-production aircraft have seen the most significant decline in
value, but added that even newer models have seen "moderate"
declines.</TE>
<TE>   The charge, which will reduce per-share earnings by 20 cents,
prompted investors to unload Boeing stock Friday. Boeing shares fell
$2.30 to $32.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company earned
$713 million, or 88 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Analysts on average estimated that Boeing would post 66 cents for the
latest third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing is scheduled to report third-quarter results Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts said the charge was not unexpected considering
the dismal outlook for the airline industry, which has been trimming
orders for new jets and taking aircraft out of service. About 2,500
commercial jets now sit in so-called boneyards worldwide waiting to
be called back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not surprising, given the state of the airline industry and
the lack of demand for aircraft," said Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace
analyst for JSA Research Inc. who does not own Boeing stock.</TE>

<KH>THE PHILIP MORRIS DECISION</KH>
<HD>After the Smoke Clears, Regrets</HD>
<DH>Profile: In hundreds of pages of court documents, plaintiff
Betty Bullock recalls her life and the role cigarettes played in it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a high school cheerleader, athlete, nurse's assistant and life
insurance agent, Betty Bullock was surrounded by the danger signs of
smoking for most of her life.</LD>
<LD>   The 64-year-old Newport Beach grandmother, who is dying of lung
cancer, won a record $28-billion jury award from the Philip Morris
Cos. on Friday, an award that is sure to be appealed beyond Bullock's
expected life span now that the cancer has spread to her liver.</LD>
<LD>   Family members and Bullock's attorney said she was not available
for an interview, but her life story as a smoker emerges in hundreds
of pages of court testimony and depositions.</LD>
<TE>   Bullock, who for much of her adult life smoked two packs a day,
picked up the habit as a high school senior. She said she was
attracted by advertisements depicting "romantic couples" who looked
like Elizabeth Taylor and Clark Gable puffing away.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, Bullock left her native South Dakota to pursue
golden dreams in the Golden State. But those dreams eventually faded
through two divorces, a series of jobs that included changing the
diapers of seniors in nursing homes and now what is described as a
terminal illness.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, Bullock suffered though repeated
emergency-room trips and hospital admissions because of severe
bronchitis and pneumonia. Her doctors suggested that she reduce
smoking the Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes she kept in her purse.</TE>
<TE>   But pulling a smoke out of her purse was an old habit.</TE>
<TE>   In one deposition, Bullock described how she would ask for breaks
during her job as a data processor at UC Irvine to "run downstairs"
and polish off a third of a cigarette before having to hurry back to
work.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, when Bullock worked for a grocer, she enraged
fellow employees by dumping cigarette ashes into a wastebasket,
causing a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a Philip Morris attorney whether she knew before her
diagnosis that smoking caused lung cancer and other deadly diseases,
Bullock answered: "I thought all kinds of controversy on it. I would
read the little clip in the paper here or there. Some medical studies
were stating such that they felt that it could.</TE>
<TE>   "But then I'd see things Philip Morris would say like that's just
statistics, there is no medical proof. Our No. 1 concern is our
customers, and we protect their health and there wasn't any health
risks," Bullock said in a deposition.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Philip Morris attorney Peter Bleakley told
jurors that Bullock didn't try to quit until 1998. She was diagnosed
with lung cancer in February 2001. Bullock also smoked other Philip
Morris brands, including Marlboros and L&amp;M cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   An active and popular student at her Watertown, S.D., high school,
Bullock was voted Sweetheart of the Year by the boys. She was a
cheerleader, active in drama and a member of the gymnastics club.
While in high school, Bullock hatched a plan to move to Southern
California, arriving in Los Angeles in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   She landed a job at the Cannon Electric plant, enrolled in
Pasadena City College and found her high school boyfriend, Phil
Wulff, who also had moved to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   They married in 1960, settling in South Dakota where Bullock's
daughter, Jodie Goldstein, was born.</TE>
<TE>   But working two jobs--as a data processor and a waitress, as well
as caring for Wulff's ill father--turned out to be too much stress on
the marriage. The couple divorced and Bullock headed back to
California, settling in Downey with Jodie.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this time that Jodie started to pester her mother
about the smoking habit, telling her that it "smelled bad" and made
the house "icky," according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout her school years, and even after, Jodie tried to get
her mother to stop smoking, often "nagging" her and pointing out how
it made Bullock cough.</TE>
<TE>   Jodie didn't like what the smoking was doing to her mother, at one
point telling Bullock: "I want to be skiing with you and ice skating
... and you'll probably have to pull one of those oxygen tanks, and
it'll be kind of hard to stay athletic like you have been."</TE>
<TE>   Bullock remarried in 1963. Marvin Bullock also was a
two-pack-a-day smoker. The marriage lasted 15 years, and Marvin
Bullock died of complications from emphysema and bleeding ulcers in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   On her own once again after the divorce, Bullock tried her hand at
the insurance business, taking a two-week prep course for a test to
become an agent. She flunked, but took more review courses,
eventually passed and for a brief stint sold life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   However, that job ended after six months and Bullock once again
was looking for another career. This time, she took classes at a
hospital and a regional occupational center to become a certified
nurse's assistant. During this period, Bullock accepted a job at a
nursing home, changing adult diapers, emptying bedpans and helping
seniors take showers--"kind of the dirty work," Bullock recalled. The
experience helped her gain her assistant's license.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock liked the work, but it was arduous. She often worked 60 to
70 hours a week and sometimes provided 24-hour care for her patients.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bullock's health continued to deteriorate. She tried to
quit smoking several times, seeking help from hypnotism, nicotine gum
and patches. Nothing worked. At the same time, Bullock acknowledged
that smoking was enjoyable--"social"--and that she liked a smoke with
a good meal.</TE>
<TE>   Later she learned that she had cancer. And in her deposition she
broke down, regretting the turn of events. "I was thinking that I was
in my teens and they were selling me these, this poison and this
addictive and brain-altering drug," Bullock said. "I was robbed
terribly, probably 20 years of my life being with my only grandchild
that's a baby and my daughter who has no sisters or brothers so she
needs me."</TE>

<HD>Tobacco Firms Struggling in West Coast Courts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Friday's record $28-billion punitive damage award against Philip
Morris Cos., West Coast courts continued to be a killing ground for
tobacco companies, whose success in fending off product liability
claims was once the envy of the corporate world.</LD>
<LD>   The victory by cancer victim Betty Bullock of Newport Beach marked
the industry's fourth straight courtroom defeat in California. With
two additional mega-verdicts in Oregon, cigarette makers are winless
in six consecutive West Coast trials dating back to 1999. All of the
cases are on appeal.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite an enormous amount of work, Philip Morris has appeared to
have made no progress in its California litigation strategies,"
Martin Feldman, tobacco analyst with Merrill Lynch, said after
Friday's verdict. "Jurors in California continue to remain
tremendously angered by the conduct that is portrayed by plaintiffs"
through internal industry documents, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The battle is scheduled to resume next week in Sacramento as jury
selection begins in a case filed against Philip Morris and R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. The two leading U.S. cigarette makers are
scheduled to go on trial again Oct. 21 in a case in San Francisco.
And Philip Morris and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. will be
defending a third case in Los Angeles in January.</TE>
<TE>   Although the industry has suffered a few losses elsewhere, there
is wide agreement that California juries seem especially hostile to
cigarette makers--and there are a number of theories why this is so.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting low social acceptance of smoking, California has the
nation's toughest protections against secondhand smoke and the lowest
per capita rate of smoking of any state but Utah. Robert Rabin, a
Stanford University law professor, notes that Californians have long
been concerned with air pollution and healthful lifestyles--and may
take a particularly negative view of industries that market dangerous
products.</TE>
<TE>   Even in non-tobacco cases, California juries at times have dealt
harshly with companies deemed to have ignored health or safety
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1999, for example, a Los Angeles jury ordered General
Motors Corp. to pay a then-record $4.8 billion in punitive damages to
six people who were badly burned in a fiery wreck. The award was
pared by the trial judge to $1.2 billion, and the case is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, anti-smoking sentiment in California has
been hardened over the years by state-sponsored ad campaigns that
attack not only smoking but also the character and motives of the
tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   The campaigns, funded by a 25-cent cigarette tax increase passed
by voters in 1988, have essentially poisoned the jury pool, tobacco
industry officials have complained. Though state health authorities
say the ads are intended to promote public health--not successful
litigation--many observers believe that they have increased disdain
toward the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Bullock case was the first to be tried since a state Supreme
Court ruling that tobacco officials and Wall Street analysts had
hoped might get the once-invincible industry back on the winning
track. The Aug. 5 ruling barred smokers from presenting evidence of
industry deception from 1988 to 1998--the period when a legislative
ban on product liability claims against the industry was in place.</TE>
<TE>   But that hope proved illusory, as the ruling reduced only slightly
the arsenal of incriminating documents available to plaintiffs,
including Bullock and her lawyer, Michael Piuze.</TE>
<TE>   Generated mostly in the 1950s, '60s, '70s and '80s, the documents
were the centerpiece of Bullock's case--and, as intended, focused the
jury's attention on the conduct of Philip Morris rather than on
Bullock's failure to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Although industry officials have sought to define the recent
setbacks as a West Coast problem, it's not clear why that should be a
source of comfort. Although its smoking rates are below average,
California has about one-eighth of the U.S. population and close to
that fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people estimated to get
sick or die each year from smoking-related causes.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there has been no shortage of potential California
plaintiffs--only of lawyers willing to invest the time and money
needed to battle the tobacco companies. . Only about 65 lawsuits by
individual smokers are pending in California now, but if the four
victories to date survive appeals, experts say, a flood of filings is
likely. Several hundred suits by individual smokers are pending
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Others question whether juror hostility is an isolated West Coast
phenomenon, noting that so few cases have been tried in other areas
that it's difficult to know.</TE>
<TE>   In 50 years of tobacco litigation, barely more than 50 individual
suits have been tried to verdicts--with hundreds more abandoned by
plaintiffs or dismissed before trial.</TE>
<TE>   Although only four cases have been tried in California since 1999,
only one state, Florida, has tried as many. And at times the industry
has shown some vulnerability where least expected.</TE>
<TE>   In June, for example, a U.S. district judge in Kansas City, Kan.,
hit R.J. Reynolds Tobacco with a $15-million punitive damage award in
the case of a former smoker who lost his legs to a circulatory
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Before the verdict, cigarette makers had never lost a case in
America's conservative Midwestern heartland and had never lost a case
in federal court, where stricter rules of evidence generally are
thought to favor the defense.</TE>
<TE>   And on Sept. 26--the same day the Bullock jury awarded
compensatory damages in her case--a jury in Puerto Rico awarded
damages of $500,000 in a wrongful-death case brought by the sons of a
deceased smoker.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, of the dozen or so smokers who have won damage awards
from cigarette makers, because of lengthy appeals, only one has been
able to collect. All of the other cases, including those on the West
Coast, are in various stages of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its poor showing in California, the industry still is
hoping for a knockout punch when the cases reach the state Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend that in every case plaintiffs have failed
to prove an essential ingredient of fraud--namely, that smokers
believed and relied on statements by tobacco companies when they
decided to start or continue to smoke. Without proof of such
reliance, they say, the findings of fraud and punitive damages can't
hold up.</TE>
<TE>   William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel
of Philip Morris, said this "will be an important issue in the appeal
of this case [Bullock], as it is in the other California cases."</TE>
<TE>   The Bullock verdict and the prospect of more punishing defeats for
the industry in California could build support for a longshot plan by
a New York judge to lump millions of injured smokers into a
nationwide class that could split a single pot of punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   In a novel ruling last month, U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in Brooklyn ordered a trial that could result in cigarette
makers paying billions of dollars into a giant fund to be divided
among all Americans who can show proof of smoking-related injuries
since 1993. The ruling, which experts say is unlikely to survive
industry appeals, is meant to reform what amounts to a lottery system
in which a few plaintiffs may reap windfall damages while a greater
number suffering identical injuries get nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   "If we continue the way this verdict [Bullock] indicates ... some
plaintiffs get tremendous windfalls by way of social punishment," but
"there will be other cases in other places where juries say you knew
the risks" and get nothing, said John Coffee, a Columbia University
law professor who has served as an aide to Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not predicting the companies will settle tomorrow, but their
thinking has to be affected by the growing tendency of California
juries to find for plaintiffs," Coffee said.</TE>

<HD>Walt Disney's Credit Rating Downgraded</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Standard &amp; Poor's is concerned about the
company's cash flow and debt load. The media giant says it remains
optimistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. was given a dose of grade deflation Friday when
credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's knocked its long-term corporate
credit rating out of the A levels for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's downgrade to BBB-plus from A-minus comes as the company
continues to suffer from disappointing theme park attendance, soft
ratings at its ABC network and a financial hangover from the
$5.2-billion purchase of cable network Fox Family Worldwide last
year.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P followed through on a threat to downgrade first issued in
August, shortly after the Burbank entertainment giant warned that its
profit would be worse than Wall Street expected.</LD>
<TE>   Another credit-rating firm, Fitch Ratings, already has downgraded
Disney. Moody's Investors Service has warned that it may take similar
action.</TE>
<TE>   In lowering the rating, S&amp;P said it believes Disney's free cash
flow--cash it could theoretically use to cut debt--"may not recover
dramatically until fiscal 2004."</TE>
<TE>   It added that Disney's dividend on its common stock is likely to
limit its ability to cut debt as well. Disney's board declares the
dividend annually. Last year, it was 21 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   A lower credit rating can be damaging because it can make
borrowing money more expensive for a company. S&amp;P's move also hurts
Disney's efforts to convince Wall Street that the company is turning
around.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lower rating, Disney's debt remains investment grade,
which means it is considered a relatively low risk. Disney had $13.1
billion in debt as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see particular pressures that would suggest a further
downgrade," said S&amp;P analyst Heather M. Goodchild.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P also affirmed Disney's short-term credit rating at A-2.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said it is reducing its debt load, has one of the world's
most-recognized brands and would continue to grow by using prudent
management and investments.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this rating action by S&amp;P as the result of short-term
business conditions, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for
the Walt Disney Co.," Disney said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock fell 95 cents to $15.05 a share in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen 27% this year.</TE>

<HD>Regulators May Refuse EchoStar Next Week</HD>
<DH>TV: Sources say majority of FCC commissioners oppose
DirecTV merger. Acquirer is still hopeful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission is preparing to reject EchoStar
Communications Corp.'s proposed $15-billion purchase of satellite
rival DirecTV and its parent, Hughes Electronics Corp., perhaps as
early as next week, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Although a formal FCC vote has not occurred, a majority of
commissioners, including Chairman Michael K. Powell, have decided
that the deal is not in the public interest, sources said. Last week,
the FCC staff, led by Media Bureau Chief W. Kenneth Ferree,
recommended that the deal be rejected.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed merger, which would combine the No. 1 and No. 2
satellite television providers, was widely viewed as a longshot from
the start. In recent weeks, numerous reports have surfaced that the
FCC's staff was balking.</LD>
<TE>   The same signals have come from the Justice Department. The agency
is preparing to sue to block the deal that would give the combined
company 18 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles A. James, who announced this week
that he planned to resign in December, is expected to make a final
decision by month's end.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition by the FCC or the Justice Department would make the
chances of a EchoStar-DirecTV merger remote, at best. The company's
only recourse would be to file suit against the government, a rare
move.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar has argued to regulators that it and DirecTV were not
competitors because few customers drop one satellite service and buy
the other.</TE>
<TE>   They said the merger would enable the combined company to become a
stronger rival to local cable operators by allowing it to combine
satellite slots and offer more channels and services.</TE>
<TE>   But FCC commissioners have concluded that the anti-competitive
effects--including a reduction in consumer choice--outweigh the
potential benefits.</TE>
<TE>   An EchoStar spokesman said Friday that the firm remains hopeful
that the deal will be approved.</TE>
<TE>   . "We believe the merger offers numerous benefits for consumers
and should be approved based on its merits," EchoStar spokesman Marc
Lumpkin said.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares fell 5 cents to $16.95 on Nasdaq. Hughes' shares
fell 41 cents to $8.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Gas Ruling Clouded by Safety Issues</HD>
<DH>Energy: Federal officials question a judge's finding that
El Paso Corp. should have run its pipeline at full bore to supply
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal safety officials are raising doubts about a judge's ruling
that El Paso Corp. should have run its natural gas pipeline at peak
pressure during the California energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The questions--echoed by industry safety experts--could bolster
the Houston energy company's claim that it did not illegally squeeze
gas supplies to drive up prices in California.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Administrative Law Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that El Paso's failure to
operate at "maximum allowable operating pressure" was key evidence of
a scheme to manipulate the California energy market.</LD>
<TE>   Wagner's decision was hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to hold
industry players accountable for damages to California consumers. But
the reaction from safety experts suggests that Wagner's ruling may be
vulnerable when the full FERC board considers El Paso's appeal. The
board can overrule the judge.</TE>
<TE>   James Mitchell, a pipeline safety spokesman for the U.S.
Transportation Department, said the judge's position had raised
concerns among safety regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "We never require people to operate at maximum allowable operating
pressure," Mitchell explained. "You wouldn't find pipelines
constantly operating at [maximum], because they would be going above
it frequently....We fine companies that exceed" that mark.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum allowable pressure of a pipeline is a safety limit
intended to prevent leaks and explosions, Mitchell said. It is
separately calculated for different pipeline segments, following a
formula found in federal regulations.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso has maintained that safety was a key factor in its
decision not to run the pipeline at full bore. In August 2000, one of
its pipelines ruptured at a campground near Carlsbad, N.M.,
triggering an explosion that killed 12 people. As a result, the
company was ordered by the Transportation Department to reduce
pressure on part of its system.</TE>
<TE>   Decreasing the pressure diminishes the amount of gas that can be
pushed through the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of America warned the
FERC board that Wagner's decision was "not in accordance with prudent
pipeline practices or applicable safety requirements."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Chairman William A. Wise made much the same point in a
Sept. 26 letter to Congress in which he complained that Wagner's
ruling "converts a safety-driven 'maximum allowable operating
pressure' into a market-driven 'maximum required operating pressure.'
"</TE>
<TE>   "If allowed to stand, this decision would place pipeline operators
in a Catch-22 situation," Wise said. "Pipelines would be forced to
operate at [maximum] on a sustained basis despite their best judgment
regarding safety, reliability and operational requirements, or they
would risk being in violation of the standard created" by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, the Transportation Department spokesman, said his agency
concurred: "We would say that the letter raises valid concerns about
applying these criteria outside of the safety area."</TE>
<TE>   The department's Office of Pipeline Safety is not a party to the
California price-gouging case.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's failure to operate at maximum pressure accounts for
about 60% of the 345 million cubic feet of natural gas a day that
Judge Wagner identified as having been clearly withheld by the
company. The entire amount is enough to serve about 1.5 million
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "This failure to operate at or near [maximum pressure] constitutes
a clear withholding of available capacity by El Paso pipeline, and is
a clear violation of its duty," Wagner wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Collins, an El Paso lawyer, called Wagner's reasoning
"flat-out wrong."</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Lipson, a lawyer representing plaintiffs against El
Paso, said Wagner made the right call: "For El Paso to attempt to
imply that the [plaintiffs] are somehow suggesting conduct
inconsistent with safety is wrong, is unsupported by the evidence and
is an attempt to shift the target."</TE>
<TE>   Lipson said none of the four key compressors on El Paso's system
reached maximum pressure on even a single day from November 2000
through March 2001. In fact, he said, they ran 4% to 14% below the
maximum.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no legitimate safety issues that are a defense to their
failure to operate at or reasonably close to the maximum," said
Lipson, who represents Southern California Edison, the utility arm of
Edison International of Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   When El Paso was forced to reduce pressure after the New Mexico
explosion, the company assured the government that the measure would
not curtail supplies to California, said Mitchell of the
Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   But an El Paso spokeswoman said that when demand for gas rose
during the winter heating season, the safety mandate reduced El
Paso's capability to meet the market's needs.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff attorney Lipson countered that the effects of the safety
order alone cannot explain the shortfall in supply.</TE>
<TE>   If the FERC board ultimately finds that El Paso manipulated the
California market, the company could be ordered to return profit to
the state's utilities. Natural gas is the main fuel for generating
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   The case arose from a complaint filed by the California Public
Utilities Commission. The PUC alleges that two units of El Paso
colluded to restrict supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Morris, a PUC staff attorney, called the safety concerns a
red herring.</TE>
<TE>   "The witnesses all took into account the safety and integrity of
the system," he said, "and Judge Wagner still found that El Paso
withheld capacity from the market."</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Falls, but So Do Payrolls</HD>
<DH>Employment: Faced with confusing data, analysts are
uncertain which way the economy is headed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American employers cut payrolls for the first time in five months,
but the nation's jobless rate still fell to 5.6% in September, the
Labor Department reported Friday. The report left analysts puzzled
over which way the economy is headed.</LD>
<LD>   Some economists said that the tenth-of-a-point drop from August,
together with an upward revision of August's job gains from 39,000 to
107,000, showed an economy on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   But others said the loss of 43,000 jobs last month and an increase
in the number of long-term unemployed, meaning those out of work for
six months or more, suggest that growth is faltering.</LD>
<TE>   "The labor market is in a holding pattern; the economy is moving
sideways," said Princeton University economist Alan B. Krueger.</TE>
<TE>   The muddled picture is likely to have some immediate effects. What
strength there was in the new numbers could convince the Federal
Reserve that there is no immediate need to cut interest rates
further. And it complicates efforts of congressional Democrats to
extend a program due to expire Dec. 28 that gives the jobless 13
weeks of extra unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The new numbers appeared to baffle investors, who initially took
them as good news and drove stock prices higher, then lost heart and
sent prices back down again. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
188.79 points, or 2.5%, to close at 7,528.40, its lowest close in
almost five years. Other major market indexes posted similar
declines.</TE>
<TE>   The most widely watched numbers in the jobs report appeared to
barely budge in September. The number of unemployed workers slipped
slightly from 8.14 million in August to 8.09 million last month. The
unemployment rate for blacks remained unchanged at 9.6%. The rate for
Latinos slipped a tenth of a point to 7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   But a variety of analysts saw signs of weakness behind the new
numbers and warned that the economy may be headed for another
"jobless" recovery like that of the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Even President Bush appeared worried. In Boston for a GOP
fund-raiser, the president said, "The unemployment rate dropped,
which was good news. But that's not good enough. There are still too
many people who wonder whether or not they're going to be able to
find employment."</TE>
<TE>   Though not particularly large, the loss of 43,000 jobs in
September snapped a four-month streak of job growth and included
steep new declines in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. factories cut payrolls by 63,000 in August and an additional
35,000 last month. The declines stretched job losses in the
manufacturing sector into a third year and boosted the loss total to
1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines cut 12,000 workers last month. Retailers, who were
thought to have been profiting from consumers' willingness to keep
buying, reduced payrolls by 16,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the few industries to add workers in September were health
care (21,000) and, because of the refinancing boom, mortgage banking
(9,000). The federal government added 11,000, most of them airport
security guards.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, private employment has shrunk by 200,000 since December,
when most analysts think the economy emerged from recession,
according to Labor Department statistics.</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, the average workweek for production and
nonsupervisory employees, who make up almost 80% of the nation's
labor force, rose two-tenths of an hour, and average hourly wages
climbed 5 cents to $14.87. But during the last year, hourly wages
have grown only 3%, their slowest annual pace since early 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were troubled by an increase from 16.2 weeks to 17.8
weeks in the average length of time unemployed workers are out of a
job, and by a jump from 18.2% to 19% in the percentage of the jobless
who are out of work for six months or more.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists had expected the September unemployment rate to
rise to 5.9% or 6%, rather than fall. They were taken by surprise by
the 5.6% rate announced by the Labor Department.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts labeled the decline a fluke and evidence of a
serious problem in the way the nation keeps tabs on its labor
markets. The Labor Department relies on two surveys--one of
households and the other of employers--that often produce drastically
different results.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, for example, the household survey showed that the
economy had added 711,000 jobs, while the more reliable employer
survey showed it had lost 43,000.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers don't tell a coherent story," said William Cheney,
chief economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston.</TE>

<HD>Koll to Close California Headquarters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Koll Development Co. said Friday that it would close two of its
California offices, including its longtime headquarters in Newport
Beach, as part of a reorganization that began last year after the
departure of company founder Don Koll.</LD>
<LD>   The shake-up comes as Koll and other real estate firms cut staffs
and costs to deal with a prolonged slump in real estate leasing and
development activity in California and the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Koll has cut its staff by about 40% since last year as the company
shifts from risky, speculative development to focus on more
conservative projects built and paid for by specific clients.</LD>
<TE>   "Even though the pipeline of prospects and deals is relatively
strong ... everybody is delaying new capital expenditures on new
facilities," said Koll Development President and Chief Executive
Steven Van Amburgh, who took control of the company after Koll
stepped down last year. Koll, who founded the company about 40 years
ago, owns a small stake in Koll Development but is no longer involved
in its management, Van Amburgh said.</TE>
<TE>   The overhaul of the company's California operation includes the
closure of the company's San Diego office by year-end and the
eventual transfer of the remaining corporate staff in Newport Beach
to Dallas, where Van Amburgh and other top officers are based. The
Southern California operations will be consolidated in a newly
constructed Koll office building in Irvine. The firm also will
continue to operate a Northern California office in Danville.</TE>
<TE>   Van Amburgh said the changes would result in layoffs that would
reduce the number of California employees to 15 from 25.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Parker, 38, a partner in the firm's Northern California
office, has been promoted to head the company's Western division.</TE>
<TE>   Although Koll has long been associated with commercial development
in Orange County and California, about half of its development
activity is outside the state.</TE>
<TE>   The company's smaller California operation now will be organized
to help clients based in the state build or expand facilities
wherever they are needed, Parker said. The company has not completely
ruled out speculative development--which involves constructing
buildings before they are leased--in California and elsewhere. But
for now there is little demand for additional office or industrial
space in most cities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a while before you will see us build an eight-story
office building on spec," Parker said.</TE>

<LD>Architecture firm Perkins &amp; Will will close its Santa Monica and
Pasadena offices and consolidate on three floors of a renovated
downtown Los Angeles office building.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based firm has leased 34,000 square feet at 617 W. 7th
St., a 74-year-old high-rise that was refurbished in 2001 in the hope
of luring dot-com tenants.</LD>
<LD>   The collapse of the Internet bubble drastically reduced the number
of high-tech firms looking for office space and the building at the
northeast corner of 7th and Hope streets has been mostly unoccupied
for the last few years.</LD>
<TE>   Perkins &amp; Will is expected to move in by the end of the year,
according to real estate brokers at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The
brokerage represented the tenant and landlord Hiro Real Estate Co.
Terms of the 10-year lease were not disclosed, but the value would
exceed $7 million based on asking rates at the building.</TE>
<TE>   Wirt Design Group Inc., an interior design firm formerly based in
Pasadena, recently took 5,000 square feet on the building's third
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain rents and the prospects of an urban revival have prompted
several architecture and design firms to move downtown over the last
two years.</TE>

<HD>Dow Falls to Near 5-Year Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks swooned again Friday, dragging the Dow industrials to their
lowest point in almost five years as another round of bad news about
corporate profits rattled investors.</LD>
<LD>   "People are scared to buy stocks," said Anthony Iuliano, head
equity trader for Glenmede Trust Co., as the Dow and other major
market barometers notched their sixth straight week of losses.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks have been hammered in recent weeks amid a steady stream of
downbeat earnings reports, and Friday was no exception. A mixed
reading on the job market in September, the continuing West Coast
port shutdown, fears of a war with Iraq and a $28-billion judgment in
a California tobacco lawsuit against Dow member Philip Morris added
to market jitters.</LD>
<TE>   "It's tough to find stock that you really want to buy in this type
of environment," said Dan McMahon, head of listed trading at CIBC
World Markets Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials lost 188.79 points, or 2.5%, to 7,528.40, its
lowest close since November 1997. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index fell 18.37 points, or 2.2%, to 800.58, barely 2 points above
the five-year low it reached in July.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index lost 25.66 points, or 2.2%, to
1,139.90, sinking to its lowest level since September 1996. The
technology-focused index is off 41.6% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Losers trounced winners by 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange
and more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow lost more than 2%, the S&amp;P 500 fell more
than 3%, and Nasdaq surrendered almost 5%. The S&amp;P 500 last fell six
weeks in a row in February and March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The market opened higher after the government said the U.S.
jobless rate fell to 5.6% in September, from 5.7% in August. But
there were trouble spots in the report, traders said. Payrolls fell
for the first time in five months, showing the uneven pace of the
U.S. economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The early gains quickly evaporated, and the market headed lower as
Wall Street grappled with disappointing earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   Dow member Boeing lost $2.30 to $32.01, after the world's largest
commercial jet maker said the shrinking value of jets it finances
would cut quarterly net earnings.</TE>
<TE>   EMC tumbled $1.18, or 23.6%, to $3.83 and ranked as the most
active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The data storage company
reported a preliminary quarterly loss and revenue that were worse
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough fell 34 cents to $17.30, adding to days of steep
declines. The drug company warned that its earnings in 2003 and 2004
would be far below forecasts as the firm loses patent protection on
top allergy drug Claritin.</TE>
<TE>   And two more banks--Hibernia and Northern Trust--cut their
third-quarter profit forecasts, pressuring already depressed
financial stocks. Hibernia lost $1.02 to $17.75 and Northern Trust
fell $1.93 to $31.81. All 52 members of Bloomberg's index of bank
stocks fell as the index slid 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "Each new day brings a new list of companies that warn us that
Wall Street is too optimistic about third-quarter earnings," said
Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist with First Albany Corp. in New
York. "Earnings for the third quarter are not going to be anywhere
near as rosy as we thought."</TE>
<TE>   The mood wasn't helped by the verdict against Philip Morris, which
fell $2.91 to $36.59. A jury in Los Angeles ordered the world's
largest cigarette maker to pay $28 billion in damages to a woman with
lung cancer. The Amex index of nine tobacco stocks fell 5.6%.</TE>

<LD>   Schering-Plough Corp. cut profit estimates, saying wholesalers are
slashing orders for its top-selling allergy treatment Claritin so
they can unload supplies before cheaper versions are introduced.</LD>
<TE>   The drug maker's shares fell for a sixth day, extending a 28% drop
since it lost a court bid in August to stop generic competitors for
Claritin. The pill, which had sales of $3.16 billion last year, may
face cheaper rivals in December.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit declined to between 28 cents and 29 cents a
share from 41 cents in the year-earlier period, Schering-Plough said.
Analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents. The company forecast
profit of $1 to $1.15 a share for next year, compared with estimates
of $1.42.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough fell 34 cents to $17.30 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt damaged
the agency's credibility by meeting with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
chairmen as the investment bank faces three SEC probes, two
Democratic representatives said.</LD>
<TE>   John Dingell of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the House
Commerce Committee, and committee member Edward Markey of
Massachusetts said in a letter to Pitt that he "apparently departed"
from a promise he made in May not to meet with executives from
companies under SEC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Such meetings damage the morale of commission staff at a time
when the commission is faced with a dramatically increased workload
that is stretching its resources to the limit," Dingell and Markey
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said he is continuing to follow his pledge "to avoid even the
appearance of impropriety in instances where such meetings could be
misconstrued."</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge denied an injunction in a patent lawsuit that
could have barred the sale of rock group Bon Jovi's new CD, "Bounce,"
clearing the way for the widely anticipated album's release Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, made by Judge Charles Haight of U.S. District Court in
New York, benefits Bon Jovi's backers at Vivendi Universal's
Universal Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction concerned a plan designed to entice consumers to
buy the CD versus downloading illegal digital copies. Record
companies are battling slumping CD sales that industry watchers link
to free digital music on the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Haight ruled that plaintiff DownloadCard Inc. failed to show a
likelihood of success if the "Bounce" release was pushed back.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based technology firm alleged that Universal used its
technology on the CD, which offers extra content to registered users.</TE>

<LD>   P&amp;O Princess Cruises said Carnival Corp.'s hostile $4.1-billion
bid is now more attractive than a proposed merger with Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd. after both transactions were cleared earlier
in the day by U.S. antitrust enforcers.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement came after the Federal Trade Commission said it
had cleared both proposed combinations on a 3-2 vote. Either deal
would combine two of the world's top three cruise lines. Carnival is
the largest operator in the U.S. and Europe, and Royal Caribbean is
No. 2 in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Princess agreed to combine with Royal Caribbean in November,
offering to pay $7.4 billion for the Miami-based cruise line.
Carnival, also based in Miami, made a hostile offer for Princess in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival dropped 45 cents to $23.68, Royal Caribbean fell 18 cents
to $15.87 and Princess slipped 76 cents to $27.09,all on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   Taxpayers who participate in certain tax shelters are getting a
limited chance to settle with the government and avoid long, costly
legal battles, the Internal Revenue Service said.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of corporations, partnerships and wealthy individuals
involved in three shelters cited by the IRS still would owe taxes,
interest and possibly penalties even if they settled.</TE>
<TE>   The three shelter schemes are all highly complex, as reflected in
their names: corporate-owned life insurance, contingent liability
transactions and basis-shifting transactions. These were identified
this year as potentially shady deals through IRS audits and an
initiative seeking disclosure of shelters.</TE>

<LD>   The Navy has instructed Pentagon bookkeepers to begin withholding
$2.3 billion from Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. in connection
with an 11-year legal battle over the canceled A-12 fighter-bomber.</LD>
<TE>   The Defense Finance and Accounting Service was told in a letter to
take "action as is appropriate." It was not known when the
collections would begin or how many contracts were affected. The
collection effort would last at least 18 months, an earlier
correspondence said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon demands that Boeing and General Dynamics repay $1.3
billion in progress payments plus $1 billion in interest from the
A-12 aircraft program that was canceled in 1991. General Dynamics and
McDonnell Douglas Corp., later bought by Boeing, sued. A federal
court ruled against the companies in August 2001.</TE>

<HD>Office Vacancy Rate in S.F. Dips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>This city's office vacancy rate fell for the first time in two years
in the third quarter as rents dropped far enough to lure law firms
and insurance companies to rent more space.</LD>
<LD>   With such tenants as Clifford Chance and Zurich Insurance signing
leases, the vacancy rate fell to 21.5% from 21.7% in the second
quarter. The average annual rent fell to $29.40 a square foot from a
peak of $65.88 in 2000, according to property broker Cushman &amp;
Wakefield.</LD>
<LD>   "For us, it's been very busy," said Allen Palmer, senior vice
president of leasing for Boston Properties Inc.'s Embarcadero Center,
known as the Rockefeller Center of the West. "Tenants have looked to
upgrade their offices. There's a lot of musical chairs in the city.
We're seeing tenants who want to move to less expensive space."</LD>
<TE>   The leasing may be an early sign of a rebound for San Francisco
commercial property, after the Internet industry collapse sent
vacancies in the financial district to an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen some decent demand," said Colin Yasukochi, research
director at broker Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. "It doesn't mean the market's
going to turn around quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The vacancy rate may climb before it falls again, as 1 million
square feet of new space is completed in the next few months,
including two buildings at Foundry Square; the Ferry Building, which
is being remodeled by Wilson/Cornerstone; and a building at Catellus
Development Corp.'s Mission Bay project that was once intended as
headquarters for Gap Inc.</TE>
<TE>   For the vacancy rate to fall below 10%, indicating a market in
equilibrium, about 8.5 million square feet has to be leased. That
would require San Francisco to add 30,000 jobs, which may take six
years, according to Cushman. In the last real estate slump, it took
almost four years for rents to recover to the 1991 level.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the Internet collapse continued to ripple from the
converted warehouses once leased by dot-com start-ups in the
neighborhood south of Market Street to the financial district. The
third-quarter vacancy rate of 22% for "Class A" space in the
financial district is the highest ever, said a report by broker
Julien J. Studley Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the dot-com fallout go through south of Market. It's
hitting the firms that were living off the tech-Internet
industry--law firms, insurance and finance," said Michael Pitre, a
managing director at Studley.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Chance paid about $34 a square foot to lease 79,000
square feet at Equity Office Property Trust's One Market Plaza.
Commerce One Inc. and law firms Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati
and Brobeck Phleger and Harrison paid about $100 a square foot two
years ago in the same building.</TE>
<TE>   Only top-tier space in the financial district commands more than
$30 a square foot, while asking rents in most other areas are in the
"very low $20s," Studley's report said.</TE>

<HD>Venture Funds Opened to Rare Public Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Finance: University endowment releases results of more than
100 of its investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Managers of the University of Texas' endowment bowed to political
pressure Friday and revealed how more than 100 of their private
investments are faring in the bear market, offering a rare glimpse
inside the clubby world of venture capital.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure--which included results for some of California's
brand-name venture capitalists in Silicon Valley--underscored that
even some of the savviest private investors haven't fared much better
of late than those making bets in the public securities markets.</LD>
<LD>   One of the university's endowment funds lost 17.2% in private
equity for the year ended Aug. 31, and another lost 15.4%, according
to the figures released. By comparison, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index lost 18% during the same timeframe.</LD>
<TE>   "All the [venture firm] partners I've talked to are, almost
without exception, not happy" with the fact that the figures are
being released, said Bob Boldt, chief executive of the $13-billion
University of Texas Investment Management Co., or UTIMCO. "Some of
these returns, especially for young venture partnerships, look very
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Venture capital firms generally invest $1 million or more in
privately held companies, many of them high-tech start-ups. Their
money comes from university endowments, pension funds and other large
institutional investors, as well as very wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Venture firms routinely give their well-heeled investors reports
on how their funds are faring, but most require them to keep the
results confidential.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
or CalPERS, posted its venture fund results. But the venture capital
firms complained, and CalPERS stopped the practice a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   UTIMCO managers had feared that venture capitalists would sue to
prevent the latest disclosures because the reported results could
damage their reputations. Some threatened, but none sued within a
10-day window established by the attorney general of Texas, who
ordered the data released.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that venture capitalists haven't been doing well
lately. Nationwide, the total loss for venture firms was 24% for the
year ended March 31, according to the Venture Capital Assn. and
Thomson Venture Economics.</TE>
<TE>   But what was striking in the UTIMCO disclosure was that even
certain blue-name venture firms have been struggling mightily,
suggesting that the performance of any one fund seems more dependent
on the year it was launched than on who is managing it.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a $10-million investment in 1995 with Information
Technology Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif., so far has returned more
than $54 million. But a $25-million investment with the same firm in
1998 is worth only $26.6 million as of now.UTIMCO says its 1997
investment with Crescendo Ventures of Minneapolis has yielded a 25%
gain. But its 1999 investment with the same firm has produced a 25%
loss. And there's a 45% loss on its 2000 investment.</TE>
<TE>   Boldt emphasized that it is difficult to predict the overall
performance of multiyear funds based on data from the first year or
two, before portfolio companies have had a chance to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Of UTIMCO's active investments, the firm with the best results to
date was Information Technology Ventures, whose two funds have posted
a 57% gain.</TE>
<TE>   The runner-up was Austin Ventures, with a 46% return from funds
dating to 1995. At the bottom of the list was Advanced Technology
Ventures of Massachusetts, down 33% since 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Among California venture funds, UTIMCO reported that a 2001
investment in Foundation Capital has lost 28% of its value, and its
2000 investment in a Band of Angels fund is off 23%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lackluster performance of certain private funds, Boldt
defended UTIMCO's investment strategy. Since UTIMCO began investing
in private funds in 1990, he said, the program has returned $400
million more than it would have earned through more conventional
investments.</TE>
<TE>   One notable UTIMCO investment was the $7.3 million it put into a
fund run by defense industry investor Carlyle Group in 2000. Carlyle
employs former President Bush. Boldt said he has seen no evidence of
political interference with the endowment.</TE>

<HD>Music Firms, ISPs Battle Over Identity of Sharers</HD>
<DH>Net: Verizon fights order seeking name of a customer
suspected of storing pirated songs on a PC. A judge is considering
the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a strategic shift, the major record labels want to expand their
fight against online piracy by going after people who use
file-sharing networks to copy songs for free. The problem is, they
don't know who those people are.</LD>
<LD>   And Internet service providers, which do know, don't want to tell.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge in Washington on Friday began deliberating how
hard it will be for the labels to ferret out the identity of Internet
users accused of violating copyrights. At issue is whether the labels
can use a federal court subpoena to force Internet providers to name
a file-sharing customer, or whether they must sue suspected
infringers individually to get that information.</LD>
<TE>   The case initially pit the labels' trade association, the
Recording Industry Assn. of America, against a single Internet
service provider, Verizon Internet Services Inc. Reflecting the
potential effect on the entire entertainment industry and Internet
users at large, though, the Hollywood studios and music publishers
have intervened on the RIAA's behalf, while numerous Internet service
providers, consumer advocates and civil liberties groups have sided
with Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge John D. Bates gave no indication Friday how he
might rule. The judge sharply questioned both sides and decried
ambiguities in the 1998 law that created the subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   Congress "could have made this statute clearer," Bates said,
referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon and its allies acknowledge that they have to disclose the
identity of customers who store pirated material on an Internet
service provider's network. They're fighting the latest RIAA
subpoena, however, because the allegedly pirated songs are on the
customer's personal computer.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute comes as the record companies are opening a new
chapter in their battle against piracy. Despite several important
legal victories against file-sharing companies, consumers are still
making unauthorized copies of millions of songs, movies, games and
other copyrighted works every day through file-sharing networks.</TE>
<TE>   So in addition to suing the networks, the labels are mounting a
high-profile campaign to educate consumers about the law and
threatening to take direct action against the most active file
sharers.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the labels want to target users who offer extensive
collections of digital music for others to copy.</TE>
<TE>   By drying up the source of music on a file-sharing network, the
labels may encourage users to shift to authorized online music
services--or simply move them to another file-sharing outpost.</TE>
<TE>   The current case arose after an RIAA anti-piracy investigator
found a user of the Kazaa file-sharing network who was offering more
than 600 songs for copying, covering a gamut of styles and artists,
including Nelly Furtado, the late Aaliyah, the Who and the
Association. On July 24, the RIAA delivered a subpoena to Verizon,
which was providing the user's high-speed Internet service somewhere
in the Pittsburgh area.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon refused to comply, prompting the RIAA to sue to enforce
the subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that seems to make a difference to file sharing is
when people know it's illegal," said RIAA President Cary Sherman on
Thursday, citing surveys conducted by the labels. "We have no way to
notify the [Internet provider's] subscriber that what he or she is
doing is illegal.... We have to get the information from them to know
who to notify."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, copyright holders who
find evidence of infringement online can obtain a subpoena compelling
the Internet provider to identify the customer in question. To obtain
a subpoena, the copyright holder must submit a sworn statement
identifying the disputed files and expressing a "good-faith belief"
that their copyrights were infringed.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon and its allies argue that this provision applies only when
the disputed files are on the Internet provider's network--for
example, when they're on a Web site operated by the Internet provider
on a customer's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   When the infringing files are housed on the users' computers,
copyright holders need to file a "John Doe" lawsuit against the
alleged infringer before issuing a subpoena, they contend. Once a
lawsuit is filed, they say, the alleged infringer would receive
notice and be able to challenge any attempt to disclose his or her
identity.</TE>
<TE>   "Verizon was a passive conduit at most" in the transfer of
copyrighted songs, Verizon's lead lawyer, Eric H. Holder Jr., told
the judge. "We also don't want to be the policeman in this process,"
said Holder, a former deputy attorney general in the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA argues that the 1998 law provides for subpoenas
regardless of where the disputed works are stored. In fact, RIAA
officials say, Internet providers have complied with several previous
subpoenas to identify people offering songs stored on their own
computers.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, RIAA attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said the 1998
law shielded Internet providers from copyright liability in exchange
for their assisting in enforcement efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "They want the benefits ... without the responsibilities,"
Verrilli said.</TE>
<TE>   The main fear among Internet providers is that copyright holders
will use automated anti-piracy tools to flood them with thousands of
requests to identify file sharers. "That is not something we could
comply with," Dave Baker, vice president of law and public policy for
EarthLink Inc., said at a news conference this week.</TE>
<TE>   Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, are concerned about the
implications for free speech and the public's ability to communicate
anonymously.</TE>
<TE>   The copyright act's subpoena provision forces Internet providers
to reveal the identity of customers accused of copyright infringement
without letting them challenge the evidence or defend their behavior,
said Megan Gray, an attorney for the groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in this country is a copyright holder, so that's giving
anybody that may have a beef the right to go and unmask a critic, a
target of their affection ... [or] unmask a whistle-blower," Gray
said. "It really could expand to any number of users."</TE>
<TE>   Healey reported from Los Angeles and Shiver from Washington.</TE>

<HD>Real Barbershops Are Less Cutting</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversy over a character's dismissive remarks about civil
rights leaders helped push the critically acclaimed movie
"Barbershop" to No. 1 in the national rankings. Is the movie close to
real life in a modern barbershop? MARY REESE BOYKIN spoke with two
veteran L.A. barbers about day-to-day life in the black barbershop.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>

<TE>   Barber, New Millennium,</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw District</TE>
<TE>   A barber is an artist, creating styles in hair like a fashion
designer does in clothing. The barber must take into consideration
the shape of the client's head, his physique, his facial structure.</TE>
<TE>   I started cutting hair when I was in high school. When I joined
the Marine Corps in 1982, there were lots of inspections. Some of the
guys felt that I did a better job than the barbers.</TE>
<TE>   Every man likes to look neat. The neatness starts with a
good-looking haircut and a well-kept mustache.</TE>
<TE>   In our shop, every barber has a technique. If a client likes
another barber's style, that barber does his hair, and there are no
hard feelings.</TE>
<TE>   I feel that the barber can be a father figure or a role model,
both in his looks and in his character. With my young customers--and
most of my clients are teens--I build their self-esteem. I tell them
not to texturize their hair. I want them to love themselves as they
are.</TE>
<TE>   Being a barber gives me an opportunity to instill knowledge,
inspire and encourage young men to stay focused.</TE>
<TE>   I get to meet such a wide range of people. I prefer this job to an
office job, and a barber is never forgotten. The barber creates good
friendships with lots of trust, especially given the fact that there
is razor shaving. In the shop, we discuss politics, religion, sex,
race, sports, body building, music. To our clients, we become a
teacher, a psychiatrist, a dermatologist. We have to have street
sense, too.</TE>
<TE>   We barbers have other interests also. During our downtime in this
shop, you may find one barber reading a book, another writing a short
story and yet another writing his movie script.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dyane Ibrahim</TE>
<TE>   Barber/Owner</TE>
<TE>   Chiefs Economy Barber Shop</TE>
<TE>   For 50 years, my dad owned a chain of barbershops, though the shop
was never my hangout. The shops were family-oriented, places where
there was no cursing, drinking or gambling--when he opened his first
shop in 1946, some barbershops were bookie joints. I have felt true
to his values. Parents can drop off their children and not worry
about them.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, I worked in corporate America, but as my company
downsized, my father encouraged me to learn the profession and take
over the Leimert Park shop, the only one of his shops that he kept
after his illness. By then a single mother, I found many advantages
in being a barber, especially the flexibility to participate in my
children's school activities.</TE>
<TE>   As a female barber, I made the decision to be reserved, not to
participate in certain conversations.</TE>
<TE>   In this public forum of men's voices, I give them their privacy.
One day, a client talked openly about his prostate cancer. I remained
quiet. But because my father died of prostate cancer, when the barber
was done with the customer's hair, I spoke to the client outside. I
stressed that he cannot dismiss his illness, that with an early
diagnosis like his, the cancer is so treatable.</TE>
<TE>   When the conversation turns to politics or to a subject for which
women's agendas need defending, I speak up. There are other times
when a male customer may say, "I'm thinking about getting back with
my wife. Give me a woman's perspective."</TE>
<TE>   I enjoy being a barber. Every day is like a party with new guests.</TE>

<HD>Americans Have a Feel for Nuance on Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOVISA STANNOW</AU>
<BD>Lovisa Stannow of Los Angeles is writing a book about
American opinion regarding abortion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I became an American citizen recently. It wasn't a surge of post-9/11
patriotism that made me do it. No, I decided to become an American
despite many of this country's public policies and its political
grandstanding over the last year. I did it because I wanted to be an
ordinary American.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't start out like this. Arriving from Sweden about five
years ago, I carried with me the full laundry list of prejudices you
would expect from a liberal European. Unsophisticated, shallow,
self-congratulatory, loud, parochial--my preconceptions about
Americans were not flattering.</LD>
<LD>   I admit now, with some embarrassment, that they said more about me
than about Americans. The United States is a curious nation, an Alice
in Wonderland place where things aren't always what they seem to be.</LD>
<TE>   The abortion issue is a case in point, one that has influenced my
views on the U.S. in a significant and--no, it's not a typo--a
positive way.</TE>
<TE>   After spending the last few years working in the field of
reproductive rights, I found myself frustrated by the acrimony, lack
of nuance and sharp polarization of the public debate about abortion.
At least as it is portrayed in the mainstream media, an impenetrable
wall divides those who believe that access to safe abortion services
is a fundamental right and those who believe that abortion is murder.</TE>
<TE>   Is this really a fair reflection of how people in the U.S. feel
and what they think? To try to answer that question, I have spent the
last six months traveling, knocking on people's doors at random,
asking men and women to speak, on the record, about their views on
abortion. The conversations I have had--with white, black, Latino,
Asian American, young, old, male and female Americans--have been
remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Albee, an actor in Southbury, Conn., told me: "I don't like
the idea of an abortion, for my wife or any woman, but I think
everybody should have the choice." When he and his wife, Laura,
decided to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, he said, "a lot
of other people thought we were wrong. It was none of their business.
But they did have the right to say that. That's just the American
way."</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Norris, an accountant from Austin, Texas, said: "I had an
abortion when I was 16. Nobody knew but my boyfriend. It was pretty
horrible. Just everything about it was bad." Even so, she said, "I
still don't think abortion is wrong. It's a huge moral decision, but
it doesn't need to be legislated. I feel like there is not enough out
there in the ambiguous camp."</TE>
<TE>   The farmhand I met in Bakersfield, the physician in Manhattan,
N.Y., the homeless woman on skid row in Los Angeles, the homemaker in
Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., and the goat farmer in Liberty Hill, Texas--all of
these ordinary Americans were able to see and embrace the shades of
gray inherent in the abortion issue. They put the protagonists in the
public debate to shame.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not a Pollyanna. I spent years working in disaster and war
zones around the world when I was with Doctors Without Borders. I
simply believe that most people, if they are given a fair chance,
will resist black-and-white judgments about others. The tone of the
public debate on many issues, abortion among them, is not helping
Americans to be nuanced and thoughtful. All the more remarkable,
then, that they are just that. It's what makes me proud to be a new
American.</TE>

<LD>As long as someone is willing to buy it, someone will sell snake oil.
Americans in the 21st century shouldn't be laughing at the suckers of
a previous era who lined up behind patent-medicine hucksters'
horse-drawn wagons. We fall prey to our own brand of snake-oil
salesmen, particularly those who promise to help us lose weight
quickly.</LD>
<LD>   A Federal Trade Commission study released last month said that of
the 300 weight-loss ads it studied last year, more than half lacked
proof of their claim and were probably false.</LD>
<LD>   The ads' claims--"I lost 46 pounds in 30 days!"--or promises of
six-pack abs through electronic stimulation appeal more to wishful
thinking than to common sense or rational scrutiny.</LD>
<TE>   More than 60% of U.S. adults are overweight. That translated in
2000 to about $35 billion spent on products claiming to aid weight
loss.</TE>
<TE>   In extreme cases, supposedly miraculous cures can kill. And
advertising claims for such products grew more farfetched each year
from 1992 to 2001, the FTC concluded. The report added that these
misleading ads exacerbate this country's serious problem with
obesity, which is second only to smoking as a cause of preventable
deaths each year.</TE>
<TE>   The media could do a better job of exercising their right and
responsibility not to air or publish ads they deem deceiving.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the FTC that has the access to expertise and is backed by
the authority to enforce truth-in-advertising laws and to try to get
reimbursements for consumers duped by bogus claims.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers do indeed need to beware, and the best solution is for
people to educate themselves about such basic health matters as
exercise and nutrition, and then to squelch the little voice urging
them to believe something that seems too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, if the FTC became more aggressive in its
investigations and pushed harder for prosecutions, a lot of
unscrupulous sellers would also have reason to beware.</TE>

<LD>We're ashamed of our downtown. We have dozens of beautiful old
buildings, the kind that people die for in New York, and we treat
them like eyesores, as if we're waiting for them to fall down so we
can sweep the bricks away and build another parking garage. Those
buildings can be filled with people.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   That was building developer Tom Gilmore talking with Times staff
writer Robert A. Jones in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, a revival has begun on the north side of downtown Los
Angeles, roughly between Temple and 6th streets, inspired by the new
cathedral, Walt Disney Concert Hall and Gilmore's own redevelopment
of the city's Old Bank District.</TE>
<TE>   The bank district redevelopment was a good start, but only that.
Four months ago, the Los Angeles City Council approved a more
ambitious effort to breathe life into downtown's biggest swath of
blight: 879 bedraggled acres stretching from a parking lot near
Staples Center to downtown's crime-ridden skid row.</TE>
<TE>   The Community Redevelopment Agency's plan would save gracious old
buildings from rot and the bulldozer, mix market-rate and low-income
housing, and, if Gilmore is lucky, make him and other money men with
a stomach for risk a healthy profit. Cheers all around, right? Of
course not.</TE>
<TE>   Two lawsuits against the CRA, a city department, are imperiling
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Filed by Los Angeles County and the Coalition to End Hunger and
Homelessness, the lawsuits seek to up the ante on what the developers
and the city must pledge to get the project started.</TE>
<TE>   Stalemate is in nobody's best interest. If downtown redevelopment
stalls, there will be no new tax revenues for anyone. Mayor James K.
Hahn should help the CRA tighten its plan to ensure that the agency
fairly allocates future tax dollars to affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that 20% of property tax revenues generated by
the project go to affordable and assisted housing. The CRA says it is
willing to set aside 25% for affordable housing, but it has not
specified when and how it will begin meeting that obligation.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition should recognize that its key demand--that 50% of
new jobs created by redevelopment go to local residents--is wildly
unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Developers, like people in any business, don't work to lose money;
they are not the International Monetary Fund, able to bankroll big
solutions to social problems.</TE>
<TE>   The county's key argument--that 30 acres of the redevelopment area
near Staples Center are not "blighted" and therefore not under the
CRA's jurisdiction--is equally indefensible. The county may be
correct in the strictest legal sense because the area in question is
now a parking lot that generates about $7 million a year in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   However, the county needs to think bigger. Ultimately the
redevelopment--by creating more than 12,000 dwellings for rich and
poor, as well as millions of square feet of commercial, industrial
and entertainment space--would generate thousands of jobs and
revenues for the very social services it says the CRA plan would
threaten. Even the county has to acknowledge that a "24/7" downtown
holds a bigger payoff than a parking lot.</TE>

<LD>In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam there is an "official" history
in which the soldiers of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese armies
were all heroic, and every American they fought a contemptible
imperialist. Bureaucrats at the National Film Censorship Council
there read scripts in advance to gauge their historic legitimacy, and
when these critics give a movie a thumbs down, it's not about box
office--the film doesn't get made. Now two movies created in the
nation of contemptible imperialism have come back to haunt a
Vietnamese actor in his noble native land.</LD>
<LD>   In "We Were Soldiers," Don Duong portrays a courageous commander
in the Vietnamese army who fights equally courageous American
soldiers, including one played by Mel Gibson. In "Green Dragon,"
Duong is a Vietnamese man who, having left a refugee camp at Camp
Pendleton, returns to tell other refugees not to fear life in
America. Both films offend Vietnam's institutionalized political
correctness.</LD>
<LD>   Duong, who lives in Ho Chi Minh City, had traveled with relative
freedom before his government saw the movies and labeled him "an
instrument in the hands of forces hostile to the Vietnamese nation."
Now Vietnam has forbidden him to attend a film festival. It may bar
the "national traitor" from acting and forbid him to leave the
country for five years.</LD>
<TE>   Such attitudes toward artistic license are standard in
totalitarian states. Joseph Stalin worked hard to make sure people
saw only what was good for them. Cuba, China and any number of Arab
nations are similarly concerned about protecting people from
dangerous views of history and unsanctioned ideas.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, however, filmmakers remain free to make
movies no matter how loudly Al Sharpton carps about a character's
historical irreverence. And no one would dare suggest, even in
wartime, that certain views are unpatriotic and ought to be
suppressed. (Right?) That's why it's appropriate that the State
Department has joined Duong's relatives in the U.S. and a slew of
Hollywood types in asking Vietnam to stop persecuting the actor. It
should keep up the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam says it is ready to throw open its economy to global trade
and establish normal diplomatic relations with the world's
democracies. But the nation's fear of free expression tells a
different story--one that history will not view kindly, no matter how
many times it is officially sanitized.</TE>

<LD>Re "Baghdad's Boys Join Lord Haw Haw and Hanoi Jane," Commentary,
Oct. 1:</LD>
<LD>   Shame on you, George Will, for comparing Rep. Jim McDermott
(D-Wash.) to Lord Haw Haw and Jane Fonda. Rather than swallow the
stuff dished out by Washington spin doctors, McDermott and other
congressmen independently set out to seek the facts. It would not
hurt Will to follow their example. Sure, Saddam Hussein will try to
renege on his word, but there are ways to hold his feet to the fire.
And if those measures don't work, then we can still go to war. Mr.
Will, you may be the gullible one this time.</LD>

<TE>   All the political experts out there who are critical of President
Bush's approach to Iraq will learn that dealing from strength is a
good thing. The fact that he does not show Iraq weakness will
ultimately lead to his success in the matter. The Democrats on the
Hill only serve to make the matter worse, as they give Hussein the
thought that he will not have to pay for his indiscretions.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Sun Can't Set on This Empire Too Soon," Commentary, Oct.
1: Wasn't the fall of the Roman Empire followed by a more than
1,000-year power vacuum notable mainly for its misery and ignorance,
punctuated by countless wars between countless barbaric
governments--a period regularly referred to as the Dark Ages? Does
Robert Scheer wish upon us the Darkest Ages, notable for the rampages
of numerous pestilence-spewing villains akin to Hussein, where all
social order collapses in the wake of biological and nuclear attacks
by unknown and unknowable petty agents of chaos?</TE>
<TE>   Charles P. Watling</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bravo to Scheer for bringing up the R-word: Romans. As I recall,
the Roman Empire's demise was attributed to three major factors:
overexpansion based on military might; erosion of an already
inequitable tax system, placing more burden on the poor; and the
barbarians. Replace "barbarians" with "terrorists" and you have the
spitting image of the U.S. as we march into war under Emperor Bush
and his tax cut for the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Anthony Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times has shown a surprising sense of irony in placing
Scheer's and Will's columns next to each other. Scheer reaches new
levels of addressing America with a derisive, dismissive and
(continuing his D-grade writing) defeatist approach. Will, in
discussing the failings of three American congressmen in a factual,
straightforward manner, could have just as easily been addressing
Scheer when he concluded that for such liberals, "The world is too
good for the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck McVey</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer's and Will's commentaries each offer a perspective on
administration policy toward Iraq. Scheer offers verifiable facts and
historic records. Will offers name-calling and character
assassination. I find facts and records far more persuasive.</TE>

<LD>Re "Archdiocese Sets a Poor Example With Cutbacks," Voices, Sept. 28:
Perhaps it was an oversight, but Jeffrey Siker neglected to tell us
what percentage of his salary he has given to Catholic Charities over
the last few years so as to prevent any cutbacks in the programs that
Jesus--speaking in "a particularly haunting manner"--tells us to
support.</LD>
<LD>   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese can only give to the poor what we
Catholics give to the archdiocese for that purpose. We Catholics will
be happy to follow your example, professor. How much did you give? If
you personally gave to the extent that you say this goal deserves,
I'll listen to you.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremiah J. Flanigan</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In reference to Siker's article: The detention ministry is not
being eliminated. Rather, the paid staff has been cut in half, from
24 to 12. This is, of course, a very significant cutback because
there will only be half the former staff to supervise and assist the
1,400 volunteer ministers who actually do most of the visiting. With
this ratio of supervisors to volunteers, the volunteers will
obviously be very much on their own. However, the program continues,
even in reduced form.</TE>

Ken Bode for pointing out that CNN is the network the world turns to
to cover real news, especially foreign news. If Ted Turner does
return, he should fire all the yahoos who have tried to clone the Fox
News Channel. The direction that CNN has taken since the AOL merger
leaves this former CNN junkie desperately longing for the old CNN.
"Crossfire" (without Tucker Carlson) and "News- Night" are the only

<LD>As someone who lives and works along Wilshire Boulevard, I applaud
the MTA for reviving its subway proposal (Oct. 2). Extending the Red
Line down Wilshire Boulevard all the way to the ocean would include
such popular destinations as the Third Street Promenade in Santa
Monica, Brentwood, the Federal Building and VA Center, Westwood
Village and UCLA, the Century City Shopping Center, Rodeo Drive, the
Beverly Center, the Grove and Farmers Market, the L.A. County Museum
of Art and the La Brea Tar Pits (to say nothing of existing stations
at Hollywood Boulevard, Universal Studios and Union Station). It
would quickly become one of the most heavily used subway lines in the
world, popular with tourists and locals alike.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, if the North Hollywood subway were extended to the
Burbank Airport (and Metrolink), Westsiders, for the first time,
would have a real alternative to LAX. When people see how much more
easily and quickly they can get around town on the subway, they will
leave their cars behind.</LD>

<LD>Re "Germ of a Message Lies in Silence Over Stem Cells," Commentary,
Oct. 1: I have been a diabetic for 45 years, since the age of 2. You
would not be able to tell by looking at me. But there are millions of
other individuals with debilitating illnesses for whom daily living
is a question of survival. Religion has no place in the decision on
stem cell research. This is an issue of hope and life. President Bush
has eliminated the hope and issued a death sentence to those who
would benefit from stem cell research. If he is so concerned about
alienating the religious right, maybe he should stop to think: His
death sentence on stem cell research threatens more voters than there
are on the religious right. Think about it, Mr. President. We do
every day!</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading "College Lecturers Long for the Respect, Rewards of Tenure"
(Sept. 30), I find myself appalled at the apparent disdain our
institutions have for the practice of teaching. The "pipeline
problem" for teachers entering the profession referred to by Ronald
G. Ehrenberg doesn't begin to describe the problem. What about the
pipeline problem for educated students? What does it tell incoming
students when the senior faculty, whose names are used in the
school's literature (read "advertising"), are unavailable to all but
a chosen few and are replaced by persons for whom that same faculty
and its institution demonstrate no respect? And why would anyone who
has any expertise and experience other than university-based research
relinquish any claim to respect or collegiality "merely" to teach? It
is a shame that teaching institutions do not demonstrate profound
respect and gratitude for Drs. Jessica Revill and Rita Calvo and all
of their lecturer colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   If we are serious about creating an educated population and
attracting qualified, capable people who have a commitment to
teaching, we will have to move past the medieval hierarchies that
inform the university. If we are going to allow universities to
benefit from their increased integration with the commercial economy
(i.e., through profits from some of the products of their research),
don't we have a right to demand that they return some of the benefit
by contributing to the creation of a productive, educated population?
There are committed academics and institutions that take seriously
their role as leaders of 21st century thought. Isn't it time that we
demand no less of every institution that receives significant public
funding?</TE>

<TE>   I have taught as a lecturer in the UC system for 22 years. I do
not want the "respect, rewards of tenure." I want the respect that
the University of California, considered by many the greatest
publicly funded university in the world, should accord its teaching
faculty. Lecturers are the teachers of the UC system. However,
lecturers have less job security than K-12 teachers and make less
money, at the entry level and in terms of years of service, than
their colleagues at community colleges. The UC even refuses to commit
itself to a pay scale for lecturers based on years of service and
performance. Clearly the UC does not respect its teaching faculty
and, by extension, its state-mandated educational mission.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Tingle</TE>

<TE>   My greatest professional disappointment as a tenure-track academic
is the failure of my tenured and tenure-track colleagues to resist
and rethink the hierarchical structures that exist in institutions of
higher education in the U.S. It is alarming that administrators at
most universities across the country think of lecturers as "cheap
labor," but I am made much more distraught by my colleagues who often
collude with administrators when it comes to lecturers and who are
frequently responsible for creating and maintaining policies and
attitudes that treat lecturers as second-class citizens.</TE>
<TE>   That lecturers have to teach in conditions very different from
tenured and tenure-track faculty is a reality at most institutions.
When I taught as a lecturer at USC, I was not imagined as a scholar
or an intellectual colleague of the tenured and tenure-track faculty;
the only mandate made on me quite explicitly was to produce high
teaching-evaluation scores. USC spent enormous resources on creating
lavish spreads for visiting scholars but was unable to find resources
to pay for me to attend professional conferences and meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Such discriminatory practices are a sad commentary on all of us in
higher education and on our failure to imagine more egalitarian
structures that do not favor some at the expense of others. I call
upon all faculty who are committed to social justice to make
lecturers' issues and struggles our top priority and to do our part
in reshaping the stratification that currently exists in higher
education.</TE>

<TE>   I left a full-time, tenure-track position as assistant professor
of economics to become just a lecturer at Cal State San Marcos, and I
never had it so good. Since then, I have almost doubled my income
doing consulting and freelance writing. I don't mind at all the
mindless teaching of lower-division economics courses, which requires
little or no preparation. I do not have to attend the boring
committee, faculty or department meetings, nor do I have to advise
students. This way, I have extra time to publish interesting
journalistic articles rather than the obscure scholarly articles
necessary for tenure. Although I understand that many adjunct faculty
members do not have access to benefits, I happen to enjoy some
benefits at CSUSM. I do not in any way feel abused by the system;
rather, I consider myself lucky to be able to combine my love of
teaching with my desire to make more money.</TE>

<HD>Hip-Hop Can't Avoid History</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Boyd and his Sept. 30 commentary, "History, Hip-Hop Part Ways in
'Barbershop,' " may have provided a wake-up call for civil rights-era
folks like me. He tells us that the members of the younger generation
of African Americans not only prefer a different type of music from
that of their older siblings and parents but also avoid assimilation,
value entertainers such as Tupac Shakur over Martin Luther King Jr.
and are uninterested in politics.</LD>
<LD>   It's painful to come face to face with this lowering of values.
It's important for diverse people to keep working at understanding
one another and coming together to share ideas and friendship. We'll
never have a healthy society until it's common for people of all
backgrounds to mix.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps one of the influences of hip-hop is that African Americans
have given up on the rest of us; I hope not. There are many
non-African Americans who respect black people and want friendship
with them.</LD>
<TE>   I'm going to read Boyd's book, but I'm also going to hold out the
hope that as these young African Americans mature, their ideas will
evolve and they will realize the importance of black heroes, politics
and diversity.</TE>

<TE>   Boyd, though his heart seems to be in the right place, shows a
stereotypical view of what the so-called "hip-hop generation"
actually is. Mr. Boyd, this generation is not made up only of
inner-city youth who may put too much emphasis on the size of their
bankroll.</TE>
<TE>   I am a 29-year-old Latino college graduate. I too am part of the
hip-hop generation, as are many other intelligent, politically
inclined people who do not necessarily "have contempt for [political]
institutions." Contrary to what you say, I don't see Dr. King as
"simply another media image, not unlike Michael Jordan or Tiger
Woods." I don't know too many people who do, either. You
over-generalize when referring to my hip-hop generation. Do you
really believe my generation deems Tupac or Biggie more important
than King?</TE>
<TE>   It seems by Boyd's tone that he only associates the hip-hop
generation with the black population. The hip-hop generation consists
of all races and ages--I'd say, between 12 and 35. (LL Cool J has
been around since the 1980s.) The hip-hop generation, while
consisting of inner-city youth and, yes, some ignorant people, also
consists of doctors, lawyers, police officers and many other
contributing members of society.</TE>
<TE>   Why attribute comments in the movie "Barbershop" to the hip-hop
generation? The comments were made by a fictional character. The
movie is entertainment for entertainment's sake, just like hip-hop.
Rappers make music to make money. Don't take their lyrics so
seriously. What they rap about is not necessarily the way they
think--just ask Eminem.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Out of all the different ethnicities in the world, I would think
that African Americans would be the most likely to have a sense of
respect for their history and historic leaders. After all the hatred
and slavery they had to fight their way through to move up from being
three-fifths of a person to count as a whole person, I believe
leaders such as King and Malcolm X deserve more honor from their
people than they are getting. No one else is going to remember them
and what they did if even African Americans don't remember them.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how much fame or money you are going to receive from
making a movie, it is not worth putting down your historic leaders in
the process.</TE>
<TE>   There's a line that should not be crossed just to put a couple of
extra dollars in your pocket. Once you start forgetting and putting
down your own history, you are allowing others to do it also.</TE>

<LD>William Arkin's critique of how the Air Force is pushing its new
F/A-22 fighter as a homeland defense weapon missed the point
(Opinion, Sept. 29). Of course it wasn't designed to deal with
terrorist attacks--none of the military's weapons were--but it is
still uniquely well-suited to addressing some forms of unconventional
aggression. Its combination of range, speed and sensors makes it by
far the best way of coping with stealthy cruise missiles launched
from the sea against U.S. targets.</LD>
<LD>   It would be nice to live in a political system where policymakers
could grasp the long-term consequences of losing global air
superiority. That's the main mission the F/A-22 was conceived to
accomplish. Replacing the Air Force's 30-year-old fighters with the
F/A-22 may not eliminate domestic vulnerability, but it will reduce
it while effectively taking the fight to the enemy.</LD>

<TE>   Arkin made some interesting arguments in his objections to fully
funding the F/A-22 Raptor. However, he failed to mention how the
shrinking available funds should be spent.</TE>
<TE>   The facts of history have proved that the most important airplane
in our inventory is the aerial tanker. No other aircraft has given
our entire military such a quantum leap forward in its global
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The aerial tanker was first proposed by junior pilots to attack
Japan from Midway Island with single airplane nighttime bombing. The
myopic culture recently attributed to the CIA and the FBI for failing
to connect the dots prior to 9/11 was in full force in the military.
A screaming and kicking Air Force finally accepted the words of Gen.
Joseph T. McNarney that it was imperative that we obtain in-flight
refueling capability to begin the secret overflights of the Soviet
Union in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   It was once reported in the Air Force Assn. magazine that the only
American military capability ever envied by the former Soviet Union
was the seemingly easy way we aerially refueled at night and in all
kinds of weather our entire fleet of aircraft and helicopters. Today
this capability is under serious stress.</TE>
<TE>   The 5,000 women and men who maintain and fly our 600 aging tankers
are this nation's No. 1 military treasure. They rarely receive any
praise or recognition. It is imperative that their contributions be
recognized by providing adequate funding to replace their aging
equipment.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis Builds Big Lead in Race," Oct. 1: A novel idea: Instead of

<LD>   Libertarian candidate Gary David Copeland would be a great place

<TE>   I simply cannot understand why there should be a debate about

<TE>   After reading Tony Quinn's Sept. 29 Opinion piece, "In California,
Politicians Choose--and Voters Lose," I have come to realize I live
in a safely gerrymandered district in a safely Democratic state. But
as a political moderate, I see a dilemma. Either I join the
left-leaning party with all the real power or the vestigial and
practically irrelevant right. Either way, my views are unwelcome.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one way out. Everyone should become a registered
Democrat. That would eliminate the sham and cost of the general
election and give the banished middle a real voice. A one-party state
sounds scary, but isn't that what we have now?</TE>

<LD>Contrary to your Sept. 24 editorial, "Don't Derail Yosemite Plan,"
Supt. David Mihalic and I have never, as you put it, "crossed
swords." In fact, Mihalic and I have enjoyed a very amiable,
professional and cooperative working relationship.</LD>
<LD>   During his three-year tenure at Yosemite, Mihalic has done an
admirable job implementing the Yosemite Valley Plan you so
incorrectly report I intend to "derail." He is an unquestionable
asset to the National Park Service, and I have every confidence that
he will continue to do outstanding work at Great Smoky Mountains
National Park. Mihalic will leave Yosemite with my very best wishes.
As for my intentions vis-a-vis the valley plan, I will continue to
work on behalf of the taxpayer and visitor to ensure that an
appropriate balance is struck between preservation and access.</LD>

<LD>I was perplexed to read the Sept. 29 editorial, "Failing Magic at
Disney"--singling out the Walt Disney Co. and its CEO, Michael
Eisner, for criticism--because I know the many good things that
Disney has done for California. The Anaheim theme park has become one
of the great attractions in California; Disney has been one of the
few employers that has increased its employment over the last few
years; and Disney family and Disney Co. contributions made possible
Los Angeles' great new concert venue, the Walt Disney Concert Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, I wish California had more Disneys. They have been great
corporate citizens for Los Angeles and our state.</LD>

<HD>Traffic Jams Prompt Amber Alert Shut-Off in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Amber alert activated during the Amadeo Medina Jr. case snarled
Los Angeles County freeway traffic so badly as motorists tried to
read the flashing signs that the California Highway Patrol ordered
them turned off during rush hour Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt it was in the best interests of traffic safety," CHP
spokesman Tom Marshall said. "It wasn't worth the safety problems
because it wasn't a brand-new message. We don't want to create
another dangerous situation while reacting to the first."</LD>
<LD>   Marshall said it was the first suspension of an alert since the
system went into effect in July to aid law enforcement by asking the
public to watch for vehicles used in suspected kidnappings.</LD>
<TE>   Future cancellations during rush hours in heavily urban areas will
occur on a case-by-case basis and will be heavily influenced by
whether the crime is fresh, Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   According to experts, the first few hours after an abduction are
the most crucial in locating a kidnapper. A CHP task force in
Sacramento decides when to post and cancel child-abduction alerts on
lighted message boards that normally warn of traffic delays.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni Thompson, spokeswoman for the Polly Klaas Foundation in
Petaluma, Calif., which tracks child abduction issues, said she did
not fault the CHP for halting the alert. "On the one hand, it's sad
that people complain about the slowdown," she said. "On the other
hand, it's fabulous that it's tying up traffic because it means they
are paying attention."</TE>
<TE>   The alert was not canceled in other Southern California counties
until Medina's capture, the CHP said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California freeway signs began displaying the alert
Thursday after Medina allegedly abducted his 1-year-old son and his
wife's sister from Los Angeles and was believed to be headed to
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Medina was found with his two passengers, who were unharmed, on
Friday morning in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant in El
Centro, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jeff Perez said Los Angeles County CHP dispatchers receive
a steady stream of calls from motorists complaining about jammed
traffic each time the system is activated. "People are upset because
they're trying to get to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But they also feel compelled to slow down and look. "The reality
is that you put a message on those boards and people want to read
it," Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   The Medina alert flashed two messages in sequence, the first
stating "Child Abduction" and the second giving Medina's license
plate and a description of his truck. Some alerts require three
screens, Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbreviating the message so it can be read more quickly "is a hard
one to come up with an answer for, and we're looking at that," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Investigators Arrest Man in Alleged Kidnapping</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police trace a cell phone to El Centro, where they
find the suspect's son and the boy's aunt unharmed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man suspected of kidnapping his year-old son and the
boy's aunt was arrested in El Centro near the Mexican border, and the
boy and the woman were found unharmed Friday after police traced the
suspect's cellular telephone call, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew that phone call had been made from El Centro, but it
could have been made from anywhere in the city," El Centro Police
Sgt. Theresa Quinn said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, 'Well, if I had a kid that I wanted to calm down, I'd
take him to McDonald's,' " Quinn said. "So I got in an unmarked car
and drove down to McDonald's, and, lo and behold, there they were."</LD>
<TE>   Quinn said she called for backup and, flanked by two officers with
automatic rifles, she approached the pickup in which the man, woman
and baby were sitting.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't resist," Quinn said. "When there are police standing
there with AR-15s, that's probably a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   Amadeo Medina, who already was wanted on a domestic violence
warrant, was booked on suspicion of kidnapping, police said. Officers
said that, although he had claimed to have a gun at the time of the
abduction, none was recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Medina's son, Amadeo "Felipe" Medina, and the child's aunt, Naomi
Salizar, 39, were taken into protective custody.</TE>
<TE>   Debora Salizar was flown by police helicopter to El Centro, where
she was reunited with her son.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Capt. Jim Miller said the incident began about
1:30 p.m. Thursday when Medina woke Debora Salizar from a nap at her
home in the 1600 block of West 59th Street and told her: "Either you
come with me, or you're never going to see [Felipe] again."</TE>
<TE>   When Debora Salizar went outside, she saw the child and his aunt
sitting in Naomi Salizar's car, investigators said. Medina was behind
the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   The mother tried to pull the boy out of the car, but Medina drove
away, detectives said. They said Medina then made a U-turn and warned
Debora Salizar it was her "last chance" to get in the car. When she
hesitated, he drove away and did not return, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police were notified, and the California Highway Patrol issued an
Amber alert, warning that the boy had been abducted and was believed
to be in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Naomi Salizar's car was found abandoned shortly before midnight in
an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County just west of Ladera
Heights. Suspecting that Medina might have switched to his truck,
police issued a bulletin for the 1998 GMC pickup, advising that the
suspect might be headed for the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday morning, Medina used his cell phone to call his
family in Los Angeles, police said. Detectives, who were monitoring
the incoming calls, traced the call to El Centro.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said she was at the station about 9 a.m. when one of the El
Centro detectives told her about the phone call. A half-hour later,
she made the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure am glad that kid's safe."</TE>

<HD>Tour Offers a Glimpse Into the Worlds of 30 Valley Artists</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This weekend, participants can get an inside look at how art is made
in the San Fernando Valley during a Valley Artists Studio Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one would confuse Van Nuys with Van Gogh's Arles, the
Valley is home to scores of talented visual artists, said Louise
Lewis, director of the Art Galleries at Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Artists are attracted to the Valley for the same reason many
others are--because it's close to their jobs and more affordable than
much of the Westside, Lewis said. But affordability isn't the only
attraction.</LD>
<TE>   "There are artists out here who enjoy being able to have a little
bit of landscape around them," she said. And while many artists are
drawn to the high-ceilinged lofts of downtown Los Angeles and such
artists' enclaves as the San Gabriel Valley's Arroyo Seco and Santa
Monica's Ocean Park, she said, "some like it out here for the
anonymity and being able to work on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty Valley artists will open their studios, said Susan Bennett,
50, an artist on the board of the Valley Cultural Center. The center
is co-sponsoring the tour with the San Fernando Valley Arts Council.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said that the Valley tour is modeled on a similar annual
event in Ojai, whose resident artists long included the late
ceramicist Beatrice Wood.</TE>
<TE>   "Out in Ojai they've done it for 25 years," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 artists submitted samples of their work for this
weekend's tour, which organizers hope will become an annual event.</TE>
<TE>   The artists vary widely in style and media, and in how they live
and work. Jodi Bonassi, whose paintings often feature local shops,
works in the living room of her Canoga Park home. Lynn Creighton, a
sculptor of female figures, has a separate studio near the pool on
her large Northridge property.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Spellman, who does architectural paintings in black, white
and gray, works in his one-bedroom apartment in Reseda. And Western
artist Robert Perrin has a studio in his Northridge garage.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Tonie Michael was discovered by fellow painter Trice Tolle
while Michael was living in a cardboard shanty near the Van Nuys
Airport. Michael's contemporary canvases are on display at Blue Skies
Aviation flight school at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Each artist has one work on exhibit at the West Valley Playhouse,
7242 Owensmouth Ave. in Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   The public may view them at no charge today from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the tour are available at the theater for $25. Ticket
holders will be given a self-guided tour map with the locations of
the artists' studios, which will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today
and from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A reception will be held at the theater at 6 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   The artists will determine the sale price of their work, ranging
from about $50 to $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "My stuff's going to be dirt cheap because I want it to move,"
said Bennett, whose work includes black-and-white photos on botanical
and architectural themes hand-tinted with pastels.</TE>
<TE>   Visual artists often work at colleges and universities to put food
on the table and pay for materials. Noted environmental artist Kim
Abeles is on the Cal State Northridge faculty. The late painter and
printmaker Milton Hirschl, subject of a recent one-man show at the
Skirball Cultural Center, taught for almost 40 years at Pierce
College in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley has inspired artists as well as sheltered
them. Noted California Impressionist William Wendt painted the hills
that surround the Valley, and the Sepulveda Dam is the subject of a
striking Depression-era painting by Edward Biberman.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent Valley-based artists include painter Robert Williams and
textile artist Stephanie Plaut.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the artist most identified with the Valley is Jeffrey
Vallance. Until he moved to Las Vegas in 1995, Vallance lived, worked
and exhibited in his childhood home in Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   Vallance's oeuvre includes an ambitious piece centering on a
frozen chicken he bought at a Valley supermarket and christened
"Blinky, the Friendly Hen." In the mid-1980s, he did a series of
drawings called "Avenue of the Absurd" that documented such West
Valley landmarks as the Calabasas pet cemetery where Blinky is
interred.</TE>
<TE>   In an 1995 interview, Vallance complained that he could get
European collectors to Canoga Park, but not Westsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Many Valley-based artists say nothing has changed. "They pretty
much know that if they want to be known, they have to work the larger
L.A. scene," Lewis said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Bank Is Founded</HD>
<DH>Finance: Investors team to form institution that will focus
on serving small- to medium-sized businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two local bank presidents who worked themselves out of their jobs
have joined with area business leaders to form Ventura County
Business Bank.</LD>
<LD>   State regulators gave preliminary approval Friday to the charter
for the Oxnard-based bank, whose executives plan to open a branch in
the Thousand Oaks area.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Business Bank, which expects to open early next
year, will target small- to medium-sized businesses with annual sales
of up to $15 million. Approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which protects deposits up to $100,000 each, is expected next
week.</LD>
<TE>   The idea of starting the financial institution came from Gerald J.
Lukiewski of American Commercial Bank in Ventura and Robert B.
Hamilton of Los Robles Bank in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   American Commercial, with six branches, became so successful that
it was bought by Midstate Bank for $63 million in September 2001, and
Los Robles' three branches were bought by Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust
for $32 million in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "To start a bank, there has to be a need," said Hamilton, a board
member of the new bank who is coming out of retirement to help secure
clients, especially in the east end of the county. "The larger banks
tend to go after the bigger customers."</TE>
<TE>   The founders chose to focus on providing better banking service to
companies with $1 million or so in annual sales "because those are
the guys who end up with sales of $30 million," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Lukiewski, the founding president and chief executive of Ventura
County Business Bank, signed up several veteran bankers to oversee
the new operation.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Lukiewski and Hamilton, the 14-member board of
directors will include the owners of an insurance agency, a
telecommunications company, a furniture store and a realty office, as
well as outgoing county Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. Directors
are expected to invest about a third of the bank's equity.</TE>
<TE>   "The board members are going to probably put in $200,000 each,"
Lukiewski said. "I wanted to keep it kind of high so everyone in the
community knew that we were serious. If you put that much money in,
people know that you're going to be watching the bank like a hawk and
working hard to make it grow."</TE>
<TE>   The investment group hopes to sell at least $8 million in shares
to the board and other investors, with minimum investments of $1,000
for 100 shares at $10 each. The capital generated would allow Ventura
County Business Bank to create a loan and investment portfolio of up
to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lukiewski said it's a good time to launch an independent bank.</TE>
<TE>   "We're banking on the businesses here, and for the most part
they've been pretty healthy."</TE>

<LD>A court commissioner on Friday lowered to $800,000 the bail set for a
former Roman Catholic priest accused of molesting a boy.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Stephen Baker, 54, of Long Beach has been held in Men's
Central Jail since his Aug. 15 arrest. He is charged with 13 counts
of committing a lewd act upon a child and 16 counts of oral
copulation.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say the alleged crimes involved a male victim and took
place between 1976 and 1985. The boy was 9 when the sexual abuse
allegedly began.</LD>
<TE>   Baker faces up to 26 years in prison if convicted on all counts.</TE>
<TE>   His bail had been set at $1 million. Los Angeles County Superior
Court Commissioner Ross M. Klein reduced it on a motion by Baker's
criminal defense attorney, Donald Steier.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is set to be arraigned Oct. 17 in the Downey Courthouse.</TE>

<LD>A cascade of dirt and mud came crashing down a hillside Friday,
damaging a house on a winding suburban street and possibly burying
two dogs, Los Angeles fire officials said.</LD>

10 a.m., city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said. The homeowners'
dogs were presumed to be under the rubble, although firefighters
could not find their bodies.</LD>

<LD>Norman O. Brown, a soft-spoken philosopher whose revolutionary blend
of Freudian analysis and New Age mysticism attracted a large
intellectual following in the 1960s and '70s, died Wednesday in Santa
Cruz. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   A former humanities professor at UC Santa Cruz, Brown had
Alzheimer's disease and died at an assisted-living residence,
according to his son Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, the author of "Life Against Death" and "Love's Body," had a
profound effect on the youthful counterculture that blossomed in
America during and after the Vietnam War. His books, which sold
widely, captured a prevailing mood of rebellion against America's
political order and a deep-seated yearning for personal creative
freedom.</LD>
<TE>   So great was Brown's popularity that Time magazine in 1966
described "Life Against Death," a Freudian interpretation of world
history, "as one of the underground books that undergraduates feel
they must read to be with it." His works were found on bookshelves
and in backpacks along with those of Albert Camus, J.R.R. Tolkien,
Herman Hesse and Jean Paul Sartre.</TE>
<TE>   Large audiences regularly assembled on the Santa Cruz campus for
Brown's weekly lectures, and he had to find increasingly larger
lecture halls to meet the demand. Graduate students, occasional
reporters and longhaired devotees flocked around him as he strolled
the campus. But for all his colorful celebrity, Brown remained a
quiet, introspective man, whose personal life bore no resemblance to
the tumult surrounding him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a leader," he said on publication of "Love's
Body" in 1966, stressing his ties to a serious life of academic and
philosophical inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mexico and educated in Europe, Brown studied classical
literature at Oxford University. But he was drawn to American
academic life and got a doctorate in classics at the University of
Wisconsin. Although he began teaching at Nebraska Wesleyan
University, Brown interrupted that career to work as a research
analyst for the Office of Strategic Services in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he taught classics at Wesleyan University in
Connecticut and the University of Rochester. His first book, "Hermes
the Thief," was published in 1947. Blending a sociological
interpretation of mythology with Marxist analysis, it was a harbinger
of later works that would marry the worlds of social science,
philosophy and poetry.</TE>
<TE>   As a young student, Brown had been greatly influenced by Marxist
thought in the 1930s and '40s and he worked in the 1948 presidential
campaign of the progressive candidate Henry Wallace. But Brown grew
disillusioned with Marx in later years, gravitating toward what he
called "the intense honesty" of Freudian thought and its often dark
view of western civilization.</TE>
<TE>   One of the central themes of "Life Against Death: The
Psychoanalytical Meaning of History" is the repressive nature of
western society and the individual's need to throw off such shackles.
Although Freud himself espoused a strict sense of morality, Brown
used his rigorous body of work as the basis for an almost
ecstatic--and highly revolutionary--view of life.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Brown's lectures eventually included ruminations on his
dream life, which he said he had learned to interpret through the
power of Freudian self-analysis. "Until I wrote 'Life Against Death,'
I was a perfect sleeper," Brown said in a 1970 interview. "But when I
learned to interpret my dreams, the power of sleep was taken from me.
Freud said he came to disturb the sleep of the world. In my case, he
succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   In "Love's Body," a collection of poetic mediations, mini-essays
and aphorisms, Brown probed what he saw as the tension between the
erotic forces of nature and civilization, lamenting man's fall from a
state of natural innocence. Many of Brown's observations in "Love's
Body" have become classics in their own right, such as: "Freedom is
poetry, taking liberties with words, breaking the rules of normal
speech, violating common sense. Freedom is violence."</TE>
<TE>   Brown joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1968, just as the campus
opened, and was the only member ever given the title of professor of
humanities. He was praised by many academics across the nation, and
criticized by others who found his thoughts and conclusions either
dangerous or simply naive.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Brown viewed his status humbly and always seemed to
envy those who were engaged in the hurly-burly of the outside world.
In a 1969 letter to a prospective student, for example, Brown said
that "anyone with your proposed reading list has real work to do, and
the Great Work of World Transformation needs every hand.... It may be
that you need a teacher or guru; I don't know you well enough to say.
But these are to be found outside the university in increasing
numbers and in proliferating forms; the disintegration of the
established university proceeds apace."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobby," as he was known, retired from teaching in 1981, and wrote
two additional books, "Closing Time" in 1973 and "Apocalypse and/or
Metamorphosis" in 1993, a collection of essays written over 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a liberating, visionary scholar, the successor in the 20th
century to Blake and to Nietzsche," said Jerome Neu, a professor of
philosophy at UC Santa Cruz and a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a memorable teacher. On a rainy afternoon in 1969,
Brown held a large audience spellbound with a description of the
Roman poet, Virgil, on his deathbed. Virgil had written the "Aeneid,"
a long poem celebrating the triumph of the Roman Empire. But in his
final moments, Brown said, the poet was filled with despair, wishing
he could rewrite--or undo--the bloody events he had described.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to reverse everything," said Brown, scribbling the word
"Roma" on a blackboard. "And if you reverse the word 'Roma,' it's
'amor.' "</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son Thomas, Brown is survived by his wife of 64
years, Elizabeth P. Brown; another son, Stephen; two daughters,
Rebecca and Susan; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>J.L. Coe, 69; Aide to Dole, First Female Secretary of
Senate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jo-Anne Lee Coe, a key fund-raiser for former Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and the first woman to serve as secretary of the
Senate, died of an aortic aneurysm Sept. 27 at a hospital in Fairfax,
Va. She was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Coe worked for Dole nearly 35 years, and in later years helped
make him the Republican Party's top money gatherer. In addition to
House and Senate races and three presidential campaigns, Dole has
financed a political action committee and two private foundations.
Altogether, he, Coe and other aides raised more than $100 million for
campaigns and Republican causes.</LD>
<LD>   Coe joined Dole's congressional office as a caseworker in 1968 as
he prepared for his first Senate race. She became his Senate office
manager, then was office manager for his vice presidential campaign
when Gerald Ford sought the presidency in 1976. When Dole became
Senate majority leader in 1985, he nominated Coe to be Senate
secretary. In that post, she supervised the upper house's
administrative apparatus, historical and archival functions, and
interparliamentary relations with other countries.</LD>
<TE>   After the Democrats assumed control of the Senate in 1987, she
returned to Dole's Senate staff and then joined his 1988 presidential
campaign staff. When Dole lost the primary, she became executive
director of the Campaign America political action committee, which
she helped him found.</TE>
<TE>   The committee raised millions of dollars for Republican House,
Senate and gubernatorial candidates and at one point was second only
to the Teamsters Union among independent PACs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Dole appointed Coe finance director of his presidential
exploratory committee. She was also acting campaign manager and then
became deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   After he lost to Bill Clinton, Dole joined the Washington law firm
of Verner Liipfert McPherson &amp; Hand as a special counsel, and Coe
joined him as his chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   She also advised clients on legislative strategy and registered as
a lobbyist for clients that included Taiwan's unofficial embassy in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She managed Dole's personal business interests, including
relationships with speakers bureaus and the publishers of his books.</TE>
<TE>   She helped him raise money for the World War II Memorial
Commission, the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of
Kansas, and the Families of Freedom Scholarship fund--co-chaired by
Dole and Clinton--to assist families of victims of the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Coe was born Jo-Anne Lee Johnson in Coronado, Calif. She attended
George Washington High School in Alexandria, Va., and the College of
William and Mary in Williamsburg.</TE>
<TE>   She was the daughter of Adm. Roy Lee Johnson, commander in chief
of the Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam War, and accompanied him as a
young adult to posts that included Japan and Hawaii, where she worked
as a secretary at military installations.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a daughter, Kathryn Lee Coe Coombs of
Alexandria.</TE>

<HD>Oak View Teen Admits Kicking Transient</HD>
<DH>Court: Statements are heard on videotape during trial of
19-year-old accused in beating death of homeless man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View teenager accused of beating a homeless man to death
admitted kicking and throwing pebbles at "the bum" in a police
videotape shown to jurors Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no intention of really hurting him," defendant Robert
Coffman, 19, said during the video, recorded by detectives a few days
after the June 30, 2001, slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Coffman is one of four teens accused of fatally beating James
Clark, 58, as the youths headed to a Ventura beach party last year.
All four defendants, ages 14 to 19, are charged with robbery and
murder. The youngest was convicted earlier this year.</LD>
<TE>   The three other defendants told police that Coffman was the
ringleader that night.</TE>
<TE>   On the videotape, Coffman portrayed himself as a peripheral player
in the assault on Clark. He accused defendant Timothy John Becker of
striking Clark on the head with a marijuana pipe as the transient
coughed and choked on his own blood.</TE>
<TE>   According to Coffman, the group happened upon Clark as the teens
were chasing each other on their bicycles near the Ventura River
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it'd be fun to throw rocks at him," Coffman said on
the police video. "He chased us.... We were having fun."</TE>
<TE>   The boys ran from Clark until one of them realized the marijuana
pipe Coffman had sold to Becker was missing. They ran back to where
the homeless man was sleeping and started arguing over the pipe,
Coffman said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Coffman said, they all began kicking Clark until he
was coughing and spitting blood.</TE>
<TE>   "I kicked him a couple of times, I ain't gonna lie," Coffman said.
"I kicked him in the head, but then I asked him if he was all right."</TE>
<TE>   Clark tried to sit up, but Becker hit him on the head with the
pipe, Coffman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He laid halfway back and started coughing and choking," Coffman
said. "Tim took it way out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   Coffman said he was upset at Becker for breaking his pipe.</TE>
<TE>   In the video, he said he asked Clark if he was OK.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the bum moaning ... so I didn't think he was dead,"
Coffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman said he overheard Becker and defendant Christopher Dunham
talking later that night about hitting Clark on the head with "a big
old rock."</TE>
<TE>   The video was taped while Coffman was in custody for allegedly
stabbing Daniel McGrath, 19, at the Ventura beach promenade a day
after Clark's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   In the video, Coffman began sobbing when he realized he was a
suspect in Clark's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared, man!" Coffman cried. "I wanna see my mom and my
girlfriend ... I'm scared!"</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Friday, Dan Swanson, a gang investigator for
the Ventura Police Department, testified about skinhead ideology.
Swanson said homeless people, especially those who are white, are
seen as worthless human beings to members of such hate groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Skinheads look at [the] homeless as a lesser human
being--particularly white homeless," Swanson said. "They look at them
as a wasted white person."</TE>
<TE>   He said it is common for members of hate groups to participate in
"boot parties," in which a group of skinheads kicks a person while
down.</TE>
<TE>   He testified he believes Coffman to be a racist skinhead.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman's defense attorneys countered by calling two of Coffman's
childhood friends to the stand. Brothers Lonnie and Joseph Stanford,
who are half black and half white, lived with Coffman and his family
for nearly a year. They even shared a room, the brothers said.</TE>
<TE>   Both consider the Coffmans as family, they testified.</TE>
<TE>   "I still call her mom to this very day," Joseph Stanford said of
Coffman's mother. "[Coffman's] pretty much like a brother to me."</TE>

<HD>Condor Chick Is Found Dead in Forest</HD>
<DH>Environment: An autopsy is planned. The fledgling born six
months ago was the first hatched in the wild in 18 years. The bird's
father is missing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major blow to the $35-million effort to save North America's
largest bird, the first California condor chick brooded and hatched
in the wild in 18 years was found dead Friday on a remote ledge deep
in Los Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-month-old fledgling was missing for the last two days, but
biologists hoped it was merely off testing its wings. Hopes were
dashed when the bird was found just below the sandstone cave where it
hatched in April.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death is unknown, and the condor will be sent to the
San Diego Zoo for an autopsy. There are two remaining chicks in the
refuge, which is near Fillmore.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the bird's father has been missing for almost three
weeks and is presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists say they last received a radio transmission from the
8-year-old adult Sept. 19, when it was near Lion Canyon in rural
Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   The transmitter on the bird's wing stopped sending signals, and
officials suspect the condor either died from lead poisoning or by
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   If it was lead poisoning, the adult could have passed it on to the
chick when feeding it, biologists said.</TE>
<TE>   The chick's hatching was hailed as a watershed event, a validation
of a controversial captive-breeding program that boosted condor
numbers from 15 to almost 200 over the last 20 years. The chick would
have been the first in a new generation of wild condors soaring the
skies from Baja California to Big Sur.</TE>
<TE>   But while condors have been decapitated by power lines, poisoned
by antifreeze and pecked to death by other condors, this fatality may
be the hardest to take.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all pretty distraught," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of
the condor project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "Any
number of things could have happened. Whether there was a connection
between the chick's death and the male, we don't know. There was no
obvious cause of death when it was discovered."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer visited the isolated region of sandstone pinnacles in the
Sespe Condor Refuge hoping to watch the chick first leave the nest.
But he believes he was a day late. Biologists say young condors
learning to fly will often do a sort of controlled crash landing into
a tree or bush and wait for days before leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt personally attached to it," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   But while the loss of two birds was a tragedy, Palmer said it
wasn't a setback for the program, which will be releasing three
condors in Baja California on Wednesday and has refuges in Big Sur,
Los Padres and the Vermilion Cliffs near the Grand Canyon. There are
73 condors in the wild and 132 in captivity. The goal is for two
populations of 150 each with 15 breeding pairs in California and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a greater impact, it's more of a personal
disappointment," Palmer said. "Fledgling mortality is greatest when
they leave the nest. It could have encountered coyotes or golden
eagles."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said an investigation will be done to review program
practices and to see if the bird was malnourished or suffered from
lead poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Wallace, condor recovery team leader, said both mother and
father were feeding the chick so it didn't starve. He said the father
may have regurgitated lead pellets or bullets while feeding the
chick.</TE>
<TE>   "If it turns out to be lead poisoning, we will move one step
further on this," Wallace said. "If we find we are losing an
abnormally high number of birds because of lead poisoning or anything
else, we have the moral responsibility to mitigate that."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Fish and Wildlife advocates the creation and use of non-lead
bullets and urges hunters to bury the gut piles of animals they shoot
with lead bullets. Yet they don't want to instigate a fight with
hunters or the National Rifle Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "They are applying a Band-Aid and not treating the disease," said
David Clendenen, a critic of the condor program and former lead
biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Service at Hopper Mountain
National Wildlife Refuge. "Fish and Wildlife is not confronting the
lead issue at all. All you hear about is how successful they are, but
they don't have anything near a self-sustaining population of birds."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace agrees that lead could doom the birds. But he thinks high
numbers increase the birds' chances of survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotionally, you can't escape the fact that we all got really
jazzed about this bird, and to this point it has been a huge success
story," Wallace said. "And to have the first chick in the wild die is
an emotional blow."</TE>
<TE>   Janet Hamber has weathered death and disappointment during her 26
years as a condor biologist.</TE>
<TE>   She watched chicks swept off nests by winds. She was there when
six condors, considered the best hope for breeding, vanished without
a trace. And she saw a chick accidentally killed by a fellow
biologist.</TE>
<TE>   "The ups and downs are huge," she said. "But if we don't try, then
we'll never succeed at anything."</TE>

<HD>Cypress, Church Near Deal to Avert Battle Over Land</HD>
<DH>Development: Cottonwood will sell property to the city for
a Costco store. The religious center will get about 28 acres on a
nearby golf course.</DH>

<LD>Cypress officials announced Friday that they have reached a tentative
settlement with Cottonwood Christian Center, apparently averting a
legal showdown over religious freedom and a city's right to dictate
development.</LD>
<LD>   Although details are not final, both parties said they agree on
several key issues: Each side will drop pending lawsuits; Cottonwood
will sell its land to the city, which plans to bring in a Costco
discount store; and the church will acquire about 28 acres on the
nearby Cypress Golf Course.</LD>
<LD>   "Cottonwood and the city now are committed to doing everything
possible to work with each other--not against each other--with a
mutual goal in mind," said David Belmer, the city's community
development director.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to wind up with a deal that's going to be best for
our community and best for Cottonwood," Belmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement should effectively end two years of rhetoric and
legal machinations that drew nationwide media attention and divided
land use experts and religious institutions. When the dispute hit the
courts, it became a test case for a federal law passed in 2000: the
Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which exempts
churches from most local zoning regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said they are cautiously hopeful the fight is
over, but won't be satisfied until the deal is signed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a tentative agreement on the principal points, and talks
are going well," said the Rev. Mike Wilson, Cottonwood's project
manager. "It's been a long road. We don't want to say it's done until
it's done."</TE>
<TE>   The city has contended that Cottonwood, a 4,000-member church,
bought 18 acres at a busy intersection at Walker Street and Katella
Avenue even though it was in a redevelopment zone intended for a
large retail center. Church officials have said they were never
warned about the city's plans.</TE>
<TE>   The city rejected the church's proposal to build, then condemned
the property so it could sell the land to Costco or a similar, tax
revenue-generating "big box" store.</TE>
<TE>   The church asked for a temporary injunction to block eminent
domain proceedings, which was granted by a federal judge in August.
U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter issued an opinion in favor
of Cottonwood, mincing no words in his criticism of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if [the city] had compelling reasons to burden Cottonwood's
religious exercise, they must do so in the least restrictive means,"
Carter wrote. "Far from doing that, the city has done the equivalent
of using a sledgehammer to kill an ant."</TE>
<TE>   Although the city downplayed the decision, it may have prompted
officials to reach a settlement, particularly since Carter would have
presided over the case.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed settlement, the church will lease about 28
acres of the Cypress Golf Course, with an option to buy once the city
grants building entitlements and the sale of the existing property is
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased that we've finally come up with something that's a
win-win," Cypress City Councilman Tim Keenan said. "The city gets its
original piece of property. It's a key anchor in our city for future
potential development. And the church gets a piece of property that's
actually more appropriate and will save them more money in the long
run."</TE>

<HD>Latino Caucus Won't Support Davis Reelection</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Lawmakers respond to vetoes of bills to allow
drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Legislature's Democratic Latino caucus, angry that Gov. Gray
Davis vetoed legislation to permit some illegal immigrants to obtain
driver's licenses, is taking the extraordinary step of not endorsing
their fellow Democrat for reelection, several legislators said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Latino members of the Senate and Assembly circulated a letter
Friday, informing Davis of their decision and saying that they are
"unable" to endorse him because of the vetoes.</LD>
<LD>   The vetoes "contradict our Democratic core value of inclusion,"
says the letter, signed by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles),
chairman of the Latino caucus, and the incoming chairman, Assemblyman
Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles).</LD>
<TE>   The practical effect of the refusal of the 22-member caucus to
endorse Davis remains to be seen. Some Latino legislators who have
endorsed Davis have no intention of revoking their personal
commitments. Others said that, though they won't vote for Republican
Bill Simon Jr., they have no intention of voting for Davis or
dispatching volunteers to help turn out the vote for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lift a finger for the governor," said Sen.
Martha Escutia (D-Whittier). "I'm not going to send my volunteers. My
volunteers won't be there."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign spokesman dismissed the development as
"unfortunate" but said the decision by the caucus does not represent
the views of Latino voters. "One or two legislators do not the Latino
community make," said the spokesman, Roger Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's veto of the driver's license legislation came as a
surprise to some lawmakers, because he had been working on compromise
language with one bill's author, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los
Angeles), and had seemed to indicate a willingness to sign the final
package.</TE>
<TE>   "People who contribute to our economy and pay taxes are deserving
of that privilege of obtaining a license," the governor said in
August.</TE>
<TE>   As approved by the Legislature, the two measures would have
permitted immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, provided that they
were California residents, had passed criminal background checks, had
federal taxpayer numbers and were in the process of becoming
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Davis issued the vetoes despite a promise a year ago that he would
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that promise, Cedillo agreed to pull back measures last
year that already had received legislative approval and would have
permitted illegal immigrants to obtain licenses.</TE>
<TE>   By August of this year, Cedillo had agreed to Davis' demand that
illegal immigrants seeking licenses submit to criminal background
checks. Several top law enforcement officials, including Los Angeles
County Sheriff Lee Baca and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, endorsed the
legislation, which had bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   In his veto message, the governor said the bills lacked a
requirement that illegal immigrants prove they were working before
obtaining licenses. Davis also said the legislation, SB 804 and AB
60, would allow an applicant to obtain a license, even with an arrest
warrant pending "for treason, espionage, sabotage, homicide,
kidnapping, sexual assault, drug trafficking, flight escape or
smuggling." Lawmakers dispute that contention.</TE>
<TE>   Davis cited last year's terrorist attacks, saying they "made it
abundantly clear that the driver's license is more than just a
license to drive."</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of the primary documents we use to identify ourselves,"
Davis wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, a driver's license was in the hands of terrorists
who attacked America on that fateful day."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco vowed that the legislation would be reintroduced next
year. "We're not going to go away with this issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, the Davis campaign spokesman, blamed Cedillo for the
Latino caucus' decision not to endorse Davis, noting that a single
member can block an endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar added that Davis "enjoys overwhelming support from the
Latino community."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar cited an array of actions taken by Davis in his first term
to help Latinos, including his agreement to expand health care for
poor people, his seeking to improve schools and his siding with
workers on employment issues.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate," Salazar said of the Latino legislators'
decision. "But the fact is, Gov. Davis has fought hard for Latinos
for 26 years, throughout his career in public service."</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo was upset over Davis' vetoes. But Escutia and other Latino
lawmakers disputed Salazar's contention that Cedillo had stood alone
to block the endorsement. Escutia said that legislators from
Sacramento, Salinas, Fresno, San Diego and Los Angeles had joined a
Friday morning conference call to discuss the endorsement question.</TE>
<TE>   "This has gone way beyond one person," Escutia said. "They want to
marginalize Gilbert [Cedillo]. But they are marginalizing
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators who were contacted Friday said the decision against
endorsing Davis does not mean that they will vote for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento), for one, said she intends to
urge her constituents to vote for the Democratic ticket, even though
she supported the Latino caucus' decision not to endorse Davis for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, it is a sound position, given the significant,
substantive amendments that were agreed to," Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is strong statement and a bold position and it comes with a
deeply held belief," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers said they would not vote for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to vote for Gov. Davis. I can't," Cedillo said. "He
gave me his word that we would get this done, and it didn't happen. I
can't reward that."</TE>

<HD>Attack Wasn't a Hate Crime, Suspect Says</HD>
<DH>Violence: He alleges that his friends leaped out of the
stolen car he was driving and attacked two men, not knowing they were
gay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man accused of wielding a baseball bat in an attack on two gay
men in West Hollywood last month said Friday in a jail interview that
his two friends did it and that the victims' homosexuality wasn't an
issue.</LD>
<LD>   Torwin Sessions, 19, of Watts said he was driving a stolen car on
Cynthia Street just off Santa Monica Boulevard the night of Sept. 2
when his two companions suddenly jumped out of the vehicle with a
baseball bat.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard the car doors slam ... then I saw the dude fall down," he
said. "The two guys I was with got back in the car and just said,
'Go!' Everybody in the car was just hysterical and panicking."</LD>
<TE>   Sessions said he "didn't know they were gay. That's not why
everything happened."</TE>
<TE>   He refused to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the West Hollywood community were outraged when Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley announced Thursday that his office would not file
hate crime charges against the three suspects because there was no
evidence that anti-gay epithets were yelled.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney charged Sessions, Larry Walker, 29, and
Vincent Dotson, 18, each with one count of attempted robbery, two
counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of conspiracy to
commit robbery. All three men, who were arrested Tuesday night in
connection with the attack on actor Treve Broudy and Edward Ulett,
pleaded not guilty in Superior Court on Thursday afternoon. Broudy
remains hospitalized with possible brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Sessions' version of events contradicts the charges against him.
The complaint alleges that he and his friend were out on a robbery
rampage when he got out of the car and beat Broudy and Ulett.
Sessions is charged with inflicting great bodily harm</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the evidence will show that he wielded the bat," said
Sandi Gibbons of the district attorney's office. "We will present all
that information at a preliminary hearing, and we plan to ask the
court that the hearing be televised."</TE>
<TE>   Sessions is in County Jail on $215,000 bail and faces a possible
19-year state prison term.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know it was going to happen," he said. "We were out
joyriding, looking for girls on Sunset Strip. It was so crowded that
we just took that other street and I slowed down to yield for
traffic. Then everything happened."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, "I'm deeply sorry. I made a mistake in my life. I
wish I could take it all back."</TE>
<TE>   Four Los Angeles City Council members said Friday that they will
introduce a measure next week asking the district attorney's office
to file hate crime charges against all three suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence indicates that these attacks were motivated by hate
and that hate crime charges should be filed," said Councilman Jack
Weiss, a former federal prosecutor. "These were not garden variety
attempted robberies; they were violent beatings with baseball bats in
the heart of the gay community."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley responded: "As a former prosecutor, Mr. Weiss fully knows
the criteria for charging someone. I don't think he knows the
evidence in this case, because if he did, he wouldn't be issuing this
statement."</TE>
<TE>   Other council members joining Weiss to introduce the measure are
Eric Garcetti, Wendy Greuel and Tom LaBonge.</TE>

<HD>Card Rooms Argue That Indians Who Plan First Urban Casino
Aren't a Legitimate Tribe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Lytton Band of Pomo Indians that hopes to open California's first
urban casino isn't legitimately a tribe, card rooms that oppose the
competition argued in court papers Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The band plans to convert a San Pablo card room into a Las
Vegas-style casino across the bay from San Francisco as early as Dec.
7, when the federal government is scheduled to take the card room
property into trust for the tribe.</LD>
<LD>   Four Bay Area card rooms and several community allies on Friday
asked a federal judge in Sacramento to stop the land transfer.</LD>
<TE>   They argued that the tribe hasn't followed all the legal steps
necessary to prove that its members constitute a legitimate tribe.</TE>
<TE>   A tribal spokesman, Doug Elmets, countered that the tribe is
recognized by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the card rooms had failed in their initial challenge
before U.S. District Court Judge David F. Levi this summer. Levi
rejected their efforts to throw out Proposition 1A, which authorized
tribal casinos in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The card rooms are appealing that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "They've already lost one round, and they are clearly grasping at
straws," Elmets said.</TE>

<HD>Dana Point Harbor Could Get $100-Million Upgrade</HD>
<DH>Commerce: County plan to move restaurants closer to water,
add shops and double parking spaces is unveiled. One aim is to
preserve its small-marina ambience.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A county supervisor on Friday unveiled a plan to redevelop Dana Point
Harbor that he said would keep its small-harbor image while moving
restaurants closer to the water's edge and creating more commercial
space and pedestrian walkways.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for relocation of the harbor's restaurants,
including the Brig, Harbor Grill, El Torito and Harpoon Harry's, into
new buildings next to the water.</LD>
<LD>   The cost is estimated at $100 million.</LD>
<TE>   The move would provide enough space to build two two-story parking
structures that would double the number of marina parking spaces to
1,300, Supervisor Tom Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was revealed to harbor merchants Friday and will be shown
to boat owners at 10 a.m. today at the Dana Point Youth and Group
Center. Residents and other interested parties can view the plan at 5
p.m. Oct. 24 at the same center.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is not expected to begin until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, whose district includes Dana Point, is hoping the entire
cost can be paid through leases and fees and not taxpayer funds.</TE>
<TE>   The county has been trying to revitalize the Cape Cod-inspired
marina since 1997. But boaters have been worried that slip fees would
double and their low-key marina would go the way of other Southern
California marinas packed with hotels and clogged with yachts.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he hopes the latest plan addresses their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of other marinas were examined by county officials and the
county's consultant, Wallace, Roberts &amp; Todd.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant also assessed the harbor's traffic, parking,
sewers, pipelines and aging infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point Harbor is a 212-acre marina built by the Army Corps of
Engineers in 1971. It contains about 2,500 boat slips rimmed by shops
and restaurants. On the western edge is the Ocean Institute, an
educational facility that helps children and adults explore the ocean
environment.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Jury Hung on Murder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury deadlocked Friday in the case of a Newport Beach attorney
accused of gunning down a client's wife, faking his own suicide off
the Golden Gate Bridge and spending four years on the lam.</LD>
<LD>   Ten of the 12 jurors favored acquittal for Hugh "Randy" McDonald,
saying prosecutors never offered conclusive proof that the attorney
shot 33-year-old Janie Pang in the closet of her Villa Park bedroom
in 1997. McDonald insisted he was with a prostitute at the time of
the murder and fled from Orange County not as a fugitive, but because
he was tired of his stressful life in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "We always thought he was a lying jerk, but we didn't think he
committed the murder," said juror Monica Bartolone, 67, of Newport
Beach. "We just couldn't tie him in to the murder. [The evidence] was
circumstantial."</LD>
<TE>   Bartolone said some jurors also believed assertions from
McDonald's attorneys that Pang was the victim of a professional hit
orchestrated by her husband, Danny Pang, a businessman who the FBI
said might have ties to the Taiwanese mob.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a hit because she knew something she wasn't
supposed to know," the juror said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not decided whether they will seek a retrial. But
McDonald expressed confidence Friday that he will be vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed I wasn't acquitted," said McDonald, who remains
free on $500,000 bail. "I have the utmost confidence I will prevail."</TE>
<TE>   The five-week trial centered on a collection of bizarre
circumstances surrounding Pang's May 30, 1997, death. The former
stripper turned stay-at-home mom was killed around noontime, when a
man in a suit carrying a briefcase appeared at the door of her home
in Orange County's wealthy horse country. After a minute or two of
discussion, according to witnesses, the visitor pulled a gun and
began chasing Pang. He eventually caught up with her in her bedroom
and shot her with a .380-caliber semiautomatic. Pang's son, a maid
and the maid's daughter fled out a back door.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors claimed that McDonald drove to Pang's home because
Danny Pang owed McDonald's law firm $20,000. Of that sum, $4,000 was
owed to McDonald directly.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, McDonald abruptly left his family and staged
an elaborate suicide, prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Having told his wife he was traveling to the Bay Area for
business, McDonald placed his watch and business card on a ledge of
the Golden Gate Bridge. He also mailed cassette tapes to his wife and
son that suggested he was going to kill himself. But McDonald headed
to Utah, where he began a new life. He was arrested four years later.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contended that investigators botched the case.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Molfetta said that local investigators ignored a report
compiled by the FBI and the Orange County and Los Angeles County
sheriffs. That report, according to court testimony, noted that Danny
Pang was suspected of being a member of the United Bamboo Triad, a
Taiwanese crime group. Molfetta and co-defense counsel Kenneth Reed
portrayed Danny Pang as a shady businessman and million-dollar
gambler who abused his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line here is that they got the wrong guy," Molfetta
said. "They've been looking for a motive for five years. They're not
going to find it, and the reason is they're looking in the wrong
place."</TE>
<TE>   Many jurors didn't believe McDonald's claims that he left Orange
County because of a midlife crisis. "We felt he was on the run,"
Bartolone said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, jurors said they didn't understand exactly what
McDonald's motivations were and felt there was not a strong enough
link between him and the murder. They also felt detectives didn't
look closely enough to other possible suspects, including Danny Pang.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a very good investigation," Bartolone said. "Things
that seemed important to us, they didn't think were important."</TE>
<TE>   Danny Pang's lawyer has denied that his client had anything to do
with the murder. But he also said he doubts that McDonald is the
killer.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, attorney William Baker has suggested a third suspect, a
man who was allegedly stalking Janie Pang since her days as a
stripper.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators said the alleged stalker was out of the country
at the time of the killing.</TE>

<HD>Aileen S. Mellott, 76; Co-Founder of Flying Samaritans,
Powder Puff Pilot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aileen Saunders Mellott, one of the nation's top aviators who won two
Powder Puff Derbies and the International Air Race before co-founding
the Flying Samaritans humanitarian organization in the early 1960s,
has died. She was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Mellott, who earned her private pilot's license in 1956 and flew
in her final race last year, died of pancreatic cancer Sept. 25 at
her home in Escondido.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the Ninety-Nines, a female pilots organization founded
in 1929, Mellott competed seven times in the Powder Puff Derby, the
all-female transcontinental air race, and won in 1959 and 1960.</LD>
<TE>   The National Pilots Assn. named her Pilot of the Year in 1961, and
a year later she won the International Air Race for women.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, she was selected to join the San Diego Airport
Commission, and she also served as a board member of the San Diego
Aerospace Museum.</TE>
<TE>   But, say those who knew her, Mellott took her greatest pride in
the Flying Samaritans, a group of physicians, nurses, dentists and
other professionals who bring health care to rural Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mellott stopped piloting her plane to Mexico about 10
years ago, "it was a constant open door with members of the Flying
Samaritans," said her brother, George Smallen of Escondido. "She kept
up with it unit the day she died."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the Flying Sams, as they call themselves, grew out of
a forced landing that Mellott made in a remote part of Baja
California in November 1961.</TE>
<TE>   She was flying five passengers, including San Diego Magazine
co-owner Jack Vietor, back to San Diego after visiting a new hotel in
La Paz when a severe dust storm, coupled with a diminishing fuel
supply, forced her to find a place to set down her twin-engine
Bonanza.</TE>
<TE>   Mellott finally found a clearing on a mesa outside the remote
village of El Rosario. "The dust was so thick, we couldn't even see
the ground," she recalled years later.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers had heard the plane circling overhead and two
battered trucks were sent up to the mesa to pick up the Americans.
They were given food, shelter for the night and extra gas so they
could fly out the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   In talking to Anita Espinoza, the English-speaking proprietor of
the general store, Mellott learned that many of the tiny village's
400 residents in the drought-plagued region were in need of food,
clothing and medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "The people were so kind, and Anita was so gracious," Mellott told
the San Diego Union-Tribune in August. "She opened her house to us
and also served as our interpreter."</TE>
<TE>   To return the villagers' kindness, Mellott and two fellow
Ninety-Nines members who had been on the Baja flight organized a
Christmas airlift to distribute food, clothing and gifts to El
Rosario.</TE>
<TE>   One of the volunteers who accompanied Mellott and the other pilots
who made the delivery was Dr. Dale Hoyt, who brought his medical bag
along on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Once the villagers learned a doctor was in town, they lined up to
see him. Hoyt treated his first patient on Espinoza's kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   Out of that successful Christmas airlift grew the Flying
Samaritans, with Mellott serving as founding president.</TE>
<TE>   From nine pilots and a handful of volunteers, the Flying Sams has
grown to a dozen chapters and more than 2,200 members throughout the
West.</TE>
<TE>   They regularly serve about two dozen rural Baja health clinics,
including one established in El Rosario.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for Aileen, there wouldn't have been any Flying
Sams," Espinoza told the Union-Tribune in August when she was flown
to Escondido so she could visit Mellott one last time.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the one who promoted it. Aileen is our angel without
wings."</TE>
<TE>   Mellott was born in Springdale, Ark., in 1926. When she was 11,
her family moved to the Los Angeles area, where her father worked as
an engineer for Shell Oil Co.</TE>
<TE>   An outgoing woman who enjoyed challenges, Mellott and her first
husband, pilot Walter Saunders, owned a combination flying school,
airplane rental and repair business at Gillespie Field in El Cajon in
the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "She always had a great interest in flying, and she decided to
start flying herself," her brother said. "Once she got her license,
flying was everything. She immediately joined the Ninety-Nines and
became really doubly interested in flying and racing."</TE>
<TE>   Mellott, who also flew search and rescue missions for the Coast
Guard Auxiliary, flew in her last race in June 2001, accompanying her
onetime rival and good friend Fran Bera in the 25th Air Race Classic
from San Diego to Batavia, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Mellott was a onetime director of sales for the U.S. Grant Hotel
in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   She was inducted into the Forest of Friendship, a hall of fame for
female pilots in Atchison, Kan., in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, Frank Zehner
of Boerne, Texas; and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Mellott had asked that any donations be made in her name to the
Elizabeth Hospice Society, 150 W. Crest St., Escondido, CA 92025, or
the Palomar chapter of the Flying Samaritans, P.O. Box 492, Bonsall,
CA 92003.</TE>

<HD>MTA to Fight Damage Award</HD>
<DH>Appeal: The transit agency has been ordered to pay $1.4
million to injured woman, 97.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county transit agency will appeal a $1.4-million damage award
handed out to a 97-year-old Los Angeles woman who suffered serious
injuries when she fell on a downtown subway platform, an official
said.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Judge Soussan G. Bruguera ruled against the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and in favor of Yvonne Wilson,
a former accountant who lives by herself in a one-bedroom apartment
on Bunker Hill.</LD>
<LD>   In August 2000, while trying to get aboard a Red Line subway car,
Wilson was hit by a train door as it closed and she fell backward
onto the platform.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson said the door's warning signal had not been turned on by an
MTA operator. She suffered serious injuries to her back and head.
Doctors eventually diagnosed her with an arthritis-like condition
that they said had been caused by the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Bruguera found the MTA negligent and ordered restitution for pain
and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived independently all my life, so this has been an
ordeal," Wilson, a widow with no family, said in a recent interview.
"The MTA--they've dragged this thing out as long as they can. They
just think, 'She's an old lady, she'll be gone soon enough.' But I
don't plan on going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA legal chief, Steve Carnevale, said Wilson's age had played
no part in the agency's legal strategy. "It's an outrageous award,"
said Carnevale, who said he did not believe the agency had been
negligent. "I have no idea where the judge was coming from. We are
definitely going to appeal."</TE>
<TE>   The deal is a particularly tough blow for the MTA since, early on
in the litigation, the woman's lawyers offered to settle the case for
about $40,000. The agency turned down the offer, gambling it could
win in court. The courtroom loss brings to $10.2 million the amount
awarded this year to plaintiffs who have sued the MTA over injury and
negligence claims, an agency spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>An Incident Report in Big Bear's Police Log Airs One Man's
Dirty Laundry</HD>

<LD>In terse cop-speak, the crime log of the Big Bear Grizzly brings you
a Laundromat employee's account of a startling bare encounter: "Male
subject taking off pants, putting them in commercial washing machine
just before closing time. Wearing only his boxers, subject left
location.</LD>
<LD>   "Reporting party closed and locked business and subject has
returned and is staring in windows. Left in dark blue van, last seen
wearing white shirt and blue boxers."</LD>
<LD>   Will it sell before Thanksgiving? You have to wonder if the
feathers are flying as home shoppers visit the property spotted by
Jean Dunbar of Newport Beach (see accompanying). It's gated, which I
guess makes sense with all the wildlife.</LD>
<TE>   'Duh!' award winner: Neil McCarthy of San Clemente points out
there are few things less illuminating than water bottles whose
ingredients label carries information about the calories, grams of
fat, carbohydrates, etc. per serving. Then again ... Phyllis and Mark
Dimant of Oxnard did notice a startling nutrition fact on a bottle of
juice (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Now that's security!  "At least my in-law won't have to renew this
card for 1,001 years," said Yoshie Tachiki of L.A. (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Bless that worker: Visiting the new cathedral in L.A., John Madden
of San Clemente "stopped at the cafeteria for a sandwich and ordered
an imported beer. When the lady at the register said, 'Let me pour
this for you,' crisis ensued.</TE>
<TE>   "The checkout line ground to a halt while personnel scurried
hither and yon in vain search for what could not be found at the new
cathedral: an old-fashioned church key."</TE>
<TE>   That's bottle opener to you non-drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually," Madden said, "a male employee came to the rescue
with skills undoubtedly learned in high school, using a pie server to
do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected return serve: Bill Lurie of San Pedro has a tennis
court in his backyard, and kids from the local elementary school
learned that he was a good source for used tennis balls. They took
turns knocking at his door, at which time he'd hand out one to a
customer.</TE>
<TE>   "One day," he said, "a little boy came to the door and asked for a
tennis ball. After I gave him one, he began leaving without saying
'Thank you.' I wanted to improve his manners so I yelled, 'Thank
you!'</TE>
<TE>   "He turned around and said to me, 'You're welcome.' "</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police log of the Seal Beach Sun reported that a
man at a bus stop "was wearing a white baseball cap, khaki pants and
a gas mask." Maybe he wanted to ensure that no one would sit next to
him.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The army marches around with a bit of a paunch these days, but that's
OK. For veterans of the Revolutionary War, they're in pretty fair
shape.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, they get out and about a lot. Later this month, they'll
hit the Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York, camping for a week in
a big field, running around with swords, shooting muskets, and
screaming their heads off with 3,000 other rebels, Loyalists,
redcoats, Hessians, Native Americans and even a horde of camp
followers.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, they were on the grounds of the Reagan Library, staging
mock battles, running a court-martial, trudging hither and yon and
sweating profusely into their woolens under the baking Simi Valley
sun.</LD>
<TE>   For stalwarts such as George Mack, being a Revolutionary War
reenactor is a labor of love, especially in the land of citrus and
surf.</TE>
<TE>   "Stand your ground, men!" the 37-year-old Orange County teacher
yelled in a passable British accent. His lads from the Third
Captain's Company of Royal Welch Fusiliers in America--lawyers,
teachers, accountants and such in real life--glared at some ragtag,
buckskin-clad, frightened-looking colonists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're exercising our militia rights as free Americans!" yelled
back rebel chief Hank Kayser, who runs a Simi Valley asphalt plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Go Americans!" shouted a couple of teenage girls in the crowd on
the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, all was pandemonium on the grassy patch between a 9-foot
chunk of the Berlin Wall and the tomb in which Nancy and Ronald
Reagan will one day rest.</TE>
<TE>   Rifles were leveled and bayonets were fixed. Shots burst out and a
colonist or two were "run through." A wailing widow rushed onto the
killing field, sobbing as she cradled a fallen soldier.</TE>
<TE>   After Mack dressed down his men for firing without an order, a
narrator rang a hand bell, intoned "Let the dead arise!" and
delivered the episode's big lesson: "To this day no one knows for
sure who fired the shot that began the American Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   For many in the audience, the ersatz Battle of Lexington would be
as close to colonial history as they would ever get west of the
Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, the original 13 colonies are the nation's hotbed
of Revolutionary War reenactment, with a cast of thousands simulating
conflict near the battlefields of yore. But in California, fans of
the "Revwar," as it's called in reenactment circles, can be numbered
in the dozens--not enough for long combat but plenty for educational
events at museums, genealogy conventions and gun shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We need reinforcements," Mack groaned as he uncrated a few skimpy
bunches of carrots for his compatriots. "There's not too many of us
in these parts."</TE>
<TE>   Inside his tent--a re-creation of a British officer's digs,
complete with Persian carpet and fine crockery--the heat was
crushing. Perspiration streamed from beneath his powdered wig. But
there would be no shorts and T-shirts for him or his troop of two
dozen, who were drooping in their waistcoats and knee breeches. For a
reenactor, authenticity is everything.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of his pals, Mack has outfitted himself with antiques,
from walking stick to bayonet. If necessary, he can brew up what he
calls "18th century Tang"--extract of dried mashed orange mixed with
water, as prescribed in 1776 by British military physician John
Ranby. Mack discovered the formula as he was poring over Ranby's
"Marine Practice of Physick and Surgery," which he keeps around the
house.</TE>
<TE>   Across the library's spacious courtyard, the rebels of the
Delaware Regiment Light Company are equally zealous researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Kayser and four friends started their Revwar group to observe
the Bicentennial in 1976. Ever since, Kayser and his comrades have
devoted themselves to authenticating the smallest details of life in
the regiment, which fought throughout the South and was present for
Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown in 1781.</TE>
<TE>   Many Revwar units are governed by a New Jersey-based organization
called the Brigade of the American Revolution. To meet the brigade's
standards for period garb and gear, members of Kayser's regiment
scoured museums, universities, the Smithsonian Institution, and the
Delaware state archives. The task took three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art let Kayser and his crew in
after hours to scrutinize period clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "We researched it down to the number of threads per square inch,"
he said. "We figured, if we were going to do this, we'd do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Many reenactors fight in 1st century Rome, at reenactments of
Antietam and on the beaches of Normandy.</TE>
<TE>   Others don't play soldier at all, opting for civilian roles.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Hallinger, a marine-biology instructor in San Pedro who also
teaches corset-making, was on hand in a vintage gown. "It was all the
rage in 1775," she said as she prepared to discuss the typical garb.</TE>
<TE>   She told a hushed audience that babies as young as 7 months were
bound in organ-strangling corsets. And dresses were never washed, but
were "freshened up" with lavender and cornmeal, said Hallinger, who
painstakingly re-creates them using 200-year-old tools.</TE>
<TE>   Under a canvas canopy, "company surgeon" Mark Rutledge displayed a
rogue's gallery of battered medical instruments, including a scoop
that caused countless deaths as it chipped lead balls embedded in
punctured flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "Bet it makes you feel a little better about your HMO," cracked
Rutledge, who has traveled as far as Paris to study the techniques of
18th century medicine.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards away, Randolph Jonathan Pentress, a 30-year-old house
painter from Las Vegas, shrieked "Oh joy!" as he bummed a few
shillings from a passerby. His face was caked with dirt, his pants
were tattered, his spectacles were shattered, and he cackled through
a protruding, stained set of store-bought teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks that the homeless are today's problem," he said
as he stepped out of character for a moment. "But that's not so. Back
then, for every magistrate, there were at least five of me."</TE>
<TE>   One of the younger reenactors, William Spiller, a 19-year-old
college student from Hesperia, took in the scene from a shady spot
beneath a tree. "My friends think it's all a little odd," he said,
"but I tell them it's just like a camping trip--only times 10."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ilie Ceausescu, 76, who served as a deputy defense minister under
Nicolae Ceausescu, his older brother and Romania's late communist
dictator, died Tuesday in Bucharest of complications from pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   In 1990, the Washington Post reported that Ceausescu and his
brother had sold advanced Soviet military technology to the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the village of Scornicesti in southern Romania, he pursued
a political and military career aided by his older brother, who ruled
Romania from 1965 to 1989. The elder Ceausescu was executed with his
wife, Elena, during the 1989 revolt that toppled communism.</LD>
<TE>   Ilie Ceausescu was a deputy defense minister from 1982 to 1989 and
a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee from 1980 to
1989. He retired from public life after the revolt.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 mourners gathered for Ceausescu's funeral Thursday at
the Ghencea military cemetery in Bucharest.</TE>

<HD>Deals Shift Justice Into High Gear</HD>
<DH>Courts: Plea bargains for lesser crimes help the county
save time and expense of trying cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justice moves swiftly in Judge David Horwitz's courtroom. Under the
fluorescent lights, amid the wood paneling, cases are negotiated,
deals made and guilty pleas taken en masse.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys know that in Division 50, the
"early-disposition" courtroom of downtown Los Angeles, prosecutors
make the best offers and the judge hands out the lightest sentences.
But to get a deal, a defendant must plead guilty before his attorney
has had a chance to thoroughly evaluate the evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Early disposition--more commonly known as plea bargaining--is a
fixture of the criminal justice system. Without it, Los Angeles
County courts would grind to a halt, overburdened by the expense and
time needed to try every case.</LD>
<TE>   But now there is a renewed push to increase the number of early
plea agreements around the county as the Superior Court tries to
close a $57-million deficit. Court officials want to set aside more
courtrooms like Division 50, devoted entirely to settling cases
shortly after the initial arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising Criminal Judge Dan Oki met last week with prosecutors
and defense to begin setting uniform guidelines so more cases will be
resolved swiftly. "If we're able to resolve cases earlier and
quicker, it has extreme benefits for the county," Oki said.</TE>
<TE>   Early dispositions--common in cases of drug possession, forgery,
burglary and welfare fraud--ease courtroom congestion, reduce the
jail population and save time and money. They also allow lawyers to
focus on trying more serious, violent cases.</TE>
<TE>   One case that recently was settled successfully in Division 50 was
that of a defendant who had faced three years in state prison on a
grand theft charge for stealing $200,000 from his girlfriend. In the
plea deal, the defendant received five years' probation and 1,000
hours of service for Caltrans. His girlfriend recovered about $78,000
of what had been stolen, and he was ordered to repay the remaining
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Reluctance to Settle</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the dust from the Rampart corruption scandal continues to
settle, the push for plea bargains raises concerns about defendants
who plead guilty early to avoid the risk of harsh sentences later.
And a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that requires defendants to
give up their right to certain information if they don't go to trial
has made defense attorneys more reluctant to settle cases early.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, plea bargaining can be controversial among
victims' rights advocates. They sometimes accuse prosecutors of
offering lenient plea bargains to felons, including potential
third-strikers and defendants charged with violent crimes. Because
roughly 96% of cases in Los Angeles County are settled before trial,
the majority of felons receive lighter sentences than the maximum
allowed under the law. Often, that means defendants who agree to
plead guilty early are placed on probation instead of behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits plea bargaining in serious felonies, such as
murder, attempted murder, rape or kidnapping. But the law allows for
exceptions if there isn't enough evidence to prove a case, if the
sentence would not be substantially different or if testimony of a
key witness is not secure.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Armando Garcia, a Catholic school math teacher who
pleaded guilty to sexually abusing seven boys, was handled through
the downtown early-disposition court. Though Garcia faced the
possibility of life in state prison, the district attorney's office
offered him a deal of one year in county jail. Deputy Dist. Atty.
Steve Katz said at the time a trial would have been risky because
some of the victims were "extremely uncomfortable" about testifying.</TE>
<TE>   Horwitz sentenced Garcia to county jail, ordered him to register
as a sex offender and allowed him two weeks to surrender. When that
date came, Garcia didn't show up in court and the judge issued a
warrant for his arrest. Police are still looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office filed 56,405
felony complaints and secured indictments of 39 defendants last year.
With only 275 criminal courtrooms in the county, attorneys and judges
have to decide which cases to negotiate and which to try. Only 2,206
defendants had jury trials last year.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the cases settled downtown in 2001 were not resolved
until the preliminary hearing stage, when a judge determines after a
mini-trial whether there is enough evidence for the accused to be
tried. At that point, police officers have already issued subpoenas
to witnesses, attorneys have prepared their cases, and defendants
have spent weeks--or months--behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge expense and inconvenience for law enforcement," Oki
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest supporters of early plea deals is the sheriff's
department. If more cases move through the system quickly, fewer
sheriff's deputies will have to testify and fewer defendants will
have to be housed in jail and transported to court.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very vested interest in this," said Sheriff's Cmdr.
Rich Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys stress that they will agree to an early plea
bargain only if it's in a client's best interests. That's not always
the case, they said, pointing to the nearly 150 criminal convictions
that were overturned because Rampart Division officers had planted
evidence or lied in court. Many of those defendants had said they
were innocent but agreed to plea bargains for fear that jurors would
not believe them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking people on a daily basis to give up their most
precious commodity--their freedom," said Chief Deputy Alternate
Public Defender David Carleton. "We don't ask people to give up their
freedom lightly."</TE>
<TE>   In the June Supreme Court ruling, justices ruled unanimously that
before the trial stage of a case, defendants are not entitled to
information that could be exculpatory or could be used to impeach
prosecution witnesses. Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley issued a memo last
month instructing his deputies to continue providing exculpatory
information to defense attorneys as early as possible. But Cooley
said that impeachment information should not be given to the defense
until after a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Public Defender Adolfo Lara said the high court's
decision could be a "major stumbling block" to early dispositions.
"If that disclosure is not made, we're operating in the dark," he
said. "We cannot proceed."</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Rules of Court, a judge can impose a
lighter sentence if the "defendant voluntarily acknowledged
wrongdoing ... at an early stage of the criminal process." But
defense attorneys say they often need more time to investigate a case
or to gauge the strength of the prosecutors' evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Cases sent to the early-disposition court generally are ones in
which defense lawyers indicate that a plea deal is likely. Deputy
Dist. Atty. Priscilla Musso reviews each case in Division 50 by
analyzing the facts, contacting the victim and checking the
defendant's prior record. Then she jots down an offer for what she
believes the case is worth. "But it's all negotiable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys read the offers and hammer out deals with Musso.
Then, with the guidance of their attorneys, the defendants decide
whether to accept a deal or take their chances at trial.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of trust is imperative," Carleton said. "It's
extremely difficult to walk into a lockup and say, 'Hi. I'm your
attorney. Do you want to plead guilty today?' "</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Musso sat down to discuss a case with Deputy
Alternate Public Defender Gabrielle Gopin. Her client Ronald Anderson
had been charged with possession of drugs for sale and faced a
maximum sentence of seven years in state prison. Musso offered three
years.</TE>
<TE>   A Good Deal</TE>
<TE>   Gopin knew it was a good deal, because Anderson had prior
convictions for burglary, forgery, grand theft and drug possession.
But she asked for something better--probation and drug treatment,
allowed for some offenders under a new California law.</TE>
<TE>   Musso shook her head. "No, not on these facts." Besides, he's got
a prior record "lengthy as all get-out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gopin nodded and took a deep breath. "OK. I didn't think so. I'll
go back and talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   About 15 minutes later, a sheriff's deputy led Anderson out to a
bench at the side of the courtroom. He had decided to take the deal.
Horwitz sentenced him and sent him on his way. Altogether, Anderson's
case was in the justice system less than a month--a quarter of the
time of a typical felony case.</TE>
<TE>   The key to success in early-disposition courts, Oki said, are
judges and lawyers with experience and the willingness to negotiate.
In July and August, Horwitz either settled or dismissed 569 cases,
compared with the 40 that were resolved in the early-disposition
courtroom during the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   As more cases are sent to such courtrooms around the county,
prosecutors say they need to ensure that they are continuing to
pursue justice, not just churning out pleas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a sausage factory--even though it looks like one,"
said Asst. Dist. Atty. John Allen. "But if we can get to a just
result quickly, why don't we?"</TE>

<HD>Business Leaders, Legislators Call for Reopening of Harbors</HD>
<DH>Labor: Federal mediator tries to break stalemate in
contract talks, but little progress reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND, RICHARD SIMON and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economic impact of the West Coast port shutdown widened Friday,
as U.S. factories braced for more closures and ships loaded with
thousands of containers sought any working harbor to unload cargo.</LD>
<LD>   A federal mediator shuttled between representatives of dockworkers
and management at a San Francisco hotel, hoping to break the
stalemate in contract talks. Negotiators were expected to meet late
into the night Friday and through the weekend, but said progress had
been very slow.</LD>
<LD>   A growing chorus of legislators and business groups urged both
sides to call a truce and reopen the ports during negotiations.
Pressure also increased on President Bush to invoke the Taft-Hartley
Act, which would force the ports open for an 80-day cooling-off
period.</LD>
<TE>   The 29 commercial ports from San Diego to Seattle were closed
indefinitely Sunday after employers said a series of union slowdowns
had cut productivity by more than half.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, said it was more cost-effective to cease all
operations than to run the ports at diminished capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents
10,500 dockworkers on the West Coast, said it was eager to return to
work, but has refused to extend its expired contract, which would
prohibit the union from staging further slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. said it must have a new contract or an
extension of the old contract before it will reopen the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "I seriously doubt a contract extension will be signed, but that's
not needed to get the ports moving again," union spokesman Steve
Stallone said. "All they need to do is open the gates."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Maritime Assn. spokesman Steve Sugerman responded: "The
last time we opened the gates without a contract, we had a 54%
reduction in productivity coast-wide. All the union needs to do is
make one stroke of a pen on a contract and the gates open."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been in contract negotiations for nearly five
months but have deadlocked on the introduction of labor-saving
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Employers on Friday agreed to allow ships bound for Alaska to be
loaded with critically needed supplies. The union called on the
association to make the same exception for Hawaii-bound cargo.
Sugerman said the association was seriously considering granting that
request.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, representatives of the National Assn. of
Manufacturers met with Bush economic advisor Lawrence Lindsay to
lobby for federal intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to reinforce the message that the impact is already
severe, and it's going to get worse very quickly," said William
Primosch, director of international business policy for the group.</TE>
<TE>   The association polled its 1,400 members on the shutdown's impact
Friday morning, and had already heard from nearly 200 by the end of
the day. Of those, 7% said they have already begun shutting down
operations. Another 27% said they planned to do so if the dispute is
not resolved next week, and another 28% said they would within three
weeks, Primosch said.</TE>
<TE>   He said retailers and manufacturers hoped Democratic legislators
could convince the longshore union to sign an extension of the
contract, which he said would be preferable to forcing a reopening
through Taft-Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   In order to use the act, Bush would first have to appoint a board
of inquiry to determine whether the closing of the ports is causing
serious harm to the nation's economy. He could then seek an
injunction forcing the ports to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   The act was last invoked, unsuccessfully, by President Carter in
an attempt to end a strike by coal miners. In 1971, Taft-Hartley was
used to force West Coast longshore workers to temporarily end a
three-month strike. But the strike resumed when the 80-day
cooling-off period ended.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO has lobbied strongly against using Taft-Hartley,
arguing that both parties should be left solve their differences at
the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups said the economic toll would grow exponentially if
the ports did not reopen by Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to express the angst over this issue," said
Robin Lanier, director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which
represents retailers and manufacturers who use the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "And people are ever more frustrated with the White House. We need
to see some leadership on this issue."</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokeswoman said late Friday that the administration
is continuing to monitor the lockout, but planned no immediate
action.</TE>
<TE>   At least 94 container vessels waited to be unloaded at the ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the world's third-largest harbor
complex, according to the Marine Exchange. About 40 of the ships were
berthed in the ports, with the remainder anchored in outlying waters.
More than 20 cargo ships have been diverted from the Los Angeles-Long
Beach complex since the lockout began Sunday, including an Evergreen
container ship that was sent to Panama to be unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Kleist, a corporate advisor for the giant Taiwanese line,
said the decision will free up the vessel for other customers in
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping lines are concerned that if the lockout continues much
longer, major ports on the West Coast will run out of anchorages. In
Los Angeles and Long Beach alone, about 50 cargo vessels are
scheduled to arrive over the next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to put a strain on what we are doing," said Capt.
Manny Aschemeyer, executive director of the Marine Exchange. "We may
have to put out the proverbial sign: 'The Parking Lot is Full.' "</TE>
<TE>   "The scene is totally depressing," Rep. Jane Harman (D-Redondo
Beach) said after flying over the harbor in a Coast Guard helicopter
Friday. "The parties need to agree to a contract. The gaming must
end."</TE>
<TE>   Republican farm-state lawmakers stepped up efforts to get
President Bush involved. Ten GOP senators, including Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), introduced a resolution urging the two
parties to enter into mediation while adopting 24-hour extensions of
the expired collective bargaining agreement. If a settlement cannot
be reached, the resolution urges the president to use the emergency
powers granted under Taft-Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   "Arkansas is already feeling the effects," said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson (R-Ark.), a sponsor of the resolution. "Many of our
farmers, retailers and manufacturers rely on waterborne trade to
survive."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), who also is sponsoring the
resolution, noted that his state's "largest industry, the livestock
industry, depends upon the reliable transport of products from the
West Coast to Asia and globally."</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City region, one of the nation's leading auto
manufacturing centers, faces a shortage of critical parts and
potential disruption to manufacturing operations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses sought other transportation alternatives, such as
expensive air freight, for critical goods.</TE>
<TE>   Available space already is tight because of seasonal increases in
the demand, and since the shutdown started Sunday, air freight rates
have jumped in some cases by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   American Honda Motor Co. said it has started flying critical parts
from Japan to its Ohio facilities, where cars and light trucks are
built.</TE>
<TE>   The New United Motors factory near San Jose, which assembles
General Motors and Toyota cars and trucks, also stated that it would
start flying in Asian-made parts so it could resume production that
was halted this week because of the port closures.</TE>
<TE>   Gardena-based Nissan North America said it will likely stop
assembly at its 6,000-employee plant in Smyrna, Tenn., by the end of
next week if the port lockout continues.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA said it has
furloughed 80 of the 250 workers at its port processing facility in
Long Beach because it cannot bring in new cars for them to work on.</TE>

<LD>Supervisor Tom Wilson on Friday unveiled a new plan to redevelop Dana
Point Harbor that he said would keep its small-harbor image while
moving restaurants closer to the water's edge and creating more
commercial space and pedestrian walkways.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for relocation of the harbor's signature
restaurants, including the Brig, Harbor Grill, El Torito and Harpoon
Harry's, into new marina buildings that would be placed next to the
water.</LD>
<LD>   The move would provide enough space to build a pair of two-story
parking structures that would double the total number of marina
parking spaces to 1,300.</LD>

<LD>Police are seeking witnesses to a hit-and-run accident on the San
Diego Freeway in Huntington Beach in which a motorcyclist was
severely injured by a driver who illegally entered the carpool lane.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Rowland, 28, of Westminster was heading south on his
motorcycle in the carpool lane just south of Beach Boulevard during
the morning rush hour Sept. 26 when a driver in the No. 1 lane who
had been stopped crossed over the two sets of double-yellow lines
into the lane.</LD>
<LD>   Rowland rear-ended the car, which is believed to be a white Mazda.
He suffered major internal injuries.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the car fled, but one or two witnesses chased the
car.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe that although those witnesses didn't get the
license plate number, they might be able to provide details that
would help the California Highway Patrol find the driver.</TE>
<TE>   Rowland is still recovering from his injuries at UC Irvine Medical
Center.</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON--An independent advisory group funded by the U.S.
government has recommended that the administration add India, Laos,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Vietnam to its list of
countries that restrict religious freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department, which compiles the list, has ignored similar
recommendations on Laos, Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan in the past
while denying that the decisions are political.</LD>
<LD>   The advisory group is the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom, created by Congress in 1998 to advise the
executive branch on the International Religious Freedom Act.</LD>
<TE>   The list of "countries of particular concern," updated in October
2001, contains six nations: China, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea
and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the designations say the administration chooses
countries with which it already has poor relations, rather than
antagonize countries with which it is friendly.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration
would take the commission's advice into account but made no promise
that it would act on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always considered their advice very carefully, but we
haven't always put out the same list as they have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, in a statement available Tuesday, said the Indian
government had tolerated severe violence against religious
minorities, particularly Muslims in the western state of Gujarat.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, the statement said, the government has likewise
failed to protect the Christian, Ahmedi and Shiite communities from
sectarian violence.</TE>
<TE>   "As noted in past years by the State Department, religious freedom
'does not exist' in Saudi Arabia," the statement added, citing the
ban on non-Muslim religious expression in public and the detention,
arrest and deportation of Christian workers.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Vietnam, it said the government was repressive
toward all religions. It imprisons religious dissidents and harasses
clergy and the leaders and followers of unregistered religious
groups, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission said it was "very concerned" about violations of
religious freedom in Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria and Uzbekistan and
suggested that they go on a new "watch list."</TE>

<HD>Mother Teresa a Step Nearer Beatification</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VATICAN CITY--Mother Teresa moved a step closer to beatification this
week when a Vatican committee approved a reported miracle attributed
to the late Roman Catholic nun, church officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Beatification is the last formal step before sainthood. After a
candidate has been beatified, the church must approve reports of a
second miracle before the person can be declared a saint.</LD>
<LD>   The first miracle, according to the Vatican panel that handles the
process leading to sainthood, involved an Indian woman in her 30s who
was cured of a stomach tumor because of the intercession of Mother
Teresa.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very grateful to God for this wonderful grace, and we are
very joyful," said Sister Nirmala, head of the order founded by
Mother Teresa, the Missionaries of Charity, based in Calcutta.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II must still give formal approval, a step not
expected before December. After that, a date would be set for her
beatification, but this could not take place before spring, a Vatican
official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   After Mother Teresa died in 1997 at age 87, the pope waived the
customary five-year waiting period to start the procedures that can
lead to sainthood.</TE>

<LD>BALTIMORE--A report issued by Cardinal William Keeler naming all area
priests who he said have been the object of credible sex abuse
allegations over seven decades has provoked criticism from some Roman
Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter last week to all parishioners, Keeler named 57 accused
priests, none of them currently in active ministry. All cases were
reported to civil authorities, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Keeler did not name 26 other accused priests who are dead and
could not reply to charges. Of all those accused--dead and alive--41
were priests of the archdiocese and 42 were members of religious
orders or priests from other dioceses working in the area.</LD>
<TE>   Some Baltimore priests, and church and civil authorities
elsewhere, questioned naming accused priests who have not been
investigated by police or convicted of crimes. Keeler said the names
were released to encourage other victims to come forward and receive
treatment.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Let Clergy Back Candidates Is Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The House rejected a bill Wednesday that would have let
religious leaders endorse political candidates without endangering
their organization's tax-exempt status.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which caused splits among religious groups and inside
the Republican Party, was defeated 239 to 178. Forty-six Republicans
joined with Democrats to defeat the bill. Its main sponsor, Rep.
Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), told lawmakers he will try again next year.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation would have removed a rule adopted by Congress in
1954 that bans churches and other tax-exempt groups from engaging in
partisan politics. Under current law, clergy are free to speak out on
moral issues and conduct voter registration drives, but churches
cannot endorse individual candidates if they want to keep their tax
exemptions.</LD>
<TE>   "This debate was long overdue," Jones said. "We've raised the flag
on this issue, and that was my goal."</TE>
<TE>   Defending the bill, Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Ill.) said: "Religious
organizations are the moral compass for tens of millions of
Americans, and I have no qualms about their leaders articulating the
pros and cons of a particular candidate for office."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) said the bill would "erode
the separation of church and state, a bedrock value of our nation,"
and probably enable big-money donors to funnel funds through
churches.</TE>
<TE>   Another opponent, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), said the bill would
lead to a situation in which "you could have a minister coming into a
pulpit and saying vote for so and so because God told me."</TE>
<TE>   The bill was supported by such groups as the Christian Coalition,
the Family Research Council and the Assn. of Christian Schools
International, but was opposed by other religious organizations.</TE>

<HD>Church to Revisit Rules on Handling Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's largest Presbyterian church will consider reforming how
it handles sexual abuse cases after a report said a serial molester
might have been stopped if officials had intervened.</LD>
<LD>   The Presbyterian Church (USA) released a 173-page report this week
detailing the sexual abuse of at least 22 women and girls by a former
missionary in the Congo. The focus of the investigation died in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   A church-sponsored Independent Committee of Inquiry focused on
abuse allegations between 1946 and 1978, but the abuse continued as
late as 1985, when the minister worked at the prominent Highland Park
Presbyterian Church in the Dallas area.</LD>
<TE>   The panel found at least 48 instances of abuse, some occurring
while the girls were sick in bed or while the minister's wife was in
the next room. Victims also accused the wife of "harassing" them and
urging them to drop their claims.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations were filed against the minister by eight victims in
1998. Church leaders formed the five-member panel soon after, but he
died before any criminal or church charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recommended 30 changes in the church policy,
including requiring church employees to report knowledge of abuse,
requiring any adult found guilty of abuse to be "summarily dismissed"
from missionary service, possible restitution for victims and a
toll-free hotline to report abuse.</TE>

<LD>VATICAN CITY--Pope John Paul II assigned Cardinal Francis Arinze to a
key post with authority over liturgy this week in a reshuffle of the
Vatican Curia.</LD>
<LD>   The Vatican announced that John Paul has named the Nigerian-born
Arinze, 69, to serve as prefect of the Congregation for Divine
Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Arinze has been
mentioned frequently as a possible successor to John Paul, and the
new post could be seen as enhancing his qualifications.</LD>
<LD>   As prefect, Arinze will rule on questions dealing with the
sacraments and other elements of the liturgy and will oversee
committees that consider nullifying or granting dispensations from
the ordinations of deacons and priests. Arinze replaced Cardinal
Jorge Medina Estevez of Chile, who has passed the retirement age of
75.</LD>

faith-based and community agencies.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded $30 million
in grants to religious organizations this week, the second round of
allocations made as part of President Bush's faith-based initiative.</LD>
<LD>   The bulk of the funds--$24.8 million from the department's
Compassion Capital Fund--will be shared by 21 agencies. Those groups
will act as intermediaries and provide technical assistance to other
faith-based and community groups, teaching them how to write grants,
manage their programs and train their staffs.</LD>
<LD>   After training the smaller groups, the intermediaries will
redirect some of the federal money to programs aimed at homelessness,
hunger and rehabilitation of addicts or prisoners.</LD>
<TE>   "With today's awards, we begin a new effort to help faith- and
community-based organizations get a fair and equal opportunity to
compete for HHS funds," department Secretary Tommy Thompson said in
announcing the grants Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Only one organization in California received a grant: St. Vincent
de Paul Management Inc. in San Diego. Nationally, the recipients
include such organizations as Catholic Charities of Central New
Mexico, the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Pat Robertson's
Operation Blessing International.</TE>
<TE>   Father Joe Carroll, president of St. Vincent de Paul, said the
$500,000 grant would be used to help train volunteers at six or seven
smaller San Diego County agencies. Then the organization will give
them grants of up to $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the objections a number of us raised in the beginning was
that a lot of small faith-based agencies are well-meaning but not
professional enough to make this initiative successful," Carroll
said. "So, for example, we will train you to run a soup kitchen, and
then give you a grant to actually do it."</TE>
<TE>   His organization, which will match the federal grant with $300,000
of its own, is one of the most active and well-known social services
groups in the state, feeding 4,000 people a day and sheltering 900.</TE>
<TE>   By dint of his colorful personality, Carroll himself looms large
in the world of social service advocacy. Originally from a scrappy
neighborhood in the Bronx, he somewhat reluctantly became a priest,
and for the past 20 years has been a vocal anti-poverty advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it because I thought being a priest would be easy--that I'd
only have to work on Sundays," he deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   In a few cases, the federal grant money was awarded to programs
that already help community groups, such as the National Center for
Faith Based Initiative, a West Palm Beach, Fla., organization that
received $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to help us take more ... training symposiums around
the country," said Bishop Harold Calvin Ray, chairman of the center,
which helps community and faith-based groups form partnerships with
other organizations in the private and public sector.</TE>
<TE>   While grant recipients hailed their awards, not everyone was
pleased. The award to Robertson's organization drew particular
controversy. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the group
did not merit an award because of Robertson's public criticism of
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who exhibits such bigoted views is unworthy to receive
taxpayer dollars," Nihad Awad, executive director of the
Washington-based Islamic advocacy group, said in a statement. "The
White House initiative must not assist, even indirectly, those who
would defame Islam and divide our nation."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, also criticized the Bush
administration's plan to allow religious intermediaries to distribute
public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving religious groups control over public funds is a blatant
violation of the Constitution," Lynn said in a statement. "Under the
1st Amendment, religious ministries shouldn't become an arm of the
government."</TE>
<TE>   Among other demonstration grants announced Thursday were $1.5
million to Emory University in Atlanta, which is affiliated with the
United Methodist church; $1 million to Mennonite Economic Development
Associates in Lancaster, Pa.; and almost $700,000 to Volunteers of
America, a spiritually based organization in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The Health and Human Services Department also awarded four
research grants totaling more than $850,000 for study of the role
that faith-based and community groups play in providing social
services in their communities.</TE>

<HD>Pilgrims Gather for Canonization of Opus Dei Founder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have descended on
Rome to grab a ringside seat for the canonization of Father Josemaria
Escriva, founder of the conservative religious group Opus Dei.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish priest Escriva founded the group, whose name means "God's
Work," in 1928 around the idea that people could be paragons of
holiness and live completely ordinary lives, whether as a banker or a
baker.</LD>
<LD>   "This canonization is the canonization of daily life," Msgr.
Flavio Capucci told a news conference. Capucci was Escriva's
"postulator," arguing his qualifications for sainthood before the
Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints in a process that
lasted for a quarter of a century.</LD>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to formally make Escriva a saint
Sunday in a ceremony in St. Peter's Square. The celebration is
drawing worshipers from Brazil, Australia, Cameroon, Poland and
especially Spain, which was Escriva's home country. Organizers expect
more than 250,000 people to attend the canonization. Officials expect
1,000 from Australia and 4,000 from Chile to attend.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrations, which will last five days, could rival those for
the canonization of Padre Pio, the Italian friar, who drew a record
300,000 people to the square June 16.</TE>
<TE>   As Opus Dei claims only 84,000 members worldwide, most of the
pilgrims will be friends and supporters of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   Those planning to attend the Mass include Lech Walesa, the
Solidarity labor leader who became Poland's first post-communist
president; the vice president of Guatemala; the first ladies of
Ecuador and Costa Rica; and Italian government and opposition leaders</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Escriva's body was moved from the church of Santa
Maria della Pace, its resting place since his death in 1975, to a
bigger church, Sant' Eugenio, to accommodate the pilgrims passing by
the coffin to pay their respects.</TE>
<TE>   At the front of the queue was American Jeff Sattler, who had
traveled from Houston, for Escriva's canonization.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the saint for our day; he's the saint for the workers.
That's us all--you and me," he said, as a woman in a wheelchair
prayed in front of the coffin.</TE>
<TE>   Opus Dei exercises political and financial influence beyond the
church. For many years, its influence was criticized and led to
accusations that the group was a secretive sect.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the order were prominent in Francisco Franco's long
dictatorship in Spain. The order remains controversial in that
country.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the ties to Franco, Capucci said this week that
"Escriva could not prevent their belonging to that executive because
there was no church pronouncement on it, and the hierarchy did not
bar Catholics from this type of choice. The democratic conscience is
a given today, but we cannot look at the past with the eyes of the
present."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Opus Dei contend that the movement was a precursor
to the Vatican II reforms of the mid-1960s because it has emphasized
the role of the laity in the church and upheld the equality of women.</TE>
<TE>   The current pope has shown great favor toward the group, in part
because of Escriva's strong anti-communism. John Paul's spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls, is perhaps the world's most recognized member.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that the speed of Escriva's path to sainthood is an
indication of the changing attitudes toward the organization.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, only 17 years after his death--a record at the time--he
was named a "blessed" of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Barbastro in northeastern Spain near the Pyrenees in 1902,
Escriva was a priest and a lawyer. He spent the Spanish Civil War and
World War II in Spain, then moved to Rome in 1946 to direct Opus
Dei's international expansion. He died there in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Escriva's beatification May 17, 1992, caused controversy, in part
because it came only 17 years after his death, but Capucci attributed
the speed to reforms in the process that John Paul introduced in 1983
and noted that other candidates have achieved sainthood in less time
than Escriva.</TE>

<HD>Former Democratic Official Arrested at Border Crossing on
Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH>Indictment: North Carolina county chairman who vanished
more than a year ago is accused on 15 federal counts. Authorities say
he diverted millions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities in San Diego said Friday that a former
Mecklenburg County, N.C., Democratic chairman, Andrew Reyes, who
vanished more than a year ago, was being held on federal bank fraud
charges after his arrest at the Mexican border.</LD>
<LD>   Agents arrested the former accountant without incident early
Thursday after he entered the United States from Mexico at a San
Diego border crossing, said U.S. Atty. Bob Conrad.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 13, a federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., indicted
Reyes on 15 counts of bank fraud. The indictment remained under seal
until Reyes' arrest, Conrad said.</LD>
<TE>   Reyes was scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate in San
Diego, where the government will request that he be held, pending his
extradition to Charlotte to face the bank fraud charges, Conrad said.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Byers, an FBI agent in San Diego, said Reyes was driving
through the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego when he was taken
into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Three other people--a man, a woman and child--also were in the
vehicle, he said. They were not identified.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Reyes had signature authority over a
client's checking account at First Union National Bank, and he used
that power to funnel large sums of money into his own accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Using that authority, he illegally diverted more than $3.6
million from accounts of his client to accounts he controlled," said
Conrad, the federal prosecutor for the western district of North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "On 15 separate occasions between March 1998 and March 2000, he
transferred amounts in the six-figure range," Conrad said.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 15 counts carries a maximum of 30 years in prison and
a $1-million fine, according to Conrad.</TE>
<TE>   Byers said Reyes had been living in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad declined to say whether any of the missing money had been
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The money came from a First Union bank account of Aslan
Construction, owned by Doug King.</TE>
<TE>   King had previously co-owned a Charlotte building company, United
Building Contractors, where Reyes had worked as treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   King, 50, died in a motorcycle accident near his home in
Hillsborough, N.H., in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, 2001, Reyes told some of his friends he was leaving town
on business. He drove away and was not seen again until his arrest on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes had been bankrupt in 1989, but less than a decade later, he
was a major donor to Democratic candidates, mingling with Hollywood
celebrities and then-President Clinton. In 1999, Gov. Jim Hunt named
Reyes to his Advisory Council on Hispanic/Latino Affairs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Yosemite killer Cary Stayner was a sexual deviant, a
forensic psychiatrist testified Friday, his actions in killing four
people during a murderous rampage in 1999 did not elevate him to the
level of a sexual sadist.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Fred Berlin was called as the last witness in the penalty
phase of the former handyman's murder trial. Closing arguments are
set to begin Monday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Berlin, who examined Stayner, 41, for about four hours on Oct. 1,
described him as a pedophile who was obsessed, and sexually aroused,
by images of children in sex acts that ran like a feature-length
movie through his head.</LD>
<TE>   Berlin's appearance on the stand was the final attempt by
Stayner's attorneys to convince a jury that he should not be executed
for his multiple murders because he was unable to control his violent
urges.</TE>

<LD>A Monterey County judge has ordered state water officials to
re-examine the cooling system at Duke Energy's newly renovated Moss
Landing power plant.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert O'Farrell said state water officials failed to make a
comprehensive review of cooling alternatives before allowing the
power plant to cycle 1.2 billion gallons of seawater daily.
Environmentalists say that process kills a substantial number of fish
larvae and declared the decision a victory.</LD>
<LD>   North Carolina-based Duke and state officials say other, pricier,
alternatives were examined before Duke agreed to pay $7 million for
an environmental enhancement program for the slough.</LD>

<LD>A former altar boy who said he was molested by his parish priest has
filed a civil lawsuit against the Fresno Catholic Diocese and two
churches.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Rocha, 27, accused the Rev. Eric Swearingen, a former priest
at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Bakersfield and St. Alphonsus
Church in Fresno, of abusing him from about 1985 to 1989.</LD>
<LD>   Rocha is seeking unspecified punitive damages from the diocese and
the churches, said his lawyer, Raymond Boucher. Swearingen, who has
been a priest in the diocese since 1987, was out of town and

<HD>Seacliff Residents Could Be High and Dry After Rent Hike</HD>
<DH>Realty: Firm's plan to triple or quadruple rates for the
land may leave many homeowners unable to stay in their oceanfront
houses or sell them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill and Joan Cathcart didn't anticipate spending their retirement
wondering how long they could stay in their home.</LD>
<LD>   After all, their cozy beach cottage was paid off--even if they did
have to pay $930 a month to rent the ground beneath it in the
tranquil ocean-side subdivision of Seacliff.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, they and many of the 49 other families in the gated
community off Old Pacific Coast Highway fear that a massive rent
increase might force them out.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd have to sell at a fire-sale price," said Joan Cathcart, a
retired high school teacher whose monthly rent would go up to $2,910.
"How many people would want to buy here? You'd have to be either a
millionaire or crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the last arrangements of its kind along the Southern
California coast, residents at Seacliff own their homes but pay the
Seacliff Land Co. monthly lease payments for the land they occupy.
Many of those payments will more than triple in January unless a
middle ground acceptable to the residents and the land's owners can
be found.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by descendants of Ventura County pioneer William Dewey
Hobson, the Seacliff Land Co. has rented lots to Seacliff homeowners
for more than 50 years. Homes are just yards from the ocean and
recently have ranged in price from $600,000 to more than $1 million,
according to real estate brokers familiar with the area.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Hambleton, a Seacliff Land Co. partner, said the pending rent
increase simply reflects the real estate boom of recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly everyone is aware of the tremendous increase in real
estate values over the last few years, particularly of oceanfront
lots," he said. "Part of the procedure for adjusting rent is
considering the fair market value of the land."</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1950s, land rents have gone up every four years,
Hambleton said, adding that buyers are told of the procedure before
they put their money down.</TE>
<TE>   But previous increases generally have been in the single-digit
range, residents say. Some who bought their homes in the last year
say they would have steered clear of Seacliff Beach Colony if they
had known the size of the increase that was looming.</TE>
<TE>   Last January, Giles Gunn met with Seacliff Land Co.
representatives before he closed on his beachfront home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told that rent increases would be larger than in the past
but that they would not be disproportionate to the increases of the
past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he and other Seacliff owners received a letter with the
bad news: Rents would triple to quadruple, depending on the
homeowner's lot.</TE>
<TE>   For Gunn, a professor of English at UC Santa Barbara, ground rent
would soar from a little more than $900 to about $3,600. On top of
his mortgage payment, the load would become unbearable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be wiped out," Gunn said. "We can't possibly sustain it."</TE>
<TE>   With Gunn's wife suffering from ovarian cancer for five years, the
couple had poured their resources into the home they call "Recovery
House."</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly doesn't feel like that now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents understand the need for some rent increase, said George
J. Bregante, head of a group fighting the hike. But he said the
amount demanded is so excessive that disclosure of it "has sucked out
our equity."</TE>
<TE>   "We can't sell, and it's difficult to get loans," he said. "We're
basically held hostage."</TE>
<TE>   Leases between the residents and Seacliff Land Co. call for
arbitration to settle rent disputes. As that takes place, some
residents also have conferred with attorneys over possible
litigation. Meanwhile, people like Gary Goldberg, a Santa Barbara
real estate agent with extensive experience selling at Seacliff and
other beach areas, wait.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg was buying a Seacliff home himself when the company
announced the new rents. "I was just as stupefied as everyone else,"
he said. "I was totally blown away."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said he and the seller have extended the property's
escrow period until the lease dispute can be resolved.</TE>

<HD>Secession Would Harm the Needy, New Report Says</HD>
<DH>Economics: Poor would lose services, according to
anti-poverty group. Advocates reply: 'Status quo is not working.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breaking up Los Angeles could profoundly hurt low-income residents
and workers by depriving them of laws and programs that protect them,
according to a study released Friday by an anti-poverty group.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by the nonprofit Los Angeles Alliance for a
New Economy in collaboration with the UCLA Center for Labor Research
and Education, concluded that the secession of Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley would hurt the poor in many ways at a time when
poverty is deepening across Los Angeles. Median household income fell
9% citywide during the 1990s, the report noted, and a greater
proportion of residents fell below the federal poverty line.</LD>
<LD>   Secession supporters countered that growing poverty is one more
argument for a breakaway. Noting that poverty soared 56% in the
Valley over the last decade--almost double the citywide
rate--Laurette Healey, co-chairwoman of the Valley Independence
Campaign, said: "The status quo is not working."</LD>
<TE>   "This verifies our contention that an independent Valley city will
be more accountable to its residents, providing better services for
the poor to turn this trend around," she said in a statement. "The
status quo may be good enough for the downtown power brokers and
politicians, but it certainly isn't helping poor people in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Funded by a grant from Kaiser Permanente, the report drew on
census data, various secession studies and a review of city laws and
programs. Many of the officials it relied upon for information,
however, are outspoken anti-secessionists, including Mayor James K.
Hahn and union leader Julie Butcher.</TE>
<TE>   "The report stands on its own," said Jessica Goodheart,
co-director of research at the Los Angeles Alliance for a New
Economy. "We went to the information sources that we thought would
help us. Obviously, the city of Los Angeles is going to have an
opinion, but I think people should look at the merits of the
arguments in the study."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cities would have substantial populations of
low-income people, according to the study. It says that about 15.2%
of Valley residents and 25.8% of Hollywood residents live below the
federal poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Left Behind," the 35-page report said secession could
destroy years of progressive public policy in Los Angeles, including
rent control, the living wage ordinance, equal benefits for domestic
partners of city workers and protections for renters living in
dilapidated apartment units.</TE>
<TE>   The new cities would retain Los Angeles' ordinances for 120 days,
but then they would have to adopt their own laws. There are no
guarantees that they would keep protections for low-income people,
the study said, and there might be legal obstacles to doing so.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the new cities would, for lack of city charters
passed by voters, be general-law cities, at least in their early
years. They would be bound by state law to numerous restrictions
governing public contracts, zoning systems, finances and housing
codes.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood and the Valley could eventually adopt charters, but the
process is likely to be complex. Amending the Los Angeles charter
took three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Without ... the flexibility that charter cities exercise, the new
city governments face significant legal obstacles in their efforts to
fight poverty," the study said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found that secession could jeopardize the jobs of
city employees, especially those at the low end of the pay scale, and
that it would fracture regional decision-making, leaving in the lurch
those who are most in need of public resources.</TE>

<HD>Critics See Wasted Time in Punishment of Tardy Students</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patricia Cavala's school day had gotten off to a sluggish start.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old said she had arrived just three minutes late at
Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles after missing the bus one
morning. She was sent to the "tardy room" for the rest of the period,
and instructed to write repeatedly: "I will not be late to school....
"</LD>
<LD>   Cavala was annoyed. Otherwise a good student who said she rarely
misses class, she was scheduled to give a presentation on American
heroes during first period history. So, she sneaked out of the tardy
room and quietly slipped into her class for her project.</LD>
<TE>   The tardy punishment is "a waste of time," Cavala said. "You're
not learning anything. It's like a gift. You're in the tardy room, so
we'll let you sleep or talk to your friends."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints like hers are not uncommon from students, parents and
teachers. As a result, the tardy room may soon be marked absent.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt is reevaluating the long-standing tradition of herding
late students into a holding room for the remainder of the class
period. Other schools have dropped the practice altogether, saying
such policies allow students to fritter away instructional time in an
era when schools are held accountable for pupils' performance and low
test scores. The practice, its critics add, rewards bad behavior by
allowing students to avoid classes or tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Having kids sequestered and removed from a class, and put in a
place where they're not receiving an education, is entirely wrong,"
said Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National Education Assn.,
a teachers union. She said other measures should be used, such as
giving students detention during lunch or after school.</TE>
<TE>   Tardy rooms were noted as poor practice in state audit reports
last year on five low-performing Los Angeles Unified high schools
targeted for reforms: Roosevelt, Jefferson, Locke, Wilson and
Fremont. Since then, Fremont and Wilson have closed their tardy
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Joining that trend over the last few years were Colton and Fontana
high schools in San Bernardino County, Emery High School in the San
Francisco Bay Area, Raymond Cree Middle School in Palm Springs, and
other schools in Illinois and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "With the new state accountability system and state standards, I
want them in class. If they're tardy, they have to make up that time
outside of class, on their own time," said Clarence Nolan, Raymond
Cree principal.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan ended the 5-year policy two years ago. Now staff members are
required to call parents or assign after-school detention for late
students.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant principal at Lanphier High in Springfield, Ill., said
budget cuts had forced the tardy room there to close this year, but
she acknowledged that the change had been welcomed by some parents
and students. When the tardy room was instituted two years ago,
students organized a petition against it, and one student's father
wrote a letter to the editor of the local newspaper stating that: "If
he is five minutes late and will spend the day [at school] only to
earn a zero, I will just keep him home for the day to do his
homework.... I want him to go to college, but if he thinks high
school is jail, I don't see college happening."</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, tardy rooms also go by other names, including
"sweep rooms," "responsibility rooms" and "individualized supervised
study rooms." Guidelines vary, but usually a staff member keeps an
eye on students for the class period. Sometimes students are required
to write essays, catch up on homework or copy sentences like "I will
not be tardy" over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Los Angeles Unified School District's 52 high schools have
tardy rooms, including Washington Preparatory, Banning, Bell, Carson,
Dorsey, Garfield, Huntington Park, Marshall, John Francis Polytechnic
and Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   But, in place of the tardy room this year, Wilson hired an
attendance officer to visit the homes of chronically late or truant
students; teachers and administrators now stand in doorways and
hallways to make sure students get to class on time. Fremont has
implemented a tardy policy that includes after-school detention,
parent conferences and suspension for multiple offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Other audited schools in Los Angeles say they are revising their
attendance procedures or reducing the number of students sent to the
tardy room.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in them," said Richard Alonzo, superintendent for
local subdistrict F, which oversees some East Los Angeles schools,
including Wilson. "I don't believe you punish students who are late
to class by taking them out of class." He said the closing of the
tardy room at Wilson would have happened eventually, even without the
state audit.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Kendrick, a representative of United Teachers Los Angeles and
an English teacher at Roosevelt, said he would rather have students
in class, even if they are late, because otherwise they miss
assignments and lessons, and slow down the rest of the class.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are the students in there? They just sit there and twiddle
their thumbs," Kendrick said. "With our students' low scores and low
achievement, we need to have them doing something more productive."</TE>
<TE>   Geri Herrera, director of school services for L.A. Unified's local
district H, which oversees Roosevelt and a handful of other East Los
Angeles schools, said the tardy room is being reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be no need for it in the future, but it is still up for
discussion," she said. "This is the kind of practice we would like to
see eliminated eventually, because we want instruction to be the
first priority."</TE>
<TE>   There are better ways to handle the problem, said Kevon Wells,
principal of the 3,400-student Alvin High School, southeast of
Houston. Wells, who became principal this year, immediately closed
the tardy room.</TE>
<TE>   "Tardy rooms were used by some as a means of getting out of a
class," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some administrators support corralling late students into
tardy rooms as a way to manage excessive tardiness.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Thompson, principal of Leuzinger High in Lawndale, in the
Centinela Valley Union High School District, said tardiness has
decreased substantially in the last three years, since the school
began sending late students into the "guidance room" for the rest of
the class period and issuing a suspension after five offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not our goal to keep students out of class," Thompson said.
"Our first goal is to get them to be on time, and really get as much
learning out of class as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Bin, assistant principal at Garfield High School in Los
Angeles, which has had a tardy room for three years, said: "When
there is a tardy room, you see kids running to class. When there is
no tardy room, you see students slowly taking their time. The biggest
complaint we get is when students say, 'Why, if I am a few minutes
late, do I have to miss a whole hour of class?' My answer to that is
it's not fair for all students who are in class on time to have their
instruction interrupted."</TE>
<TE>   At Jefferson High School near downtown, staff member Jesus Aguayo
supervises the tardy room on most school days. Students must sit in
every other chair. They are not supposed to talk or sleep and must do
some work.</TE>
<TE>   But such requirements are rarely enforced, Aguayo conceded. He
said he is usually too busy marking down which students missed their
classes and filling out passes for them to prove they were in the
tardy room.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, 40 students lounged in the Jefferson
cafeteria, which doubles as a tardy room.</TE>
<TE>   Three girls braided bracelets out of pink plastic strings.
Clusters of students chatted and giggled in the back of the room. Two
students slept with their heads resting on a lunch table, while other
girls shared a bag of Cheetos.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Randall Klarin entered the cafeteria, marching
between lunch tables. He hushed the crowd, separated students from
their friends and announced to the carefree tardy group: "This is not
a party." A girl rolled her eyes. The crowd quieted down, and the
bell rang a few minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Then five teenage boys, who simply didn't feel like going to
class, waited for admittance to the tardy room. "Fifty percent are
repeat offenders," said Aguayo.</TE>
<TE>   One boy plopped down and licked a green Popsicle. Another put his
head down and went to sleep.</TE>

<HD>2 O.C. Dramatists' Napkin Jotting Becomes Proud Premiere
Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When David Emmes and Martin Benson began their collaboration in 1964,
they had a cigar box and a napkin. The box, which held their
fledgling theater troupe's cash, was always empty. The napkin, on
which they envisioned their future, was full of grand ideas.</LD>
<LD>   Today, as the curtain rises on a $19-million, 38,000-square-foot
expansion of South Coast Repertory's Costa Mesa home, the acclaimed
theater's founders are living proof that being successful in the
business of art requires mastering the art of business.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion, designed by noted architect Cesar Pelli, includes a
renovated main stage, still with 507 seats, and a new 336-seat second
stage, with the previous, smaller second stage converted to a
teaching theater. The complex will be dedicated tonight, with public
performances starting next month.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a real Orange County success story," said Bonnie Brittain
Hall, executive director of the nonprofit Arts Orange County. "These
are two guys with a wide range of talents who were able to grow their
business thinking at the same time they maintained their artistic
vision."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes, a native of Orange County, and Benson, who grew up in the
Bay Area, were recent graduates of San Francisco State's theater
program when they sketched out their plan in a coffee shop. For 38
years, they have followed that plan to the letter--building a theater
company that began operating out of the back of a station wagon into
a regional powerhouse known for showcasing original work and
nurturing writers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very naive. But we also had the chutzpah that getting
right out of school gives you," Benson said. "We knew we would
accomplish it, but we thought it would happen in five to 10 years. It
took a lot longer, but it's been a grand adventure and we followed
the script all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes, 63, the producing artistic director, and Benson, 65, the
artistic director, are about to achieve their most ambitious goal
yet. South Coast Repertory's new complex is the keystone of their
$50-million fund-raising effort intended to boost its development of
new plays, including an annual series targeted at families and
children.</TE>
<TE>   "They're true visionaries," said Robert Cohen, a drama professor
at UC Irvine who helped found the university's theater department a
year after Emmes and Benson came to Orange County. "This will let
them do what they do better."</TE>
<TE>   The renovated South Coast Repertory includes 230 miles of
electrical wiring, much expanded shop and backstage facilities,
classrooms and a sweeping 270-foot-long glass-enclosed lobby.</TE>
<TE>   The new Julianne Argyros Stage will allow South Coast to mount
productions that the cramped second theater couldn't accommodate.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a postage stamp," Benson said of the old facility, which
had no backstage and couldn't handle multiple sets or more than eight
actors at a time. "Now, we can take on any play."</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, South Coast Repertory has served as the
crucible for numerous original scripts and award-winning plays,
including Margaret Edson's "Wit," which won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize
for drama. In 1988, South Coast Repertory earned a Tony award for
distinguished achievement in American regional theater.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Donald Margulies, whose "Dinner with Friends" had its
West Coast premiere at South Coast Repertory and went on to win a
Pulitzer in 2000, has been commissioned to write a play for its new
youth series.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than anything, it was Benson and Emmes' idea for the
annual series that intrigued Paul Folino, who donated $10 million--a
fifth of the fund-raising goal. The new complex is named after him.</TE>
<TE>   Folino, CEO and chairman of the board of Costa Mesa-based Emulex
Corp., grew up in a Seattle housing project and saw his first play at
9: Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" changed his life.</TE>
<TE>   "It opened my eyes to a whole other world," said Folino, who is
also president of South Coast Repertory's Board of Trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Folino got to know Emmes and Benson when he joined the board six
years ago and quickly discovered that the pair's skills went beyond
stagecraft.</TE>
<TE>   "They just stand out in the way they balance their creative juices
and the way they manage the business side," Folino said. "They are
able to look out at the horizon, see where they want to go, come up
with a plan to get there and then execute, execute, execute."</TE>
<TE>   A large part of South Coast Repertory's success has been the
ability of its founders to cultivate the support of Orange County's
wealthy arts patrons. They include people like Folino and businessmen
Henry Segerstrom, George Argyros and Broadcom Corp. co-founder Henry
Nicholas III.</TE>
<TE>   For Benson, who is in rehearsals for a play he is directing, every
day is casual-dress Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But he keeps a sport coat and slacks in his office in case he has
to rush out for a fund-raising pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes with the territory and enables us to artistically do the
work we want to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After four years, the effort has paid off. South Coast Repertory
has raised $42 million of its $50-million goal.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a troupe that collected $78 at its first show.</TE>
<TE>   "We're artistic liberals and fiscal conservatives," Emmes said.
"At the beginning, we couldn't spend more than what was in the cigar
box. So we disciplined ourselves to live by our income. I'm proud to
say that in 38 seasons, we've never run a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a real Horatio Alger story," he added. "Only in America
could this have happened."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Public Utilities Commission has turned down the last-ditch
appeals of two community groups that had pressed for changes in the
design of the Pasadena Gold Line light railway.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting closed to the public Wednesday, the five-member PUC
voted against reviewing its May decision that cleared the way for the
final phase of construction of the 14-mile light rail line. It will
connect downtown Los Angeles with Pasadena and is scheduled to open
next summer.</LD>
<LD>   The community groups, from Pasadena and Mount Washington, have
fought for years against the design, saying the mostly street-level
pathway would be a hazard to cars and pedestrians and would cause
environmental damage.</LD>
<TE>   The 3-2 PUC decision means the two groups can no longer appeal to
the regulatory agency, which oversees rail safety in California.</TE>

<HD>John Weitz, 79; Fashion Designer, Writer Served as U.S.
Agent in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Weitz, the fashion designer with the sleek personal style of
James Bond and an unconventional career that began in the Office of
Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA), died Thursday of
cancer in Bridgehampton, N.Y. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Weitz was a savvy businessman who pioneered product licensing, put
his signature on everything from business suits to ice buckets, and
won a Coty Award, fashion's top prize for style and innovation, in
1974. At the same time, Weitz was an accomplished writer of fiction
and nonfiction with an expertise in Hitler's Germany. His men's style
book, "Man in Charge: The Executive's Guide to Grooming, Manners, and
Travel," made bestseller lists the same year Weitz won the Coty.</LD>
<LD>   A slim, dashing figure who excelled at high-speed sports and moved
with an international set, Weitz held memberships in at least a dozen
clubs over the years, including the Vintage Sports Car Club of
America and the New York Yacht Club. The air of adventure, and even
danger, that surrounded him traced back to his early 20s, when he
served in Army intelligence from 1943 to 1946.</LD>
<TE>   He rarely talked about his experiences as an agent, not even with
his family. He had signed a statement agreeing not to discuss any
details before he left the military. Still, in the '70s, when he was
at the height of his career, his friend Albert "Cubby" Broccoli, who
produced the James Bond movies, saw the parallels and told Weitz he
reminded him of Ian Fleming's character.</TE>
<TE>   Born Hans Werner Weitz in Berlin in 1923, he migrated to England
with his parents in the early 1930s as Adolf Hitler was rising to
power. Weitz's father, Robert, was a prosperous ready-to-wear
clothing manufacturer and World War I hero who had been awarded the
Iron Cross.</TE>
<TE>   John followed his father's lead and went into fashion, starting as
an apprentice in London with Captain Edward Molyneaux, a fashion
modernist, in the late '30s. After the war, Weitz went to New York
and designed women's sportswear collections built on pea jackets and
wraparound skirts. Ostrich feather pullovers, leather coats lined in
red, and men's striped shirts as swimsuit cover-ups caught American
women's attention.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Weitz launched a menswear line that he personally modeled
in stores. His body-contoured dress shirts were half the width of the
boxy cuts that ruled men's style at the time. Called the "European
cut," a shirt by Weitz required the wearer to maintain a washboard
stomach, like his. He once declared that a wardrobe should begin with
a navy blue suit. From there, however, it should spin out to
turtleneck evening shirts and race flag-checked socks, preferably in
aubergine and pumpkin. The look caught on among "vertically mobile"
business executives.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a terribly good-looking man who designed clothes for
himself," said Weitz's son, Christopher, 32, a filmmaker in Los
Angeles who made "About a Boy" and "American Pie" with his brother,
Paul, 36. "My father liked sportswear for men who lived an active,
dynamic life."</TE>
<TE>   The same year he launched his men's collections, Weitz married
Susan Kohner, an actress who co-starred with Lana Turner in the 1959
film, "Imitation of Life." Bill Blass was best man at their wedding.
By then, Blass had made his own mark as a rising star in New York
women's fashions.</TE>
<TE>   In their Park Avenue apartment, where the staff included a Chinese
chef, the Weitzes' dinner parties brought together actors such as Yul
Brynner, movie directors such as Alan J. Pakula, and writers such as
Tom Wolfe, who was one of Weitz's best friends.</TE>
<TE>   By 1972, Weitz's earnings in the U.S. alone were $18 million,
stoked by licensing agreements that included housewares and home
sewing patterns. He was a fashion celebrity in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   His licensing business continues, but Weitz withdrew from the
fashion bustle after he won the Coty. He concentrated on his writing
and published seven books, including novels, and several studies of
Nazi Germany under Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years Weitz and his wife spent most of their time in
their home in Bridgehampton, N.Y., a replica of a 1912 farmhouse.
Before he died this week, Weitz asked that his ashes be scattered
over Sag Harbor, near his home.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Susan Kohner Weitz, and his sons Paul and
Christopher, Weitz is survived by two children from a previous
marriage to Sally Gould, Karen Weitz Curtis and Robert Weitz.</TE>

<HD>Convict Captured, Despite New Face</HD>
<DH>Crime: The inmate, 71, altered her appearance to look
younger after she escaped from prison. A tip from a viewer of a
television episode led to the arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>A 71-year-old woman who escaped from a California prison camp four
years ago and disguised herself through plastic surgery was arrested
Thursday after authorities received a tip.</LD>
<LD>   At the time of her August 1998 escape, Astarte Rice-Davis was
serving a 15-year federal sentence for embezzling from her husband's
estate.</LD>
<LD>   James Rice had disappeared from his Virgin Islands home in 1986.
The body of the Contra Costa developer was never found and he was
declared dead in 1988.</LD>
<TE>   Rice-Davis, whose surgery made her appear much younger, had been
featured on several television shows, including "Unsolved Mysteries,"
"A Current Affair" and "America's Most Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   A second "Unsolved Mysteries" episode about her aired in
September, said Jason Wong, task force coordinator for the U.S.
Marshals Service.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a Spokane informant who recognized Rice-Davis from the
episode led authorities to her. She was captured early Thursday as
she drove away from her house.</TE>
<TE>   Her fingerprints proved she was the fugitive, Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   Rice-Davis walked away from a prison camp in Dublin, Calif., near
Oakland. Prison officials discovered during a routine roll call that
she was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Wong said authorities were still investigating what Rice-Davis had
done in Spokane, where she apparently held several jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Wiyrick, a spokesman for the Spokane County Sheriff's Office,
declined to say where Rice-Davis had been living, except that it was
in an affluent part of the South Hill area of Spokane.</TE>
<TE>   Her escape from the prison camp wasn't her first foray as a
fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, 24 hours after her husband
disappeared, Rice-Davis filed a false deed conveying his St. Croix
house and undeveloped lots to her, and significantly lowered the
price to raise money quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, she held a garage sale and sold her husband's
pickup, cement mixer, two 40-foot trailers, furniture and
construction gear at bargain rates, records show.</TE>
<TE>   After her indictment on the embezzlement charges, she fled house
arrest in the Virgin Islands and lived for 18 months under a fake
name in Santa Barbara.</TE>

<HD>Biggest Arms Cache Yet Found in Afghanistan Is Destroyed</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. troops have destroyed the largest cache of explosives yet found
in Afghanistan: hundreds of 500-pound bombs buried in a dry riverbed
near Kandahar, the military said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The cache of 420 air-to-ground bombs was found in the Dori River
channel last month, but it took munitions experts weeks to examine
the explosives and decide how to proceed, Air Force Maj. Steve
Clutter said at Bagram air base, the U.S. military headquarters in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   After evacuating residents, demolition teams used 30,000 pounds of
C-4 explosive to destroy the bombs in a single blast Thursday. Army
photos of the explosion showed a huge mushroom cloud.</LD>
<TE>   Clutter said he was unsure how the troops discovered the bombs or
when they were buried.</TE>
<TE>   Experts determined that the bombs were not stable enough to be
moved and decided to string them together with explosives to destroy
them all at once, Army Maj. Richard Patterson said. Troops warned
village elders about the demolition, and an aircraft was sent to
patrol the area around the blast, he said.</TE>

<LD>Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda said the four center-right
parties to emerge from elections last month with a combined
parliamentary majority have forged a coalition agreement to form a
new government.</LD>
<LD>   With the victory in the vote, Dzurinda and his pro-Western allies
prevented a return to power by autocratic former Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar, which would have killed Slovakia's chances of
joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.</LD>
<LD>   Dzurinda said his Slovak Democratic Coalition would sign the pact
Tuesday with the rightist Christian Democrats, the Hungarian
Coalition Party, and the business-friendly New Citizens' Alliance.</LD>

judge, relieved President Kim, who has governed without a prime
minister since July. Eight votes were declared invalid or

<LD>Nepal's king fired the prime minister and disbanded his Cabinet. It
was the first time since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1990
that a Nepalese king has ousted an elected government and its leader.</LD>
<LD>   King Gyanendra's radio announcement came a day after Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba asked the monarch to postpone
parliamentary elections because of concerns about rebel attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The king called Deuba incompetent and said he was postponing the
Nov. 13 elections and would temporarily hold executive powers. He
said a caretaker government and elections would come soon.</LD>

<HD>Coffee's Bitter Harvest</HD>
<DH>Farmers from Central America to Africa are struggling to
survive as oversupply cripples their earnings. Retail prices have
fallen far less.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER and DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MATAGALPA, Nicaragua</DL>
<LD>Ernesto Alonso has coffee in his blood.</LD>
<LD>   He grew up on coffee farms. He planted the dark green bushes on
steep and shady mountains. He helped workers harvest the bright red
coffee berries. He spread the beans in the hot sun to dry.</LD>
<LD>   And so now, when the 56-year-old looks around the ruins of his
100-acre coffee farm, despair crosses his face. He has laid off most
of his workers. The bank wants to seize his farm. The coffee that has
sustained his family for generations is nearly worthless.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what is going to happen," Alonso said, sweeping his
arm across rows of coffee bushes on a hillside overgrown with jungle.</TE>
<TE>   From Africa to Latin America, coffee farmers like Alonso have been
hit hard by a glut that has sent wholesale prices tumbling to their
lowest levels in real terms in more than 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   The 25 million families who depend on coffee for jobs face an
economic and social crisis similar to America's Dust Bowl in the
1930s. Thousands of families camp out by the side of the road.
Violence and social unrest have soared. Hunger, misery and fear stalk
entire towns.</TE>
<TE>   In Colombia and Kenya, coffee growers have begun planting drug
crops.</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam, which is largely responsible for the glut, farmers
clearing forest land to grow more coffee have clashed with local
ethnic minorities.</TE>
<TE>   In Central America, more than 540,000 part-time and permanent jobs
have been lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people are emigrating because of coffee's low price. We are
living in poverty," said Luis Toledo, a 28-year-old from Oaxaca, one
of Mexico's coffee-growing regions. "Many people have gone to the
U.S., including almost all the young people. There are more jobs in
the north than here."</TE>
<TE>   With coffee prices at record lows for the third year in a row, the
fall harvest promises to be even more bitter.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the crisis has largely been masked by robust retail
coffee sales. The big coffee companies have continued to report
healthy profits. Coffee outlets such as Starbucks have maintained,
and in some cases even increased, their prices for coffee.</TE>
<TE>   But those profits aren't trickling down.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Kanyi, a 90-year-old Kenyan coffee farmer, grabbed his head
in disbelief when a visitor told him that coffee drinkers in the
United States pay up to $3 for an espresso made with Kenyan beans.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see that kind of money here," he said. "If we did, we
wouldn't be poor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a simple explanation for the fall in coffee prices: too
much coffee.</TE>
<TE>   This year, worldwide coffee consumption is expected to equal about
105 million 132-pound bags of coffee. But coffee producers are
expected to harvest 10 million more bags than that. Worse,
coffee-growing countries already have 40 million surplus bags stored
up.</TE>
<TE>   The problem began with the fall of the Berlin Wall. For years, a
worldwide coffee agreement had kept prices artificially high to
prevent the development of pockets of poverty that would be
susceptible to Communist takeover. When the agreement collapsed, the
markets opened up and prices began to vary widely. Countries such as
Vietnam and Brazil sharply stepped up production. Vietnam's output
has soared from fewer than 2 million bags a year in the early 1990s
to 14 million bags, making it the world's second-largest coffee
producer, behind Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The huge oversupply has allowed the coffee traders and big
corporations to offer ever-lower prices to farmers for coffee, but
the savings have not been passed on to the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   The price paid to coffee farmers for a pound of coffee has dropped
75% since its most recent peak at $1.81 a pound in May 1997. During
the same period, the retail price for a pound of coffee in U.S.
supermarkets has only fallen 28%, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The difference has meant more profits for companies such as
Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestle, Sara Lee and Philip Morris, which together
control about half the coffee market. (Despite Starbucks' ubiquity,
the amount the company buys accounts for only about 1% of coffee
purchases.)</TE>
<TE>   This has meant an increasingly smaller share of the profits for
farmers. Ten years ago, coffee-producing countries got about a third
of every dollar spent on coffee. Now, they get less than 8 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have dropped so much that, in most countries, it costs more
to grow a pound of coffee than it's worth on the open market.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The resulting misery can be seen everywhere in Nicaragua's
northern mountains, the heart of this nation's coffee zone.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee dominates daily life here. Great yellow sheets of coffee
beans dry by the roadsides. The mountainsides are covered in coffee
bushes. Coffee exporters, producers or co-ops seem to occupy every
other building.</TE>
<TE>   But now that coffee has gone bust, so has the region. More than
100 coffee farms have been seized by banks. Tens of thousands of
workers are jobless.</TE>
<TE>   Those who suffered most were temporary workers. Many of them lived
on the coffee plantations, in ramshackle cabins with small plots of
land that they used to grow basic food such as corn and beans.</TE>
<TE>   Now, turned away from the farms, thousands have gathered in
makeshift shantytowns by the sides of roads, begging for food, help
and jobs. Plastic tarps spread among trees are home. Huge black pots
filled with corncobs provide stew.</TE>
<TE>   Marilla Blandia, 17, held her 18-month-old son, Ronald, in her
arms at a shantytown about 60 miles north of Managua, the capital.
His head lolled to the side. He was suffering from diarrhea. Flies
covered his face.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have food. We don't have work. We don't have anything,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nicaraguan government has tried to respond, without much
success. Natalia Barillas, the minister for family, recently received
a shipment of about 6,000 pounds of food and aid from the Mormon
Church. She had to ask a friend to use his truck to deliver it.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the kids need food. We know that people need jobs. But
what can we do?" she said. "We are a poor country."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About 8,500 miles away, small coffee farmers on the slopes of Mt.
Kenya tell similar stories.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few weeks ago, Kanyi uprooted half of the coffee plants on
the three-acre plot that his family has farmed for the last half a
century, replacing them with beans, maize and tea.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very painful," he recalled outside his two-room mud hut
facing snowcapped Mt. Kenya. "Cutting down the [coffee bushes] was
like sacrificing something or someone close to you. But we have no
alternative. At least we'll have something to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Low wholesale prices have devastated thousands of farmers like
Kanyi in the coffee-growing countries of East and Central
Africa--Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Burundi and Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kenyan town of Nyeri, where Kanyi lives, farmers don't need
laborers to tend abandoned fields, so unemployment has topped 50%,
according to some government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Wife-beating is up, alcoholism is rampant, and families are
falling apart every day--all because of the problems in the coffee
business," said J.K. Mwangi, a Kenyan official who monitors coffee
trading in the central highlands.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearby town of Meru, dozens of coffee farmers have uprooted
their coffee plants to grow khat, a stimulant popular in Somalia,
Yemen and Ethiopia.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Mungathia, 55, said the khat grown on his three-acre plot
brings in about $6,000 a year--more than five times the amount he
earned from coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a cash business," said Mungathia, who now exports khat to
Somalian communities in London and Amsterdam. "I don't have to wait
for some cooperative to pay me money that will never come."</TE>
<TE>   The crisis has also affected education. Thousands of students have
dropped out or been kicked out of school because their coffee-farming
parents could no longer afford to pay their school fees or buy their
books and uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Kanyi's 19-year-old granddaughter, Virginia Wanjugi, plucked weeds
from the vegetable garden that recently replaced the coffee plants.
Wanjugi was supposed to have graduated from school this summer, but
her teachers withheld her final grades until her family pays $225 in
outstanding fees.</TE>
<TE>   "Coffee money used to pay for my education," she said. "But coffee
has no money anymore. Where do they expect me to get it?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The crisis has become a test of globalization, of the idea that
open markets can lead to increasing wealth. If poor countries with
cheap labor can't make money from a work-intensive crop such as
coffee, then what can they look to as a source of export income?</TE>
<TE>   "When you have countries like those in Central America or Colombia
or those in Africa that are very dependent on coffee, it's very
difficult to just say, 'Wait and see,' " said Nestor Osorio, the head
of the International Coffee Organization. "While you're waiting,
you're going to see social unrest, more drugs being grown and more
people dead."</TE>
<TE>   Solutions are difficult to come by.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone in the industry--from small growers to big
buyers--acknowledges that there is no chance of a return to the age
of price quotas.</TE>
<TE>   The big coffee companies have placed most of their hopes in
persuading coffee drinkers to drink more of the beverage, thereby
eliminating the surplus of beans on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Tonia Hyatt, a Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman, said the company
recently introduced new types of flavored coffees to induce consumers
to buy more.</TE>
<TE>   She also insisted that P&amp;G had passed on the savings to consumers,
noting that the retail price of a can of Folgers had dropped 50% in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts explained that one reason retail coffee prices have
remained high is that coffee companies build in profits to avoid
market fluctuations. As for outlets, the price of coffee makes up
only a small part of the final price of a cup of java.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a commitment to promoting demand," Hyatt said. "That's in
the best interests of the consumer, our shareholders and the
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Others place their faith in the Fair Trade movement, which
certifies that coffee farmers receive at least $1.26 a pound for
their coffee--enough to ensure that bills are paid with enough left
over for education and health care. But less than 0.2% of the coffee
consumed in the U.S. and only 0.9% of the coffee in European Union
nations is Fair Trade coffee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another, related solution lies in following the path blazed by
California wine: improving the quality of coffee, raising consumer
awareness and creating niche markets for specialty coffee such as
organic and shade-grown varieties.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that consumers will pay more for better coffee. And
since many specialty producers sell directly to coffee producers,
avoiding middlemen, more of the profits return to the farmer.</TE>
<TE>   "For too long, we have simply sold coffee. It didn't matter where
it came from. That has to change," said Pedro Haslam, the leader of a
Nicaraguan cooperative of farmers dedicated to producing quality
coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that many coffee-producing countries are trying the
same solution, leading to fears that the high-quality coffee market
also will soon be flooded.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam has not been involved in the high end of coffee
production. The country entered the coffee market in force in the
1990s when lowland Vietnamese farmers from the majority Kinh ethnic
group moved in on lands occupied by hill tribes that have long
opposed the Communist government.</TE>
<TE>   The newly arrived settlers planted hundreds of thousands of acres
of lower-quality Robusta coffee beans, clearing out forest land and
clashing with hill tribe members. On one occasion, a demonstration
turned violent when local minority groups burned five acres of coffee
plantations.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Vietnamese farmers also suffering the effects of the
lower prices, the government has begun encouraging coffee farmers to
shift from low-yield Robusta coffee to Arabica coffee or other
industrial crops.</TE>
<TE>   "Vietnamese coffee growers ... have to lower cost and improve
quality to better compete in the world markets," said Doan Trieu
Nhan, president of the Vietnam Coffee Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of news worries those trying to promote high-quality
coffee. Alfonso, the Nicaraguan coffee farmer, simply shakes his head
when asked about possible solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "In this chaotic situation, everybody has to sit down together,"
he said. "We have to figure out what we are going to do. This is a
potential time bomb."</TE>

<HD>Report Cites Iraq's Recent Weapons Role</HD>
<DH>Assessment: The regime has been producing biological and
chemical arms, CIA asserts. The data mark the harshest U.S. view yet
of Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN and PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies Friday gave their
harshest public assessment yet of Saddam Hussein's weapons programs,
providing fresh ammunition for the Bush administration's effort to
force tough, new inspections on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-page declassified report, released hours before Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell made the administration's case to the U.N.'s
chief weapons inspector, asserts that Baghdad has recently produced
both chemical and biological weapons, and has hidden ballistic
missiles that can travel farther than permitted under United Nations
resolutions.</LD>
<LD>   "If left unchecked, it probably will [build] a nuclear weapon
during this decade," the report says of Iraq. The regime "probably
does not yet have nuclear weapons or sufficient materials to make
any," but Hussein "remains intent on acquiring them."</LD>
<TE>   If Baghdad acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material on
the black market, the report says, "it could make a nuclear weapon
within a year." U.S. intelligence officials say they have no evidence
to indicate that Iraq has managed to obtain such closely monitored
material.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the CIA says in the report that Iraq not only
has a larger biological weapons program than before the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, but that it also may be preparing such agents as anthrax
via "covert operatives, including potentially against the U.S.
homeland." It did not elaborate on the possible threat to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   There were no other such revelations, but the report represented a
hardening of the CIA's views since it last issued an assessment nine
months ago of Iraq's capabilities and the threat it poses. The U.S.
report in part is more strongly worded than the assessment issued
last month by the British government, or several independent reports.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting Powell and other top U.S. officials, chief weapons
inspector Hans Blix said he saw signs that the U.N. Security Council
may be coming together on a new resolution aimed at forcing Iraq to
comply with weapons inspections. Despite differences among Security
Council members, Blix told reporters that he believes there now is
strong support for a new resolution that would provide the framework
for more stringent inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it's not very long to a new resolution," he said. Blix
also said it is clear that "constant pressure" needed to be applied
on Iraq to ensure its compliance.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been pushing for a single resolution that
would use the threat of swift military enforcement to persuade Iraq
to open up quickly and completely to inspections. But Russian
officials have argued that a new resolution may not be needed, and
France is seeking two resolutions so that there would be no automatic
military response if Iraq refuses to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was joined at the meetings by National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and
other officials. The secretary of State agreed that the differences
among Security Council members are likely to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The document released Friday says that since U.N. inspections in
Iraq ended in 1998, Baghdad "has maintained its chemical weapons
effort, energized its missile program, and invested more heavily in
biological weapons; most analysts assess Iraq is reconstituting its
nuclear weapons program."</TE>
<TE>   The report says Iraq "largely has rebuilt" missile and biological
weapons facilities that were damaged by U.S. and British bombers
during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 and has expanded its
chemical and biological infrastructure "under the cover of civilian
production."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, it says Baghdad has restarted production of such
chemical warfare agents as mustard, sarin, cyclosarin and VX. The
effort is probably "more limited" now than before the Gulf War, the
report notes.</TE>
<TE>   But research and development, production and weaponization of
Iraq's biological weapons program "are active and most elements are
larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War," the
report says.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is capable of "quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of
such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, missiles,
aerial sprayers and covert operatives, including potentially against
the U.S. homeland," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq also probably retains a covert force of as many as a few
dozen ballistic missiles with ranges of up to 540 miles, in violation
of U.N. resolutions barring Iraq from possessing missiles exceeding
90 miles in range.</TE>
<TE>   The report also says Iraq has sought to develop a drone aircraft
that "probably is intended to deliver biological warfare agents."</TE>
<TE>   The report gives a more menacing view of Iraq's capabilities than
one provided by the CIA to Congress nine months ago. In a Jan. 30
report, the CIA said that "given Iraq's past behavior, it is likely
that Baghdad has used the intervening period to reconstitute
prohibited programs."</TE>
<TE>   Since inspections ended, "Baghdad has had the capability to
reinitiate its [chemical warfare] programs within a few weeks to
months," the CIA said then, adding that while the germ warfare
program appeared to have continued, it was "more difficult to
determine" the program's precise status without inspections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where the Resolutions Stand</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several resolutions on Iraq are pending before the United Nations
and Congress. Their status:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal: The United States has drafted a tough
resolution demanding that Iraq allow inspectors access to all sites
or face the threat of force. The draft is backed by Britain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The French alternative: France wants two resolutions, one laying
out new regulations for the inspections and a later resolution, if
needed, dealing with consequences for Iraqi noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Status: U.N. deliberations continue on the rival U.S. and French
proposals while the Bush administration explores a backup strategy
for a compromise. The compromise features one resolution demanding
cooperation on disarmament and a second, to be agreed on now but
voted on later, allowing U.N. member states to take all necessary
means to ensure compliance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Congress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   House version: It authorizes the president to use armed forces to
``defend the national security of the United States against the
continuing threat posed by Iraq'' and strictly enforce U.N.</TE>
<TE>   resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Status: The International Relations Committee passed the
resolution, 31 to 11. The full House is expected to pass the measure
next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senate version: At least three competing versions are at play: the
Bush-backed version, another that authorizes force only in
conjunction with the U.N., and an alternative version that would
allow force only to disarm Iraq, not to force ``regime change.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Status: Senate is expected to vote next week. A resolution similar
to the House version is expected to pass.</TE>

<HD>Radio Liberty Loses a Warranty</HD>
<DH>Russia: Putin rescinds a decree ensuring that the
U.S.-funded station, founded to counter communism, can function in
the country. Activists express worry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday unexpectedly revoked a
decade-old decree guaranteeing U.S.-funded Radio Liberty the right to
operate in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The move followed months of Kremlin hints and complaints that the
station was on thin ice with authorities due to its coverage of the
war in the separatist republic of Chechnya and its recent launch of a
Chechen-language service.</LD>
<LD>   But it was not clear what the decision by Putin would mean in
practice or whether the revocation was an opening gambit in a
longer-range plan to pressure the station or actually evict it from
Russia.</LD>
<TE>   The Kremlin said the new decree was aimed simply at putting Radio
Liberty on the same legal footing as other foreign news organizations
in Russia and had nothing to do with its editorial policies.</TE>
<TE>   However, an anonymous Kremlin official was quoted by the Interfax
news agency as saying that Radio Liberty's news coverage has become
biased and selective in recent years and has been particularly
"slanted" in its broadcasts to Ukraine and Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists immediately saw a political message.</TE>
<TE>   "The president would not have signed a separate decree if it had
involved only economic and business issues," Sergei Kovalyov, a
deputy in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told
Interfax.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the U.S. strategy to contain communism, Radio Liberty and
its sister station, Radio Free Europe, broadcast into Russia and the
Soviet bloc throughout the Cold War, providing news, views and
analysis from the West. The Soviet Union and its satellites spent
large sums trying to jam the programs, but without great success.</TE>
<TE>   "We find it hard to understand what implications President Putin's
decree will have for the station's work in Russia," said Andrei
Shary, editor in chief of the Radio Liberty Moscow bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Shary said he had been told by Foreign Ministry officials, who
oversee foreign journalists in Moscow, that as far as the ministry
was concerned, "the decree would not result in any negative
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   According to those officials, he said, Radio Liberty retains its
status as a foreign mass medium working legally in Russia. But he
also noted that the new decree came not from the Foreign Ministry or
Mass Communications Ministry but directly from the president's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Communist Russia's first president, Boris N. Yeltsin, signed
a decree in August 1991 allowing Radio Liberty to open its Moscow
bureau. At the time, he cited the station's service to the cause of
democracy in Russia over the years.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian reporter for Radio Liberty, Andrei Babitsky, was
detained by Russian forces in Chechnya in January 2000 and, in a
purported prisoner swap, was turned over to Chechen rebels. Babitsky
resurfaced later and said his abduction had been orchestrated by
security services to punish him for his critical reporting in the
republic.</TE>
<TE>   Shary pledged that the station would not submit to pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the first and not the last time our station has been
subject to criticism. However, our stance on all issues of principal
importance, including the ones of human rights and the Chechen war,
is widely known. And we are not going to change it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will stick to our guns because we think it is necessary to
terminate hostilities in Chechnya, to begin the process of
negotiations and to stop all human rights violations there. This is
the groundwork of our world outlook, and it will remain immutable."</TE>
<TE>   According to the station, Radio Liberty typically attracts between
2% and 4% of the daily radio audience in Russia.</TE>

<HD>Hussein's Palaces Brimming With Excess and Intrigue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Crystal chandeliers glitter above polished marble floors.
Velvet-covered chairs flank gold-topped tables. Bathrooms gleam with
gold faucets and pink bidets. Brocade curtains drape plush canopy
beds.</LD>
<LD>   Those who have seen the inside of the Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein's many palaces describe a world of opulent kitsch and lavish
excess, rooms adorned with busts, statues and portraits of Hussein
and protected by bullet-proof windows, 20-foot-high walls and guard
towers.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. officials say that eight palace compounds also might
contain evidence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons
development, which Iraq pledged to give up after losing the Persian
Gulf War in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Gaining unfettered access to the sprawling sites is one of the
Bush administration's key demands as it wrestles to win support at
the United Nations and in world capitals for aggressive new
inspections in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite photos indicate that Hussein has dug swimming pools,
built mansions and made other major renovations at compounds that
were bombed by U.S. and British forces in December 1998. The raids in
Operation Desert Fox were launched in part because Iraq had
obstructed U.N. disarmament efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Several defectors say Hussein has hidden secret weapons research
labs and other facilities in the palaces since 1998, but U.S.
intelligence and other officials acknowledge that they don't know for
sure.</TE>
<TE>   "These are gigantic facilities, extremely well guarded, unknown
underground networks with unknown equipment and unknown activities,"
said State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker. "We don't
necessarily know what he's hiding in these things."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts suspect that the insistence on surprise inspections
of presidential compounds is mostly a matter of psychology.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Hussein hides anything in those palaces," said
Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi-born Middle East expert at the Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies, a London think tank. "They
know the palaces will be inspected. They know the palaces would be
attacked in a military strike."</TE>
<TE>   Getting inside is "more a matter of psychological value because it
undermines the credibility of the regime. By inspecting palaces, you
remove the immunity of the leadership, and that is a psychological
blow," Alani said.</TE>
<TE>   To some, the push on the presidential compounds is a case of
diplomatic deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Hussein's regime repeatedly blocked United Nations teams
from entering the presidential compounds, saying such searches
violated Iraq's "national sovereignty and dignity." Washington and
London were furious, but Paris and Moscow backed Baghdad in the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis appeared to ease when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
negotiated an agreement with Iraq in February 1998 to permit palace
inspections--but only if Baghdad had advance notice, and if "senior
diplomats" escorted the weapons teams. That agreement is still in
force, but it is likely to be superseded by new U.N. action.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Duelfer, who was deputy chairman of the U.N. panel then
responsible for disarming Iraq, says the 1998 agreement turned his
searches of the palaces into "a circus."</TE>
<TE>   Duelfer said the inspectors had hoped to find "an audit trail,
purchasing documents, presidential directives or other documents"
outlining precisely what Hussein had bought, what he had built, what
he had hidden and more.</TE>
<TE>   But advance notice gave Iraq time to empty rooms of nearly all
file cabinets, documents, computers and equipment, Duelfer said. Even
the furniture was removed from some buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "We surveyed all of them, every inch of them," Duelfer said in an
interview. "After six weeks' advance notice, of course there wasn't a
speck of paper anywhere. They'd taken everything out."</TE>
<TE>   Over an eight-day period in 1998, the U.N. weapons teams visited
the Republican Palace, Kharkh and Radwaniyah compounds in Baghdad, as
well as presidential compounds at Tikrit, Tharthar, Jabal Makhul,
Mosul and Basra, U.N. records indicate. "It was clearly apparent that
all sites had undergone extensive evacuation," Duelfer wrote in a
1998 summary of his inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials portrayed the investigators as bumbling gumshoes,
searching for Scud missiles under Hussein's bed. The presence of
hundreds of Iraqi minders, as well as 20 ambassadors and other
diplomats, didn't help.</TE>
<TE>   The job was enormous. The lush, landscaped grounds cover 40 square
miles and contain about 1,500 guesthouses, offices, warehouses,
garages, sentry posts and other buildings, as well as man-made moats,
fountains, waterfalls and lakes, according to a U.N. survey in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the U.N. teams made progress. They prepared maps and
sketches, using coordinates from global positioning devices. They
shot photos from helicopters and on the ground. They took soil
samples and, in at least one case, examined an underground sewer
system.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ritter, a former weapons inspector who now publicly opposes
U.S. policy on Iraq, says the palace searches were partly based on
faulty intelligence that indicated the regime used Hussein's
residences to produce biological toxins.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard he had 'Special Biological Activity' teams at the
palaces," Ritter recalled. "It turns out that's the food testing
service for Saddam and his family. They test for poison in his food,
his bed linen, his toilets, his clothes, anything the president comes
into contact with."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the Bush administration is particularly concerned
with gaining access to three presidential sites, according to the
State Department.</TE>
<TE>   The first is Radwaniyah, west of downtown Baghdad. It has been
continually expanded since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The site houses 360 individual structures, including four
presidential residences, 225 VIP villas, plus scores of offices,
warehouses, security housing and checkpoints, according to U.N.
reports. The compound is surrounded by a high fence and is heavily
guarded by Hussein's internal security forces.</TE>
<TE>   The second is the Tikrit compound, the largest and most elaborate
of presidential sites. Located 90 miles north of Baghdad in Hussein's
hometown, it includes farms and rural retreats for VIPs as well as
palaces and villas. The facility has been expanded since the weapons
inspectors left in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The third is a new facility known as the Baghdad Al Salam Palace.
It has been built on the site of the former Republican Guard
headquarters, which was destroyed during the Gulf War. Construction
of the facility was completed in 1999, according to the State
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Douri, indicated this week that
Baghdad may be willing to revise the 1998 agreement and let the
inspectors into the presidential compounds. He provided no details,
however.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraqi offers of cooperation make some suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Martin S. Indyk, who was assistant U.S. secretary of State for the
Near East during the 1998 crisis, said new searches of the palaces
are probably fruitless at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had four years to clean up his act," Indyk said. "In a
sense, the palace compounds are the last place we're likely to find
anything of consequence--because it's the first place he expects us
to look."</TE>
<TE>   And the shrinking of computer storage discs and other electronic
media since 1998 may make future searches even more difficult, said
Gary Dillon, the Iraq team leader for the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which led the search for Iraq's nuclear weapons development
program.</TE>
<TE>   Entire libraries, he said, now can fit in someone's back pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam's really as cunning and dangerous as everybody says he
is, do you know how many pages you can get onto a CD-ROM?" he asked.
"Why would he have three wardrobes of paper, when he can fit them on
a couple of CD-ROMs?"</TE>

<HD>China Snarls North Korean Reform</HD>
<DH>Asia: Questioning of tycoon set to govern a special zone
suggests that Beijing is displeased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>For years, East Asia's two Communist countries, China and North
Korea, have characterized their relationship as being as close as
"lips and teeth."</LD>
<LD>   But Friday, observers were left wondering whether the two have
actually been talking to each other.</LD>
<LD>   A Chinese government-backed news agency confirmed that Yang Bin,
39, a flamboyant entrepreneur whose orchid business has made him one
of the richest men in China, had been taken in for questioning in the
northeastern city of Shenyang on suspicion of unspecified "illegal
business activities."</LD>
<TE>   Yang's detention would have been just one more case in the catalog
of alleged economic crimes in China were it not for the fact that he
is reclusive North Korea's choice to bring capitalism to a specially
designated area.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean government tapped Yang on Sept. 23 to head its
new special economic zone in Sinuiju, a city of several hundred
thousand people on the Chinese-North Korean border. North Korea
promised to give Yang, who holds Chinese and Dutch citizenship, wide
latitude in governing Sinuiju's affairs, and Yang, in turn, promised
to usher in a political and economic revolution there.</TE>
<TE>   But his detention fueled already rife speculation that authorities
in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, had appointed Yang without
consulting Beijing and that Beijing was none too pleased by the
choice.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to call Yang in for questioning before dawn Friday
forced him to put off a trip he had planned to Sinuiju later in the
day to hash out details concerning the proposed capitalist enclave.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, named China's second-richest man last year by Forbes
magazine, has been under investigation for unpaid taxes by his
companies, including a Hong Kong-listed firm called Euro-Asia
Agricultural Holdings Co. At an impromptu news conference held
Thursday in Shenyang, where Euro-Asia is based, Yang dismissed the
investigation, saying he planned to turn over about $1.2 million in
tax payments next week.</TE>
<TE>   "That's no problem," he told reporters. "I've already worked out
an agreement about that."</TE>
<TE>   But the displeasure of Chinese authorities was evident. Police
broke up the news conference, confiscating some of the journalists'
equipment and saying the gathering was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   It was another misstep by a businessman with a reputation for
being something of a maverick.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Yang announced that any passport-holding foreigner
would be allowed to enter and leave Sinuiju through the Chinese city
of Dandong on the opposite side of the Yalu River. But interviews
with Chinese sources, including the border police, made it clear that
Yang had not received clearances or worked out the details to enact
such a policy. Foreign reporters who had hoped to cross were denied
permission.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my personal mistake," Yang acknowledged at Thursday's
abbreviated news conference. He asked for patience while he resolves
the matter. It might not be settled until North Korea can erect a
wall around Sinuiju to prevent foreigners from penetrating deeper
into the country.</TE>
<TE>   Yang also said foreign experts would be invited to help run the
special economic zone's legislative and judicial affairs. That will
be a landmark step, if it happens, for one of the most insular and
secretive nations on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is unclear how many of his plans Yang worked out with
Pyongyang. He has bragged of close ties with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il, but it remains somewhat of a mystery how he was picked for
the Sinuiju job.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government has kept uncharacteristically mum about the
whole affair since Yang was sworn in at a Sept. 24 ceremony in
Pyongyang. It has said only that it supports reform in North Korea.
State-controlled media have said next to nothing about the
appointment, which analysts see as evidence that Beijing was taken
aback.</TE>
<TE>   In appointing Yang, Pyongyang said it would turn Sinuiju, a city
of about 50 square miles, into a Hong Kong-like area of unbridled
capitalism with little to no interference from the central
government. But Pyongyang might forcibly move hundreds of thousands
of residents to outlying areas before the experiment begins.</TE>

<HD>Philip Morris Ordered to Pay $28 Billion to Smoker</HD>
<DH>Courts: The L.A. jury's punitive award, a record for an
individual, likely will be cut, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles jury on Friday ordered tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos.
to pay $28 billion in punitive damages to a 64-year-old woman with
lung cancer. The judgment is the largest punitive award to an
individual in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiff Betty Bullock, a Newport Beach resident who also has
liver cancer, contended that the firm failed to warn her about the
hazards of smoking. Her attorneys introduced reams of internal
company documents showing that Philip Morris knew for years that its
products were addictive and hazardous even though the company was
publicly denying that.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris said it would ask to have the award reduced and
appeal the entire verdict. The jury of seven women and five men
earlier had awarded Bullock $850,000 in compensatory damages.</LD>
<TE>   Legal experts predicted that the award would be slashed
substantially by the judge. In any case, Bullock, who is gravely ill,
may not live to see any of the money because appeals could take
years. Although other plaintiffs have won cases against the cigarette
companies, only one, Grady Carter of Jacksonville, Fla., has
collected his judgment. The remaining cases are being appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Friday's verdict is a reminder that even though the
industry paid $246 billion in the late 1990s to settle lawsuits filed
by state attorneys general, the cigarette manufacturers still have
huge litigation problems.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of other cases loom in the wings, and verdicts such as
Friday's will prompt more suits, said Northeastern University law
professor Richard Daynard, director of the Tobacco Products Liability
Project, which encourages tobacco suits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bad omen for Philip Morris," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the bailiff read the verdict, there was a moment of stunned
silence in the small courtroom of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Warren L. Ettinger.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bullock's lawyer Michael Piuze, who asked the jury for an
award ranging from $6.6 billion to $20 billion, seemed surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this verdict underlies the disgrace, not just for the
tobacco industry but for society as a whole for letting this go on as
long as it did.... This is long overdue," Piuze said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they believed the massive award was justified by the
reprehensibility of Philip Morris' conduct during the last 50 years
and the company's profits.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the panel had punished the company so severely, jury
forewoman Jessica Gelson responded: "I don't think it's such a loud
message when you consider how long [the company's conduct] went on
and when you look at the number of people who die each year from
smoking."</TE>
<TE>   According to government figures, 400,000 deaths in the U.S. are
attributable to smoking each year.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Jose Farinas also said he did not consider the amount
staggering, noting: "It's just a year's revenue for Philip Morris."</TE>
<TE>   "We thought about the 50 years of malice and fraud" demonstrated
by more than 100 internal company documents introduced during the
trial, added Farinas, who teaches math at Van Nuys Middle School.
"The documents were very important in that they confirmed that
[Philip Morris] knew" that cigarettes were hazardous and addictive
and that "they lied to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Juror Frank Guzman said the panel had a spirited debate over the
amount of the award, with individual jurors suggesting awards ranging
from $5 million to $100 billion. Eventually, 11 of the 12 settled on
$28 billion, more than the nine votes needed for a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman said the jurors had been told that only 1 in 28,000 lung
cancer victims gets his or her day in court, and the panel in effect
decided to impose $1 million of punishment on Philip Morris for each
of the 28,000.</TE>
<TE>   There has been only one larger jury verdict in a tobacco case: the
$144 billion awarded in 2000 to a class of thousands of sick smokers
in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Because the jurors had voted unanimously in the first phase of the
trial that Philip Morris had acted with "malice, fraud and
oppression," there was little doubt they would render a punitive
award.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Ettinger instructed the jury that it should consider three
factors in assessing how large the punitive award should be if the
jury voted for one: the amount of punitive damages that would have a
deterrent effect on the company; the degree of reprehensibility of
the company's conduct; and that the amount of damages bear a
reasonable relationship to the injury suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Before deliberations began, defense lawyer Peter Bleakley moved
for a mistrial, contending that Piuze had asked the jury to ig- nore
the third factor. But the judge disagreed and denied the motion.</TE>
<TE>   The Bullock verdict was the latest setback for an industry that
for more than 40 years had a virtually unblemished record of success
in litigation, never paying a dime in damages. The industry's primary
defense was that the plaintiffs knew there were risks when they
lighted up and they should be held responsible for their own conduct.</TE>
<TE>   But the tables began to turn against the companies in the
mid-1990s, when thousands of damaging internal industry documents
leaked out and then more were obtained in the course of litigation.
Plaintiffs' lawyers now are able to use those documents to say that
the companies showed no personal responsibility in vigorously
marketing products they knew to be addictive and dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict marks the sixth straight big loss for the
industry in trials on the West Coast--four in California and two in
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Piuze first raised the issue of corporate responsibility when he
questioned potential jurors in the case, and he seized on that theme
in remarks after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge instructed the jury that corporations are to be viewed
like individuals," he said. "We showed that Philip Morris had
personal responsibility" for what happened to his client.</TE>
<TE>   "Betty Bullock admitted that she was partially responsible," Piuze
said, noting that his client, who began smoking at 17, had been urged
to stop by her daughter but continued smoking until her cancer
diagnosis in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Though Philip Morris' attorneys did not deny during the trial that
smoking is dangerous, they focused on Bullock's awareness of the risk
and her failure to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict marked the second time Piuze has vanquished
Philip Morris. Last year he persuaded a Los Angeles jury to award $5
million in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages to
smoker Richard Boeken--an award that was reduced to $100 million by a
judge. Boeken has since died, and Philip Morris is appealing the $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the
Bullock verdict was so large as to be almost "comical."</TE>
<TE>   But Philip Morris executives were not laughing Friday, even though
the company's associate general counsel, William Ohlemeyer, expressed
confidence that the verdict would be dramatically reduced. The jurors
"were instructed that punitive damages must bear a reasonable
relationship to the compensatory damages, and you know 33,000 times
[the ratio of the punitive award to the compensatory damages] is not
reasonable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But industry critic Daynard said, "There is no number large enough
to appropriately punish a company whose reckless pursuit of its own
profits led to millions of premature deaths."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street reacted swiftly to Friday's verdict, sending Philip
Morris' stock to its lowest level since December 2000. Shares fell
$2.91, or 5%, to $36.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. Other tobacco
stocks also fell.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome was a setback for veteran Philip Morris lawyers
Bleakley and Maurice Leiter, both of Washington-based Arnold &amp;
Porter. They tried new tactics in the case, hoping for a better
outcome than in the Boeken case.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Philip Morris--as well as the other cigarette
companies--fought over virtually every blade of grass in court, down
to the definition of ordinary words such as "health." This time,
though, the company presented only one witness during the first phase
of the trial and no witnesses during the punitive phase. During that
segment, defense lawyers chose only to cross-examine a plaintiff's
expert who testified on Philip Morris' wealth, saying its domestic
tobacco unit was worth $24.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors cited that figure when discussing the size of their
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Bleakley conceded that Philip Morris
could absorb a $20-billion punitive award. On the other hand, he told
jurors, it would be wrong to render such a verdict because the
company already had changed its ways.</TE>
<TE>   But that argument held no sway with the jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what their thinking was," said jury forewoman
Gelson. "I think the evidence was so strong it didn't matter what
they said."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict and the jurors' comments "reflect a fundamental change
in how jurors view the industry's behavior," said Matthew Myers,
president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington. "The
companies are being hung on their own words from their own documents.
These cases are less and less about the behavior of individual
smokers and more and more about the cumulative behavior of the
tobacco industry."</TE>
<TE>   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said he saw a
silver lining for the industry in a verdict so huge that it was
"incoherent."</TE>
<TE>   "In a backhanded way, this is good for the tobacco companies," he
said, "because it will force the courts to address the lottery
quality of this verdict and perhaps might force the Congress to step
in and resolve these issues legislatively."</TE>
<TE>   After rendering their verdict, virtually all the jurors went up to
Piuze, his co-counsel Paula Lawlor and their paralegal Ray Goldstein
in the courthouse hallway and congratulated them. Then Piuze took the
jurors to lunch at a nearby restaurant.</TE>

<HD>Bratton Warns Officers to Get With His Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY, RICHARD WINTON and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warning that he will have "very little patience" with those who do
not back his vision for the Los Angeles Police Department, William J.
Bratton said Friday that he already has picked his command staff from
within the LAPD ranks and plans to have the new team in place within
two weeks of being sworn in as chief.</LD>
<LD>   On his second whirlwind day since Mayor James K. Hahn named him to
head the LAPD, Bratton drew clear lines for the 9,000 officers who
will be under his command if he is confirmed by the City Council in a
vote that could come as soon as next week.</LD>
<LD>   His template for change, he reiterated, will be the federal
consent decree that the city signed last year after the U.S.
Department of Justice concluded that the LAPD had for years been
engaging in a "pattern or practice" of civil rights violations.</LD>
<TE>   "If you don't embrace [the decree], if you aren't prepared to
embrace it, put your retirement papers in, because you won't be part
of my command staff driving change in this department," he said in an
interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, the tough-talking former head of police in New York City
and his hometown of Boston, continued a hectic pace of public and
private appearances Friday, accompanied by Hahn--as he has been since
his selection was formally announced Thursday. On Day Two, he
sharpened his criticism of the department even as he continued to
express respect for its men and women and gratitude for the chance to
take command.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an underperforming department," he said. "They know it.
You know it."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, 54, laid out an aggressive schedule of reform for a
department known for its hostility toward outsiders and resistance to
change. His initial assessment of the department's strengths and
weaknesses will be on the mayor's desk in 60 days, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   In blunt comments about the current state of police work in Los
Angeles, he eviscerated whole sections of the LAPD, dubbing the
crime-tracking computer system "a joke" and criticizing the
department's "shotgun approach" to training.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who said he grew to love Los Angeles during the time he
spent here as part of the federal monitoring team for the consent
decree, nonetheless had harsh words about the city, saying that its
homeless and graffiti problems are the worst he's seen.</TE>
<TE>   But he expressed confidence in his ability to effect change. He
said that he had never failed at a job and that he wouldn't fail now.
"This department needs to clearly understand there's a new sheriff in
town," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton outlined a plan for a re-engineered LAPD made up of 18
divisions that essentially operate as distinct police departments
commanded by captains under orders to respond to community needs.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is going to happen--boom, boom, boom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said crime reduction in the city will be driven by an
updated version of the system he put in place in New York City during
the mid-1990s that will help the various divisions work together in
targeting problem areas. Known as CompStat, that system relied on
computer-generated crime data to guide police response efforts
throughout New York City.</TE>
<TE>   He said a system modeled on that approach and currently used in
Los Angeles "has evolved into a bunch of people sitting around the
table shooting the breeze."</TE>
<TE>   Used properly, Bratton said, computer data can provide clear
indications of who is performing well and allow personnel to be
deployed swiftly to crime hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   He also argued that the consent decree should dictate the
technology used by the department, showing the public that it is
getting a professional force, not officers who practice brutality or
racism.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to rapid street-by-street crime statistics, Bratton
said, he will rely on his team of top aides to direct departmental
change.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be bringing in very few outsiders, initially, because I
don't need them," he said. "There's a lot of talent in this
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very good understanding of who's who. I've been here for
a year. It's what I do. I'm very good at it in terms of picking up
personnel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton named several current LAPD leaders he highly respects,
although he declined to specify which positions he has in mind for
them.</TE>
<TE>   He called his longtime friend Jim McDonnell, special assistant to
the chief of police, "an extraordinary person" and praised a 100-page
"plan of action" McDonnell had drafted for the department.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton also singled out Deputy Chief David Kalish, who heads
operations for the West Bureau; Sharon Papa, the LAPD's ombudsman;
and Cmdr. George Gascon, head of the LAPD's training group. All three
unsuccessfully applied for the chief's post.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said that the city's budget crunch has made resources
scarce and that bringing the force up from about 9,000 officers to
the more than 10,000 authorized would not be possible in the short
term.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, during the Times interview, said he too would like to see
additional officers on the street, and he's prepared to find a way to
authorize more overtime if necessary. But the mayor said he is eager
to see what Bratton's planned "top down" assessment of the department
concludes about staffing. Hahn said one of the reasons he chose
Bratton was his history of achieving success without adding staff.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said it is a formula that will work again.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to find where the missing in action are, where the
conscientious objectors are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will rely on his staff to re-energize demoralized
rank-and-file officers. "Once they're in charge, they are the ones
that are going to be able to open those closet doors and [say],
'There's where you have been for the last five years. Haven't seen
you. Come on back in. Let's get back into the game.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he will demand cooperation between specialized units
that should be working together on related problems, such as gangs,
drugs, petty crime and graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD has been fighting those problems independently,
separately. There is no organized crime strategy in the LAPD that I
can find after a year," he said. "There's an organization that is
policing this city as it did in the '60s."</TE>
<TE>   Within Parker Center, tensions ran high Friday as ranking
commanders and others pondered their fate--even as some veterans of
the force said that much of what Bratton said rings true.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so far behind the curve. It's embarrassing," said one
command officer, who asked not to be identified. "The question is,
what does he mean when he says he'll shuffle the deck?"</TE>
<TE>   Others said Bratton will need Hahn's support to ensure that the
department gets more leeway to fill empty jobs in specific divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am down 25 people in this division, and we cannot promote
people from elsewhere to fill those positions," said Capt. Sharyn
Buck, who oversees the Juvenile Division. "It's hard to investigate
crimes when you don't have the bodies."</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the changes [Bratton] plans have long been needed," Buck
said.</TE>

<HD>20-Year Sentence for Lindh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>An emotional John Walker Lindh, protesting that he never intended to
take up arms against America when he journeyed to Afghanistan, was
sentenced Friday to 20 years in federal prison for serving as a foot
soldier for the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing the judge from the podium, the 21-year-old Northern
Californian spoke publicly for the first time about his Islamic
religion, his trek to South Asia and his branding as an American
traitor.</LD>
<LD>   He read haltingly from a prepared statement, repeatedly removing
his dark-framed glasses, dissolving into tears and struggling to
catch his breath during the 15-minute speech.</LD>
<TE>   "I went to Afghanistan because I believed then there was no way to
alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people aside from military
action," Lindh said. "I did not go to fight against America, and I
never did."</TE>
<TE>   His words came during a remarkable 2 1/2-hour hearing that drew
impassioned comments not only from Lindh but from U.S. District Judge
T. S. Ellis III and Johnny Spann, the father of CIA agent Johnny
Michael Spann, who was killed during a prison riot in Afghanistan
shortly after he interrogated Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   After prodding from the judge, Lindh insisted he had no role in
Spann's death. He said he did not plan or participate in the riot
that resulted in Spann being shot through the head several times,
execution-style.</TE>
<TE>   But the CIA agent's father strongly suggested that Lindh in fact
did harm his son and that Lindh's 20-year sentence, negotiated after
Lindh pleaded guilty this summer, was far too lenient.</TE>
<TE>   He also scoffed at Lindh's assertion that he never fired his
weapon as a soldier for the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here as an American and as Mike Spann's father, and I
represent everybody who lays over there at Arlington Cemetery," the
father said.</TE>
<TE>   Glancing at Lindh, and then back at the judge, he added: "I don't
believe the things Mr. Lindh is saying to us."</TE>
<TE>   The judge also spoke eloquently. He hailed the younger Spann as a
true American hero since his death last fall as the first U.S.
casualty in the war against terrorism abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us in America share the grief you bear," he told the
father. "Everyone admires the courage and patriotism of your son. And
hopefully, his death will serve as an inspiration in our struggle,
our jihad if you will, against those who mean to hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   Later, turning to Lindh--who hopes to pass his 20 years reading
and meditating on his adopted Islamic faith--the judge said:</TE>
<TE>   "I hope, Mr. Lindh, that you will have a productive 20 years in
terms of enlightenment. And I do hope you take to heart your
country."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis spoke of the U.S. Constitution and how it had protected
Lindh's rights and afforded him safeguards after his arrest and
through his decision to plead guilty to singular charges of
supporting the Taliban and carrying explosives in furtherance of that
felony.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also stressed that, had the government not admitted its
inability to prove the allegation that Lindh was involved in the
younger Spann's death, he never would have approved the plea
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "This country has many faults, but it has many virtues," the judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped Lindh's assertion that Islam condemns terrorism
was right.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope it would," Judge Ellis said. "I wouldn't worship any
God who promises a bordello in heaven" for suicide martyrs willing to
give their lives for those who espouse terror.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis derided the hijackers who crashed planes into the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon as "the criminals and thugs of 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   He also pointed out that, as part of the plea agreement, Lindh is
to cooperate fully with federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The judge noted that so far, Lindh has told them he knew of plans
for three waves of attacks involving 50 suicide bombers targeting the
U.S. and Israel. The third wave, he said, was to "finish America"
sometime this year.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Lindh has been quite cooperative. But, they
added, they will give him a polygraph examination to gauge his
truthfulness.</TE>
<TE>   When Lindh rose to speak to the judge, U.S. marshals took their
places around him, appearing as impassive as he was tearful.</TE>
<TE>   "To begin, I would like to thank God who has protected and
sustained me," in a voice that hinted of a Middle Eastern accent.</TE>
<TE>   He thanked the court, his parents, the U.S. military medical
personnel who treated his wounds aboard the Peleliu, and "those who
helped bring me home."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "I understand why so many Americans were angry when
I was first discovered in Afghanistan. I realize that many still are.
But I hope that with time and understanding, those feelings will
change."</TE>
<TE>   Then he sought to explain what got him from his Marin County
boyhood to the front lines in the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He said that in May 2001 he was a student of Islam in Pakistan,
having earlier studied Arabic in Yemen. Then "I traveled to
Afghanistan in order to assist the Taliban government in opposing the
Northern Alliance."</TE>
<TE>   Required to take military training, "I volunteered as a foot
soldier on the front lines in the province of Takhar, in northeastern
Afghanistan." He arrived there five days before the airplanes flew
into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon back home.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh saw it as his "religious duty" to assist fellow Muslims
militarily. He defended the word "jihad," saying that "in Islamic
terminology, jihad refers to the spending of one's exertion in the
service of God."</TE>
<TE>   "I have never understood jihad to mean anti-Americanism or
terrorism. I condemn terrorism on every level--unequivocally."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was merely trying to help "an Islamic liberation
movement" in protecting Afghanistan from the Northern Alliance. He
said he had learned of Northern Alliance atrocities, such as
"massacres, child rape, torture and castration."</TE>
<TE>   It was at this point that Lindh paused the longest, the moment he
seemed most deeply overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh also said he "had no real exposure" to the harsh regime of
the Taliban, which oppressed the Afghan people. Saying he only
learned of this harshness after returning to America, he added that
he never would have joined the Taliban had he known. Such oppression,
he said, "I believe is strongly condemned by Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Then he turned to Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "Bin Laden's terrorist attacks are completely against Islam," he
said, "completely contrary to the conventions of jihad and without
any justification whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   "His grievances, whatever they may be, cannot be addressed by acts
of injustice and violence against innocent people in America.
Terrorism is never justified and has proved extremely damaging to
Muslims around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never supported terrorism in any form and never would. I
went to Afghanistan with the intention of fighting against terrorism
and oppression, not to support it."</TE>
<TE>   The judge, under a request from Lindh's family, said he would
recommend that Lindh serve his sentence at an institution near the
family home in the San Francisco area. But he could not promise that,
noting that Lindh's notoriety puts him in harm's way from other
inmates and that the Bureau of Prisons is likely to find it
"problematic" to incarcerate him in California and also protect his
safety.</TE>
<TE>   In handing down the sentence, Ellis described how Lindh was
willing to give his life for the Taliban, but not to die for his own
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is about choices and living with the consequences," he told
Lindh. "You are a bright young man, and you have the capacity to make
good choices."</TE>

<HD>Killing in D.C. Is Linked to Same Sniper</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police also check whether a nonfatal shooting at a
Virginia mall is part of spree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER and JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KENSINGTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>The fatal shooting a 72-year-old man on a Washington street corner
was linked by police late Friday to five random slayings in suburban
Maryland that have prompted an intensive dragnet for a sniper and
possible accomplice who have spread panic throughout the nation's
capital and its suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   Police also are examining whether a seventh shooting at a suburban
Virginia shopping mall Friday afternoon may be connected to the crime
spree.</LD>
<LD>   "People are on edge," said Montgomery County Police Chief Charles
A. Moose. "We're all human. We're all afraid."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities say the suspect used a high-powered assault or hunting
rifle and demonstrated the skills of a trained marksman.</TE>
<TE>   As sketchy details emerged Friday about the shooting spree, police
throughout the capital region continued to scrutinize small, white
commercial vehicles, acting on one of the few tips from the Maryland
crime scenes. The suspects were still at large Friday night and the
public remained on edge.</TE>
<TE>   Pascal Charlot was shot in the chest Thursday night as he stood on
a street corner in the District of Columbia, several miles from the
Maryland attacks. He died an hour later. Bullet fragments recovered
during an autopsy were submitted to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms for comparison with the other cases. The same
high-powered rifle was used in the Washington shooting and at least
three of the Maryland deaths.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a woman was shot in the back outside a Michaels arts
and crafts store in Fredericksburg, Va., while loading purchases into
her car about 2:30 p.m. The woman, who was not identified, was listed
in serious condition Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   ATF agents were examining evidence collected at the scene of the
shooting to see if it could be linked to the others.</TE>
<TE>   The five deaths in Montgomery County left the community of
shopping centers and leafy residential streets, about 10 miles from
the White House, in a state of anxiety Friday. Between Wednesday
night and Thursday morning, the killer gunned down people going about
such routine acts as mowing grass, vacuuming a car, pumping gasoline,
going to the grocery store and sitting on a bench.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on wounds and shell fragments suggested the shooter used a
.223-caliber rifle, firing high-velocity rounds, police said. Many
military and civilian rifles use such ammunition, which can penetrate
bulletproof vests, said Kevin McCann, a special agent in the ATF's
Baltimore office.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement specialists said the lethal efficiency of the
shootings and the powerful weapon suggest the killer might have a
military background.</TE>
<TE>   "It's highly likely this guy is a hunter or ex-military or both,"
said Reid Meloy, a San Diego forensic psychologist who profiles
suspects for the FBI. "It's highly likely he has an intense interest
in weapons."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that more shootings are probable. "When an individual
is not caught, he'll attempt to kill again in a one- or two-day
period," Meloy said.</TE>
<TE>   The spree began Wednesday night at another Michaels store in
Maryland when a bullet whizzed over the head of a cashier. No one was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Dang, that was awfully close,' " said Ann Chapman,
the cashier, recalling that the bullet ripped through the store
window, passed a cash register next to her, pierced an advertisement
and ricocheted off a rack of inspirational prayer books.</TE>
<TE>   One private investigator suggested Friday that such crimes are
typically committed by young men, but that reports of the shooter's
accuracy might suggest someone slightly older, with a great deal of
experience with guns.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some aspects of the crimes suggested the shooter was
asserting at least some self-discipline, said Clint Van Zandt, a
retired FBI official and expert on criminal psychology, pointing to
the hiatus between the Wednesday night and Thursday morning shootings
and their cool efficiency. "These individuals are calculating," he
said. "They know what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt said the proximity of the first five
shootings--clustered within a few miles of one another--suggested the
shooter spends a lot of time in the area. "I would look for
individuals who live, work, have relatives, girlfriends in that
geographic area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meloy suggested that the shooter has experienced personal failures
and has a tendency to blame others. "Unfortunately, he has sense of
that entitlement. That I have a right to strike back."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also suspect the gunman has an accomplice, a theory
based on the account of a witness who saw a small white truck racing
away from one of the crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a man surrendered to authorities in Arlington County,
Va., claiming responsibility for the shootings. He was charged with
filing a false police report.</TE>
<TE>   The family of one of Wednesday's victims, James E. Martin, 55, who
was shot at a store parking lot, released a statement saying he had
been shopping for groceries for his church and for a mentoring
program for students at an elementary school in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Martin was a devoted husband, son and brother," it said.</TE>

<HD>4 in U.S. Held as Members of Terrorist Cell</HD>
<DH>Probe: Arrests are made in Oregon and Michigan. In other
cases, a tearful Lindh says he's sorry, and a defiant 'shoe bomb'
defendant says he isn't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Calling Friday a "defining day" in the fight against terrorism, Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft announced the arrests of four people on charges of
conspiring to wage war against U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, as
so-called American Talib John Walker Lindh was sentenced and
shoe-bomber Richard Reid pleaded guilty to trying to blow up a
transatlantic airliner.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents arrested two men and one woman in a series of predawn
raids in Portland, Ore., and another man near Detroit. They were
identified as members of a terrorist cell who were bent on traveling
to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks to fight alongside the
Taliban army and Al Qaeda terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   In all, six people--five men and one woman, all but one U.S.
citizens--were indicted by a federal grand jury in Portland on
Thursday. The charges, which were unsealed Friday, include conspiracy
to levy war against the United States and conspiracy to provide
material resources and support to a terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.
Each defendant could face life in prison if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   Two of those indicted remained fugitives late Friday and were
believed to be overseas. The others made court appearances in
Portland and Detroit and were ordered held in custody without bail.
One of them, Jeffrey Leon Battle, 32, is a former U.S. Army reservist
who joined the military to receive "training in U.S. tactics and
weapons" that he hoped to later use while fighting against U.S.
troops, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a defining day in America's war against terrorism,"
Ashcroft said at a news conference at Department of Justice
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We've neutralized a suspected terrorist cell within our borders.
We've convicted an attempted suicide bomber. And an American pledged
and trained and captured in violent jihad is sentenced."</TE>
<TE>   As Ashcroft spoke in Washington, Lindh, 21, was appearing in a
packed federal courtroom in nearby Alexandria, Va., to be sentenced
as part of a plea agreement with the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   In sometimes tearful remarks, Lindh renounced Osama bin Laden and
his Al Qaeda network before the hushed courtroom and the judge. He
said he never would have enlisted to fight with the Taliban had he
known it was sheltering Al Qaeda. After accepting full responsibility
for serving as a Taliban soldier, Lindh was sentenced to serve 20
years in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Reid, 29, appeared at a hearing in Boston, in
which the British vagabond agreed to plead guilty to
terrorism-related charges. Reid was arrested Dec. 22 while trying to
detonate explosives packed into his sneakers while aboard a crowded
commercial airliner heading from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an enemy of your country," Reid said, after pronouncing his
allegiance to Bin Laden and Al Qaeda and at times laughing at the
judge and court observers. He could face life in prison without the
possibility of parole when he is sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft and other authorities described those taken into custody
in Portland and near Detroit as committed terrorists who tried for
months late last year to gain entry into Afghanistan and fight with
the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Ashcroft said their indictments bring to 17
the number of people charged in the United States since Aug. 28 with
participating in terrorist plots. In recent weeks, authorities have
arrested men in upstate New York, Seattle and Detroit on
terrorism-related charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a day of justice for the citizens, the soldiers and law
enforcement officers who defend our nation and our values, and defend
them each and every day," said Ashcroft, who appeared with several of
his top deputies and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III. "It is a day
both of victory and a day of resolve, of well-deserved thanks for a
job well done, coupled with a rededication to the job that lies
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day Friday, U.S. authorities and law enforcement
officials overseas searched for Ahmed Bilal, 24, and Habis Abdulla Al
Saoub, 36, also known as Abu Tarek, who were indicted but not
arrested. Al Saoub is the only non-U.S. citizen among those indicted;
authorities described him as being Jordanian, but also a permanent
resident alien in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not say whether they knew the whereabouts of
Ahmed Bilal and Al Saoub.</TE>
<TE>   The others indicted were identified as Patrice Lumumba Ford, 31,
also known as Lumumba; Bilal's brother Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, 22 and
October Martinique Lewis, 25, also known as Khadijah, who is Battle's
ex-wife. Battle is also known as Ahmad Ali and Abu Isa, according to
the indictment. Ford has worked as an intern for two Portland mayors,
according to city officials there.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad Bilal was held without bail after a court appearance in
Detroit Friday, while Ford pleaded not guilty to all charges during
an arraignment in federal court in Portland. Arraignments for two
others were postponed until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Washington, Portland and Detroit said their
investigation was continuing into other suspected members of the
Portland group, particularly at least one unidentified person who
wired some of the defendants money while they were trying to enter
Afghanistan. Authorities also said they were continuing to search for
clues indicating whether the suspects were planning attacks on U.S.
soil, and whether others had also traveled overseas in an effort to
fight with the Taliban. All of those indicted had lived in Portland,
including Muhammad Bilal, who had been living recently with a
relative in Dearborn, Mich., where he was arrested Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The enemy recruits in this country, it trains in this country, it
plans in this country and acts in this country," said Charles
Mathews, the FBI special agent in charge of the Portland field
office.</TE>
<TE>   To date, authorities have found no evidence that the six
defendants were plotting specific attacks on U.S. soil. But there is
ample evidence, they said, that the five males indicted had bought
weapons just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, trained and then
traveled through China, Indonesia and Bangladesh in an effort to join
the Taliban in Afghanistan and engage U.S. troops in battle.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons included a high-powered rifle with scope, a Chinese
SKS assault rifle and several semiautomatic pistols, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   But their efforts to link up with the Taliban and Al Qaeda appear
to have been unsuccessful, and the three male defendants arrested
Friday had returned home to Portland late last year and in early
2002, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Another man identified as an unindicted co-conspirator, Khaled Ali
Steitiye, was recently convicted of fraud and firearms charges and is
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not comment on why the grand jury named Steitiye
as a co-conspirator but did not indict him.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also said nothing about how authorities knew the
men wanted to fight for or with the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and
Ashcroft and other authorities refused comment, except to refer to
the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, when Al Saoub left Portland for
China, he left behind a document titled "A Martyr's Will."</TE>
<TE>   It also said that once Battle was overseas in November 2001, he
sent ex-wife Lewis one of many e-mails, saying "three of the brothers
could have made it by now," referring to their efforts to enter
Afghanistan and join the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Lewis replied to Battle that "the U.S. captured three
[A]mericans out there trying to fight on you know who side" and that
there were 2,000 U.S. Marines now "out there."</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, the five male defendants began
acquiring firearms in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center and Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   They also engaged in weapons training and physical training "in
preparation to fight a jihad," it said.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, as United States troops entered into battle
against the Taliban regime, Battle, Ford, both Bilals and Al Saoub
began to travel to Afghanistan, one by one, in the hopes of joining
forces with Taliban and Al Qaeda troops battling United States and
allied military forces, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   They all purchased airline tickets to Hong Kong with the intent of
traveling to Afghanistan via China and Pakistan. On Nov. 2, 2001,
Battle told his ex-wife, Lewis, that the group had encountered
difficulties crossing the border of China into Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges that on eight occasions, Lewis wired money
to Battle overseas with the knowledge that the money would be used to
support his attempt to reach Afghanistan to fight with Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also said that while he was in Bangladesh trying to
gain entry into Afghanistan, Battle had himself discharged
administratively from the U.S. Army Reserve, "in which he had
enlisted in order to receive military training intended for use
against the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the Portland group began last September
when a resident of Skamania County, Wash., just across the river from
Portland, called authorities after hearing gunfire on private
property. Last December, Skamania County authorities contacted the
Joint Terrorism Task Force in Portland after Mercer recognized
Steitiye from televised news reports of his arrest on weapon charges.
The task force launched a full-scale investigation that led to
Friday's arrests.</TE>

<LD>Soon after Pakistan test-fired a missile, India tested one of its
own, raising fears of a renewed arms race. India called Pakistan's
test a publicity stunt ahead of next week's general elections.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's information minister, Nisar Memon, said India was
trying to "turn this into an arms race" by testing a surface-to-air
missile with a range of about 16 miles on the same day that Pakistan
tested a nuclear-capable surface-to-surface missile with an estimated
range of more than 350 miles.</LD>

<HD>Iraqi Kurdish Groups Set Aside Dispute, to Turkey's Dismay</HD>
<DH>Pact: Hussein's northern neighbor fears a wave of
separatism, but the U.S. hails the peace move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, seen as important allies in
the event of a Bush administration campaign against Saddam Hussein,
took a major step Friday toward shelving decades of fratricidal
feuding.</LD>
<LD>   The Kurdish parliament based in the Iraqi city of Irbil
unanimously approved a U.S.-brokered peace agreement formally ending
more than six years of war between Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan
Democratic Party and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very special day for the Kurdish people," said Iraqi
Kurdish politician Hoshyar Zebari. "It will mean burying discord and
disunity and turning a new leaf of harmony and prosperity."</LD>
<TE>   Reconciliation between the Kurdish factions, who together command
about 50,000 fighters, is good news for U.S. war planners. Signaling
U.S. support, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sent a message that
was read at Friday's legislative session. Powell said the U.S. shares
the Kurds' vision of a "democratic, pluralistic and united Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   However, Washington's enthusiasm is not shared by a key ally,
Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Iraqi Kurds have called independence unrealistic,
Turkish officials still believe it is their goal. The Kurdish
parliament's decision to debate a draft constitution under which the
Iraqi Kurds would maintain only a loose federation with the central
authority in Baghdad is likely to reinforce Turkey's view.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's hawkish military has threatened to intervene should Iraqi
Kurds seek independence, because it fears that such a move would
reignite separatist sentiment among an estimated 12 million Turkish
Kurds. Several thousand Turkish troops who were deployed to hunt down
guerrillas fighting to carve a Kurdish state out of Turkish territory
remain in northern Iraq, even though the Kurds ended their rebellion
after the capture of their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Kurds have controlled a chunk of northern Iraq since their
failed rebellion against the Iraqi president at the end of the 1991
Persian Gulf War. A "no-fly" zone was established to protect about
3.5 million Iraqi Kurds against possible attack from Hussein's
forces. U.S. and British warplanes enforcing the no-fly zone are
stationed at the Incirlik air base in Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi Kurds have succeeded in rebuilding their shattered
region and, after decades of oppression under successive Iraqi
governments, are enjoying freedoms such as elections and
parliamentary representation.</TE>
<TE>   The parliament was formed after Iraqi Kurds held their first free
elections in 1992. But the chamber ceased to function after civil war
erupted between the two Kurdish groups over power-sharing and
revenues from a once lucrative fuel trade between Iraq and Turkey
that passed through their territory.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey froze the trade in January because it feared that the Kurds
were using the money to build a state. Turkey's action had the effect
of removing one of the biggest reasons for the dispute between the
Kurdish factions. Barzani's faction controls the mountainous land
along the Turkish border and therefore monopolized the trade.
Talabani long complained of not receiving a fair share.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's prime minster, Bulent Ecevit, said Thursday that Turkey
hoped the Kurdish assembly would not be promoted as the parliament of
an independent state.</TE>
<TE>   "If they go over the limit, Turkey will take necessary
countermeasures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kurds must not forget that their security remains in our
hands," said a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is the only member of the North Atlantic Treat Organization
that is predominantly Muslim. It played a pivotal role in the Gulf
War and is expected to be a key player if there is another war
against Iraq. But Turkish leaders say their country will not take
part in any action that would result in the dismemberment of Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Clash With Palestinians at Temple Mount</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli police said they fired stun grenades Friday in the main
mosque compound in Jerusalem to disperse Palestinian worshipers who
threw rocks that fell on Jews praying at the Western Wall below.</LD>
<LD>   Police said about 50 officers entered the Al Aqsa mosque compound,
known to Jews as the Temple Mount, a hotly contested site.</LD>
<LD>   They said several dozen youths had thrown rocks toward officers at
an entrance to the compound and some of them fell on the people
below. No injuries or damage was reported.</LD>
<TE>   Leaflets distributed earlier in Arab parts of Jerusalem had urged
Muslim worshipers at Friday services to demonstrate against a U.S.
congressional measure that required Washington to recognize Jerusalem
as Israel's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian witnesses said they heard no chants from what they
called a small number of youths who threw stones. The Al Aqsa mosque
preacher on Friday, Yousef Abu Sneneh, had denounced the U.S.
measure, although President Bush said as he signed the bill Monday
that he would not enforce the clauses on Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Palestinians have protested the act. In the Gaza
Strip, about 3,000 marched through the Jabaliya refugee camp Friday,
and 2,000 others marched through nearby Gaza City.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers Friday shot and killed a
Palestinian teenager. Fifteen-year-old Mohammed Zeid was watching
other youths hurl rocks at an Israeli army patrol in the village of
Nazlat Zeid when the troops opened fire, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said soldiers seeking to impose a curfew were
attacked by rioters and fired into the air to disperse them. It
confirmed that a youth was killed.</TE>

<HD>Bratton's Take on Problems, Priorities in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from William J. Bratton's meeting Friday at The Times:</LD>
<LD>   "Problems with crime and disorder and fear in Los Angeles are not
just murders, not just gang violence, not just narcotics, not just
vice divisions, not just quality-of-life conditions. The problems are
a combination of all of these. Where you have guns, you have young
people. You have young people and guns, you have gangs. You have
gangs, young people and guns and narcotics, because that is what's
feeding it all.</LD>
<LD>   "The LAPD has been fighting those problems independently,
separately. There is no organized crime strategy in the LAPD that I
can find after a year."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding his plans for reorganizing the department:</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be bringing in very few outsiders, initially, because I
don't need them. There's a lot of talent in this organization, like
the NYPD of 1993.... A lot of the talent is farther down in the
organization, but there's some up at the upper levels. It's a matter
of merging the two and coming out with a new talent that will embrace
the consent decree."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the computer-assisted crime program, CompStat, he
started in New York :</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the medicine is the same. It's just the doses or the
combination of medicines you have to apply....</TE>
<TE>   "I want 18 separate police departments. I want those captains, or
maybe commanders, running those divisions to function as a separate
police force coordinated through CompStat, where those captains are
charged with effectively meeting with their community and working on
their particular problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the optimum size of the LAPD:</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows. And you know why they don't know. Because they've
been scared to death to ask how big it should be. It seriously needs
to be bigger than it is."</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Funding in Flux</HD>
<DH>Congress: As funding measures stall, the rail carrier's
future has become more clouded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY TRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As appropriation bills stall on Capitol Hill, the future of Amtrak
and long-distance passenger service has become even less certain.</LD>
<LD>   Three funding amounts have floated through Congress, ranging from
the $1.2 billion the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved to
the $521 million the Bush administration proposed last summer. In the
middle is the House appropriation bill, offering the rail service
$762 million for the next fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   As the full House sets to debate the funding level, such groups as
the United States Conference of Mayors have been weighing in.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the organization of civic leaders called on the House
to meet the Senate committee's funding level of $1.2 billion, saying
continued investment in Amtrak is critical to urban development, the
economy and coping with ever increasing transportation demands.</TE>
<TE>   "America needs a balanced transportation system, and Amtrak is a
piece of that system," Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said. Not
funding Amtrak at the Senate committee's level would "plunge Amtrak
into the type of funding crisis Congress and the administration
narrowly avoided in July."</TE>
<TE>   Barr was referring to the crisis last summer when the government
approved $270 million in loans to keep the trains running for the
rest of the fiscal year, subject to conditions that included an
accounting of assets and finances and monthly financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David Gunn has told Congress he needs a minimum
of $1.2 billion to upgrade track and equipment, repair deteriorating
tunnels in the Northeast and operate current routes.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have taken shots at Amtrak's long-distance routes, the
portion of the service that is the least financially independent. As
a result, the Republican-drafted House legislation earmarks only $150
million to continue long-distance intercity runs. That could force
Amtrak to cut 13 of its 18 long-distance runs, said Rep. James L.
Oberstar (D-Minn.), speaking at Friday's news conference with the
mayors.</TE>
<TE>   Oberstar, ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, said if the House funding level passes, "not only will we
not have a commuter rail system, but our rail will be the equivalent
of a Third World country's."</TE>
<TE>   A number of long-distance routes run through Los Angeles, from
cities including Seattle, Chicago and Orlando, Fla. If Amtrak cuts
the least profitable of the long hauls, most in the Midwest, it means
fewer passengers coming into California from the East.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast and California routes may remain untouched because
of high ridership levels and because a majority of the funding comes
from the state, Oberstar said.</TE>
<TE>   California has formed a partnership with Amtrak that is unique.
Amtrak California uses state money to subsidize the large Amtrak
lines that feed into major cities such as Los Angeles and Sacramento,
and the smaller lines linking smaller cities.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials "like us as a model," said Dennis Trujillo,
Caltrans' deputy director of external affairs. Trujillo lamented any
federal funding cutback to Amtrak and said funding below what Amtrak
needs is likely to result in reduced services in California, despite
state support.</TE>

<HD>Annenberg's Will Splits Fortune Among Family, Charity,
Museum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORRISTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Billionaire publisher and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg left
half his fortune to his family, a priceless art collection to New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the rest to charity, according
to his will.</LD>
<LD>   Annenberg left his holdings in the philanthropic Annenberg
Foundation to an organization he set up in 1992 called the Annenberg
Foundation Trust.</LD>
<LD>   All other holdings not allocated to his family or the art museum
are to be given to his charitable organizations, according to the
will, filed this week in Montgomery County outside Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   Annenberg, who made much of his fortune with TV Guide, died
Tuesday at age 94. Forbes magazine listed him as one of the
wealthiest people in the country, ranking him No. 39 in 2002 with an
estimated net worth of $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg left $10 million to each of four grandchildren and also
gave a total of $17.4 million to three stepgrandchildren--as a favor
to his wife, the will said.</TE>
<TE>   "My father, Moses L. Annenberg, was firmly convinced, and he
convinced me, that family wealth should stay within family lines, and
should not pass to those related by law but not by blood," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But Annenberg said he was acquiescing to his wife's wishes.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Auctions Cattle Seized From Members of Tribe Who Owe
Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Despite protesters and the objections of an international human
rights panel, the U.S. government auctioned off cattle seized from
two Western Shoshone sisters in Nevada who owe nearly $3 million in
grazing fees.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Bureau of Land Management on Friday sold the 232
cattle for $59,262 to three unnamed out-of-state bidders.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the state BLM office in Reno, about 50 tribal members,
state's rights activists and other protesters picketed with signs
that read "Don't Buy Stolen Cattle" and "BLM Cattle Rustlers."</LD>
<TE>   The cattle were confiscated last month from longtime tribal
activists Mary and Carrie Dann of Crescent Valley, who insist that
the land under dispute belongs to the Western Shoshones. Agency range
specialists say the Danns' cattle are damaging federal land that has
been legally allotted to neighboring ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights had urged the government to cancel the sale until
allegations of injustice can be reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   BLM spokeswoman JoLynn Worley said the cattle were impounded after
the government was unable to negotiate a settlement with the sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal lawyers said the U.S. government has an obligation to
adhere to the wishes of the 33-year-old human rights panel, which
found in a preliminary ruling that the Danns' rights were being
violated. Worley said that, although the U.S. considers OAS
recommendations, they are not binding.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time in 15 months that the BLM has confiscated
and auctioned cattle in Nevada for trespassing on federal land
without a grazing permit.</TE>

<LD>Turkey deli meat was one likely source of a listeria outbreak blamed
for 20 deaths and 120 illnesses in eight states, U.S. government
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
and the Agriculture Department have linked at least seven deaths and
40 illnesses to the same listeria strain. The illnesses were reported
in early September.</LD>
<LD>   The USDA said it conducted 200 tests on meats and deli products
after the illnesses were reported in New York, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut and Delaware.</LD>

<LD>An Illinois postal worker accused of firing a pistol outside the
United Nations in New York was held without bail after a prosecutor
said he "threw away whatever life he had" to promote his political
views about North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said in a court document that Steve Kim cased U.N.
headquarters in September before firing a .357 magnum into the air
Thursday. The FBI also said Kim ate very little for two days before
the shooting because he thought an empty stomach would improve his
survival prospects if he was shot and needed surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Kim, 57, a naturalized U.S. citizen from South Korea, was charged
with carrying a firearm and making a violent attack on foreign
officials. No plea was entered.</LD>

<HD>Bush to Make His Iraq Case in TV Speech</HD>
<DH>Public: Address to the nation is seen as bid to garner
greater support for a 'regime change.' No new policy will be
announced, aide says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>As Congress prepares to grant him authority for a potential attack on
Iraq, President Bush plans to address the nation Monday evening in an
effort to shore up public support for a campaign against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The White House's announcement of the speech, to be delivered in
Cincinnati, amounted to a tacit acknowledgment that Bush has yet to
win the unqualified support of the American people in his quest for a
"regime change" in Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   "The country will benefit from an opportunity to hear the
president reflect on the reasons that Saddam Hussein is such a clear
threat to the United States," White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said.</LD>
<TE>   But Fleischer indicated that Bush would neither announce new
policy nor offer fresh evidence in making his case. Rather, he
intends to repackage his previous descriptions of the danger posed by
Hussein, a man Bush repeatedly has warned may use weapons of mass
destruction against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In another mixed signal about the importance the White House
attaches to the speech, Fleischer said the commercial networks would
not be asked to televise it live. It could be shown by the major
cable news networks.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is all but certain to approve a resolution next week
granting the president broad leeway to launch an attack on Iraq, but
polls have found that much of the public is uneasy about military
action that does not enjoy broad international support. As a result,
analysts said it is not surprising that Bush would turn his attention
to the court of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "The president and the Congress are far, way far, out in front of
the public on this," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia
political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Sabato added: "People wonder: Why are we doing this? Why now? Why
this great urgency? Is it just a grudge match? People are very
troubled by it. They don't want to be unpatriotic. After 9/11, they
do want to rally around the flag and the president. But they want to
know why. What does this have to do with Al Qaeda, if anything?"</TE>
<TE>   A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found that, with congressional
approval, 69% of Americans support sending troops to Iraq to oust
Hussein; that percentage rose to 79% if the action had U.N. backing.
But only 59% approved of a unilateral U.S. invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A Washington Post-ABC News Poll found more division, with 47%
opposing and 46% favoring an attack that did not include U.S. allies.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Cook, a Washington-based political analyst, said he is not
surprised by the White House attempt to keep Iraq on the front
burner, especially with just a month left before the midterm
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "If the spotlight is on the economy, Democrats do real well. And
if it's on Iraq, then the president and Republicans do well," Cook
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he added, emerging polls may be foreshadowing a
drop in Bush's job-approval ratings because public concern over the
economy appears to be soaring.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever controls the spotlight will control this election," Cook
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Bush traveled to Boston on Friday to address a Republican
fund-raiser and campaign for Mitt Romney, the GOP gubernatorial
candidate in Massachusetts. He provided a possible preview of his
Monday speech, as he challenged Hussein to honor his pledges to allow
unfettered U.N. inspections and to give up any weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called Hussein "a cold-blooded killer"--a phrase that he
had reserved for members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man who I believe strongly thinks he can use terrorist
networks to foster his own ambitions," Bush said. "This is a man who,
when [weapon inspectors] went into Iraq the first time, it was
discovered that he was a short period away from developing a nuclear
weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Bush added:</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wouldn't have weapons of mass destruction, and that's
what those of us who love peace expect."</TE>
<TE>   But if Hussein does not comply, and if the United Nations does not
act, Bush said: "The United States will lead a coalition to disarm
this man before he harms America and our friends."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his tough words, the president's remarks continued to
suggest some softening of his stance toward Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   For several days now, Bush made no mention of ousting the Iraqi
president, while emphasizing the role the U.N. and a coalition of
countries would play in the push to disarm Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The change in tone seems targeted at gaining wider support for the
resolution pending in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   While congressional support for authorizing military action is not
in doubt, the more lopsided the vote, the more bargaining power Bush
might gain in the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   The president is scheduled to deliver his speech at 5 p.m. PDT
before an audience of about 500 people assembled by Cincinnati's
World Affairs Council, the Chamber of Commerce and the United Way.</TE>

<HD>Governor's Race Draws Bush to Massachusetts</HD>
<DH>Politics: An event raises $1 million for Romney, the GOP
candidate. Polls show competitive battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In Massachusetts, politics seldom brings a smile to the face of a
Republican president or words of optimism to his lips.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, GOP presidents don't generally spend much time in the home
of the Kennedys, a state where the entire congressional
delegation--10 House members and two senators--is Democratic.</LD>
<LD>   Yet President Bush had reason for smiles and optimism on Friday,
as he began two days of campaigning for New England Republicans by
headlining a fund-raiser in Boston for businessman Mitt Romney.</LD>
<TE>   Best known for his direction of the Olympic Games in Salt Lake
City this year, Romney is the GOP gubernatorial candidate against
Democrat Shannon O'Brien. And polls have shown the race is
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   The state's reputation as a Democratic stronghold notwithstanding,
Romney is hoping to keep alive an unusual political trend. Since
1990, when Michael S. Dukakis completed his second term, Republicans
have controlled the governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did his part to keep that streak alive, helping Romney
collect $1 million for his gubernatorial campaign at Friday's event.</TE>
<TE>   Happily referring to Romney as "governor," Bush touted the
candidate's credentials to help the state's economy. Praising Romney
as a "doer," not a "talker," Bush said: "He started his own
businesses, he's an entrepreneur. He knows how to create jobs at a
time when you need somebody in Massachusetts who knows job creation."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the Olympics, Bush said Romney made sure the Games
"were not only successful, but profitable. It's the same kind of
attitude you need here in your state budget in Massachusetts."</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, Romney would appear to be the sort of Republican
who succeeds in Massachusetts. Wealthy, self-effacing and presenting
himself as a political moderate, he is in the mold of the state's
most successful recent GOP politician, former Gov. William F. Weld.</TE>
<TE>   But he is not as deeply rooted in the state as most Massachusetts
candidates tend to be. Neither a Boston Brahmin nor an Irish
Catholic, he is Mormon and son of former Gov. George Romney of
Michigan. He came to Boston for his education, and stayed to make a
fortune in a venture capital firm that helped Staples office supply
store take off.</TE>
<TE>   In O'Brien, the state treasurer, Romney also is facing a strong
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   A former state senator whose father long has been active in
Democratic politics and whose husband is a lobbyist, O'Brien won a
hard-fought primary in mid-September and rode that momentum to a
small lead in recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Beard, director of the John W. McCormack Institute of
Public Affairs at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said that
so far, O'Brien has withstood Romney's initial line of attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Romney is trying to paint her as a member of the old boys'
network, and nobody's buying it," Beard said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her entrenched ties to the Democratic establishment,
Romney's charge "just won't stick," Beard said, because O'Brien's a
woman--one of 10 running for governorships across the country this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, after spending the night at his parents' summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, is scheduled to speak today at a fund-raising
lunch for the Republican Senate candidate in New Hampshire, Rep. John
E. Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   Sununu defeated two-term incumbent Sen. Bob Smith in a contentious
GOP primary and is facing Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who is
completing her third two-year term.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Massachusetts governor's race, polls forecast a close
election.</TE>
<TE>   More than anywhere else in New England, Bush offers political
weight in New Hampshire, the only state he carried in the region in
the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   With the Democrats controlling the Senate by a single vote, Bush
is likely to stress to his New Hampshire audience that a few votes in
the sparsely populated state could have a major effect on whether
Republicans become the chamber's majority party.</TE>
<TE>   Sununu--son of a former New Hampshire governor who served as White
House chief of staff in the administration of Bush's father--already
has driven home that point. He asked voters whom they wanted as
chairman of the Senate Education Committee: Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.), the liberal icon, or New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg.</TE>
<TE>   "The congressman very early made his general election campaign
about that question. And the Democrats are doing the same thing,"
said J. Mark Wrighton, an assistant professor of political science at
the University of New Hampshire.</TE>

<HD>Before the Iraq Vote, a Casting Call</HD>
<DH>Senate: With cameras rolling, Republicans and Democrats
make their case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Democrats opposed to the resolution that would authorize
President Bush to use force against Iraq pushed an alternative Friday
that would require greater cooperation with the United Nations before
a U.S. military strike.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans, meanwhile, continued to stand firm behind the
president as the Senate's debate on the Iraq resolution heated up in
its second day. No votes were taken, but competing arguments were
laid out in anticipation of action next week.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, both houses of Congress are expected to vote for a
resolution giving Bush broad authority to launch, if he deems
necessary, a preemptive strike to quell the threat the White House
says is posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his suspected
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, argued that the United States should take more time to
work with the world community.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said his resolution would authorize the use of military
force against Iraq only in concert with the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "If Congress endorses the use of force even in the absence of a
U.N. authorization, it enables the members of the Security Council to
take a pass on the use of force," Levin said. "They can avoid taking
a tough position on the basis that the United States will act, no
matter what the U.N. does."</TE>
<TE>   Levin added: "If done wisely, we can unite not only the Congress,
but ultimately the world community, on a course of action that we all
seek--the elimination of Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten the
world with weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) said he would back Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein poses a clear threat to peace in the world, to
America and our interests, to regional stability, and to his own
people," Voinovich said. "I am convinced that the threat is real."</TE>
<TE>   Voinovich added: "Saddam Hussein is the neighborhood bully, and
only when neighbors come together and say enough is enough can he be
stopped. He needs to understand that the jig is up and the world must
act now together to protect the peace by confronting this bully."</TE>
<TE>   The debate, though spirited, played out before a mostly empty
chamber. Many lawmakers had left Washington for the weekend, some for
campaigns, some to work in their states and others to attend a
funeral in Hawaii for Democratic Rep. Patsy Mink, who died last week.</TE>
<TE>   The senators were conscious, nevertheless, that their remarks were
being televised. And some clearly sought to rouse viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), an opponent of the White
House-backed resolution, declared: "My office has received 1,400
telephone calls, just today. And almost every single caller has said,
'Wait! Slow down! Don't rush this through.' "</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, his voice rising as he waved a copy of the Constitution in
his hand, continued: "I plead with the American people. Let your
voice be heard.... Let the leadership of this Congress know that you
don't want this resolution rammed through this Congress before
election day. The life of your son may depend upon it. The life of
your daughter may depend on it."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), a senior member of the Armed Services
Committee and former Navy secretary, said Bush needed to be given
authority to use force against Iraq now. "Enough is enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said the war on terrorism should be a higher priority than
action against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "In the constellation of threats to our homeland and our interests
abroad, in my judgment, terrorism represents the greatest and most
urgent security threat to the American people," Graham said.</TE>

<HD>Nominee's Chances Look Slim</HD>
<DH>Senate: Lott concedes that Democrats are unlikely to hold a
vote on a Latino judicial pick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott conceded Friday that President
Bush's judicial nomination of Miguel Estrada, a Latino attorney seen
by critics as too conservative, appears virtually dead.</LD>
<LD>   Bush nominated him to be the first Latino on the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 17 months ago. If
confirmed, Estrada would be positioned as a potential Bush nominee to
the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Democratic aides agreed that the nomination would not
progress, saying Congress seemed certain to adjourn for the year
without the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee even voting whether to
send Estrada to the full chamber for confirmation.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think they are going to bring him up. There has been no
movement at all," said Lott (R-Miss.) in a brief interview on Capitol
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not going to vote on him because he is a highly
intelligent conservative," Lott said. "That's it. Pure and simple."</TE>
<TE>   Lott said that if Republicans regain control of the Senate in the
Nov. 5 election, they would move swiftly in the new year to confirm
Estrada and other conservative judicial nominees blocked by Democrats
over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Senate Democrats and liberal interest groups see
Estrada as another attempt by Bush to line the federal courts with
right-wing ideologues.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and fellow Republicans in Congress argue that Estrada should
be confirmed, noting that the American Bar Assn. gave him its highest
rating.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, a private attorney in Washington, D.C., earlier served as
an assistant U.S. solicitor general.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, just two of Bush's judicial nominees have been formally
rejected by the Judiciary Committee: Charles Pickering of Mississippi
and Priscilla Owen of Texas. But many others have not received a
hearing or a vote.</TE>
<TE>   If this Senate adjourns without taking action on them, the
nominations would be returned to Bush, who could renew them next year
when a new Senate is sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   Lott said that if Republicans do take control of the Senate, "We
would probably, within a month or two, confirm 40 to 50 judges who
have been abused unmercifully" by Democrats. Overall, the Judiciary
Committee has approved 81 of Bush's judicial nominees and plans to
hold hearings next week on seven district court nominees.</TE>

<LD>Bob Graham (D-Fla.)</LD>
<LD>   Excerpts from the second day of the Senate debate on the
resolution that would grant President Bush authority to use military
force against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "We all agree that [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein is an evil man
in a region of evil men.... The latest White House draft of this
resolution attempts to link two challenges to our nation's
security--terrorism and Saddam Hussein. I am not sure that it does so
in a coherent or effective way. And frankly, I fear that elevating
Saddam Hussein to our nation's No. 1 enemy poses risks that we have
not fully considered.... I am concerned that a war with Saddam
Hussein would be waged to the exclusion of--and possible detriment
to--the war on terrorism.... A second concern is that, as a
consequence of the threat to take unilateral action against Iraq, we
have seen a hardening of anti-American sentiment in the Middle East,
which puts U.S. persons and interests in that region in greater
jeopardy."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bunning (R-Ky.)</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old saying here in America: 'Fool me once, shame on
you. Fool me twice, shame on me.' I don't see how we can let Saddam
fool us again. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Saddam
Hussein cannot be trusted. The time for inspections, diplomacy and
delay has passed. It is time for us to act.... I believe this
resolution takes the right approach and addresses their concerns. It
says that we should do all we can to work with our friends and the
United Nations to address the menace of Saddam Hussein. But it does
not tie our hands and preserves our right to act in self-defense....
I do not believe that in the end you can negotiate with a madman.
Sooner or later, we're going to have to act, and we should pass this
resolution to give the president every tool at his disposal to
prevail in this struggle with evil."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carl Levin (D-Mich.)</TE>
<TE>   "Whether we commit our forces to attack Iraq as part of a United
Nations-authorized coalition, or whether we go it alone, could have
immense consequences for our security and for future peace and
stability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and beyond. That's
why I will be introducing an alternative resolution.... The
resolution I will be introducing is consistent with how I think most
Americans want us to proceed. It emphasizes the importance of dealing
with Iraq on a multilateral basis, and it withholds judgment at this
time on the question of whether or not the United States should go it
alone."</TE>

<HD>Tobacco Companies Prevail in Secondhand Smoke Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., Philip Morris Cos. and other
cigarette makers won a jury decision Friday that a former flight
attendant's breathing problems were not caused by exposure to
secondhand smoke on airliners.</LD>
<LD>   A state court jury in Miami decided that the chronic sinusitis
suffered by plaintiff Julia Tucker, a former US Airways Group Inc.
flight attendant, was not caused by her years of working for the
airline.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, defendants
included British American Tobacco Plc's Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp. and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co.</LD>
<TE>   "Credible evidence does not exist to show that secondhand smoke
causes chronic sinusitis in nonsmokers, even at the highest levels
likely to be encountered in real-world environments," said Douglas
Chumbley, R.J. Reynolds' trial attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors would have been barred from awarding punitive damages in
the case based on a 1997 settlement of class-action claims by flight
attendants. That $350-million settlement allowed individual suits
seeking compensatory damages to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement didn't provide money to the plaintiffs. Instead, it
financed health research and paid attorneys' fees, and also gave
plaintiffs legal leverage for their own suits. The settlement puts
the burden of proving that secondhand smoke doesn't cause disease on
the tobacco industry. About 3,000 flight attendants in the U.S. have
filed individual claims.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry has won two prior similar cases and lost one.
A Miami jury told the companies to pay $5.5 million to a former
flight attendant. That award was later cut to $500,000.</TE>

<HD>With Hurricane Lili Gone, Cleanup Begins</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Louisiana residents pulled out their chainsaws and mops Friday to
clean up the mess left by Hurricane Lili after the storm struck the
state a blow that was painful but not deadly.</LD>
<LD>   Southern Louisiana was littered with fallen trees, downed power
lines and glass after the hurricane came ashore Thursday with 100-mph
winds and as much as 8 inches of rain. But only a few injuries and no
deaths were reported, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Lili killed at least six people in Jamaica and Cuba when it
crossed the Caribbean earlier in the week.</LD>
<TE>   The storm generated winds of 145 mph Wednesday as it took aim at
Louisiana, but it lost much of its punch just before making landfall.</TE>
<TE>   Weather experts said cooler water in the northern Gulf of Mexico
and a layer of dry air near the coast depleted much of Lili's
strength. It was little more than a rainstorm Friday as its remnants
moved across Kentucky and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Before fading, Lili toppled thousands of trees, some of which fell
into houses, and blew down so many power lines in coastal counties
that the area was in almost total blackout Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   National Guard crews and municipal workers were out in force
Friday, using chainsaws to cut and remove trees that blocked roads.</TE>
<TE>   In Vermillion Parish, where the storm came ashore, no one had
electricity, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Utility companies sent hundreds of extra workers to repair lines,
but 317,000 homes and businesses were still blacked out Friday night,
said Debbie Conrad of the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the number of outages, this is the worst storm in the
history of this company," said Ann Jenkins, spokeswoman for Cleco
Corp., which provides electricity to the central coastal region that
was worst hit.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Supreme Court Strikes Property Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The Oregon Supreme Court on Friday struck down a voter-passed law
that would have required state and local governments to pay
compensation to property owners when government regulations reduced
their property values.</LD>
<LD>   The court said Measure 7, passed in November 2000, contained more
than one proposed constitutional change and that each should have
been voted on separately.</LD>
<LD>   The court focused on a provision in the measure that said
compensation wouldn't have to be paid if the government regulation at
issue prohibited using the property to sell pornography.</LD>
<TE>   In the unanimous ruling, the court said the measure affected free
speech rights and separate constitutional property rights that
require compensation--for example, when the government condemns land
for public use.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Wallace Carson Jr.'s opinion said the measure
contained too many changes to be rolled into one ballot proposal
under the state Constitution's "separate vote" requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Measure 7 "therefore is void in its entirety," Carson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again the Supreme Court has spit in the face of Oregon
voters," said Dave Hunnicutt, legal counsel for Oregonians in Action.
The Supreme Court since 1998 has struck down three other measures on
the same grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Hunnicutt said his group will ask the 2003 Legislature to send a
revised measure to voters. If that fails, he said, the organization
will work to put a new measure on the ballot in 2004 by initiative
petition.</TE>
<TE>   The decision upheld Marion County Circuit Judge Paul Lipscomb. The
measure never took effect because of court orders blocking it during
the court reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would have exempted governments from paying
compensation claims when regulations prohibited using property for
nude dancing, selling alcohol or operating a casino.</TE>
<TE>   Foes claimed it could have had a devastating fiscal effect. State
analysts estimated state and local governments could have faced
paying $5.4 billion a year in claims for compensation. Measure 7 was
approved by a 54-46 vote, with most of the support from rural areas.</TE>

<HD>Raid on Terror Suspects Occurs in Unlikeliest of
Neighborhoods</HD>
<DH>Arrests: The everyday routine in Portland ends abruptly
when agents from the FBI arrive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER HONG and PATRICK McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The latest strike in the war on terrorism hit a neighborhood that for
many residents is a steppingstone to their American dream of
middle-class prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   Before sunrise Friday, FBI agents rousted three suspected
terrorist cell members at a pair of southwest Portland apartment
complexes, startling children readying themselves for school and
parents up early for work with the sight of their neighbors being
arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve-year-old Wesley Jacobsen was about to take her dog for a
morning walk just after 6 a.m. when she saw a swarm of
black-uniformed men outside her window.</LD>
<TE>   "There were all these guys with FBI vests on. I just stayed
inside," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen lives with her mother across a courtyard from the unit
where FBI agents arrested Jeffrey Leon Battle, 32, and his ex-wife,
October Martinique Lewis, 25, in a woodsy compound built on grassy
slopes just off a busy highway.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, agents also were arresting Patrice Lumumba
Ford, 31, at another apartment complex where Ford lived with his wife
and toddler son.</TE>
<TE>   Nazefa Wahedi, 29, who lives in the apartment next to the Fords,
said she awoke Friday to the sound of men barking, "Get out!" and
wondered whether the orders were meant for her. She peeked through
her front curtains and saw a uniformed FBI agent waving at her to
stay inside.</TE>
<TE>   Wahedi said the Ford family were like many others in the
horseshoe-shaped apartment building--a couple with a young child
seemingly focused on work or school.</TE>
<TE>   Ford told Wahedi he had lived in China, where his wife was from.
Wahedi said the couple often spoke to each other in Chinese. She said
the Fords had an 18-month-old son, Ibrahim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very frightening," she said of the raid. "I don't know why
they had to do it like that, like he was a murderer or something. He
is a very peaceful man," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wahedi thought Ford was a student at Portland State University or
nearby Portland Community College, because he often carried a
backpack with books. She said he also operated some kind of vending
kiosk at a shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests shocked Wahedi not only because she knew the Fords as
a quiet and somewhat friendly couple, but also because she is a
Muslim from Afghanistan. While she and others said few Muslims live
in the community, there are two mosques in the neighborhood and a
halal food market.</TE>
<TE>   Wahedi said that since the Sept. 11 attacks, she has stopped
wearing a scarf over her head when she goes to her job at a nearby
Nordstrom. She said after Friday morning's raid, her 10-year-old
daughter told her she was afraid to leave for school with her head
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Ford never spoke to Wahedi about religion. Wahedi said she saw
Ford occasionally, praying at the Islamic Center of Portland, but
does not believe he was a regular at the mosques where she worships.
The Islamic Center is home to Sheik Mohammed Abdirahman Kariye, the
religious leader who was arrested Sept. 8 by the FBI's Joint
Terrorism Task Force. Kariye, 41, was indicted on suspicion of Social
Security fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have not said whether he was involved in any
terrorist-related activity, but in 1992, he was co-founder of a
charity now under investigation for having ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   He remains in jail awaiting a Nov. 5 trial.</TE>
<TE>   While the Fords were described as amicable neighbors, those who
lived near Battle and Lewis said they were reclusive to the point
that they forbade their 5-year-old son from playing with other
children at the apartment playground.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Hawkey, 36, said the couple never spoke to other residents
and their son told other children earlier this year "that 9/11 was a
good thing." Hawkey said he called the FBI when he heard of the
remark.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Jacobsen, 38, said after the raid that she and her daughter
Wesley discussed the treatment of Muslims and both said they were
concerned about another Muslim family in the complex.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about not discriminating against an entire race. We
don't want anything to happen to the other family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the apartment complex at Rizwan Mosque, president Mona
Luqman said the mosque has received overwhelming support from people
since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten hundreds of calls after 9/11, all supportive, and
for many months people left flowers at our door," he said.</TE>

<HD>Reid Says He Tried to Blow Up Plane</HD>
<DH>Court: Guilty plea in the shoe-bomb case marks first U.S.
conviction of an Al Qaeda terrorist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In the first U.S. conviction of an Al Qaeda terrorist, Richard Reid
pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he tried to destroy an American
Airlines transatlantic plane with explosives concealed in his shoes.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as the factual basis is concerned, I done this," Reid
declared in U.S. District Court here.</LD>
<LD>   Pronouncing his allegiance to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, the
29-year-old British citizen faced the judge and said, "I am an enemy
of your country." U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan said the government
made no deal with Reid, who surprised prosecutors this week when he
abruptly decided to plead guilty. Sullivan said his office would seek
a life prison term for Reid at his Jan. 8 sentencing.</LD>
<TE>   Charles Prouty, special agent in charge of the Boston FBI office,
said Reid's conviction would not end the government's effort to learn
who aided Reid in building the bomb hidden in his ankle-high hiking
shoes, or to uncover additional information about his terrorist
activities. "This is not the end of the investigation," Prouty said.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Reid will cooperate with authorities remained in
doubt. The tall, spindly defendant appeared alternately distracted
and animated in court Friday--sometimes chewing on his cheek,
stroking his straggly beard and smirking as Judge William Young
patiently instructed him in the intricacies of a legal system he
professes to revile.</TE>
<TE>   Young, in judicial robes, sat less than 3 feet from the defendant,
who wore manacles and khaki prison attire. In a surreal moment of
courtroom graciousness, he greeted Reid by saying, "My name's Bill
Young and I am the judge who has been assigned to preside over this
case."</TE>
<TE>   A small legal colloquy ensued as Young painstakingly led Reid
through the implications of his guilty plea. To most of Young's
questions, Reid responded in his strong cockney accent, "Yeah." When
asked, "bottom line," why he wanted to plead guilty, he replied,
"Because at the end of the day, I know that I have done the actions."</TE>
<TE>   Reid, whose education stopped in the fifth grade, pleaded guilty
to eight charges, including attempted use of a weapon of mass
destruction, attempted homicide and placing an explosive device on an
airplane. His plea also covered charges of attempted murder, two
counts of interference with a flight crew and attendants, attempted
destruction of an aircraft and using a destructive device during a
crime of violence.</TE>
<TE>   On the last count, Reid became agitated as he attempted to correct
the wording. "I admit I used a destructive device in an act of war,"
he said, prompting Young to respond: "Very well."</TE>
<TE>   Raised by his mother in a small town west of London after his
parents divorced, Reid embraced a youthful life of street crime. He
served five years in a British prison for a series of robberies.
Following his release from prison in 1996, he began to frequent a
mosque in south London.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors told the court Friday that Reid was the son of a
Catholic mother and Protestant father who converted to Islam in his
early 20s. He received training at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan,
and first scouted the Israeli airline El Al as a possible bombing
target. On Dec. 22, Reid boarded American Airlines Flight 63 in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami-bound Boeing 767 carried 198 passengers and crew, mostly
Americans. Reid took a window seat near the rear of the plane. When
his seatmate got up hours into the flight, Reid removed shoes in
which "a sophisticated explosive device" had been hidden, a
prosecution report said.</TE>
<TE>   He made six attempts to light matches as he sought to detonate
fuses in both shoes. Passengers and crew members who smelled the
burning rubber and smoking sulfur from the matches overpowered Reid,
who bit one flight attendant in the struggle. Reid was restrained
with belts supplied by passengers. His shoes were confiscated and the
plane was diverted to Boston. Prosecutors said that if either of
Reid's shoes had exploded where he was seated, "the resulting
explosion would have breached the outside skin of the aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   When Young asked Reid to corroborate this sequence of events, the
defendant said the account was true, "more or less." He elaborated:
"Basically I got on the plane with a bomb. Basically I tried to
ignite it. Basically, yeah, I intended to damage the plane." As Reid
laughed at this depiction, the judge said once again, "Very well."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also cited an e-mail Reid sent to his mother via "a
brother" to explain his intended actions on Flight 63. "What I am
doing is part of the ongoing war between Islam and disbelief," Reid
wrote, adding that he also was sending his mother a will. He went on:
"I didn't do this act out of ignorance nor did I do [it] just because
I want to die, but rather because I see it as a duty upon me to help
remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim lands."</TE>
<TE>   Labeling his struggle "a war between Islam and democracy," he
beseeched his mother, "Forgive me for all the problems I have caused
you both in life and in death and don't be angry for what I have
done." Reid reportedly entered his plea in part to avoid a trial that
could cause further embarrassment to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also described a final e-mail in Reid's Yahoo! account
that was sent to another unidentified "brother." Reid related a dream
in which a pickup truck that was supposed to pick him up was too
crowded, and passed him by. "I now believe that the pickup ... was
9/11 and it's true that I was upset at not being sent," Reid wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with authorities at the time of his arrest, Reid
said democratic countries are contrary to God's will. He also stated
that "America is the problem, without America there would be no
Israel." In addition, Reid said he was prepared to die as a martyr,
and that Allah would reward him in heaven. He told federal officials
that he targeted an airplane during the holiday season in hopes that
Americans would stop flying, thus damaging the economy. He explained
that he switched his focus from Israel to America after the U.S.
began bombing Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are your views?" Young asked Reid in court Friday. "Yeah,"
he answered.</TE>
<TE>   But when Young asked whether Reid was satisfied, once and for all,
with his plea, he shot back: "I don't recognize your system. How
could I be satisfied?" Young also refused Reid's request to strike
the phrase "Al Qaeda" from his indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pledged to Osama bin Laden. I'm an enemy of your country,"
Reid rejoined. "I don't care."</TE>

<HD>Public Access to Smallpox Vaccine Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Health: People should be allowed to opt in after emergency
workers are inoculated, officials say. The White House is undecided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After as many as 10 million health care workers and emergency
personnel are immunized against smallpox, a licensed vaccine should
be made available to all Americans who want it, the government's top
public health officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But the officials said their position did not necessarily reflect
the Bush administration's view on who should be protected against a
possible terrorist attack using smallpox.</LD>
<LD>   They stressed repeatedly that President Bush had not made a
decision.</LD>
<TE>   "We represent the public health perspective, but the decision also
has to be made on the grounds of homeland security and national
security," said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The United States stopped routinely vaccinating children against
smallpox in 1972, and the disease was eradicated worldwide in 1980.
But last year's terrorist attacks raised fears that the highly
contagious virus, which kills almost a third of those infected, could
be used as a biological weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the administration has dramatically increased the
nation's vaccine supply.</TE>
<TE>   It determined that old stocks could be watered down and it
contracted with manufacturers for the fast-track production of
millions of additional doses. Federal health agencies also are
working with state and local governments to develop mass-immunization
plans, and officials said Friday there is enough vaccine for all
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   States should be able to vaccinate as many as 1 million people in
the first 10 days after a smallpox attack, the CDC said last month.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the pre-attack inoculation decision so difficult are
the risks associated with the vaccine. Using vaccination data from
the 1960s, scientists estimate that for every million people
vaccinated, the live virus will replicate in 900, causing
complications such as rash, fever and body aches. About 15 people
would develop encephalitis or other life-threatening conditions, and
one or two of those individuals would die.</TE>
<TE>   The risks of the vaccine to the current American population could
be even greater--or smaller. On the one hand, the rate of
complications is lower for people who were vaccinated as children. On
the other, the vaccine poses serious risks for individuals with
weakened immune systems--HIV, cancer and transplant patients, for
example--and those with eczema and other skin disorders.</TE>
<TE>   That at-risk population could number more than 30 million, said
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. Highlighting some of the complicating factors
associated with the disease--the virus can be transmitted from a
vaccine site to another individual, for example--Fauci said people
living with individuals who have weakened immune systems should not
get the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   "We stopped using this vaccine when the disease was eradicated
because it's dangerous," Gerberding said. "So it's not a
straightforward" decision to use the vaccine now just because it's
available, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, after weighing the "tension between wanting to be
safe, the lack of ability to predict the threat and the recognition
that people are afraid," top scientists at the CDC, the National
Institutes of Health and the Health and Human Services Department
concluded that the government should "let people make up their own
mind," Gerberding said.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a society that values individual choice."</TE>
<TE>   Even if President Bush decides to make the vaccine available to
everyone, most Americans would not have access to it until early
2004, after new supplies have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us believe we should make it available to the general
public right now," said Jerry Hauer, assistant Health and Human
Services secretary for emergency health preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   But some vaccine supplies could be licensed as early as next
month, and health officials favor getting front-line health care and
emergency workers immunized as soon as possible after the vaccination
policy is announced.</TE>
<TE>   The phased approach they favor could make the vaccine available
first to about 500,000 front-line health care workers--the public
health teams who would investigate smallpox cases and the doctors,
nurses and support personnel in hospital emergency rooms who would
probably be the first to treat infected pa- tients.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the vaccine would be offered to all of the nation's 7
million health care workers and about 3 million police, fire and
other emergency workers, Hauer said.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier recommendation proposed designating one or two
"smallpox" hospitals in each city. Health care officials have now
rejected that idea, in part because hospitals resisted it so
strongly. They also realized such a plan was not realistic, Hauer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When people have rash and a fever, they're going to go to the
nearest ER, not a smallpox-designated hospital," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Friday they decided to take the unusual step of
briefing reporters before the pre-event policy was announced because
the issues were complex and the potential for confusion and panic so
high.</TE>
<TE>   "I, for one, am not worried," Gerberding said. "I think ultimately
we'll get to the right decision."</TE>

<HD>N.J. Senate Dispute Argued</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: GOP, Democrats make cases in writing over
replacing Torricelli on the ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>New Jersey Democrats urged the Supreme Court on Friday to stay away
from their Senate ballot dispute, saying that neither Republican
candidate Douglas Forrester nor the state's voters are hurt by the
late switch on the Democratic side.</LD>
<LD>   The high court rarely intervenes in pending disputes and does so
only where a delay will cause "an irreparable harm."</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats' lawyers said the GOP had failed to meet that strict
legal standard.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no reasonable argument that Forrester himself is
injured," they said. "While he claims the voters 'risk effective
disenfranchisement,' every one of them remains able to vote for him,
regardless of who else is on the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   Other states allow ballot substitutions just weeks before the
election, the Democrats noted. For example, Connecticut law says
vacancies can be filled seven days before the election. Georgia and
Idaho allow changes up to 10 days before the election, and Illinois
allows substitutions 15 days before balloting, the Democrats said.</TE>
<TE>   No one has asserted that these late changes violate the
constitutional rights of the opposing candidates or the voters, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   California law forbids filling a vacancy within 68 days of the
election.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that provision, California Secretary of State Bill Jones
joined the case on the side of the New Jersey Republicans, saying he
feared "a wave of similar lawsuits" across the nation if the parties
are allowed to replace candidates who appear to be losing in the
month before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "As California's chief elections officer, I was appalled at the
recent New Jersey Supreme Court decision," Jones said. If it is
allowed to stand, political parties will be tempted to try the same
scheme when their candidates are sinking in the polls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "California is very strict about getting on or off the ballot,"
said William P. Wood, chief counsel for the secretary of state in
Sacramento. "Basically, you have to die 68 days before the election."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that rule, an Orange County candidate was put on the
ballot in July to fill the vacancy created when disgraced Superior
Court Judge Ronald C. Kline removed himself from the ballot because
he was facing child pornography charges.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey law said party leaders can fill a vacancy on the ballot
51 days before the election. But after scandal-tainted Sen. Robert
Torricelli (D-N.J.) withdrew on Monday, the state Supreme Court
agreed on Wednesday that his place could be filled by former Sen.
Frank R. Lautenberg. Its judges said they did so in order to give the
voters "a full and fair choice."</TE>
<TE>   Forrester and the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee have
urged the Supreme Court to block the switch and to rule it
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Republican lawyers filed a lawsuit in federal
court in Trenton, N.J., asserting that overseas military personnel
might be confused or prevented from voting by the late switch on the
Democratic side. A hearing will be held on the claim Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court justices have had no response to the emergency
appeal from New Jersey. Their term begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>Va. Girl Is Identified by Skeletal Remains</HD>
<DH>Crime: Child of slain parents was shot in head. Focus is on
man whose home had been searched.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WENTWORTH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Bone fragments and a skull found on a rural property are the remains
of a 9-year-old girl who vanished after her parents were fatally shot
in their home seven weeks ago, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said they have not made any arrests but would like
to talk with a man whose rented house and mobile home in Rockingham
County were recently searched.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Short's remains were discovered Sept. 25 near a home in
Stoneville, N.C., about 30 miles south of her home. She had been shot
in the head, Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page said.</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer had been missing since Aug. 15, when her parents--Michael
Short, 50, and Mary Short, 36--were found shot to death in their
Bassett, Va., home. Investigators had said they believed the girl had
been abducted by her parents' killer.</TE>
<TE>   "The skeletal remains in Rockingham County have been determined to
be a positive match with the DNA profile of Short and are hers," Page
said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation and search for the little girl had been
emotionally difficult, said Sheriff Frank Cassell of Henry County,
Va.</TE>
<TE>   "She's gone now and she's safe now and no evil can befall her," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tests by a lab in Roanoke, Va., showed Jennifer had been shot,
Page said. Neither sheriff would say whether evidence indicated she
had been raped.</TE>
<TE>   "I am saddened. I am heartbroken for this little girl and her
family," Cassell said. "But at least it's important for them to know
she's not out there being abused or hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Garrison Storm Bowman, a 60-year-old carpenter from Myodan, was
last seen in the area the day after the Shorts were killed. Page said
he is now in northwestern Canada, but the sheriff would not give a
specific location.</TE>
<TE>   Page said he wasn't certain whether Bowman was in custody but
added, "We know where he's at, and we will be interviewing him at a
later time."</TE>
<TE>   Rockingham County sheriff's deputies seized nine maps, one of
which was marked to show the location of the Shorts' home, on
Saturday from the trailer east of Madison, according to court
records. The house was searched in August.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers on Common Ground With Election Reform Legislation</HD>
<DH>Congress: Measure funds state upgrades, sets national
standards. Vote is likely before elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional negotiators agreed Friday on legislation to give states
more than $3.8 billion and impose new national voting standards to
help fix flaws exposed by the 2000 presidential election fiasco.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking a lengthy partisan impasse, the compromise struck by
House and Senate negotiators is meant to bolster voter access to the
polls, minimize spoiled ballots and deter fraud. Lawmakers hope the
bill, which President Bush has indicated he will sign, will restore
confidence in an electoral process shaken badly two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation takes special aim at two oft-ridiculed voting
systems, setting aside $325 million to pay for replacing punch-card
and lever-operated machines. Punch cards and the "chads" they
produce--hanging, dimpled and otherwise--became infamous during the
protracted Florida recount that ultimately determined the 2000
presidential race's outcome.</LD>
<TE>   But upgrading voting machinery is only one goal of the
legislation. Just as important, lawmakers said, are provisions that
seek to ensure equal access to voting through uniform nationwide
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Never before, lawmakers said, has the federal government injected
itself so extensively into the details of how states run elections.
Some lawmakers compared the measure's potential impact to the 1965
Voting Rights Act, which ended discriminatory voting laws.</TE>
<TE>   "With this bill, we move closer to the day when every vote cast
will be counted," said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a lead
negotiator on the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio), another negotiator, said the bill
would "go on for decades to produce elections that leave no one
behind."</TE>
<TE>   The compromise, melding bills passed in the House and Senate, is
expected to come to a final vote before Congress adjourns shortly
before the November elections.</TE>
<TE>   While there were no figures immediately available on how much each
state would get, California stands to receive hundreds of millions of
dollars because much of the money would be distributed according to a
formula tied to population.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the bill's key requirements would be enforced starting in
2004, though states would be able to obtain two-year extensions in
some cases.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's enactment would represent the second major step by
Congress this year to change the political process, following passage
this year of the campaign finance law that aims to lessen the flow of
large contributions to the two major political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Because the voting bill deals directly with the issues most
sensitive to a democracy and to partisan politics--who votes and how
votes are counted--compromise was delayed for months as Republicans
and Democrats bickered over fine points.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers were given another reason to cut a deal last month
when the Florida Democratic gubernatorial primary was clouded by
widespread voting problems.</TE>
<TE>   One key Republican, Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, also pointed to
the brewing ballot controversy in this fall's New Jersey Senate race
as a reason to pass voting reform.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of cynicism about elections in America right now,"
Blunt said.</TE>
<TE>   While Friday's agreement drew applause across the ideological
spectrum in Congress, some groups that have tracked the voting bill
gave it mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The League of Women Voters expressed support with portions of the
bill that would require and pay for better voting machines, voter
education, training for poll workers and other steps to improve the
voting process. But Kay J. Maxwell, the league's president, said she
was "deeply concerned about possible disenfranchisement of voters"
through the bill's anti-fraud provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Those provisions were the main reason that prominent Republicans,
such as House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, embraced the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout debate on the bill, Republicans generally focused on
combating voter fraud while Democrats pressed to expand voter
participation. In the compromise, each party claimed advances,
following the formula coined by Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.):
"Make it easier to vote and tougher to cheat."</TE>
<TE>   To help prevent fraud, the bill would require all states to
maintain statewide voter registration lists. It would also require
new voters who register by mail to provide proof of identity when
registering or when casting a ballot for the first time. Acceptable
proof would include a utility bill, government check, bank statement
or driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers stressed, though, that a photo identification was not
required.</TE>
<TE>   They also gave two options for voters who fail to carry acceptable
identification.</TE>
<TE>   States could electronically verify identity using a driver's
license number, the last four digits of a Social Security number or
another assigned number kept in a database. And voters who still lack
verification could cast a provisional ballot that would later be
double-checked for validity.</TE>
<TE>   In another anti-fraud step, the bill would require states to keep
separate ballots cast after a polling station was scheduled to close.</TE>
<TE>   Those ballots would be counted after state authorities upheld
their validity.</TE>
<TE>   This provision addresses complaints from Missouri Republicans
about local officials keeping polling places open late in heavily
Democratic areas of St. Louis in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats praising the bill included Rep. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who
said he was "euphoric" about provisions he believes will expand voter
participation.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: States would be required to offer voters a chance to
fix mistakes on ballots, set aside at least one voting machine in
each precinct to allow disabled voters to cast private ballots, meet
minimum voting error standards set by the federal government and
define what constitutes a legal vote.</TE>
<TE>   The last issue was a major dispute in the Florida recount in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also hailed the requirement for states to offer voters
provisional ballots even if their names are not on a precinct list,
to safeguard against inadvertent omissions or overzealous "purging"
of voter rolls. While California already offers such ballots, many
states do not.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   Key Ingredients of the Measure</TE>
<TE>   Key provisions of the compromise reached Friday on legislation to
reform voting procedures. Republicans pressed for anti-fraud
provisions, while Democrats focused on increasing participation. It
requires:</TE>
<TE>   * First-time voters who register by mail to show proof of
identity. Acceptable proof would include certain official documents
with an address, a driver's license or an identifying number, such as
four digits in a Social Security number, kept in a state database.</TE>
<TE>   * States to offer voters a chance to fix mistakes on a marked
ballot</TE>
<TE>   * Expanded disability access.</TE>
<TE>   * States to give provisional ballots to those who lack proper
identification or whose names are omitted from voter rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Such ballots would be verified later.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Man Indicted in Deaths of 2 Girls Buried at His Home</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A grand jury indicted an Oregon man Friday on charges of murdering
two girls whose bodies were found buried at his home in August, just
yards from their own homes.</LD>
<LD>   Ward Weaver, a 39-year-old toolmaker with a history of violence
against women, was already in jail on charges of raping his son's
girlfriend. The son had called police on Aug. 13 and said his father
had admitted killing Ashley Pond, 12, and Miranda Gaddis, 13.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver pleaded not guilty to the new charges and showed no emotion
as court officials read out the 17 counts, ranging from rape and
aggravated murder to sexual abuse and abuse of a corpse. The charges
including new allegations that he raped a 15-year-old girl in July.</LD>
<TE>   After the hearing, which followed a week of grand jury testimony,
Clackamas County Dist. Atty. John Foote told reporters he would seek
the death penalty if Weaver is convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of crime is terrible and it can scare all of us," Foote
said.</TE>

<HD>Northridge Fault Shows Almost No Movement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Northridge fault, which was expected to keep readjusting for the
next 20 years, has slowed to a crawl, according to JPL scientists who
have been monitoring the area closely since before the Jan. 17, 1994,
magnitude 6.7 quake that killed 60 and injured 7,000. Geophysicist
Andrea Donnellan, who has studied the region for 15 years, said the
fault has probably stopped moving because it originated in a lower,
colder part of the crust.</LD>
<LD>   The part of the Earth's crust where the Northridge quake
originated is 500 degrees to 1000 degrees colder than the region that
spawned the magnitude 7.6 Landers quake in the Mojave Desert in 1992.
The slowdown of Northridge fault activity does not mean the area will
never shake again. More aftershocks are still possible, Donnellan
said, and other nearby faults could rupture as well.</LD>

<HD>New Theory on How Carlsbad Cave Formed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns with its gypsum formations and its
huge space--bigger than six football fields and as tall as a 30-story
building--inspires awe for 500,000 annual visitors, but it's been a
nagging puzzle for geologists. For decades, visitors were told the
cave was formed by the relentless drip-drip-drip of carbonic acid
eating away at the limestone. But where did all that rock go?</LD>
<LD>   In most caves formed that way, subterranean streams carry off the
residue. There were no underground streams in Carlsbad Caverns. The
story scientists had been telling the tourists didn't make sense to
geologist Carol Hill of the University of New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   UNM biologist Diana Northup, who worked with Hill, said
single-cell microbes--bacteria--that fed on pools of petroleum under
the Carlsbad region were the real cave carvers. "The carbon compounds
available in oil are eaten by the microorganisms," Northup said, "and
the product they produce is hydrogen sulfide." Hydrogen sulfide
reacts chemically with oxygen to produce sulfuric acid, which can
dissolve whole stadiums of limestone.</LD>

World Health Organization. The report, which appeared in newspapers
and on television last week, said a WHO study made the projection.</LD>
<LD>   The only problem, WHO said Wednesday, is that it never conducted
such a study and there is no basis for the reports. Apparently, the
story was begun by a European news service and picked up by other
publications.</LD>

<HD>NFL Should Be Giving Minority Hiring a Push</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest push for the NFL to increase minority hiring among its
coaches shouldn't have to come from Johnnie Cochran. It really should
come from the fans, fans who long ago grew tired of seeing the same
old names such as Bruce Coslet, Dan Henning, Kevin Gilbride and Jerry
Glanville called on to coach their teams.</LD>
<LD>   A report released this week by civil rights attorneys Cochran and
Cyrus Mehri shows that black head coaches have outperformed their
white counterparts. If more owners were willing to tap into this
underused pool, maybe they wouldn't get stuck in a perpetual state of
being, say, the Cincinnati Bengals.</LD>
<LD>   Two pages among the 68 pages in the report struck me: the first
and the last.</LD>
<TE>   It opens with a dedication to the five black coaches hired in the
NFL's modern era. It's a short paragraph, with only a few names.
Something's wrong when a guy like me, who covers only two or three
NFL games a year, has met 80% of the black coaches.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I reached the report's conclusion, a call for the NFL
commissioner's office to encourage diversity by awarding or revoking
draft choices, made sense. A lot more sense than a lawsuit, actually.</TE>
<TE>   Litigation is the proposed action if the NFL doesn't change its
sleepy hiring practices. And it's what these guys do best. Mehri won
settlements of $176 million from Texaco and $192.5 million from
Coca-Cola in racial discrimination cases. Among Cochran's numerous
victories are an $8.7-million settlement for police brutality victim
Abner Louima in a New York civil case and an acquittal of a former
NFL running back in a well-known criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   But if the NFL gets taken to court, the only winners will be the
lawyers. There will be plenty of billable hours and maybe the league
would have to fork over some money, but would that change anything?
Not really.</TE>
<TE>   But start talking draft picks and things change. Now you're
dealing in the NFL's currency.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution proposed by Cochran and Mehri calls for the
commissioner to give draft picks to teams "for diversifying
front-office positions through the hiring of qualified minority and
female candidates." Teams would be required to have a racially
diverse field, with each candidate interviewed in person, before a
head coach, assistant or coordinator is chosen. Note that this
pertains to interviews, not hires. Any team can opt out of the
diversity-interview requirement by forfeiting a draft pick (a
first-rounder for head coaches).</TE>
<TE>   We've already seen teams willing to part with draft picks to get
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers gave up two first-round
picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Oakland Raiders
to get them to release Jon Gruden from the final year of his
contract. In 1997, the New York Jets gave the New England Patriots
four draft picks, including a No. 1, to get Bill Parcells. Three
years later, the Patriots sent three picks (one a first-rounder) to
New York for Bill Belichick and two lesser draft choices.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't blame the Jets; I'd give up a whole draft to get a
motivated Parcells. I wondered why the Patriots were so pressed to
bring in Belichick, but he coached them to a Super Bowl victory, so I
guess they knew what they were doing.</TE>
<TE>   So if some team has its heart set on hiring a white coach without
checking all the alternatives that they're willing to part with a No.
1 pick, step right to it. That way they wouldn't have to answer to
civil-rights attorneys, they'd have their judgment questioned and be
held accountable by the people in the seats. If the fans don't like
the team's direction, they can stop buying tickets.</TE>
<TE>   But the report makes you wonder why NFL owners aren't more active
in finding the next Tony Dungy or Herman Edwards without any
inducement or penalties. Cochran and Mehri brought in University of
Pennsylvania labor economist Dr. Janice Madden to crunch the numbers.
She found that since 1986 black coaches have made the playoffs 67% of
the time versus 39% for white coaches and averaged 1.1 more victories
per year than white coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Black coaches average 2.7 more wins in their first year than new
white coaches, but that brings up an interesting point. Normally a
roadblock to success for black college football, baseball and
basketball coaches is that they get to take over only teams and
programs that are left in the wastebasket. To the NFL's credit, three
of the four most recent African American hires took over teams that
had winning or .500 records the season before (Dennis Green in
Minnesota, Ray Rhodes in Green Bay and Edwards with the New York
Jets).</TE>
<TE>   But they paid the price in higher expectations. Fired black
coaches won an average of 1.3 more games than fired white coaches.
Ray Rhodes was cut loose by Green Bay after one year and an 8-8
record, when star quarterback Brett Favre was bothered by a thumb
injury.</TE>
<TE>   It took three consecutive losing seasons for the Raiders to make
Art Shell the first black coach in the league's modern era in 1989.
He was fired by the Raiders after a 9-7 season in 1994. Neither of
his next two successors, Mike White and Joe Bugel, won that many
games, and it took Gruden until his third year to surpass that total
with a 12-4 record in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The record shows that when teams hire minorities, it benefits the
team, not some quota. Baltimore's Ozzie Newsome is the only black
general manager, and the Ravens won the Super Bowl in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad that guys such as current Washington Redskin defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis--the architect of Baltimore's championship
defense--can't get a shot at a head coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   If he gets an opportunity, I like his chances. Under the
Cochran/Mehri proposal, a team would at least get an extra draft pick
for the attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see: a chance to improve your team in addition to
statistical trends that show the choice would pay off. Sounds like
odds that even the conservative NFL owners can't turn down.</TE>

<HD>Playing Short, Eckstein Makes an Impact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin; Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With this prime-time series introducing the Angels to the rest of the
country, America has a new hero. He's David Eckstein, the Angels'
5-foot-6 shortstop, the new role model for all those kids tired of
hearing how they are too little to earn a scholarship--let alone earn
a living--by playing sports.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein, the leadoff hitter on a playoff team, led the American
League in sacrifice bunts, times hit by pitch --he had one of each in
Game 3--and grand slams. He gets more fan mail than any of his, er,
bigger teammates, and he is relentlessly besieged for autographs,
home and away.</LD>
<LD>   In rhyme, his teammates joke with him about his popularity.
"People can look you in the eye, that's the reason why," they tell
him.</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein, listed at 5-8, calls all the attention "humbling" but
says he considers it "a compliment" if a kid considers him a role
model. And, when he was a kid, which short player did he--pardon the
pun--look up to?</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like that," he said. "My favorite player was Dale
Murphy, and he's 6-4."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels decided not to use rookie John Lackey as a fourth
starter during this series. If the Angels beat the Yankees, they
could used Lackey or veteran Aaron Sele as a fourth starter in the
league championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Sele sat out five weeks while rehabilitating a partially torn
rotator cuff, but he returned to start the final day of the regular
season and impressed the coaching staff by shutting out the Seattle
Mariners for four innings. Sele appeared to tire in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels left him off the roster for this series, but he has
continued to work out and could be added to the roster for the next
series. Pitching coach Bud Black said Sele is capable of throwing
five or six innings, more than enough with a six-man bullpen and a
playoff schedule of no more than three consecutive games without a
day off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peter Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner and Los Angeles
Olympic chief, attended Friday's game. Ueberroth confirmed that his
investment partnership is interested in buying the Angels from Disney
but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ueberroth's group was outbid by Disney when the Autry family sold
the team in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians are leaning toward retaining interim Manager
Joel Skinner on a full-time basis, but they would like to interview
Black before making a decision. Cleveland General Manager Mark
Shapiro said he would not seek permission to talk to any candidates
working for playoff teams until their season ends.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a long-term working relationship and friendship with
Bud, and I respect him as a baseball man and as a person," Shapiro
said. "If he were ever available to talk to, he would certainly be a
candidate for us."</TE>
<TE>   Black, a former Cleveland pitcher, worked for the Indians after
his retirement in several capacities, including advance scouting,
player evaluation and minor league coach.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Jackson, who played for the Yankees for five years and the
Angels for five years, was in attendance Friday night. So who was he
pulling for?</TE>
<TE>   "Since the Yankees sign my paycheck, the Yankees," he said. "But
I'm really happy about the Angels' success."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has been a special advisor for the Yankees since 1993. "I
help players who have problems, both on or off the field," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who has homes in Orange County and Pebble Beach, said he
usually only comes to Angel games when they play the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Someone else at Game 3 was Jack Nicholson, who had a seat right
behind home plate.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker regular said this was the first time he has been to an
Angel game in Anaheim. So who was Nicholson pulling for?</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees," he said.</TE>

<HD>PLAY BY PLAY</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   YANKEES: Yankees 3, Angels 0--Alfonso Soriano flied out to the
warning track in right. Derek Jeter lined a shot up the middle that
narrowly missed Ramon Ortiz. The Angels put on the infield shift with
Jason Giambi at bat. Jeter stole second, and because the shift was
on, continued to third because there was no one covering third. What
made it worse: It was ball four on Giambi, so Bengie Molina did not
even have to throw at all. Bernie Williams walked, loading the bases.
Ventura doubled to right-center, Jeter and Giambi scoring, Williams
stopping at third. Mike Scioscia better have someone warming up (as
long as it's not Schoeneweis). Jorge Posada flied to the right-field
fence, Williams scoring, Ventura to third. Ortiz is fooling no one.
Mondesi was hit by a pitch. Johnson fouled out to Anderson. Three
runs, two hits, two left.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Yankees 3, Angels 0--David Eckstein fouled out to the
catcher. Darin Erstad swung at ball four and flied to center. Tim
Salmon flied to left. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 3, Angels 0--Juan Rivera struck out. Soriano
bounced slowly to third and was thrown out on a nice play by Glaus.
Jeter grounded up the middle and Adam Kennedy made the grab and a
twisting throw to get him. The two consecutive stellar defensive
plays awakened the Edison Field crowd. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 3, Angels 1--Garret Anderson struck out on a curve
in the dirt. Troy Glaus broke his bat while singling to left. It's
nice not to have to listen to Tim McCarver drone on incessantly.
Fullmer doubled down the right-field line, Glaus stopping at third.
Spiezio grounded to first, Glaus scoring, Fullmer to third. The crowd
in the stadium is strangely silent. Must be waiting for the Rally
Monkey. Molina grounded to second. One run, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 6, Angels 1--Giambi walked. Williams doubled off
the left-field fence, Giambi stopping at third. Where's John Lackey?
Ventura hit a laser to center that Erstad caught, Giambi beat the
throw home. Williams took third on a wild pitch. Posada lined to
Glaus. Mondesi walked, and here comes Scioscia. And there goes Ortiz.
Lackey is in the game. Johnson singled to center, Williams scoring,
Mondesi to second. Rivera singled to left, Mondesi scoring. This is
getting embarrassing. Soriano struck out swinging. Three runs, three
hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 6, Angels 3--Kennedy singled to center. The
Yankees have already gone through their batting order twice, the
Angels are just finishing their first turn through. Kennedy stole
second. Eckstein lined to first. Erstad grounded a single just under
Soriano's glove and into right. Kennedy, wisely not wanting to test
Mondesi's throwing arm, stopped at third. Salmon doubled to left,
Kennedy and Erstad scoring. Anderson grounded to second and decided
to jog to first. Soriano bobbled the ball but had plenty of time to
throw Anderson out because Anderson was dogging it. Glaus was hit by
a pitch. It could be bases loaded with one out, but thanks to
Anderson's laziness, it is first and third, two out. Judging by the
crowd, Game 3 was either noisemaker night, or loaf of French bread
night. Fullmer struck out swinging. Two runs, three hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 6, Angels 3--Jeter grounded to short. Giambi
grounded to second. Williams walked on what appeared to be strike
three. Scioscia and Mickey Hatcher were visibly annoyed. Ventura
popped to shallow right, Kennedy making the catch. No runs, no hits,
one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 6, Angels 4--Spiezio fouled to right. Molina flied
to right. Fox then switched to a shot of Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in
the booth. Why? Who wants to see these guys? All they are doing is
talking. Then they showed the guys calling the game on the radio?
Huh? This is cutting-edge television. Kennedy homered to right.
Eckstein grounded to second. One run, one hit.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 6, Angels 4--Posada grounded to first, pitcher
covering. Jeff Weaver is warming up in the Yankee bullpen. Mondesi
flied to center. Jon Miller just identified John Lackey as Jeff
Weaver. Not once, but twice. Johnson struck out swinging on a curve
in the dirt. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 6, Angels 4--Jeff Weaver pitching. Or is that John
Lackey? Mussina is hurt, so Weaver gets all the time he wants to warm
up. This leads to some exciting television, where we get to learn all
of Fox's fall lineup. Hey, a guy in the stands is holding a "Yes We
Can" sign. Sir, 1979 just called. It wants its slogan back. Finally,
the inning begins. Erstad grounded to short. Salmon struck out
swinging. Anderson walked. I believe the last walk he drew was in
1997. Glaus flied to left. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 6, Angels 4--Rivera singled to left. Rivera went
on the pitch, allowing him to make it to second safely when Soriano
grounded to short. Jeter took a called strike three on the inside
corner. Apparently, Jeter thinks umpires aren't supposed to call
strikes when he is at the plate. Uh oh, Scott Schoeneweis is pitching
now! Giambi grounded to second. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 6, Angels 5--Fullmer flared a single into left.
Spiezio walked. The home plate umpire has a very erratic strike zone.
Molina sacrificed, runners on second and third. Kennedy flied to
left, Fullmer scoring, Spiezio holding at second. Eckstein was hit by
the pitch. Mike Stanton now pitching. The Rally Monkey makes his
first appearance. He has really moved up since leaving "Friends."
Erstad flied to center. One run, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 6, Angels 5--Francisco Rodriguez pitching.
Williams argues with the plate umpire after a called strike two.
Aren't the Yankees supposed to be a classy team? Williams struck out
swinging. Ventura struck out swinging. Does Rodriguez remind anyone
else of Fernando, 1981? Posada lined to second. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 6, Yankees 6--Salmon struck out swinging. Anderson
doubled down the right-field line. Glaus was walked intentionally,
putting the go-ahead run on base. Shawn Wooten hit for Fullmer.
There's a fan in a gorilla suit in the stands. His parents must be
proud. Wooten popped to second. Spiezio blooped a single to center on
a full-count pitch, Anderson scoring. Molina flied to center. One
run, two hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 6, Yankees 6--Mondesi flied out to left. Johnson
struck out swinging. Rivera took called strike three. Wow. In two
innings, Rodriguez made the Yankees look feeble. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Yankees 6--Kennedy flied to right, but, in a
scene familiar to Dodger fans, Mondesi couldn't make the play, and it
was ruled a double. Eckstein laid down a perfect bunt, Kennedy taking
third. Erstad doubled down the right-field line, Kennedy scoring.
Never question the power of the Rally Monkey. Steve Karsay now
pitching. Salmon homered to left. Anderson grounded to second. Glaus
flied to right. Mondesi managed to hold on to this one. Three runs,
three hits.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 9, Yankees 6--Troy Percival pitching. Soriano
grounded to third. Jeter flied to left. Giambi flied to left. No
runs, no hits, the halo shines tonight.</TE>

<LD>For Angel fans, these are the saddest of possible words. One win
away.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, and again in 1986, the Angels were one win away from the
World Series. Each time, the Angels had three chances to win that one
game. Each time, the Angels failed.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are one win away, again, one win from winning a
postseason series for the first time in the 42-year history of the
franchise, this time with a resilient team for which history is no
albatross. The Angels are one win away, again, with two chances to
advance to the American League championship series.</LD>
<TE>   And the Angels are one win away from evicting the team that owns
October from the playoffs. In the most spectacular comeback in
franchise history, one that will be retold for the ages, the Angels
spotted the New York Yankees a 6-1 lead, then rode a makeshift
bullpen and a relentless offense to a 9-6 victory Friday.</TE>
<TE>   With Darin Erstad driving home the winning run in the eighth
inning, and Tim Salmon driving in four runs, the Angels took a 2-1
lead in the best-of-five division series. The Angels send ace Jarrod
Washburn to the mound today, in a quest to clinch at home.</TE>
<TE>   The game was a nine-inning thrill ride for the players and for a
deafening crowd of 45,072, the largest in Edison Field history. The
noise never ceased from the red sea, even after the game ended, with
the fans chanting "Let's go Angels!" down the exit ramps and into the
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to somehow come down," Salmon said, "so I can go to
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   This just doesn't happen. The Yankees had not blown a bigger lead
in the postseason since 1956, to the Brooklyn Dodgers, five years
before the Angels were born.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got 16 of their 27 outs from three relievers who did
not open the season in their bullpen. John Lackey, who pitched three
shutout innings in his first relief appearance in either the major or
minor leagues, opened the season at triple A. Scott Schoeneweis, who
did what he could not in Game 1 by retiring Jason Giambi, opened the
season in the starting rotation.</TE>
<TE>   And Francisco Rodriguez, the wonder child with the 95-mph
fastball, the kid who threw his first major league pitch 17 days ago,
the winning pitcher in both Angel victories, opened the season at
double A. Rodriguez, 20, faced six batters and retired all six,
striking out four.</TE>
<TE>   "We should all be so fortunate as to have that stuff and that
makeup," closer Troy Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   "The story was our bullpen," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"Those guys did a great job against an incredible offensive team."</TE>
<TE>   That they did, after starter Ramon Ortiz put the Angels in that
6-1 hole by losing his acquaintance with home plate. Lackey relieved
Ortiz in the third inning, got the last out and returned to the
dugout, where pitching coach Bud Black told him that, if he could
hold the score right there, the Angels would win, 9-6.</TE>
<TE>   Really.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to say things in the dugout to give guys faith," Black
said, almost sheepishly.</TE>
<TE>   The team believed, of course. This is the first team in major
league history to lose 14 of its first 20 games and come back to make
the playoffs. The Rally Monkey lives here, and scoff at your own
peril.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have mounted bigger comebacks, yes, but never on the
October stage. But Salmon doubled home two in the third inning, and
the Angels trailed, 6-3. Adam Kennedy, who came within a triple of
hitting for the cycle, homered in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, Kennedy contributed a sacrifice fly, and the Angels
trailed, 6-5. In the seventh, Scott Spiezio singled home the tying
run.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Erstad doubled home Kennedy with the go-ahead run.
Salmon followed by punctuating the comeback with a two-run
homer--Angels 9, Yankees 6, just as Black called it--and the usually
reserved outfielder pumped his fist as he rounded first base.</TE>
<TE>   "I had goose bumps," Salmon said. "You would have thought it was
the seventh game of the World Series from listening to our crowd....
There's a lot of years of frustration they're letting out, and it's
awesome."</TE>
<TE>   After the unsung and unusual bullpen did its job, Percival trotted
in to do his usual job, retiring the Yankees in order in the ninth.
The Yankees got one hit after the third inning and none after the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   As Giambi flied out for the final out, as the ball settled
harmlessly into the glove of left fielder Garret Anderson, Percival
pumped his fist so high he nearly touched the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rushed the mound to hug, then quickly shifted into
handshake mode, well aware that one more win will not come easily,
certainly not against a Yankee team that erased a two-games-to-none
deficit against Oakland in last year's division series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not over till it's over, to use a cliche from the other
side," Schoeneweis said. "But we've got the guy pitching that we
want."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "Biggest game of my life, so far. Hopefully, there
will be bigger ones."</TE>
<TE>   One win away.</TE>

<TE>   The Comeback</TE>
<TE>   It looked like a long night for the Angels when starting pitcher
Ramon Ortiz struggled from the outset while the Yankees took a 6-1
lead in the top of the third. But Anaheim scored in five of the next
six innings to rally for an improbable 9-6 victory. A look at how the
Angels did it:</TE>
<TE>*--*
THIRD INNING
* With one out and runners on first and second, Tim Salmon doubled to
left, scoring Adam Kennedy and Darin Erstad
Yankees 6, Angels 3
FOURTH INNING
* With two out and the bases empty, Kennedy homered to right
Yankees 6, Angels 4
SIXTH INNING

SEVENTH INNING
* With two out and runners on first and second, Scott Spiezio singled

<TE>   A lack of playoff experience before this American League division
series against the New York Yankees hasn't fazed the Angels, who have
overcome deficits in all three games:</TE>

<HD>Can't Mystique This Rookie's Stuff</HD>
<DH>Angels: The 20-year-old Rodriguez strikes out four of six
batters he faces in getting his second postseason win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the most diligent scouting reports can be worth less than the
paper they're printed on if the player in question has all the tools
scouts seek but lacks the poise to perform under pressure when he
gets to the Show.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' reports on 20-year-old right-hander Francisco
Rodriguez were uniformly glowing, the praise from their triple-A
staff echoing what their double-A personnel had said.</LD>
<LD>   "But you never know until the guy gets here," pitching coach Bud
Black said.</LD>
<TE>   And you never know the heights someone is capable of scaling until
he gets the chance to reach the top of the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, you take that leap of faith with somebody," Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "Sometimes you have to believe and trust."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' trust in Rodriguez, and their scouting reports, has
certainly been vindicated. In the biggest test of his young career,
pitching before an Edison Field-record crowd of 45,072 in a game that
tipped the balance of power in their American League division series
to the Angels' end of the seesaw, Rodriguez added to his budding
legend by striking out four in two perfect relief innings and earning
the win in the Angels' 9-6 comeback victory over the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Rodriguez was pitching in the Class-A California
League. On Friday, he pitched the Angels to within one victory of
advancing to the AL championship series and became the first Angel to
be credited with two postseason triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Yankees--everybody knows they've won so many World
Series," said Rodriguez, who was a late September call-up and beat
out several veterans for a spot on the postseason roster. "If you
make the pitches and keep the ball down, you have a chance. If you
make a mistake, those guys are going to hit you."</TE>
<TE>   Say this much for Rodriguez, whose soft-spoken, polite demeanor
masks a fierce competitive streak: He's a quick study.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, he learned the hard way that any
mistake against New York's savvy hitters will exact a high price. He
gave up a two-run home run to second baseman Alfonso Soriano in the
sixth inning Wednesday, which gave the Yankees a 5-4 lead, but the
Angels rallied and got him off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   He returned the favor Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out Bernie Williams and Robin Ventura in the seventh,
and ended the inning by getting Jorge Posada on a soft liner to
second. In the eighth, Raul Mondesi momentarily stole the thunder
from Angel fans' red Thundersticks by sending left fielder Garret
Anderson to the warning track, but Rodriguez kept his cool, striking
out Nick Johnson swinging and getting Juan Rivera on a called third
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four pitches, two perfect innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He has proven he has electric stuff," Williams said in
admiration.</TE>
<TE>   The kid from Caracas, Venezuela, can now call Anaheim his own.</TE>
<TE>   "You get adrenaline from the crowd," said Rodriguez, who until a
few weeks ago had never played before crowds bigger than 7,000 at
triple-A ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to go out and throw the ball and have fun. As soon as
I cross the line, I want to relax and enjoy the game."</TE>
<TE>   Black compared Rodriguez's poise to that of Bret Saberhagen in
1984 and 1985, when Saberhagen was a starter at 19 and 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the same composure," Black said. "He had it together. He's
loose.... He's doing what people told us he's capable of doing."</TE>
<TE>   Black said Rodriguez might yet improve his fastball, which peaks
at about 94 or 95 mph, and he likes Rodriguez's slider and ability to
mix in a changeup or two.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes teammates confident. "The kid's been doing it
every time," John Lackey said. "As far as his stuff, he's as good as
it gets. He's stepped up in some big situations."</TE>

<TE>   (19-7, 3.75 ERA in season)</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV--Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570), XPRS (1090).</TE>
<TE>   Update--Washburn will start on three days' rest for the second
time this season; he pitched eight shutout innings at Oakland on
three days' rest last month. He started the first game of this series
and received no decision, pitching seven innings and giving up four
runs, all on home runs--solo shots by Derek Jeter and Rondell White
and a two-run homer by Jason Giambi. Wells, starting for the first
time in the series, is 4-0 with a 1.45 ERA in his past four starts.
But he has a 7.15 ERA in day games this season, including an August
game in Anaheim in which the Angels routed him for five runs in two
innings. In 21 career games in Anaheim, he has a 6.89 ERA. He loves
to face Benji Gil (.059) and Scott Spiezio (.118) and hates to face
Garret Anderson (.382) and Troy Glaus (.333).</TE>

<HD>Fast Start for A's Drives It Home</HD>
<DH>American League: First two batters, Durham and Hatteberg,
homer to set tone as Oakland wins, 6-3, at Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics went under and then over the Minnesota Twins on
Friday, lining one home run under the glove of center fielder Torii
Hunter and knocking three others into the Metrodome seats, and now
they're in a position to roll right through the Twins and into the
next round of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Durham opened the game with a fluke inside-the-park homer, and
Scott Hatteberg, Terrence Long and Jermaine Dye had traditional
homers to lead the A's to a 6-3 victory over the Twins in Game 3 of
the American League division series.</LD>
<LD>   A Metrodome-record crowd of 55,932, which at times seemed to
create as much noise as a 747 taking off, saw Oakland left-hander
Barry Zito give up three runs and five hits in six innings to earn
the victory, giving the A's a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-five
series. Oakland, a division series loser to the Yankees in 2000 and
2001, can close out the Twins with a victory in Game 4 today.</LD>
<TE>   "We slipped in Game 1," Durham said of a 7-5 loss, in which the
A's blew leads of 3-0 and 5-1. "Now, we have to finish them off. We
want to go back to Oakland, but we want to go back to rest, not to
play Minnesota [in Game 5]."</TE>
<TE>   The pesky Twins rarely allow opponents to breathe easily. They
fell behind, 3-0, Friday but pecked away at Zito, scoring on A.J.
Pierzynski's bloop RBI single in the fourth and tying the score in
the fifth on Corey Koskie's RBI triple and Hunter's two-out RBI
single.</TE>
<TE>   But Dye led off the sixth with a laser into the left-field seats
off starter Rick Reed to make it 4-3, and the A's scored two
insurance runs in the seventh on Randy Velarde's RBI double and
Miguel Tejada's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   "That home run was crushing," Hunter said of Dye's shot. "We had
just tied the game.... That just crushed us."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's first-inning gaffe didn't help. Both teams were concerned
that the concrete-like surface and decibel levels inside the
Metrodome would affect the game, and those fears were justified.</TE>
<TE>   Durham lined Reed's third pitch of the game up the middle for an
apparent single, but Hunter, after hesitating at first, raced in to
attempt a shoe-string catch. One problem: The ball never hit his
glove, skipping past him and to the wall, 408 feet away, giving
Durham time to circle the bases for an inside-the-park home run.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sinking line drive, and I'm an aggressive player," said
Hunter, who won a Gold Glove award last season. "I made the decision
to go for the ball at the last second, and it went under my glove.
That could have changed the momentum of the game, but I'm always
going to go after those balls."</TE>
<TE>   Hatteberg then drove a home run to right, the first time in
post-season history consecutive homers were hit to start a game.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the first, Jacque Jones lifted a popup to the
right side. Hatteberg, the A's first baseman, drifted toward the
dugout and lost the ball, which bounced about three feet in front of
the first-base bag and into foul territory.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer you stare up there, the worse it is," Hatteberg said.
"I couldn't find it. The sheets [that make up the roof] are the exact
color of a dirty baseball. I don't know why they did that. [My
teammates] are going to make fun of me for weeks, and I'm sure I'll
be on the blooper reel, but you can't catch what you can't see."</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the second, Hunter lifted a popup behind first.
Hatteberg went back and had an easy play until A's second baseman
Mark Ellis, unable to communicate because of the noise, crashed into
Hatteberg, the ball bouncing off the two for an error.</TE>
<TE>   Zito's next pitch slipped out of his hand and flew about 15 feet
straight up, allowing Hunter to reach second. Walks to Doug
Mientkiewicz and Pierzynski loaded the bases with two out, but Zito
recovered to strike out Luis Rivas to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The A's calmed down, and their pitching, defense and power
prevailed. Reliever Ricardo Rincon threw two scoreless innings behind
Zito, and closer Billy Koch had a scoreless ninth for the save,
finally silencing the raucous crowd.</TE>

<HD>Karros' Future Is Hazy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger first baseman Eric Karros underwent arthroscopic surgery to
clean out scar tissue in his left (nonthrowing) shoulder Friday,
addressing a year-old injury that did not appear to be as serious as
feared.</LD>
<LD>   There was some concern Karros may have suffered damage to a
ligament or to the labrum, but Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angel team
physician who performed the surgery, found no extensive structural
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Karros, who hit .271 with a career-low 13 home runs and 73 runs
batted in this season, will begin rehabilitation in another week or
so and is expected to make a full recovery, but his future in Los
Angeles is hazy.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers would love to trade Karros and perhaps make a run at
San Francisco slugger Jeff Kent or Cleveland slugger Jim Thome, who
will be a free agents this winter, but with a guaranteed contract for
$8 million next season and a $9-million option for 2004 that would
vest with 500 plate appearances in 2003, there is virtually no market
for Karros.</TE>
<TE>   "We're contemplating things to get better, and one thing we need
is more power at first base," General Manager Dan Evans said.
"Thirteen homers is not enough. We need to find more run production
at that position. If that means we have to find someone to share time
with [Karros], we have to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Evans wouldn't come out and say it, but he made it clear the
Dodgers have no intention of letting Karros reach the 500 plate
appearances next season, a threshold that would guarantee the option
year of his contract. If the contract doesn't vest, the Dodgers can
buy out the option for $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Karros believes his shoulder injury, which he suffered in 2001,
has hindered his ability to hit for power, but the Dodgers don't seem
convinced that, even if Karros returns at full strength next spring,
he'll be able to provide the 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons he delivered
regularly until 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very clear that for us to win next year, we can't get 14
homers and 73 RBIs from the first-base position," Evans said. "Some
teams can get away with that when they have run-producers at
shortstop, second base and center field."</TE>

<LD>There were several key hits for the Angels, but with Adam Kennedy on
third and one out in the eighth, left-handed hitting Darin Erstad
stepped to the plate against Yankee left-hander Mike Stanton and
stroked a double to right field, giving the Angels their first lead
of the night after trailing, 6-1, in the third inning.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees quickly took the air out of the fans in Edison Field
by scoring three runs in the top of the first off shaky Angel starter
Ramon Ortiz. It appeared it would be a long night for the Angels,
especially after the Yankees tacked on three more runs in the third
to take a five-run lead.</LD>

<HD>Giants Have Inside Stuff</HD>
<DH>National League: Sanders, a former Brave, is happy to share
whatever he knows about Maddux and Glavine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants are benefiting from Reggie Sanders' bad
experience with the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   The Giant right fielder spent one unproductive season with the
Braves in 2000, batting .232 with 11 home runs and 37 runs batted in,
but he learned a lot about how Cy Young Award winners Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine approach batters.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants followed Sanders' tips in Game 1, getting 10 hits
against Glavine and chasing him after five innings in an 8-5 victory
at Turner Field, and they're hoping to have similar success today
against Maddux in Game 3 at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen how they pitch and seen how they approach different
hitters," said Sanders, who singled off Glavine and scored in the
Giants' three-run second Wednesday. "It's fastballs on the outside
part of the plate, consistently going to stay on the outside part of
the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's not exactly a news flash, considering Maddux and
Glavine have openly discussed working the corners throughout their
stellar careers. But Sanders provided insight into what the Giants
could expect in specific situations from the Braves' 1-2 pitching
punch.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize what students of the game those pitchers were,"
Sanders said. "For them, they prepare themselves like a Curt
Schilling, like a Randy Johnson. They have already played the game
before they have played it. They have a plan and they stick with
it.... That's why they've been so successful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, hoping to have his first productive postseason, was
busy off the field during the first two games in Atlanta, fulfilling
his role as godfather to Gary and DeLeon Sheffield's three-week-old
son, Jaden.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry wouldn't let me hold my son," the Atlanta right fielder
said. "He said to Jaden, 'You're going to learn from a real baseball
player.' That's all right. He'll make a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield said Bonds, two for eight with a solo home run and two
runs, isn't fazed by media criticism of his playoff history.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Barry talk about it a lot," said Sheffield, who left the
Dodgers in January.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is not feeling any tension whatsoever in this series. The
family life, and all the other things you've got going on in your
life, are really important to you, so you really don't care about
[criticism]."</TE>

184 yards and the Bulldogs (3-3) batted down Bradlee Van Pelt's
two-point conversion pass attempt with 50 seconds left as the
Bulldogs (3-3) won at Fresno. The Rams fell to 4-2.</TE>

<TE>   Former Colorado quarterback Craig Ochs has been given permission
to talk to Washington about a transfer. Colorado Athletic Director
Dick Tharp rejected a blanket request to allow Ochs to speak to other
Pacific 10 Conference schools on the quarter system, including UCLA.
Ochs' interest in attending a school on a quarter system would mean
that he could enroll immediately and have this season count as a
redshirt year. That would allow him to play next season and have two
years of eligibility remaining.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Scott Rolen will sit out the rest of St. Louis' first-round National
League playoff series against Arizona after injuring his shoulder in
Game 2, and his availability beyond that is uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   "He's out for this series," trainer Barry Weinberg said Friday.
"His future status will be determined later."</LD>
<LD>   Manager Tony La Russa said Friday he didn't know when his third
baseman would be available.</LD>
<TE>   The team released a statement that said a CT scan revealed a
moderate shoulder sprain, and an MRI test revealed no additional
injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals lead the best-of-five series, 2-0. The NL
championship series is scheduled to begin Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know that I don't think he'll play the rest of this
series, and that's enough for now," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the team described the injury as a sprained shoulder.
Rolen was hurt in a seventh-inning collision with Diamondback
pinch-runner Alex Cintron.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa said he wasn't sure what he would do in Game 3 today,
mentioning Albert Pujols and Miguel Cairo as possible replacements.
Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said he empathized with La Russa, having
lost Luis Gonzalez because of a separated shoulder the last week of
the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "As an opposing manager it didn't hurt as bad," Brenly said, "but
putting myself in Tony's shoes and what I've been through this year
with injured players, I know exactly how much that hurts."</TE>

<HD>Moreno Steps Forward When Galaxy Needs It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think Alejandro Moreno is coming into tonight's Major League Soccer
semifinal series opener against the Colorado Rapids wide-eyed and
filled with wonderment?</LD>
<LD>   Think again.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-year-old Galaxy rookie forward, who will be making his
second consecutive postseason start at the Rose Bowl after starting
only seven games in the regular season, is taking it all in stride.</LD>
<TE>   "Exciting? Sure it is, but it's also a huge responsibility,"
Moreno said. "But it's good to have the confidence and the trust of
the coaching staff and I know my teammates are behind me so all I
have to do is go out there and do the things that they ask me to do.
My role is pretty well defined so I just have to do the best that I
can."</TE>
<TE>   And that role is?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm out there basically to take some heat off of Carlos
[Ruiz].... I try to create as much opportunities as I can, not only
for him but also for Cobi Jones so they can run into spaces and
hopefully get behind defenders."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed to work the last time out, with Ruiz and Jones each
getting two goals and an assist in the Galaxy's 5-2 first-round
series-clinching victory over the Kansas City Wizards on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   With defensive midfielder Peter Vagenas out because of a strained
right hamstring and playmaking midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos
benched, Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid moved Jones and Chris Albright to
the midfield, leaving an opening at forward alongside Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno was the surprise starter and played 71 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid expects a more technical series against the Rapids than the
one the Galaxy just survived against the Wizards and thus, Cienfuegos
is back in his starting role of playmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos entered this year's postseason as the league's
third-leading all-time scorer in the playoffs with 27 points on seven
goals and 13 assists. In fact, until being relegated to cheerleading
duty in Game 3 against Kansas City, Cienfuegos had started 31 of the
Galaxy's 32 playoff games.</TE>

<LD>Well-bet California-based horses couldn't win while running over
off-track surfaces Friday at rainy Keeneland in Kentucky, where
Westerly Breeze, at 15-1, scored a surprising win in the $400,000
Walmac International Alcibiades Stakes and Owsley, a 4-1 shot,
rallied to win the $500,000 WinStar Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   Atlantic Ocean, who broke her maiden at Del Mar and won a stake
last month at Turfway Park, couldn't protect a lead against Westerly
Breeze, who had finished fourth in the Turfway race. Ruby's Reception
finished second, beaten by three-quarters of a length, and Final
Round was third.</LD>
<LD>   Time for 1 1/16 miles in the mud was 1:46 4/5.</LD>
<TE>   Affluent, winner of the John Mabee Ramona at Del Mar in her last
start, ran fifth in a six-horse field in the WinStar.</TE>
<TE>   "She warmed up nice and broke good," jockey Pat Day said of the
6-5 favorite, "but on the second turn she just spit out the bit."</TE>
<TE>   Owsley finished 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Snow Dance for her third
win in the last four starts. Suya finished third. The time for 1 3/16
miles over a yielding surface was 1:56 3/5.</TE>

<LD>Two Harbor City Narbonne girls' basketball players announced their
college commitments as Jamie Funn chose USC and Indi Johnson selected
Purdue.</LD>
<LD>   Narbonne Coach James Anderson said USC was the top choice all
along for Funn, a 6-foot-3 forward. Johnson, a 6-4 forward, chose the
Boilermakers over California, UC Santa Barbara, Boston College and
Old Dominion.</LD>
<LD>   Funn averaged 10.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 3.2 steals last season
and Johnson averaged 8.2 rebounds for the Gauchos, who went 27-4 and
reached the Southern California Division I regional final.</LD>

<TE>   Rankings held to form--barely--when North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake traveled to Tustin High on Thursday to take on Santa
Ana Foothill in a boys' water polo match that went down to the final
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Matthies scored three goals to lead the Wolverines, No. 3 in
The Times' rankings and No. 2 in the Southern Section Division I
poll, to a 7-6 victory. Jay Connolly had seven saves for
Harvard-Westlake (9-0).</TE>
<TE>   Foothill, ranked No. 7 by The Times and No. 4 in Division I,
trailed, 6-3, after three quarters, but drew to within 6-4 early in
the fourth. Geoff Wills and Frank Reynolds scored twice for the
Knights (6-4), who closed to within 7-6 with 1:34 to play on Bryan
Oland's goal.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Loumena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dominique Lastrapes of Laguna Hills has committed to play softball
at Washington. Lastrapes, a second baseman at Laguna Hills, had a
school-record .560 batting average last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Waldecker of Garden Grove Pacifica has committed to play
softball at Nebraska. A catcher, Waldecker said she chose Nebraska
over Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martin Iti, the 6-foot-11 Australian basketball player who made
two stops in Orange County, has enrolled at Durham (N.C.) Mt. Zion
Academy, his seventh high school in five states since arriving in the
United States in May 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old senior center, considered among the best big men
in his class, has committed to UNC Charlotte. He will spend this
season playing for Mt. Zion, whose alumni include Orlando Magic
All-Star Tracy McGrady and Phoenix Sun rookie Amare Stoudamire.</TE>
<TE>   Iti played at Anaheim Servite during the 1999-2000 school year
before transferring to Villa Park, where he served a yearlong
athletic suspension for misleading school officials about his
academic status.</TE>
<TE>   Iti spent last year at the Winchendon School, a small New England
prep school, where he averaged 11 points and seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   J. William LaBelle, Winchendon's headmaster, said Iti's guardians
requested a transcript in June.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we can figure, they thought his basketball fortunes
would rise if he went elsewhere," LaBelle said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great kid here, did well in the classroom and was a
perfect gentleman. It wasn't as if he had any particular problems."</TE>

<HD>Arroyo Grande Stops Valencia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Coach Jon Huss predicted, his Arroyo Grande High football team had
trouble dealing with visiting Valencia's superior team speed in a
nonleague game Friday night. But in the end, it was good,
old-fashioned, grind-it-out football that propelled the Eagles to a
28-21 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo Grande, No. 12 in The Times' rankings, took a 21-0 lead on
Jimmy Chambers' two-yard touchdown run with 2 minutes 30 seconds left
in the second quarter. But it took a five-yard touchdown run by
Dustin Robertson with 1:08 left to give the Eagles the victory over
No. 20 Valencia.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson's run capped a seven-play, 51-yard drive for Arroyo
Grande (4-0) after Valencia quarterback Stephen Wright had unloaded a
49-yard punt on a quick kick out of his own end zone.</LD>
<TE>   "We just told ourselves that this was our game to win," said
Robertson, who rushed for 103 yards and two touchdowns in 13 carries.
"When we got in the huddle [after the punt], we said, 'Let's take it
in and win.' "</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (2-2) appeared to be reeling after falling behind by
three touchdowns in the first half, but the Vikings scored on a
37-yard run by Charles Burnley and a 16-yard pass from Wright to
Stephen Bothwell.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia tied the score, 21-21, on Wright's 42-yard touchdown pass
to Shane Morales with 2:43 left in the third quarter, but the Vikings
were later stopped inches short of a first down on fourth and two
from the Arroyo Grande 32-yard line with 8:23 left in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Burnley rushed for 163 yards in 27 carries, but only 28 in the
second half.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roosevelt converted three mistakes by Dorsey into a 29-21 victory
over the defending City Section champion in a nonleague game Friday
night at Roosevelt.</LD>
<LD>   Jody Adewale rushed for 116 yards and scored on runs of 31 and
eight yards to help give the Rough Riders (4-0) the win. The Dons
(1-3) had two botched snaps on punts that led to Roosevelt's final
two scores.</LD>
<LD>   Adewale's eight-yard run gave Roosevelt a 22-21 lead with 9:22 to
play after the first bad snap. Dorsey, coming off a 5-0 loss to Santa
Margarita, then had another bad snap on its ensuing possession and
Roosevelt's Antonio Sanchez recovered the ball to start the Rough
Riders toward their last scoring drive.</LD>
<TE>   Nathan Holloway threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Sanchez on a
reverse with about two minutes remaining to clinch it.</TE>
<TE>   The Rough Riders scored on the first play from scrimmage when Luis
Cortez intercepted a Robert Childers pass and returned it 15 yards
for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Childers would rebound for the Dons, throwing three touchdown
passes to Jerome Johnson for a 21-14 halftime lead. Childers
completed seven of 15 passes for 91 yards with two interceptions.
Jody Rucks rushed for 105 yards in 19 carries for the Dons.</TE>
<TE>   Rafer Weigel</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Hart 27, Lake Balboa Birmingham 14--Hart's often
overlooked defense came up with the game's decisive play as
linebacker Brian Elledge returned a fumble 46 yards on the first play
of the fourth quarter to extend the Indians' unbeaten streak to 26
games with the victory at Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   Cody Kase hit Patriot quarterback Ryan Lombardo to jar the ball
loose. Elledge grabbed it and ran behind a Hart caravan to break a
14-14 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham's only turnover killed its chance at an upset, but
offensive breakdowns in Hart territory also were a contributing
factor. After the first quarter, the Patriots (2-2) couldn't score
though they crossed midfield five times.</TE>
<TE>   Hart (3-0-1) added the finishing touch when quarterback Sean
Norton took advantage of Birmingham's goal-line defense on fourth
down and flipped the ball to a wide-open Kevin Ciccone, who took it
in for a 30-yard score with 41 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The play capped a 14-play drive in which the Indians kept the ball
for more than seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham outgained Hart, 327 yards to 294. Lombardo completed 17
of 29 passes for 230 yards. But all the Patriots could muster was a
59-yard pass play from Lombardo to Brian Baylor and a one-yard
touchdown by Dennis Keyes in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Norton completed 18 of 25 passes for 208 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo 31, Crenshaw 6--Jeff Ferrier kicked a 51-yard field
goal, one yard shy of Nick Gilliam's school record, and Mark Dunn
scored on a 65-yard pass play as the Diablos moved their record to
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Tadman, a cornerback who is filling in while starting
quarterback Josh Rodarmel's broken collarbone mends, threw only nine
passes and two of them were intercepted, but of his five completions,
two went for touchdowns. Tailback Ryan Holmes gained 136 yards in 18
carries and scored twice.</TE>

<HD>Keeping It Simple</HD>
<DH>Los Altos High's straight-forward approach breeds a
tradition that rivals any school</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no sacred helmet from which players draw strength, no sign
above the door that they tap on their way to the football field.
There's no axiom that the team lives by printed on the cover of a
playbook or the back of a T-shirt.</LD>
<LD>   There is only football and fundamentals at Hacienda Heights Los
Altos High, a straight-forward, streamlined football program that
doesn't try to do too much, but still accomplishes plenty.</LD>
<LD>   In Southern California, top-ranked Long Beach Poly sets the
standard for high school football, having won five Southern Section
titles since 1972.</LD>
<TE>   In the same span, Los Altos, which ran its record to 3-1 (the loss
was a forfeit) Friday with a 14-10 come-from-behind victory over
Chino Hills Ayala, has won nine.</TE>
<TE>   But while Poly enjoys the spotlight of Division I, Los Altos has
won titles two of the last three seasons in the relative obscurity of
Division VII. Indeed, the Conquerors have one of the best football
programs that few people have heard of--three title games in a row,
and a trip to the semifinals the year before that. And that's just
fine with them.</TE>
<TE>   In an age when Santa Margarita has a souvenir program that rivals
most colleges, Poly suits up 99 players, and some bright-eyed
coordinator at this minute is diagraming a better mousetrap, Los
Altos has discovered that less is more.</TE>
<TE>   "We're about as low-key as you can get," said Greg Gano, who is in
his sixth season as coach. "Just take care of business. Do what you
have to do. This isn't Camp Pendleton."</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos keeps its approach simple.</TE>
<TE>   Each opponent gets the same treatment; the Conquerors prepare for
strong teams the same way they prepare for weak ones. "That way, the
kids aren't confused," defensive coordinator Lee Fair said. "The
adjustments we make are technique adjustments. We try to work within
what we do all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The focus is always on fundamentals. Every day, every week,
practice is the same. "We tell our kids that if we do what we're
supposed to do, and we do it with the right technique, if they beat
us it's because they're a better player or they have better people,"
Fair said. "We make sure we don't beat ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The players respect their coaches--and vice versa. "They're
players' coaches," said senior Caleb Flores, a receiver and defensive
back who is averaging 19.0 yards per reception. "They take care of
us, and we feel the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows his part in the game plan. "We all know our role in
order to be successful," said Carlos Ordonez, the senior quarterback
who has completed 28 of 52 passes for 612 yards, eight touchdowns and
four interceptions. "The coaches know what we can do and don't put us
in situations where we can fail."</TE>
<TE>   Another example of getting more from less: Four years ago, the
most talented player on the team was also its biggest distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "We booted him, and the kids never mentioned his name again," Gano
said. "The next week we started a 23-game winning streak."</TE>
<TE>   This season, Los Altos has plenty of options on offense, including
junior running backs Randall Brown and Daniel Drayton; Brown is
averaging 6.9 yards per carry with six touchdowns, and Drayton 5.3
with nine.</TE>
<TE>   But the strength of the team is its defense, led by senior tackle
Armando Soto and junior end Brigham Harwell, who had 18 sacks last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Gano gets much of the credit for continuing the tradition started
by Dwayne DeSpain, who retired after 29 seasons with a 244-94-9
record (71.6%), including 44-16 in the playoffs and 7-2 in
championship games.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a lot of guys beating the door down when the
position became available," DeSpain said.</TE>
<TE>   Gano was among those advised to steer clear of it. "I had guys
telling me it was like replacing John Wooden," said Gano, who had
been head coach at Covina Northview for two seasons. "But what bigger
challenge is there? I never really felt the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Dwayne told me it would take three years to build the program
back up. We went 7-4-1 the first year, then 10-2, 13-1, 14-0. I kept
things just about the same within the program."</TE>
<TE>   And the victories just keep coming.</TE>
<TE>   Against No. 24 Ayala, a Division II team, No. 11 Los Altos trailed
at halftime, 10-0.</TE>
<TE>   But in the second half, the defense tightened and the Conquerors
took the momentum and the game--the program's 300th victory since
DeSpain took over in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Brown rushed 21 times for 136 yards, including a 46-yard score in
the third quarter that capped a six-play, 95-yard drive that cut
Ayala's lead to 10-7. Brown also set up the game-winner, returning a
punt 19 yards to the Ayala 35 midway through the final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Four plays later, Drayton scored from 10 yards out with 4 minutes
31 seconds left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the defense took over. In the final minutes, Jeff
Castro and Ray Martinez both broke up pass plays that would have gone
for key gains. On the game's last play, Ben Chavez intercepted a
desperation pass at the Los Altos 10 to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gano's record at Los Altos is now 56-11 (83.6%), and he says this
team is "a lot better" than last year's 11-3 squad.</TE>
<TE>   Like the players, he credits the coaching staff, many of whom are
holdovers from DeSpain: offensive coordinator Rick Fries, who has
been on staff for 28 seasons; defensive backs coach Rick Godinez, who
was on DeSpain's first championship team in 1972 and has been on
staff 21 seasons, and defensive line coach John Howing, who is
regarded as the backbone of the organization for the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics credit another reason: recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   The Conquerors have had five players with varsity experience
transfer into the program in the last five years, including Drayton
from Montebello and Pete Suarez, a linebacker and kicker, from
Bassett this season.</TE>
<TE>   The team didn't benefit from transfers in 1999 and 2000, when it
won section titles.</TE>
<TE>   "DeSpain won for so long, I'm sure he heard every type of
allegation there is," Gano said. "When you're winning, people are
going to point fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos is the top-rated team in its new playoff classification,
Division VI.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Conquerors lost the Division VII title game to
Covina Charter Oak, 7-6, in large part because of two missed field
goals and a missed extra point. "I think we're all a little hurt
about the way it went down last year," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a program that takes setbacks in stride. Forced to
forfeit its opener, a 42-21 victory over Menifee Paloma Valley,
because of an administrative error six months ago, Gano's stance was,
"These things happen."</TE>
<TE>   "We told the kids, look behind you at the smoke in the distance,"
he said, referring to a recent fire that charred nearly 40,000 acres
in the Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "People are losing their homes. People have it worse than us
forfeiting a game."</TE>
<TE>   Another example: Four turnovers in the first half were responsible
for the Conquerors falling behind La Mirada, 16-13, two weeks ago.
But there wasn't a lot of ranting and raving. Instead, Gano simply
told his team to play the way they're capable of playing.</TE>
<TE>   So in the second half they did, and won, 41-16.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't yell and scream," Gano said. "We just take care of
business."</TE>

<DH>Football: Huskies stretch regular-season win streak to 21
with 26-12 victory at San Clemente.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corona Centennial High ignored a banner reading "This Is Triton
Country" hanging over a bridge above Interstate 5, and made itself
feel right at home Friday during a 26-12 nonleague victory over San
Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   The Huskies knocked out San Clemente quarterback Beau Budde midway
through the first quarter and turned five Triton turnovers into 20
points en route to winning their 21st consecutive regular-season game
dating to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Centennial quarterback Shaun Lewis completed three touchdown
passes, two of them to DeAnthony Hicks, for the Huskies (4-0), No. 10
in The Times' rankings.</LD>
<TE>   But Centennial Coach Matt Logan didn't like everything he saw from
his team. The Huskies missed blocking assignments, misread passing
routes and Lewis had two passes intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a ton of mistakes," Logan said. "All we care about is
winning the game, however we needed to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who completed 19 of 34 passes, connected on his third
touchdown pass to Ramiro Hernandez on a 15-yard play early in the
fourth quarter for the final score.</TE>
<TE>   Backup San Clemente quarterback Cole Bergquist played admirably in
Budde's absence, completing his first seven passes and finishing 12
of 24 for 115 yards. But he had two passes intercepted in the third
quarter as Centennial increased a one-point halftime lead to eight.
The No. 13 Tritons (3-1) trailed, 7-6, entering the third quarter but
Bergquist had his first pass of the second half intercepted by
linebacker Donovan Brown, who returned the ball to the Triton 24-yard
line.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis found Hicks streaking over the middle for a 15-yard
touchdown pass three plays later to make it 14-6.</TE>
<TE>   Bergquist bulled ahead for a one-yard touchdown run midway through
the third quarter to pull San Clemente within 14-12, but his pass on
the two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis found Hicks just over the goal line on a four-yard touchdown
completion with 50 seconds left in the third quarter, giving
Centennial a 20-12 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Husky running back Terrell Jackson, who was averaging 222 yards
rushing a game, was held to 77 in 18 carries. Logan said the junior
was nursing knee and shoulder injuries.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente running back Cheyne Verhagen ran for 97 of his
game-high 144 yards after halftime.</TE>

<LD>Matthew Lawhorn's fourth-down pass from the 17-yard line fell
incomplete in the end zone with 20 seconds to play, and La Verne
Damien's second goal-line stand of the game was enough to perserve a
14-9 victory over host La Puente Bishop Amat in a nonleague game
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Amat (3-1), the No. 15 team in The Times' rankings, drove
56 yards in 14 plays in the final 2 minutes 30 seconds, but the
defense of Damien (3-1) responded. Linebacker Joey Rios sacked
Lawhorn for an 11-yard loss on third and six at the Damien six-yard
line with 28 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   Damien ended the first half by stopping Bishop Amat on first and
goal from the 10 with 40 seconds left. On third down, Lawhorn fumbled
the pitch intended for Chris Seals, sending the Lancers back to the
21 with four seconds left. Aaron Arias missed a 41-yard field goal
attempt as time expired, but Bishop Amat led, 9-7.</LD>
<TE>   Damien's Ian Johnson rushed 27 times for 174 yards and Bishop
Amat's Seals carried 21 times for 119 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson rushed seven times for 56 yards in Damien's 10-play,
76-yard drive that culminated in a 13-yard scoring run by Frank
Fontes, giving the Spartans a 14-9 lead with 2:12 left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Damien sacked Lawhorn three times and had three interceptions, but
the junior completed 16 of 27 passes for 197 yards.</TE>
<TE>   John Klima</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola 21, Antelope Valley 19--Second-ranked Loyola beat back
a furious Antelope Valley rally by blocking a 27-yard field goal with
3.6 seconds left to preserve the victory at Santa Monica College.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Cuellar, a senior defensive back, flew in from the left side
and, with his forearms, blocked Johnny Walker's field goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs (4-0), who led, 21-0, on an 11-yard touchdown run by Bo
Renaud with 2:18 left in the half, remained among the unbeaten....
barely.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, a senior quarterback for Antelope Valley, rushed for 112
yards and two touchdowns in 24 carries. His 33-yard touchdown run
brought the Antelopes to within 21-19 with 7:40 left.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud rushed for 152 yards and three touchdowns in 25 carries,
though Antelope Valley (3-1) stopped both Renaud and Loyola in the
second half, giving up only 82 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill 28, Orange El Modena 24--Don Poole connected
with receiver Yoko Hamamura for a 42-yard touchdown play with 1:02
left, completing a 21-point comeback by Foothill at Tustin High.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill (4-0) trailed 21-0 at halftime and 24-8 after the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Poole, who completed 14 of 19 passes for 326 yards and four
touchdowns, threw touchdown passes of 48, 49, and 42 yards in the
last quarter. Hamamura, who caught four passes for 103 yards, had two
touchdown receptions. Quincy Lever had five catches for 111 yards and
one touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback was a reversal of the teams' game last year, when El
Modena overcame a 24-7 third-quarter deficit to win, 27-24.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Pitre had 155 rushing yards and two touchdowns in 19
carries to lead El Modena (2-2). Daniel Dixon had 155 yards in 31
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 26, Encino Crespi 7--Mike Allen kicked
field goals of 39, 32, 31 and 26 yards and Brandon Clayton broke off
a decisive 57-yard touchdown run to start the second half to lift
host Notre Dame (4-0) in a nonleague game.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton, a junior tailback, finished with 153 yards rushing in 24
carries. Crespi (3-1) was held to 56 yards total offense.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Fontana Kaiser 49, Lancaster Paraclete 7--Kaiser (3-0-1) avenged
its only regular-season loss from last season, defeating small-school
power Paraclete (3-1) at Fontana High.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser held Paraclete to a total of 75 yards of offense and ended
the Spirits' winning streak at 28 games.</TE>

<HD>Was Scioscia Right? His Guess Just as Good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To all you second-guessers of Mike Scioscia, such as Plaschke,
Newhan, McCarver and company:</LD>
<LD>   To answer your question of why Scioscia did not bring in Troy
Percival in the eighth inning of Game 1 you only have to look at Game
2, when he did bring him in during the eighth. After successfully
getting out of the inning on Wednesday, Percival proceeded to get
knocked around in the ninth and ended up facing the winning run for
the last two batters of the game.</LD>
<LD>   If you need to point fingers, look at the umpire's blown call at
first in the first inning that could have gotten the Angels off to a
big inning, not at the American League manager of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Roger Zuch</TE>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do you think that Phil Jackson keeps Kobe on his "normal" rest in
the playoffs when the other team is making a game-turning run? Did
Gretzky take every fourth shift in the Cup finals for Edmonton? Did
Jim Brown or Emmitt Smith ever come out of the fourth quarter of a
playoff game to save himself for the next game? Then what exactly was
Mike Scioscia thinking?</TE>
<TE>   Craig Dunkin</TE>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' playoff pitching legacy continues, although instead of
Gene Mauch pulling the starting pitcher too early, Mike Scioscia left
the short relievers in too long. His decision is a tough one,
stemming from trying to make what he thought was the best decision at
the moment, while at the same time thinking ahead concerning unknown
situations that may or may not happen based only on speculated
scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   With that being said, why can't Scioscia just admit he blew it?
Sometimes you just have to put in your best pitcher to slam the door
shut and not worry about the thought of extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   In football, they say, don't go for the tie, go for the win. That
should have been the Angels' philosophy, especially playing in the
home of a strong enemy .</TE>
<TE>   I guess that's why I'm not paid the big bucks. These managers have
to make decisions, and live with the fact that the outcome will be
material for future baseball folklore.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Umeda</TE>
<TE>   Monterey Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with great interest Doug DeCinces' second-guessing of Mike
Scioscia's managing in Thursday's Times. Lest anyone forget, Dougie,
wasn't it you who, with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth
inning of Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS against the Red Sox, popped out to
shallow right (or more accurately, deep second)? Those of us fans
with more than just a blurry recollection of Angel history know that
it is you, not the unfortunate Donnie Moore, who is most to blame for
the Angels' failure to reach the World Series that year.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, please keep your comments to yourself. It is
apparent that you couldn't even manage your own at-bats, much less
someone else's pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew M. Weiss</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some advice to the Angels from a longtime Dodger fan: Try to have
every game come down to a Raul Mondesi at-bat. The last clutch hit he
got was on a sandlot in the Dominican Republic.</TE>

<TE>   OK, who's the wiseacre Trojan or Irish booster who sneaked onto
the N.Y. Times computer server and hacked into it, anointing Notre
Dame and USC No. 1 and No. 2 in its college football rankings? No
offense to both programs, but it's no longer the halcyon Heisman days
for these schools. Is past glory the mitigating factor in the warped
poll? If this were so, shouldn't we rank Marshall and BYU No. 3 and
No. 4 simply because they bucked the trends and were undefeated some
years ago?</TE>

<LD>As I return yet another strip of playoff tickets, the Dodgers led us
to believe that the reason they didn't make the playoffs was because
of the onset of injuries to the starting pitching. Because a healthy
Kaz Ishii won fewer games than Kevin Beirne in the last two months
and a healthy Andy Ashby was stuck on nine wins for the last two
months, this is utterly absurd.</LD>
<LD>   The reason is simple: The Dodgers led the league in grounding into
double plays, they left the most runners on base and they were shut
out 13 times ... 10 at home. The bottom line is the Dodgers weren't
very good and they were boring.</LD>

<TE>   So here it is, one day after the regular season, and already Ross
Newhan is on Page 1 with a column declaring that it is the Dodgers'
responsibility to spend more money on a power-hitting RBI player.
Farther back in the same section, it is forecast that Adrian Beltre
and Odalis Perez will receive big raises from an arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine being an owner and having the L.A. Times call you out to
spend even more money or risk the indignation of the community,
knowing that some other third party is about to volunteer you to give
your employees big raises based primarily on what goes on everywhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   Let us all remember those two factoids the next time you hear
players or agents or columnists declaring that the owners have only
themselves to blame for rising salaries in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Hainline</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's only fitting that one of the reasons the Giants are in the
postseason is because Tom Goodwin, who is still being paid by the
Dodgers after they released him this spring, has been somewhat of a
catalyst for the Giants' offense, and an even bigger nemesis to the
Dodgers. That being said, it would only seem even more fitting if the
Dodgers were smart to realize the impact of current
Giant-free-agent-to-be Jeff Kent's bat in their lineup next season.</TE>

<TE>   Sunday's Fan Appreciation Day at Dodger Stadium was a
disappointing bust to this fan. Courtesy appearances by Paul Lo Duca,
Dave Hansen and Shawn Green notwithstanding, I endured a perfunctory
nongame by players I never knew existed. And the giveaways were
embarrassing. Gas fireplace logs, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think I'm alone in feeling the fans were not appreciated.
Insulted was more like it.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Nakamura</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What do you think the Dodger brass is going to talk about during
the off-season?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied with a third-place finish, that's where we finished
last year."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if we're the only team in baseball that hasn't won a
playoff game in 14 ... er, 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   "We still pack 'em in the park, even when we lose on a consistent
basis, so what's the problem?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hearing some rumors that, because we have the third-highest
payroll in baseball, a few bobblehead fanatics expect us to get
beyond third place in a five-team division."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the media is responsible for setting expectations too
high for our fans in April, and they begin to think we can really
compete with Arizona and San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Michael</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's unarguable: The 2002 Dodgers fell short. Their offense was
frequently less productive than the given situation required, leaving
too many men stranded on base, and the pitching, while strong at the
start, took enough blows that titanic efforts by Hideo Nomo, Odalis
Perez and Eric Gagne were, in the end, simply not enough. These facts
are obvious to anyone who even casually follows the game, though
professional sneerers like T.J. Simers get paid--and I'll wager far
more handsomely than I do at my trade--to point them out well past
the point of tedium.</TE>
<TE>   What Simers and his ilk miss about the Dodgers can be found on the
face of my 2 1/2-year-old daughter whenever she steps into Dodger
Stadium, or sees the Dodger logo, or hears Vin Scully's voice on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Those moments are more valuable to me than the opportunity to
righteously condemn a team that struggled in 2002 through injuries
and ever-shifting lineups--while improving their record yet again.
Despite their shortcomings, my daughter and I will be back in 2003 to
enjoy a hopefully even more successful Dodger summer. I'll withdraw
my support only when Jim Tracy's team starts phoning in their
performances on the field the way Simers does with his knee-jerk
vomitus in the sports section.</TE>

<LD>Did the loss in the Ryder Cup by the U.S. team mean that much to us?
Not really. Not after what happened last September and why this event
was postponed a year. The European team deserved to win because they
played better, wanted it more, and really played well as a team. What
really upset me was the way the American squad looked on the course.
They looked as if they really didn't want to be there. They looked
like robots and played without any real emotion or fire.</LD>

<LD>It is now very obvious what the NFL and the media are conspiring to
do. They're trying to force-feed us a heavy dose of junk food better
known as the San Diego Chargers.</LD>
<LD>   First the Chargers move their training facilities to L.A. Next the
NFL gets them on TV in the L.A. market as much as possible. They even
cut into the Raider game with Jerry Rice nine yards away from
breaking Walter Payton's seemingly insurmountable record for yards
from scrimmage. The final insult was the front of The Times sports
page, a picture of a San Diego Charger record being tied.</LD>
<LD>   We hate Al Davis as much as you do, but we will be a Raider town
until we get an expansion team.</LD>

<LD>Corona Kool makes her first appearance in more than seven months as
the 127-pound highweight in tonight's $54,150 Las Damas Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Lucas Racing Inc. and trained by Donna McArthur, the
5-year-old First Down Dash mare was last seen winning the Los
Alamitos Winter Championship on March 2. It was her 14th victory in
24 starts.</LD>
<LD>   In the 400-yard Las Damas, which is a Grade II, Corona Kool will
break from Post 4 in the field of eight and will be ridden, as usual,
by Sam Thompson.</LD>
<TE>   Her main rival is Running Bac, who will be looking for her fifth
win in a row for owner J. Francisco Diaz and trainer Juan Aleman.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. I Dream Of Flyin. 2. Greenspan GVL. 3. Painted
Indian Summer. 4. Lotta Bang. 5. Fly Hot Rod Fly. 6. Beda Special. 7.
Babe With Rhythm. 8. Royal Domain. 9. Miss Absolut. 10. Corona Kool.
11. This Wins For You.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Ken Mars Secret, Royal Domain and Meters Honor in the
eighth, La Classique and Miss Absolut in the ninth, single Corona
Kool in the 10th and Slinker, Pacines Lady, Dashin Mystery Man and
This Wins For You in the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: BW Romas Royal is a new face from Idaho in the
second race for a winning barn. Jazzin Janet drops into a softer spot
in the fifth for trainer Curley Ortiz.</TE>

<TE>   Update: The Crew is well rested after its unlikely sweep of the
defending MLS Cup champion San Jose Earthquakes. The Revolution,
meanwhile, won a playoff series for the first time in franchise
history and is aiming to play for the league championship on its home
field as MLS Cup 2002 is Oct. 20 at Gillette Stadium. Columbus needs
to slow forward Taylor Twellman, the league's leading scorer in the
regular season. Revolution defender Carlos Llamosa is out for Game 1
as his suspension for "prolonged and aggressive dissent" in the
Chicago series was extended.</TE>

<TE>   Update:  Colorado's 1-0 overtime win on April 27 is the lone
smudge on the Galaxy's sterling 13-1-2 record at the Rose Bowl,
including the playoffs. And while the Galaxy and Rapids split their
four meetings this year, the Galaxy held a 9-5 advantage in aggregate
goals. Still, the Galaxy must respect the Rapids' high-scoring

<LD>The hits keep coming for the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   Quentin Richardson, their standout reserve guard, injured his
right knee while running Friday morning at the College of the Desert
in Palm Desert. He underwent an MRI exam, which revealed a partial
tear of his medial collateral ligament, while teammates completed
their practice. He will be forced to stay off his leg for at least
the next two weeks, and the timetable for his return is uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson limped out of the gym, needing help from athletic
trainer Jasen Powell to get into a car to drive to a nearby hospital.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers already are without power forward Elton Brand, who
had arthroscopic knee surgery last week, small forward Lamar Odom
(sprained ankle) and backup guards Keyon Dooling (ankle) and Bryant
Stith (knee).</TE>
<TE>   Cherokee Parks, battling for a reserve forward spot, has been
sidelined the last three days because of flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Only 13 of the 19 players on the training camp roster were fit to
participate in a scrimmage during the evening session Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers face the Lakers in the first exhibition for each team
Tuesday at Bakersfield. The Clippers open the season Oct. 30 against
the Cleveland Cavaliers at Staples Center, and it's possible they
could be without three of their top six players.</TE>
<TE>   "With Q, Elton and Lamar out, we're missing three guys who could
be starting for us," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "Lamar is going to
start the season on the injured list. There's a good chance Elton
Brand also will start the season on the injured list. We'll see about
Keyon. Obviously, Bryant Stith is not ready to go either.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer to have Q, Elton Brand, Lamar Odom and Keyon
Dooling healthy and ready to play. [But] we've got good players.
We've got good depth. We've got to make sure our [healthy] guys are
playing at a high level."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was the Clippers' first substitute in most games last
season and was the team's third-leading scorer, averaging 13.6 points
in 26.6 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that Richardson will move into the starting lineup
this season, dropping shooting guard Eric Piatkowski into a reserve
role. Gentry liked the jolt of energy the team received whenever
Richardson entered games, however. He believed Richardson to be a
more effective reserve than Piatkowski.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm open," Gentry said. "Obviously, Elton and Michael
[Olowokandi] and Andre Miller will start. We'll see if Q can battle
for a spot. I don't worry about who starts. It's an old coaches'
cliche, but it's more about who finishes."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry hoped to see a good deal of such newcomers as guard Marko
Jaric, a 2000 draft pick, and forwards Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely,
their top picks in the 2002 draft. Now, Gentry has no choice but to
play those three and a number of others extensively during the
Clippers' eight-game exhibition schedule.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brand arrived in Southern California on Thursday and the Clippers
expected him to travel Friday afternoon to Palm Desert to begin his
rehabilitation exercises with the team's training staff today.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said he talked with Brand Thursday night. "He said his knee
looks great," Gentry said. "It's just a time thing. It takes time for
it to heal. That's what we're looking at."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal's recovery from toe surgery is "textbook perfect"
after three weeks, Dr. Robert Mohr said Friday, a little more than
three weeks after the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr cleared O'Neal for rehabilitation work on a Precor machine,
which allows O'Neal to run without excessive pounding on his feet. He
already had been riding a stationary bike daily.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr, the chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical Center, said
O'Neal is "on schedule to be close to being play-ready at the
six-week point," though it remains impossible to predict O'Neal's
return to the Laker lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very comfortable with where he is," Mohr said. "He's moving
along textbook perfect. The main thing, however, is we don't want to
lose progress by pushing him too quickly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner David Stern is expected to make this year's ring and
banner ceremony Oct. 29 at Staples Center. Last year, Stern sent
deputy Russ Granik, remaining in New York for Michael Jordan's  first
game back with the Washington Wizards. The Wizards open Oct. 30....
The Lakers scrimmaged Thursday night and Friday, and assistant Tex
Winter said he thought the newcomers--Kareem Rush and Tracy
Murray--were beginning to grasp the offense.</TE>

<LD>From the muscle tightness that prompted Mike Mussina to leave Game 3
of the division series with the Angels after only four innings, to
the pain being inflicted by Anaheim hitters, that "best pitching
staff" in Joe Torre's seven years as the New York Yankee manager is
on its back, hurting in more ways than one.</LD>
<LD>   "They're taking it to us pretty good," General Manager Brian
Cashman said after another improbable pounding in which the Angels
rallied from a 6-1 deficit for a 9-6 victory that may have left his
Yankees beyond emergency care.</LD>
<LD>   They must win today to send the series back to New York for a
decisive fifth game Sunday, but their vaunted pitchers have given no
indication they can impede that relentless Angel offense, which
responded to the beat of an Edison Field crowd of 45,072 with 12 more
hits, bringing their three-game totals to 41 hits and 22 runs.</LD>
<TE>   "To say I'm surprised would be disrespectful to the Angels,"
Cashman said. "I think what's happening is a combination of us not
pitching to our capability and the Angels having an extremely
volatile offense. I want to be careful not to take anything away from
them because they're forcing the action, making things happen. We
have to make better pitches, but in some cases they're hitting good
pitches."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the Angels are now hitting .369 and have scored in
15 of the 26 innings in which they have batted. The Yankees, who
ranked fourth in the American League with a 3.87 earned-run average,
have a 7.62 ERA for the three games with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday's off day, Andy Pettitte, who had lasted only three
innings as New York's Game 2 starter, had tried to come to grips with
his staff's inability to put the Angels away and said, "I still think
we're better than they are, starting pitching-wise, and I think we're
due."</TE>
<TE>   Due? Pettitte is still waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees built that 6-1 lead at the expense of Ramon Ortiz, who
lasted only 2 2/3 innings, but by the time Mussina left with a groin
strain in his right leg, it was 6-4, and the Angels didn't let up
against Jeff Weaver, Mike Stanton and Steve Karsay, three renowned
baseball names working out of the Yankee bullpen and outpitched on
this October night by rookies John Lackey and Francisco Rodriguez and
a left-hander, Scott Schoeneweis, who is in his first half-season of
relief assignments.</TE>
<TE>   In Cashman's words, Lackey, Schoeneweis and Rodriguez "stabilized
the early bleeding" and enabled the Angels to reap the benefits of
their rally, ultimately joining with closer Troy Percival to limit
the Yankees to one hit over the last six innings.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the Angels scored five runs off Weaver, Stanton and
Karsay in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings, with the decisive
three coming in the eighth as Adam Kennedy and Darin Erstad doubled,
and Tim Salmon homered.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they had a tough lineup," Stanton said. "We knew they
didn't strike out a lot and didn't walk a lot. We knew they worked
the count and put the bat on the ball, and they did it tonight on
what I thought were some quality pitches I made."</TE>
<TE>   If so, the Angels trashed the quality, saddling the left-hander
with four hits and three runs in 1 2/3 innings--and the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Yankee relievers are suddenly working overtime because
none of the celebrated starters have gotten past the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens went 5 2/3 innings in Game 1 and Pettitte went his
three before Mussina limped out after four. The Angels have forced
the three starters to deliver 249 pitches in 12 2/3 innings and they
have collected 22 hits and scored 12 runs in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Mussina had leads of 3-0 and 6-1 before he left with the score,
6-4, and Torre made no excuse for his starter.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the groin that gave up the runs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was OK at that point."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing OK with the Yankee pitching, however, and Torre
said, "It's definitely capable of doing a better job, but I don't
want to say we're totally to blame here. I think you have to credit
the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "They're good. We knew they were good coming in, and right now
they're playing with a great deal of confidence, they're playing very
aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we just haven't been able to do our job as well as
they have."</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't change today, the Yankees will be forced to pack
their wounded pride and $135-million payroll and head back to the
Bronx without the accompaniment of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   It will be up to David Wells to heal those wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Wells was 19-7 this year and has an 8-1 postseason record in 19
games. He also has a 16-10 record against the Angels. However, he is
6-6 with a 6.89 ERA at Edison Field, where the Angels really don't
need the Rally Monkey the way the Yankees are pitching.</TE>

<LD>Cristie Kerr capped a course-record 64 with her second eagle of the
round Friday and took a one-shot lead over Annika Sorenstam after two
rounds of the Samsung World Championship at Vallejo, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Kerr's eight-under-par round at Hiddenbrooke Golf Club left her at
12-under for tournament.</LD>
<LD>   She chipped in from off the green on the par-five 18th to complete
her round with a birdie-birdie-eagle finish.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam, who had seven birdies in a 67, was at 11 under, one
stroke ahead of Rosie Jones, who shot a 66.</TE>

at Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Albus shot a four-under 68 that left him in a three-way tie

<HD>There's a Special Kind of Stress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raider kicker Sebastian Janikowski was arrested this week for
suspicion of drunk driving. On the NFL shock meter, that falls
somewhere between Daniel Snyder is pompous and the Bengals are 0-4.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone with a vague recollection of Janikowski's background could
see this coming. From his wild college days at Florida State--where
he had at least six brushes with the law involving drugs or
alcohol--to his face plant last year on the dance floor of a San
Francisco nightclub, he is trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Don't feel too sorry for the Raiders, who wasted a first-round
pick on him; they knew what they were getting. The guy to sympathize
with is special-teams coach Bob Casullo, who came into the league
with Janikowski in 2000 and whose fortunes are tied to the
24-year-old knucklehead.</LD>
<TE>   Of all the coaching jobs in the NFL, being in charge of special
teams must be the most stressful. Your fate rests in the hands--and
on the feet--of the team's youngest and often least experienced
players. Your practice time is very limited; it's almost an
afterthought with many teams. And the stakes are extremely high.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the league's 32 teams have changed special-teams coaches
in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   It's the only job in football in which you can go from a great
coach to a buffoon in the amount of time it takes a kick returner to
run from one end zone to the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had an urge to stick my foot out and trip a guy when
he ran past me," said Joe Avezzano, who has been with the Dallas
Cowboys since 1990, making him the dean of special-teams coaches.
"But you do want to crawl in a hole when something bad happens.
Because there's no one else that will take the hit on that. On
offense, you've got four or five coaches to share the blame. If
there's a mistake in the kicking game, it's on you."</TE>
<TE>   Just think how Denver's Frank Bush felt Monday night, when his
field-goal unit found its way into the NFL record books in a most
discouraging way. Bronco kicker Jason Elam, one of the game's most
reliable players, ended the first half by coming up short on a long
field-goal try. Baltimore's Chris McAlister caught the ball in the
end zone, then bolted past a slew of lumbering linemen for a 107-yard
touchdown, the longest play in league history.</TE>
<TE>   Then, there's Casullo, who was floating on a cloud all week after
Raider rookie Phillip Buchanon returned two punts for touchdowns,
sparking Oakland's first victory over Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Then, along comes Janikowski, who was arrested by the California
Highway Patrol late Wednesday for speeding in his red 2001
Mercedes-Benz. Police told the Associated Press that his
blood-alcohol level registered 0.20, more than twice the legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day, I spoke with Casullo about the unpredictability
of coaching special teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Each game is its own entity," he said. "One week, your guys can
be really outstanding. The next week, it's like you've never met with
your guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders have met with Janikowski before, and they'll meet with
him again.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, that doesn't seem to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   At This Stage of the Game</TE>
<TE>   "Runt of the Litter," a critically acclaimed play written and
performed by former NFL player Bo Eason, is heading into its second
and final week in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The one-man show takes place in a football locker room, where the
protagonist is preparing to play against his older brother in the
Super Bowl. Eason is the helmeted Hamlet, struggling with the notion
of trying to defeat the person he respects and loves most.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a Cain and Abel premise; do you choose brotherhood,
or do you want to win?" explained Eason, 41, a Houston Oiler safety
from 1984 through '88 who has had supporting roles in movies such as
"Miami Rhapsody" and "A Bright Shining Lie."</TE>
<TE>   "Runt" is autobiographical to a large degree. Eason's older
brother, Tony, 42, played quarterback for New England in the 1980s
and helped lead the Patriots to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the
Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Bo and Tony were best friends growing up in Walnut Grove,
Calif.--Bo considered himself the runt, hence the name of the
play--and never lost a game while playing on the same teams from Pop
Warner through high school. They never played against each other in
the pros; they were scheduled to in 1987, but the player strike wiped
out that reunion.</TE>
<TE>   Castle Rock has optioned the screen rights to Eason's play, which
had a successful off-Broadway run in New York, and several Hollywood
types have been--or are scheduled to be--in the audience, among them
Toby McGuire, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Chris Klein and Rosie
O'Donnell. The production runs Tuesday through Friday at the Matrix
Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST--After the Patriots won the Super Bowl, four former
Dolphins--quarterback Damon Huard, linebacker Larry Izzo, cornerback
Terrell Buckley and offensive lineman Gary Ruegamer--put their
championship rings on their raised middle fingers and posed for a
picture. Then, they sent the photo to some of their former teammates.
Coach Bill Belichick was irate when he found out about the gag and
fined the four players. Copies of that picture could be found all
around the Dolphin facility this week--they play host to the Patriots
on Sunday.... Buffalo quarterback Drew Bledsoe has thrown 149
consecutive passes without an interception. Twenty-four more and
he'll pass Jim Kelly for the franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH--If you go to a Cleveland game, don't leave early. The
Browns are 9-11 under Coach Butch Davis, and seven of those games
were decided on the last play.... The Bengals are an embarrassment.
They have a 37-game losing streak on the road to teams with a winning
record. Their last road victory over a team with a winning record was
Dec. 2, 1990, when they beat the 6-5 Steelers, 16-12.... Terry
Donahue, 49er general manager and former UCLA coach, on quarterback
Tommy Maddox, whose most recent starts came in the Arena Football
League and XFL: "I don't think [this opportunity] would have happened
for him without the XFL. That league gave him a chance. He had
exposure on the big field again. That helps a lot more than playing
in an arena.... Arena ball is great, fun to watch the players
compete, but it's a more difficult transition for a player to go from
arena ball, than a league like the XFL or NFL Europe."</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH--Don't be surprised if someone in Nashville writes a sad
country ballad about Tennessee's special teams. Through four games,
the Titans have allowed three touchdowns on punt returns, and
opponents twice have recovered onside kicks.... Tennessee linebacker
Keith Bulluck on the team's bumpy start: "Those movies where
everything goes wrong for a person--I feel that's where we are right
now." ... The Colts had a bye last week, so Peyton Manning spent
Sunday in New York working the CBS "NFL Today" halftime show. It was
the same day Kurt Warner and Vinny Testaverde were hurt, Kordell
Stewart was benched, Akili Smith was horrible, Jay Fiedler had four
passes intercepted, and David Carr's sack total climbed to a
league-high 26. "Tough day for quarterbacks,"</TE>
<TE>   Manning said. "I'm glad I was in the booth."</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST--Oakland's Rod Woodson has had a storied career, but
clearly he still has something left. The 37-year-old free safety
recovered three fumbles against the Steelers in Week 2, then last
Sunday returned an interception 82 yards for a touchdown against
Tennessee. "You could be the wisest man on the planet, and if you
can't step on the field and produce then there's no value to you
being there," he said. "You have to produce." ... Did you know that
Kansas City running back Priest Holmes went by his middle name,
Anthony, for his first two seasons at Texas? He switched to Priest
because the Longhorns already had a cornerback named Tony Holmes. It
was a good move, if only because the team had an offensive lineman
named Octavious Bishop, so they had a bishop blocking for a priest.
Please, hold your applause.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST--The new field at Texas Stadium will make its debut
Sunday for the Cowboy-Giant game. The artificial turf is called
RealGrass, and players love it. Imagine watering your lawn for three
hours, then squishing across the gushy surface. That's how soft the
field feels.... Last Sunday, Philadelphia's Brian Dawkins had a sack,
an interception, a fumble recovery and caught a touchdown pass,
becoming the first NFL player in history to do all that.... Baltimore
and Washington aren't too far apart on the map, unless you're talking
defenses. Under Marvin Lewis, the Raven defense was consistently
among the league's best. But Lewis is defensive coordinator in
Washington now, and the Redskin defense is ranked 30th against the
run, 24th in points allowed and 27th overall. Lewis has said he
doesn't plan any major shakeups.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH--Brett Favre was sacked four times against Carolina last
Sunday, and, in an upset, none of those sacks were faked. The Packers
are 0-4 against the spread this season.... Detroit's Desmond Howard
had a 70-yard kickoff return against New Orleans last Sunday, and his
teammates got a little too excited. Defensive end Robert Porcher
celebrated by giving him a head slap that felt vaguely like a love
tap from a Ford Explorer. Porcher is 6 feet 6 and weighs 266; Howard
is 5-10 and 188. "It's the way guys celebrate in the NFL," a dizzy
Howard told reporters. "It just so happened I was coming off a neck
injury, so it wasn't the proper way to celebrate at that time.... It
hurt." It was an accident, of course, and Porcher felt terrible when
he saw Howard icing his neck on the sideline. "I came over to him and
said, 'Hey, are you doing all right?' " Porcher said. "He's like,
'Yeah, but somebody smacked the hell out of me.' "</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH--Atlanta's defense hasn't scored a touchdown in 34
games. Sunday, the Falcons play the Buccaneers, who have scored three
touchdowns on interception returns this season. That said, the
Falcons' Michael Vick is the only quarterback with three or more
starts who has yet to have a pass intercepted.... Being reduced to a
spectator against the Saints is especially painful for Pittsburgh
quarterback Kordell Stewart because he grew up in New Orleans, and
his family still lives there.... The Saints have fallen behind 20-0
twice the past two weeks. They scratched back to beat Chicago, but
couldn't do the same against Detroit.... Tampa Bay quarterback Brad
Johnson on excitable Coach Jon Gruden, a former quarterback at
Dayton: "He takes a shower after the game, too, now. He thinks he's
playing. In practice, he calls the play in the huddle as if he's the
guy. He's kind of reliving his past--or the past he didn't have."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST--The 49ers have lost to the Rams six consecutive times
and have been outscored by an average of two touchdowns in those
games. If they win, the 49ers go up on St. Louis by 3 1/2 games, but
a loss would be a devastating psychological blow. The 49ers say they
don't plan to make any major changes on defense in facing quarterback
Jamie Martin: "We don't anticipate them changing their offense,"
Coach Steve Mariucci said. "They didn't change their offense when
Trent Green got hurt a few years back and a guy named Kurt Warner
took it over and did very well." ... Warner, out with a fractured
pinkie, says he'll be back sooner than 10 weeks from now. Dare to
doubt him?</TE>

<HD>DUI Charge Is Janikowski's Latest Legal Mess</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oakland Raider kicker Sebastian Janikowski was charged with driving
under the influence, adding another chapter to his history of legal
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Janikowski was stopped for speeding in Oakland early Wednesday and
failed a sobriety test, police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   His blood-alcohol level registered 0.20, more than twice the legal
limit, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not allowed to talk about it, and my focus is on the Buffalo
Bills," the 24-year-old Janikowski said before the Raiders left for
their game at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could face up to six months in jail, Alameda
County Deputy District Attorney Ann Kenfield said. Janikowski is
scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Raider Coach Bill Callahan said Janikowski will kick against the
Bills.</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in a line of troubles for Janikowski. A year
ago, he needed five stitches in his head after falling on a San
Francisco dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, he was acquitted of charges of having GHB, the
so-called date-rape drug.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a
Florida police officer $300 to release his roommate after an argument
with a bouncer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that the sports psychologists Jacksonville Jaguar
Coach Tom Coughlin hired to counsel his players aren't really sports
psychologists.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Brawer, executive director of the Florida Psychological
Association, said that neither Chad Bohling nor Trevor Moawad, the
two employees of IMG Academies hired by the Jaguars, is a licensed
psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Falsely calling oneself a psychologist is against the law in
Florida, and Brawer filed an "administrative complaint" to the state
health department Friday, after reading a story about the men.</TE>
<TE>   Brawer said he called Coughlin to notify him of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin, who said Moawad and Bohling have been doing a great job
for the team, had no comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville spokesman Dan Edwards said the team was aware of the
issue, and the Jaguars were still happy with the service the two men
are providing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Jet receiver Wayne Chrebet will miss Sunday's game
against the Kansas City Chiefs with a bruised right knee. He was hurt
against Jacksonville last weekend.... A turf-toe injury kept St.
Louis Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams, who has a streak of 127
consecutive starts, out of practice this week, and Coach Mike Martz
wasn't optimistic that Williams would play in Sunday's game at San
Francisco.</TE>

1     OAKLAND  (3-0)        Raiders have averaged 26 first downs in
                            last three games. (3)
2     PHILADELPHIA  (3-1)   Eagles have recovered from defensive
                            collapse on opening day. (4)
3     NEW ENGLAND  (3-1)    Just don't mention the word "cutback" to
                            skittish Patriot defense. (1)
4     SAN DIEGO  (4-0)      Victory over New England gave Chargers
                            instant credibility. (11)
5     DENVER (3-1)          After an embarrassing first half, almost
                            came back at Baltimore. (2)
6     SAN FRANCISCO  (2-1)  After playing host to the Rams on Sunday,
                            the 49ers have four of six on the road.
                            (6)
7     TAMPA BAY  (3-1)      Buccaneers starting to get comfortable
                            with Gruden's complex offense. (9)
8     NEW ORLEANS  (3-1)    Defense has to stop putting Saints in big
                            holes early. (5)
9     GREEN BAY  (3-1)      Packers had no business letting Carolina
                            hang around so long at Lambeau. (8)
10    MIAMI  (3-1)          Dolphins don't have the kind of offense
                            that can play catchup. (7)
11    PITTSBURGH  (1-2)     Maddox isn't spectacular, but he doesn't
                            force throws the way Stewart does. (14)
12    BUFFALO  (2-2)        Emotional, physical exhaustion of three
                            overtime games has to take a toll. (15)
13    CHICAGO  (2-2)        Bears have lost two in a row for first
                            time since December 2000. (12)
14    KANSAS CITY  (2-2)    Ah, so that's the way Trent Green was
                            supposed to look. (23)
15    CAROLINA  (3-1)       Finally faced a real opponent ... and
                            looked pretty good, even in losing. (22)
16    INDIANAPOLIS (2-1)    Colts get a breather with two home
                            patsies--Cincinnati, then Baltimore. (17)
17    N.Y. GIANTS (2-2)     Offense has scored nine and seven points
                            in last two games. (10)
18    CLEVELAND  (2-2)      Yes, rulebook has cost Browns two
                            victories, but this team is average. (16)
19    ARIZONA (2-2)         Young Cardinal defense got a big morale
                            boost in thrashing of Giants. (25)
20    JACKSONVILLE  (2-1)   Eagle defense should give Jaguars big
                            problems. (21)
21    SEATTLE  (1-3)        Remember Shaun Alexander? The Seahawks
                            finally did. (26)
22    ATLANTA  (1-2)        Michael Vick can't carry the whole load
                            on his shoulders. (19)
23    ST. LOUIS  (0-4)      Rams are hanging on by a (broken) pinkie
                            in the NFC West. (13)
24    BALTIMORE (1-2)       Raven defense showed flashes of its
                            former self in the Denver game. (30)
25    DETROIT (1-3)         "Joey Heisman" could save the jobs of
                            Matt Millen and Marty Mornhinweg. (28)
26    DALLAS  (2-2)         With his job on the line, Quincy Carter
                            picks up biggest victory of his career.
                            (31)
27    TENNESSEE  (1-3)      Titans are lucky they play in a lousy
                            division. (18)
28    WASHINGTON (1-2)      Time to warm up rookie quarterback
                            Patrick Ramsey. (27)
29    N.Y. JETS  (1-3)      Jets have been outscored 133-50. (20)
30    HOUSTON  (1-3)        David Carr has been battered like a
                            crash-test dummy. (29)
31    MINNESOTA  (0-4)      Week by week, Vikings are spiraling out
                            of control. (24)
32    CINCINNATI  (0-4)     Made a game of it against Tampa Bay--for
                            five minutes, at least. (32)</TE>

<KH>KING/DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>High-Salaried Heinze Not Claimed in Draft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Heinze was not claimed in Friday's NHL waiver draft, no
surprise to the Kings but probably not what they wanted to hear.</LD>
<LD>   Signed to a three-year, $6-million contract as an unrestricted
free agent in July 2001, Heinze, 32, scored 15 goals last season,
ranking fourth on the team, but none after Jan. 15. He ended the
season with a 27-game goal-scoring drought and was used sparingly in
the latter part of the regular season and the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Though they won't come out and say it, the Kings would have loved
to dump his contract, which guarantees him $2 million this season and
$2.25 million in 2003-04, and almost certainly would entertain trade
offers for the veteran winger.</LD>
<TE>   Not that they expect any.</TE>
<TE>   After it was released Wednesday that Heinze was among the players
exposed to the waiver draft, "We never received any calls about him,"
General Manager Dave Taylor said Friday. "So it wasn't a surprise
that he cleared."</TE>
<TE>   Each team was allowed to protect 18 skaters and two goaltenders.</TE>
<TE>   Only six players were selected, none by the Kings. Age, health
and, in some cases, hefty contracts deter teams from picking players.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only protect so many players and I think the feeling was,
with his salary, we probably weren't going to lose him," Coach Andy
Murray said of Heinze, who could be sent to the minors without again
having to clear waivers. "I didn't give it a second thought. He's
competing for a job on our team, working real hard."</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, in his 12th NHL season, is one of 17 forwards on the
roster. The Kings probably will open the season with 14.</TE>
<TE>   Among the forwards protected by the Kings was enforcer Ken
Belanger, who played in only 43 games last season, sitting out 20
because of a broken thumb, and has participated only sparingly in
training camp because of a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Niclas Havelid, a defenseman the Mighty Ducks are counting on for
some offense, scored the first goal in a 4-0 victory over Phoenix on
Friday at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Alexei Smirnov forced a turnover, then got the puck to
center Steve Rucchin, who found Havelid charging the net. His chip
shot easily beat goalie Brian Boucher for a 1-0 lead in the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   "I followed the rush and Rucchin laid it there for me," Havelid
said. "I am trying to skate with the puck a little more this season."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin has played in only 54 of 164 games the last two seasons,
but demonstrated his value to the Ducks on Friday, finishing with two
goals and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin scored both goals on power plays, as the Ducks scored
three power play goals in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   On the first, Rucchin battled in front of the net and knocked in a
rebound. The other came on a pass that went off the skate of Coyote
defenseman Paul Mara.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora had the other power-play goal and Adam Oates, acquired
to boost the NHL's worst power play, assisted on all three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski underwent an MRI on his right knee
Thursday, which was negative. Vishnevski is suffering from a strained
muscle in his right leg.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced with the team Friday morning but sat out the
exhibition against the Coyotes.</TE>

<DH>Canadian pair may have missed chance to capitalize on
Olympic limelight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a few frantic days in February, Canadian figure skaters Jamie
Sale and David Pelletier were two of the world's most famous
athletes.</LD>
<LD>   The pair's off-ice love story added intrigue to the "Love Story"
routine they hoped would win them an Olympic gold medal at Salt Lake
City. When they performed a flawless free skate program but finished
second to Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, media and fans
cast them as innocents who had been wronged by a bizarre judging
system. When the International Skating Union determined that a French
judge had been pressured to vote for the Russians and so awarded Sale
and Pelletier duplicate gold medals, a rich and happy ending seemed
all but written.</LD>
<LD>   Offers poured in from TV networks, magazines eager to put the
attractive couple on their covers and advertisers hoping to associate
with winners.</LD>
<TE>   "The situation that was thrown at us, there's no way you can be
prepared," Sale said. "We were surrounded by some great people who
kept us grounded."</TE>
<TE>   But their fame didn't soar for long.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of starring in their own tour, as envisioned by their
former agent, Craig Fenech, they will be one of four pairs on the
Stars on Ice tour this winter. Their performance in the Ray Charles
Tribute on Ice today at Staples Center--which will be televised Dec.
21 by NBC--is a footnote during a busy sports week instead of the
headline event it might have been six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it was inevitable their fame would fade. And they say
they're happy with their choices and lives. They spent much of the
spring and summer doing charity appearances and recently started
rehearsing with Stars on Ice for their December debut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot different than the first few months after the
Olympics," said Pelletier, who bought a house with Sale in Edmonton.
"Now, there's way more skating. That's way more fun for me. I can
speak publicly and do whatever stuff sponsors want, but I feel more
comfortable on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Comfortable is good. Innovative is what Fenech had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Sale said talk about a tour "wasn't true."</TE>
<TE>   "We learned about it when we woke up one morning and heard about
it," she said. "There were some people who wanted to do it, but David
and I didn't want to. And not because we don't feel we have the star
power, but because Champions on Ice and Stars on Ice would be going
on at the same time and we'd have to compete against them."</TE>
<TE>   But Fenech, primarily a baseball agent, said he had arranged a
landmark deal the duo undermined by repeatedly negotiating for
themselves, which left them prey for the promoters who grip skating
in a stranglehold. He said they sat in the library of his New Jersey
home and were so enthusiastic about the tour, "Jamie wanted to sign
that night and said, 'Let's sign right now.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think they had a chance to transcend the sport," said Fenech,
who later sent the couple an e-mail saying their forays behind his
back compromised his credibility and negotiating power.</TE>
<TE>   "I had all kinds of things I would have liked to have done with
them.... There was a lot of naivete, and I think there were people
poisoning the well."</TE>
<TE>   Fenech said he had ample financial backing for Sale and Pelletier
to star in their show. It would have begun in Canada, with some U.S.
dates. "The plan was to deal with one of the bigger tours or own
their own," he said, referring to the IMG-backed Stars on Ice tour
and Tom Collins' Champions on Ice company.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a four-year, seven-figure guarantee, and they would have
owned 50% of it, which would have made it groundbreaking. The truth
is, I'm not sure at the end of the day they were sure they wanted to
carry it. It is a lot of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Fenech resigned in May, ending an 18-month relationship in which
he secured a contract with skate manufacturer CCM, a deal for the duo
to skate in NBC specials and negotiated with Crest for ads that
appear in national magazines. They replaced him with Robert
Steadward, who described himself as Sale's "sport counselor" and a
family friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have given them an equity position," Fenech said, "which
a lot of people didn't understand. Or they understood and feared
it.... Getting subsumed into the Stars on Ice tour definitely
diminishes their value."</TE>
<TE>   Steadward began working with Sale in 1993 while she skated with
another partner and continued to counsel her when she competed solo.
They parted when she moved to Montreal to train with Pelletier, but
hooked up again after the duo won the 2001 world championship and he
worked with both. At Salt Lake City, he said, he helped coordinate
media relations.</TE>
<TE>   A partner in a number of sports medicine clinics and a former
International Olympic Committee member, Steadward fields 20 requests
a day for Sale and Pelletier to perform or appear at schools. He
negotiated their four-year Stars on Ice deal and completed a contract
with Roots, the Canadian company whose clothing was so popular at
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Fenech denied reports he asked Champions on Ice to pay them
$30,000 a show and said he could have completed a deal with Stars on
Ice if they'd asked. "I miss them. I liked them very much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Sale, Steadward said the tour Fenech spoke of was no sure
thing for the skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "They had certain interests and wishes, but maybe negotiations
weren't going in the right direction," he said. "They felt nothing
was being accomplished and when were they going to skate? There were
so many options.... Things just weren't getting done at the time.
They wanted to skate in both Canada and the U.S. and everything
wasn't getting done to their satisfaction, or wasn't getting done at
all."</TE>
<TE>   He also disputed Fenech's contention Sale and Pelletier will be
lost in the Stars on Ice cast. The troupe also includes Berezhnaya
and Sikharulidze, sustaining the unwitting bond established during
the judging scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're worried about whether there are two pairs
or six pairs," Steadward said. "They just want to skate to the best
of their ability and give back to the community after all the support
they got."</TE>
<TE>   Sale knows she and Pelletier will always be linked to the Russians
and, indirectly, to the still-unfolding judging scandal. She said she
and Pelletier have not been questioned by the FBI regarding
allegations that reputed Russian mobster Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov
conspired to fix the pairs and dance events; if questioned, she said,
they will say they know nothing about him. Or about French judge
Marie-Reine Le Gougne's alleged misconduct in judging the pairs
event.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do," Sale said of their link to the
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier has little faith in the ISU judging reforms instituted
to avoid repeats of the scandal. According to the proposal, judges
will be selected at random from a pool, and their marks will be
chosen at random by computer without posting their nationality.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this to protect the judges? I thought we were doing this to
protect the skaters from [officials] doing backroom deals," he said.
"Judges have to be responsible. As a skater you're out there naked on
the ice, and if you fall, you fall. Judges should not be hiding. This
is a joke. Time will tell. I hope it will work, but I don't think it
will."</TE>

<HD>An October Surprise With Real Fireworks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>October baseball returned to Fantasyland Friday, but there was
nothing Mickey Mouse about it.</LD>
<LD>   The silly monkey wasn't the story. The balloon noisemakers weren't
an issue. The beach balls bounced flat.</LD>
<LD>   Through Edison Field's fireworks and funky videos, an
old-fashioned baseball team appeared.</LD>
<TE>   They are the Angels, and everything anyone once believed about
them is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   They are not a Main Street novelty. They are not a Happy Meal
trinket.</TE>
<TE>   They are not a first-round thrill ride that the New York Yankees
must grudgingly endure on their way to another championship.</TE>
<TE>   After three games of the American League division series, the
Angels are playing more traditionally than baseball's most
traditional team.</TE>
<TE>   They are showing more postseason toughness than baseball's
postseason giants.</TE>
<TE>   They are doing the little things better, and the big things more
dramatically, and today are one win from knocking the Yankees back
home into chaos after a 9-6 comeback victory.</TE>
<TE>   Those poor Yankees. They must feel like the unluckiest team on the
face of the earth.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night, a new thrill," Tim Salmon said late Friday, shaking
his head along with most of the baseball world. "I didn't think
anything could top the first two games of the series, but then,
this.... "</TE>
<TE>   This, a comeback from a 6-1 deficit against a pitcher, Mike
Mussina, who had not allowed an earned run in his previous 27
innings.</TE>
<TE>   This, a comeback in a game in which Ramon Ortiz never showed up
and Garret Anderson quit running.</TE>
<TE>   This, a two-out homer by Adam Kennedy that pulled them close, a
two-out bloop by Scott Spiezio that tied it.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, this, a bloop and a bunt and a two-strike Darin
Erstad line drive to win it.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field's sea of red rocked and pounded and screamed. The
skies cackled with fireworks. Center field splashed with geysers.</TE>
<TE>   And none of that was as good as the baseball.</TE>
<TE>   None of that was as good as my favorite two at-bats, which were
the Angels' first two at-bats, which meant nothing and everything.</TE>
<TE>   Down, 3-0, after an awful top of the first inning, David Eckstein
and Erstad stepped in against Mussina and immediately let him know
that they were not going to panic.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein fouled out after a six-pitch at-bat that included two
other foul balls.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad flied out at another six-pitch at-bat that included two
more foul balls.</TE>
<TE>   Two outs. But one enduring message. The Yankees were in for a long
night. If they were going to win this fight, they would have to go
nine rounds without a stool.</TE>
<TE>   "They have great pitchers, so we have told ourselves, we will make
the outs tough," Eckstein said. "Every pitch, we will try to get to
the next pitch."</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't matter what kind of pitch. And it doesn't matter
what kind of hit.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are winning this match-play event not because of their
pretty drives or perfect putts, but because they are relentless out
of the rough. Hacking and chopping, hole after hole, finally reaching
the green as their opponents, who have watched all this with
incredulity, miss two-footers out of exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite RBI Friday wasn't their last one, but their first one.</TE>
<TE>   Second inning, runners on second and third, Spiezio stepped to the
plate wanting to be a hero.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to hit a grounder to score two runs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mussina throws strike one, then a ball, then Spiezio fouls off
two more pitches and comes to a realization shared by seemingly every
Angel.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized, forget the two runs, forget the big hit, just get the
ball down and score one," he said. "I knew I would be making an out.
But that didn't matter anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, instead of striking out with a big hack, Spiezio
shortened his swing and hit a little grounder to first base. It was
an out. But it scored a run. It worked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our team, no big egos, nobody getting a lot of
recognition, everybody understanding," said Spiezio. "When you're
only worried about getting the run in, it's amazing how many times
you find a hole."</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like that hole Spiezio found with his game-tying bloop
over the outstretched arms of second baseman Alfonso Soriano in the
seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   On a low full-count fastball.</TE>
<TE>   When he was hitless in 12 at-bats against Yankee left-hander Mike
Stanton at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these guys have figured out, this is the way to win,"
said batting coach Mickey Hatcher. "This is the way to play the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps making this the most important stat: The Yankees threw
only two fewer pitches than the Angels--155-153--even though the
Angel pitchers threw one more inning.</TE>
<TE>   And now comes today, a chance to win the series without returning
to the uncertainty of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody should first talk to Anderson. His slow jog out of the
box on a third-inning grounder that was bobbled by Soriano--who threw
him out by a whisker-- may have cost the Angels a prolonged rally.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody should also talk to Ortiz, who tried to win Friday's game
by striking out 27 Yankees in the first three innings.</TE>
<TE>   But on a team with the demeanor of Mike Scioscia and the fire of
Mickey Hatcher, everything else is working.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe even the Rally Monkey, but I'm not sure. He did come out
Friday, right? When? I don't remember. I couldn't care less.</TE>

<LD>One swing, sweet and smooth and confident, one huge intake of breath,
one bright, white baseball traveling through the night air, high and
triumphant and with the hang time of a football, taunting, almost,
the Yankees. Home run, Tim Salmon, in the eighth, cementing the lead.</LD>
<LD>   One fastball, thrown too hard to hit far, lofted lazily, falling,
slowly, easily, into the glove. Troy Percival threw the pitch, Garret
Anderson made the catch.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Angels with the longest history, the toughest memories,
the saddest stories, finished Friday night's incomparable 9-6 win
over the New York Yankees.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything I'd been told about the playoffs," Salmon said, "was
to just get there because you never know what can happen. Something
magical might happen."</TE>
<TE>   Almost four hours earlier, other Angels, with graying hair and
skin toughened by the sun and the wind and the tears, had been
invited to Edison Field. To spit in the face of their history, to
proudly confront the past, embrace it, celebrate it, the bad and the
good but never the magical.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff history, Anaheim style, has been mostly heartbreaking
losses, blown leads and awful collapses. But it is the best of Angel
history. So members of the 1979, 1982 and 1986 Angels--until now the
only three playoff squads in the 42 years of Angel baseball--were
invited to stand on the field before Game 3 of the American League
division series.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Dave Frost, who was 16-10, and Don Baylor, who was the
league MVP, represented the 1979 Angels, who lost to Baltimore in
four games.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Doug DeCinces, who had 30 home runs that year, Fred
Lynn, who hit .611 and was series MVP in a losing cause, pitcher Ken
Forsch, who is an assistant general manager for the Angels, and Bob
Boone, now the Cincinnati Reds' manager and then a great defensive
catcher, represented the 1982 Angels who blew a 2-0 advantage and
lost a best-of-five series to Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Mike Witt, from an All-Star season, Gold Glove center
fielder Gary Pettis, pitcher Kirk McCaskill, who had 202 strikeouts
during the year but who was also loser of Games 2 and 6, and Wally
Joyner, a rookie who gamboled through a "WallyWorld" season and then
missed four games of the playoffs with a staph infection, represented
the cursed 1986 team.</TE>
<TE>   And throwing out the co-first pitches were Bobby Grich and Brian
Downing, the only Angels to have been involved in all three Western
Division titles.</TE>
<TE>   This takes some guts, to bring out the guys who ultimately failed,
who could be a symbol of all the bad that has plagued the Angels. But
they are also the heart of the Angels' past, a collection of talented
men who, as Boone says, "got some strange bounces and bad breaks and
all sorts of things that are just part of baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Downing says he doesn't remember emotions.</TE>
<TE>   But then Downing talks about the emotions of elation and then
despair he felt in Game 5 of the 1986 American League championship
series, when his Angels once led Boston, 5-2, were once a single
strike from playing in the World Series, were finally a stunned
loser, swallowed up, an entire team, by emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Downing says he pays little attention to the Angels, out on his
farm in rural Texas, watching mostly Texas Rangers' games if he
watches baseball at all. But then Downing says, "I'm a fan of
baseball, of great matchups. I watch moments. Like Troy Percival
versus Derek Jeter in Game 2."</TE>
<TE>   He calls himself "a cyborg," and turns to his wife, Cheryl. "Ask
her," Downing says. "She says I don't have a heart." But then Downing
turns at the crack of a Yankee bat and flinches when Ramon Ortiz
throws a wild pitch. He has no feelings for the Angels, pro or con,
Downing says, but he twists his fingers in his hands when the Yankees
take a 3-0 first-inning lead against the Angels on Friday night at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   This is only Downing's second time back to Edison Field since he
was released after the 1990 season, a bitter ending to his Angel
career. Downing loved being an Angel, loved how the fans adored his
hard-charging style. Downing felt he had been treated rudely by
general manager Mike Port, had felt lied to and denied a chance to
say goodbye to Angel fans. Downing had been held out of the final
game of the 1990 season and Downing will always be convinced Port
knew he wasn't going to offer Downing a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until Angel fans voted Downing to an All-Angels' team to
celebrate the 40th anniversary of the franchise in 2000 that Downing
finally came home. He had been an Orange County kid, had graduated
from Magnolia High and had let his anger keep him far from home.</TE>
<TE>   And Downing still fights his feelings for the Angels. He said he
almost didn't come here to throw out that pitch. Downing says it
hurts to go on the field without a uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Downing did come, though, and no matter what, he had to have been
excited by the end.</TE>
<TE>   History hasn't been changed yet. These are the Yankees and they
don't lose in the first round. Some day Salmon and Percival and
Anderson might be standing at another reunion, gray and wrinkled and
proud and sad and talking about the 2-1 lead that got away. But it's
hard to imagine that now. It's hard to imagine that more magic isn't
on its way.</TE>

<HD>Sprewell Injury Scrutinized</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latrell Sprewell might have broken his hand by throwing an errant
punch at the boyfriend of a woman who vomited on Sprewell's new
yacht, the New York Post reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper, citing two eyewitnesses who asked not to be
identified, said the New York Knick star was injured when he slammed
his right hand into a wall during a skirmish at a late-night party.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, acknowledged Friday that Sprewell
hurt his hand aboard the luxury yacht he bought over the summer.</LD>
<TE>   Sprewell underwent surgery Tuesday for a displaced fracture of the
bone beneath his right pinkie. He is expected to be sidelined at
least six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks were stunned when Sprewell arrived in New York on
Monday with a broken hand. After initially saying Sprewell would join
the team for training camp in Charleston, S.C., the Knicks said
Sprewell had been told to stay in New York until the team returned.</TE>
<TE>   Gist said he did not speak to Sprewell about the exact cause of
the injury, although the agent was quoted in the Post describing how
Sprewell banged his hand while shifting the boat's navigational
system.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell is expected to meet with club officials Monday.</TE>

<HD>Midterms Will Be Pass-Fail</HD>
<DH>UCLA: As they begin Pac-10 play, the Bruins have a vanilla
personality type, which beats last year's personality disorder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>UCLA's four nonconference games were like Rorschach inkblots, serving
as a team personality test. Coaches evaluated character, traits and
temperament.</LD>
<LD>   Three victories and one defeat later, the profile is of an Average
Joe.</LD>
<LD>   Description? Nondescript.</LD>
<TE>   The conclusion causes no consternation among the coaches, who got
their fill of vain and forceful personalities last season. This Bruin
team begins Pacific 10 Conference play today at Oregon State with few
distinguishing characteristics but even fewer fissures.</TE>
<TE>   "I like our unity, I like our heart," Coach Bob Toledo said. "We
have a focused football team, a team that has given good effort."</TE>
<TE>   And it is a team with no glaring weaknesses and no startling
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot of stars, and that actually helps in some
ways," running back Manuel White said. "Everybody is pulling on the
same end of the rope."</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown:</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Overall: Workmanlike quarterback Cory Paus completes only about
half his passes even on good days, but he has demonstrated
quick-strike ability. His six touchdown passes average 33 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Craig Bragg is the best deep threat and tight end Mike
Seidman is a target defenses must account for on every play. Tab
Perry has not made a strong impact yet and Ryan Smith has had few
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   White could become a workhorse at tailback, but he will continue
to play some fullback until coaches are convinced Pat Norton and J.D.
Groves can block well enough to split the load full-time.</TE>
<TE>   Akil Harris can get through a hole but has trouble gaining yardage
when the defense loads up the line of scrimmage. Freshmen backs Tyler
Ebell, Wendell Mathis and Jason Harrison infuse the offense with
short bursts of energy.</TE>
<TE>   The line is considered a strength, although Paus has been sacked
11 times. The development of redshirt freshman center Mike McCloskey
and sophomore guard Steven Vieira erased question marks.</TE>
<TE>   Today: Oregon State (4-1) has the best defense the Bruins have
faced. Somebody--White and Perry are likely candidates--must step up
and match the toughness of the brash, physical Beavers.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the ball on the ground and preventing sacks will be a
challenge. Beaver linebackers Richard Seigler and Nick Barnett have
combined for 15 tackles for losses.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Dennis Weathersby is another standout. Paus should
avoid him.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Overall: The Bruin defensive line is deep enough that reserves Mat
Ball, Asi Faoa, Sean Phillips and Ryan Boschetti replace starters
Dave Ball, Rusty Williams, Steve Morgan and Rodney Leisle as a unit
without a noticeable drop-off.</TE>
<TE>   However, the pass rush must improve. UCLA has a respectable nine
sacks, but opposing quarterbacks often have too much time to throw.</TE>
<TE>   Linebackers Marcus Reese, Brandon Chillar and Spencer Havner have
exceeded expectations. The secondary, anchored by cornerbacks Ricky
Manning and Matt Ware, is solid because of the development of young
safeties Ben Emanuel, Jarrad Page and Jibril Raymo.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to continue to get tougher and more physical," Toledo
said. "Otherwise, the defense is about where we thought."</TE>
<TE>   Today: Because the secondary is strong and the linebackers are
mobile, UCLA is well-suited to stop an attack that uses three or more
receivers and spreads the field.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State runs just such an offense. Beaver sophomore
quarterback Derek Anderson threw for 15 touchdowns in four victories
but showed his inexperience in last week's 22-0 loss to USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Derek had plenty of time to throw the first three or four games,
then last week he got pressured and hit," Oregon State Coach Dennis
Erickson said. "To me, that's a learning process."</TE>
<TE>   James Newson is Anderson's most frequent target, but it makes
little sense to double-team him because he is one of eight receivers
who have made touchdown catches. Expect UCLA to employ a lot of zone
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Steven Jackson leads the Pac-10 with 120 yards a game
and is especially dangerous on draw plays. Reese, the senior middle
linebacker, will be responsible for keeping Jackson from breaking
free.</TE>
<TE>   SPECIAL TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   Overall: There were concerns after numerous breakdowns in the
opener against Colorado State. But Bruin special teams have improved
each week.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell gives UCLA firepower on punt returns, averaging 13.9 yards.
Kick returns are better as well with Perry doing the bulk of the
work.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Chris Griffith and punter Nate Fikse, seniors considered
among the best in the conference, started slowly but have shown signs
of living up to expectations. Griffith made a career-best 46-yard
field goal against San Diego State and Fikse placed several punts
inside the 20-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Today: Oregon State kicker Ryan Cesca has made only one of three
field-goal tries after winning back his job. He has had trouble
finding the form that earned him All-Pac-10 honors in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES</TE>
<TE>   Overall: The Bruins' best qualities have been maintaining poise on
the road and avoiding turnovers and penalties. They have not lost a
fumble and have a plus-nine turnover ratio. And they have committed
only 18 penalties--tied for the fewest in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Today: UCLA is 2-0 on road, but this will be the most severe test.
Sold-out Reser Stadium is loud and hostile.</TE>
<TE>   "Their fans are close to the action and are very opinionated,"
Paus said. "It's a good place to play as long as you play well. If
you start having setbacks, they do a good job of putting pressure on
like a 12th man."</TE>
<TE>   Penalties have hurt the Beavers. They had 12 for 116 yards against
USC, about their average. Oregon State has forced 18
turnovers--including a conference-leading 12 interceptions--but have
turned the ball over 10 times.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Manuel White will play more at tailback than fullback and could
reach 20 carries for the first time in his career. UCLA will try to
establish a running game against a Beaver defense that allows only
107 yards a game on the ground. Linebackers Richard Seigler and Nick
Barnett are among the best in the Pac-10. The Oregon State secondary,
led by cornerback Dennis Weathersby, is opportunistic. Bruin
quarterback Cory Paus must take what the defense gives and avoid
forcing balls into a defense that ranks third in the nation with 12
interceptions. Tight end Mike Seidman had a big game against San
Diego State and again could be a primary target.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN OREGON STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Like UCLA, the Beavers strive for a balanced attack. Quarterback
Derek Anderson has thrown for 1,281 yards and 15 touchdowns, although
USC held him to 80 yards last week. Steven Jackson leads the Pac-10
with 603 yards rushing and is especially dangerous on draw plays.
James Newson has 25 catches for 379 yards and five touchdowns. The
UCLA defensive line, weakened by a foot injury to tackle Rodney
Leisle, will blitz to pressure Anderson. The Bruins hope the real
Beaver offense is the one USC shut out, not the one that averaged 47
points in four victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Taking advantage of injuries to the Oregon State offensive line
and pressuring quarterback Derek Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   2. Quarterback Cory Paus must play relatively mistake-free against
a Beaver defense that averages 2.4 interceptions a game.</TE>
<TE>   3. Maintaining poise in a hostile road environment and having
fewer penalties and turnovers than Oregon State.</TE>

<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>For fullback J.D. Groves, it's a first trip home.</LD>
<LD>   For tackle Bryce Bohlander, it's just another trip home.</LD>
<LD>   The two Bruins are from McNary High in Keizer, Ore., a small town
near Salem and not too far from Oregon State.</LD>
<TE>   Groves, a freshman, is excited about playing in front of relatives
and friends, many of whom bought Oregon State season tickets with the
UCLA game in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to secure a spot in the stadium," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander, a senior, has already experienced the so-called thrill
of homecoming several times.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody already hates me [in Oregon]," he deadpanned. "So
what's the difference? It's just another game."</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander was big man on the McNary campus when Groves was a
freshman struggling to make the varsity.</TE>
<TE>   "He made an impression on me then, and he did so again during the
recruiting process," Groves said. "He was my host during my trip to
UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to McNary, Groves got an earful from another
Bohlander. Bryce's father, John, is the school principal.</TE>
<TE>   "A degree from UCLA means more than one from Oregon or Oregon
State," Groves said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bohlander before him, Groves took heat from locals who wanted
him to play for an Oregon school. But he is looking forward to his
return for two reasons--he is getting substantial playing time and
UCLA does not return to Corvallis the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander, however, merely shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Bowl, that's my home crowd," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second-string receivers Ryan Smith and Junior Taylor will play
more, whittling time from third-stringers Garrett Lepisto and Jon
Dubravac.</TE>
<TE>   Starters Craig Bragg and Tab Perry frequently took plays off in
the four nonconference games, partly because they are on special
teams and partly to give Lepisto and Dubravac snaps.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith is a proven receiver who had a touchdown catch against
Oklahoma State and Taylor has displayed big-play ability.</TE>
<TE>   "Ryan Smith is a reliable guy and Junior Taylor is learning more
of the offense," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State has won seven in a row and 19 of 21 at Reser Stadium.
The Beavers' only loss there since 1999 came against UCLA last
season, 38-7.</TE>

<DH>USC: The No. 18 Trojans' top-ranked defense will go after
Gesser, attempting to slow No. 17 Cougars' prolific offense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser reviewed tape of USC's
victory over Oregon State and is painfully aware of the Trojan
defensive line's starring role.</LD>
<LD>   Gesser, who has been wearing a flak jacket to protect an injured
ribcage muscle, said he winced a few times when Oregon State
quarterback Derek Anderson absorbed repeated shots from USC's front
four, which dominated from start to finish in a 22-0 victory last
week.</LD>
<LD>   USC didn't blitz much against Oregon State, but Gesser expects a
different approach today when the No. 18 Trojans play No. 17
Washington State in a Pacific 10 Conference game at Martin Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "I think they're going to blitz all day long till the cows come
home trying to get in and get hits on me," Gesser said. "If I take a
couple, that's just football.</TE>
<TE>   "They're probably thinking that hopefully the hits will add up and
hurt me at the end of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Give Gesser credit for reading minds as well as pass coverages.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing he's a little dinged or whatever gives us a little more
incentive to come after him and do our thing," USC defensive tackle
Shaun Cody said. "We're just going to go in there and make the hit on
him. The harder we can make it the better. That's the way you've got
to see it. You want to hit somebody and make them feel it."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as nose tackle Bernard Riley said: "If he shows us he's
hurting, he's in trouble because once we smell blood we go for all of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser is regarded as a dangerous scrambler, but he stayed in the
pocket most of the time last week against California and passed for
432 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-38 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-1 senior has passed for 1,282 yards and 11 touchdowns
this season for the Cougars (4-1, 1-0), the preseason favorites to
win the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said Gesser showed his mettle against Cal
when he bounced back from several shots.</TE>
<TE>   "He got hit late in that game and came back the next play and
threw a touchdown pass," Carroll said. "He's obviously tough and
courageous and healthy enough."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, which averages 429.8 yards, is expected to
challenge USC cornerbacks William Buchanon and Darrell Rideaux with
6-6 split end Mike Bush and 6-3 flanker Devard Darling. Buchanon is
6-3, Rideaux 5-9.</TE>
<TE>   USC (3-1, 1-0) needs a breakout game from its offense, which ranks
last in the Pac-10 in total yardage (354.3 yards a game), ninth in
rushing (113.5) and seventh in passing (240.8).</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer has completed 57.7% of his attempts in
the Trojans' ball-control passing game and will operate against a
Cougar defense that ranks seventh in the conference, giving up 357.4
yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has passed for five touchdowns with three interceptions in
149 attempts. Tailbacks Sultan McCullough and Justin Fargas are
averaging 4.5 and 2.9 yards a carry, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "They have played some good defensive teams, so their offensive
statistics are a little misleading," Washington State Coach Mike
Price said. "Carson Palmer is playing the best I have ever seen him
since he's been at USC."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State suffered its only defeat Sept. 14 at Ohio State,
25-7. The Cougars led, 7-6, at halftime but could not contain
freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who gained 194 of his 230
yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars' victories came against Nevada, Idaho, Montana State
and Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Today's game is USC's first at Martin Stadium since 1999, when it
escaped with a 31-28 victory. Washington State won two years ago at
the Coliseum, 33-27. The teams did not play last season.</TE>
<TE>   Price hopes the crowd will unnerve a Trojan team that struggled in
a hostile environment at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer does not anticipate a repeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be louder than K-State," Palmer said. "We played at
Washington and other places with bigger stadiums. I can't imagine it
being noisier than that."</TE>

<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are last in the Pacific 10 Conference in total offense
at 354.3 yards a game, an inadequacy overshadowed by the top-ranked
defense in the nation. Flanker Keary Colbert and wide receiver Mike
Williams were quarterback Carson Palmer's favorite targets the last
two games, but senior Kareem Kelly could become the go-to receiver
against the Cougars.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State is surrendering 22.4 points and 357.4 yards a
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN WASHINGTON ST. HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Jason Gesser is wearing a flak jacket because
of a rib injury and fully expects Trojan defenders to take their
shots at him. Gesser has thrown for 1,282 yards and 11 touchdowns.
Sophomore flanker Devard Darling has 28 receptions and six
touchdowns. Gesser also passes often to slotback Scott Lunde (21
receptions) and split end Mike Bush (19 catches). USC's secondary,
No. 1 in the nation in pass defense, gets another test against the
6-foot-3 Darling and 6-6 Bush.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Control Jason Gesser and neutralize tall receivers. Gesser
passed for 431 yards and four touchdowns last week against
California, despite a rib injury. USC's cornerbacks are 6-foot-3
William Buchanon and 5-9 Darrell Rideaux.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game. Neither Sultan McCullough nor Justin
Fargas has been a consistent threat. The offensive line's pass
blocking is fine, but it needs a bigger push for the running game to
shine.</TE>
<TE>   3. Maintain special teams. Ryan Killeen kicked three field goals
in four tries against Oregon State. Today is his first test in a
hostile environment. Freshman punter Tom Malone struggled before a
similar crowd in Manhattan, Kan., but kicked well last week.</TE>

<LD>USC's defense is ranked No. 1 in the nation, a status earned in part
with stellar play on third down.</LD>
<LD>   USC opponents have converted only seven of 52 third-down attempts.
Even in their 27-20 loss to Kansas State, the Trojans shut down the
Wildcats 10 times in 12 third-down situations.</LD>
<LD>   Middle linebacker Mike Pollard said the No. 18 Trojans must
sustain that dominance today against No. 17 Washington State.</LD>
<TE>   "The guys up front on the defensive line are creating all kinds of
pressure on passing downs and getting into the backfield in running
situations," Pollard said. "That's something we need to continue if
we're going to win this conference."</TE>
<TE>   USC's offense has converted 20 of 63 third-down attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, which finished 10-2 last season, was picked as
the preseason favorite in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer said the Cougars are worthy of the
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "They won 10 games last season and they are playing well again,"
Palmer said. "Until someone beats them, you can't say they don't
deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kicker David Davis and wide receiver Jason Mitchell did not make
the trip because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman receiver Chris McFoy made the traveling squad in
Mitchell's place and could play on special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who struggled against Colorado and Kansas State and was
supplanted by Ryan Killeen against Oregon State, was hurt Thursday.
Davis suffered a contusion on his left leg--his kicking leg--when he
was hit after a field-goal attempt on the last play of practice.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell's back injury might force him to redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC leads the series with Washington State, 50-7-4, its best
winning percentage (85.2%) against any Pac-10 team. The Trojans have
won 27 of the last 30 games between the schools.</TE>
<TE>   They are 10-2-2 against the Cougars in Pullman and have won six
games in a row here. USC's last loss here was in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, a few tickets remained for the game at Martin
Stadium, which has a capacity of 37,600. USC was expected to return
some tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast calls for partly cloudy skies with temperatures in
the low 60s.</TE>

<KH>DON WELLS 1923-2002</KH>
<HD>He Was One of First Angels as a Broadcaster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Wells, a member of the Angels' original broadcast team, died
Thursday in Switzerland after a long illness, according to his
brother, Ralph. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Wells, a Sacramento native and World War II veteran, went to
broadcasting school on the GI Bill. He was working for WCFL in
Chicago, where he broadcast White Sox and Chicago Cardinals football
games, when he was hired by Angel owner Gene Autry in 1960 to work
for Autry's Golden West Broadcasting Co. as the voice of the 1961
expansion Los Angeles Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Wells worked with Bob Kelley and Steve Bailey on KMPC during the
Angels' debut season and with a variety of other announcers,
including Dick Enberg and Dave Niehaus, during his 12 seasons. He
made the call of the first home run hit by an Angel, Ted Kluszewski,
and described it by saying, "GOOD-bye baseball! Kluszewski hit one!"</LD>
<TE>   Wells left the Angels after the 1972 season and announced sports
and general news for KFWB until his retirement in 1988. He later
moved to Switzerland to be with his son, Christopher, who had married
a Swiss woman.</TE>
<TE>   Niehaus, who shared the radio booth with Wells and Enberg from
1970 through 1972, remembered Wells as a "heck of a broadcaster" who
never realized his dream.</TE>
<TE>   "He never got that No. 1 job that he always wanted," said Niehaus,
now a member of the Seattle Mariners' broadcast team. "I had a
wonderful relationship with him. I always had fond memories of him."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Mead, the Angels' vice president for communications, said he
was saddened to hear of Wells' death, especially as the Angels
prepared Friday for Game 3 of their American League division series
against the New York Yankees, the club's first postseason home game
since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a part of Angel history," Mead said of Wells, "and one of
the premier broadcasters in the history of this organization. The old
guard, every time they refer to the L.A. and California Angels, they
refer to Don Wells."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Autry aide and Angel employee John Moynihan remembered
Wells and his partners affectionately.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really good," Moynihan said Friday of Wells and one of
his later partners, Buddy Blattner. "There aren't many of us
[original employees] left. Just me...."</TE>
<TE>   Another original Angel employee, publicist Irv Kaze, died June 29.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Wells is survived by his wife, Jacque,
grandsons Martin and Andrew and brother, Ralph, of San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Brenly's Stubbornness Is Arizona's Downfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels and Minnesota Twins have definitely raised some eyebrows
with their gutsy styles in the American League playoffs, but the
biggest first-round eye-opener has been the dismal play of the
defending World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks.</LD>
<LD>   If Arizona loses today at St. Louis in its National League
division series, the Diamondbacks' season will be over thanks to a
three-game sweep by the Cardinals and Manager Tony La Russa, who has
out-managed Arizona's Bob Brenly over the first two games of the
series.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondback manager has turned Brenlyball into an art form.
What is Brenlyball, you ask? It's when a manager or coach thinks he
or she is the smartest person in the world and is too stubborn to
make changes for the sake of the team. The St. Louis Rams' Mike Martz
had a bad case of it in last season's Super Bowl when he refused to
give the ball more to Marshall Faulk against the New England
Patriots.</LD>
<TE>   With Brenly, it always seems to be personal. Remember last year's
dramatic World Series? That's when Brenly stubbornly stuck with
relief pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim and kept sending him to the mound
against the New York Yankees, and it almost cost the Diamondbacks the
title.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly may not have been the one who gave up those dramatic
late-inning home runs, but he seemed to take it personally when his
moves were questioned.</TE>
<TE>   "No one likes to get second-guessed," former Dodger Manager Tom
Lasorda said. "When it happened to me, I always tried to make sure
that I explained why I made the decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks knew going into the first-round matchup against
the Cardinals that they were short-handed because of injuries. No
manager ever wants to enter the playoffs without his big guns, but
that's exactly what Brenly faced with left fielder Luis Gonzalez,
right fielder Danny Bautista and infielder Craig Counsell on the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   With key hitters out of the lineup, Brenly's decision to sit
Erubiel Durazo, who batted fourth for Arizona in last year's World
Series, just doesn't make sense. Brenly should have found a way to
get the most dangerous bat among the Diamondbacks on the field for
the first two games, when Arizona managed only a combined three runs
and was 0 for seven with runners in scoring position in Thursday's
2-1 Game 2 loss at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly said Durazo isn't playing in the outfield because he's a
liability, based on how he played there in a couple of games late in
the season.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1 against St. Louis right-hander Matt Morris, Brenly opted
to start Mark Grace at first, which is understandable, considering
Grace's track record. You can't blame Brenly for not making offense a
priority with Randy Johnson pitching. But Johnson ended up getting
bombed in a 12-2 loss.</TE>
<TE>   With a day off before Game 2, Brenly made a couple of changes
against left-hander Chuck Finley, but none of them involved Durazo,
who may not hit left-handers well (.222 batting average), but two of
his nine hits against them this season were home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 was a nail-biter, with the Diamondbacks desperate for runs
to support starting pitcher Curt Schilling, who gave up seven hits,
struck out seven and walked one. Brenly desperately needed a big bat
in the lineup but still chose to start Greg Colbrunn, who had only 10
home runs and 27 runs batted in this season, at first base and Mark
Little in left field, even though the weak-hitting outfielder hit
.208 during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly's decision not to play Durazo, who finished tied for third
on the team in home runs during the season despite appearing in only
76 games, came back to haunt him in the first inning of Game 2. The
Diamondbacks had runners at first and second with one out, but Finley
struck out Matt Williams and Steve Finley to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   That threat that would have been a little more potent if Durazo,
who batted .333 in the playoffs last year, had a chance to hit.</TE>
<TE>   Now, to remain alive in its bid for consecutive championships,
Arizona must overcome a 2-0 deficit, something no National League
team has done since the start of the division series in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly doesn't plan to start Durazo today in Game 3 against St.
Louis right-hander Andy Benes because he still considers him a
liability in the field. Grace will get the nod while Durazo sits
again.</TE>
<TE>   "At playoff time, there's a premium on pitching and defense,"
Brenly said. "Not meant as a slight to Ruby, but certainly there are
very few defensive first basemen out there as good as Mark Grace ...
and the very positive byproduct of that is that we have a very
dangerous left-handed bat available to use off the bench in Durazo.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, Durazo will only appear in right field in an
extreme emergency."</TE>
<TE>   An emergency? The Diamondbacks can only hope that Brenlyball is
right this time or they'll be dusting off their golf clubs this
weekend.</TE>

<TE>   Running Out of Cards</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries to left fielder Luis Gonzalez, right fielder
Danny Bautista and infielder Craig Counsell, Arizona Diamondback
Manager Bob Brenly was forced to shuffle his lineup in the National
League division series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Down 0-2 in
the best-of-five series heading into today's game in St. Louis,
Brenly is searching for a spark on offense but says he will not
sacrifice a sound glove for a solid bat. A look at this year's and
last year's Diamondback starting lineup against the Cardinals in the
playoffs:</TE>

<HD>Yankees Go to Old Hand Today</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Free-spirited David Wells turned out to be a real
bargain, winning 19 games in his return to New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the last place David Wells thought he'd be today.</LD>
<LD>   But it's the only place he ever wanted be.</LD>
<LD>   Wells will be on the mound this afternoon for the New York Yankees
at Edison Field to try to keep his team alive in the American League
division series against the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Around the holidays last year, Wells was shopping for a team for
whom he could log a 16th big league season. It appeared he had found
one in the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations proceeded so well that the Diamondbacks thought they
had a deal in place. There was a verbal agreement, according to
sources close to the negotiations</TE>
<TE>   Then came the call from Yankee owner George Steinbrenner.</TE>
<TE>   Want to have lunch? Wells was asked.</TE>
<TE>   Did he ever.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander broke in with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1987. He
had spent six seasons with the Blue Jays, then on to the Detroit
Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, Baltimore Orioles, Yankees, back to the Blue
Jays, and finally to the Chicago White Sox, where Wells spent last
season.</TE>
<TE>   But his favorite stop was the Yankees, his favorite player Babe
Ruth, with whom he shares a sizable girth, a free spirit and
memorable moments in pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Ruth's memorable moments established the Yankee tradition
while Wells had only a two-year splash with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Wells was 16-10 with New York in 1997, but he went 18-4 the next
year, finished third in the American League Cy Young Award voting and
was 4-0 in the postseason with one victory in the division series,
two in the championship series and one in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   He also had a perfect game in the regular season against the
Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Wells desperately wanted to finish his career in pinstripes. So he
eagerly sat down with Steinbrenner at Pete and Shorty's Tavern in
Clearwater, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the conversation started at lunch, I thought I was
heading to Arizona, to be honest with you," Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat there, talked about family, about this and that, just
nothing that related to baseball. Then he dropped it on me. I was in
shock."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner wrote out an offer on a napkin: Two years, seven
million.</TE>
<TE>   It was suddenly the best meal Wells had ever had.</TE>
<TE>   And one of Steinbrenner's best bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Wells, 39, went 19-7 this season with a 3.75 earned-run average.
He beat the Angels at Yankee Stadium, but in his only other
appearance against them in the regular season, he lasted only two
innings at Edison Field, giving up five runs in a game in which he
had no decision.</TE>
<TE>   Wells is 8-1 in postseason play with a 2.74 ERA, 68 strikeouts and
only 21 walks in 85 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   His secret to postseason success?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not afraid to fail," he said. "That's my philosophy going in.
If you are not afraid to fail, then what have you got to lose?"</TE>
<TE>   Wells' manager, Joe Torre, thinks Wells' secret is his frame of
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes to be challenged," Torre said. "You tell him, 'You're a
little too heavy, David. I think you should lose some weight,' he's
going to show me he can pitch at that weight. He's his own person. He
has a great deal of confidence. He dares people."</TE>
<TE>   And now Wells is back in the postseason, which he missed during
his three years in exile.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fun watching it on TV," Wells said. "In the last three
years, I very seldom paid any attention to the playoffs. It's hard to
swallow because, knowing that you could be in that situation, it's
not fun to watch it. I'm not a guy who likes to watch baseball on TV.
I want to be right in the mix of it and enjoy it that way."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly where he'll be today.</TE>
