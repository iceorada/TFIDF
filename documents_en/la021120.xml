<HD>Maintenance 101: What all owners need to know</HD>
<DH>Most people ignore even the most basic, routine chores.
Here's what to do to avoid breaking down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Kretsch, head of the Auto Club of Southern California's
vehicle inspection services program, says that a recent car-care
inspection event in Costa Mesa underscored what car-care
professionals long have asserted: that most drivers ignore the most
routine auto maintenance.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Kretsch said, most people drive around in cars that
are sometimes unsafe and could break down and land the negligent
owners with serious repair bills for problems that a little diligence
could have prevented.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 550 cars, minivans, pickups and SUVs inspected during the
club's annual Car Care Fair, 75% had some sort of vital fluid problem
-- from dirty or dangerously low oil to rancid transmission fluid --
and at least a third had worn-out drive belts on generators,
alternators, air conditioners and engine cooling fans.</LD>
<TE>   "Despite all the money they spend on buying a car, most motorists
just don't take the time to take care of it," Kretsch said.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club event "provides us with a very good snapshot of
what's driving around out there," Kretsch said, "and it seems that it
is ingrained in human nature that you don't need to take care of your
car."</TE>
<TE>   Other common problems reported by the Auto Club inspectors
included: inoperative headlights, brake lights, tail lights and turn
signals; dirty air filters, which can cause inefficient engine
operation, loss of power and increased fuel consumption; and
underinflated tires, a condition that increases fuel consumption and,
in the worst cases, is a safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Kretsch said that some car owners are just too lazy to do routine
inspections and maintenance chores, and others are too busy, too
uncertain of their abilities or too complacent.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the good things about newer cars -- the loads of
electronic controls that can compensate for small problems and keep
the engine running smoothly -- is also a bad thing, because it means
that people who rely on the car to tell them when something is wrong
often don't get the message until something starts malfunctioning,"
Kretsch said.</TE>
<TE>   A must-do list for owners</TE>
<TE>   If Kretsch were king, certain routine automotive inspection and
maintenance chores would be required of anyone who owned a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   His recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Read the maintenance section of the vehicle owner's manual. It
is the authoritative source for what should be done.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a monthly walk-around to visually inspect for leaks, low
tires and broken light bulbs. Check tire levels with a good gauge,
turn on lights and signals to confirm they are working and pop the
hood to check fluid levels and the condition of the engine and
accessory drive belts.</TE>
<TE>   * Get an oil change and new oil filter every 3,000 to 5,000 miles
or, for vehicles that are not driven much, every six months.</TE>
<TE>   * With each oil change, have the mechanic inspect other fluids,
especially in the brake, automatic transmission and power steering
systems, to make sure they are not burned, soured or contaminated
with water or bits of metal.</TE>
<TE>   * Rotate tires at least every other oil change -- especially
important on modern performance cars with highly tuned suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   * Visually inspect the rubber "boots" that cover and protect the
CV (constant velocity) joints on front-wheel-drive vehicles. Cracked
boots can allow water and dust to get in. This can cause expensive
damage and can make the vehicle dangerous to drive.</TE>
<TE>   * Drain and service automatic transmissions every 24,000 miles or
at two-year intervals.</TE>
<TE>   * Flush and refill cooling systems every two years.</TE>
<TE>   * Adhere to manufacturers' recommendations for changing timing
belts because a failed belt can destroy an engine.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a good mechanic</TE>
<TE>   Some of the work Kretsch recommends is best done by a qualified
mechanic, and for many people the task of hunting for a good mechanic
ranks right up there with having a root canal.</TE>
<TE>   The most common suggestion for finding a good mechanic is to check
with friends and relatives to see where they take their cars and how
satisfied they are; there also are a number of mechanic rating
services on the Internet, including one by the popular National
Public Radio program "Car Talk" at</TE>
<TE>   www.car talk.com (click on Mechan-X Files).</TE>
<TE>   A large number of car enthusiast groups on the Internet, from
Acura owners to classic Ford Mustang clubs, also maintain chat lines
and forums on which people can solicit and make recommendations about
mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the Auto Club of Southern California maintains a
list of mechanics that have passed its screening program -- which
includes checks by the club of the shop's complaint and licensing
history; the training and certifications of its personnel; its
financial stability and insurance status; its tools and equipment;
and shop cleanliness.</TE>
<TE>   The club requires garages that want to display an Auto Club
approval sign to provide at least a 12-month or 12,000-mile warranty
on repairs and to agree to allow the club to resolve disputes with
customers who are Auto Club members.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Kretsch said, the club requires the garages to supply
names and addresses of several hundred customers. It sends surveys to
all of them and approves only those shops with at least a 90%
customer approval rating.</TE>
<TE>   The 630 Southern California auto repair facilities that have
passed the club's scrutiny are listed at www.aaa-calif.com (go to the
ownership and maintenance section); club members also can obtain a
printed list at any of the club's offices or by calling (800)
713-0003.</TE>

<LD>Mitsubishi's 2003 Outlander is a competent addition to the
ever-growing small sport utility vehicle segment and the first of
these car-based crossovers to be marketed for what it is -- a minivan
for people who don't see themselves as minivan drivers.</LD>
<LD>   The company's current outdoor advertising campaign plays on the
Mitsubishi brand's attractiveness to young buyers but makes no
pretense that the Outlander is anything but a minivan substitute.</LD>
<LD>   It is the first of two crossover SUVs from Mitsubishi -- the
mid-size Endeavor will debut in January -- and Pierre Gagnon,
president of the company's North American operating unit, says it is
critical to Mitsubishi's goal of nearly doubling U.S. sales in the
next few years.</LD>
<TE>   Outlander sales have just begun, with 2,240 sold in October, the
first full month of U.S. sales, so there's no way yet to tell how
well consumers are reacting. Mitsubishi says its goal is to sell
40,000 vehicles a year once the marketing program is ramped up.</TE>
<TE>   After two stints behind the wheel, my impression is that
Mitsubishi will do well with the Outlander, although it won't set the
SUV world afire. Outlander provides a nice alternative for shoppers,
especially those who don't like the idea of driving the same car
everyone else has, but it doesn't lead the segment in any of the most
important measurements.</TE>
<TE>   For many, especially in the youthful buyer category Mitsubishi
draws from, the 3,200-pound Outlander's biggest drawback may be lack
of oomph from the smallish 2.4-liter, 140-horsepower, four-cylinder
engine. A four-speed automatic with manually selected "sport" mode is
the only transmission offered.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel economy for the two-wheel-drive version is estimated by
Mitsubishi at 21 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on the
highway. The optional all-wheel drive subtracts one mile per gallon
in each category.</TE>
<TE>   On a daylong drive last summer in the mountains near Bend, Ore.,
switching among several pre-production models, I found the
Outlander's handling and ride, the quality of the fit and finish, and
the comfort and roominess of the passenger compartment to be
impressive. But this SUV doesn't like altitude.</TE>
<TE>   At one point on a moderate incline at an altitude of about 7,000
feet, I put my stopwatch to work while accelerating. With the
automatic in the "drive" position, it took a nervous 13 seconds to
scoot from 60 to 80 mph, an eternity given that the exercise also
involved passing a car on that mountainous road. When I switched to
the transmission's "sport" mode and held it in third gear, the
acceleration time dropped to seven seconds, better but still not
great.</TE>
<TE>   When Mitsubishi made production models available for testing this
fall, I grabbed an Outlander and put it through its paces near sea
level.</TE>
<TE>   Although still no racer, it seems more at home on the urban roads
and freeways of Southern California. I had no problem accelerating up
an onramp and hitting 60 mph in time to merge with the traffic; there
was no problem cruising in the fast lane on the Ventura Freeway at 80
mph, which seems to be the mandatory speed these days, and certainly
no problem keeping up with surface street traffic at anytime of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   My notebook also reveals the following information: "Seats very
firm and well-bolstered. Nice footrest for driver. Still quiet at 100
mph -- just a little wind noise. Good back seats, roomy and they
recline in three positions. Corners pretty flat, with little body
roll even at 80."</TE>
<TE>   All those features, more than the ability to climb steep mountains
in a burst of speed, probably are important to most of the target
buyers. After all, hardly anyone who buys an SUV these days uses it
as anything but a family car.</TE>
<TE>   So comfort while idling in a traffic jam on the Santa Ana Freeway
is of more benefit than the ability to leap logs on a dirt track in
the high Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The redesigned Toyota RAV4 still leads the small SUV pack in
sporty good looks, but the Outlander, with its Formula 1
racer-inspired prow and flared flanks, won't have to hug the wall
while the others get asked to dance. Outlander's styling is racier
than the boxy Honda CRV and Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute twins.</TE>
<TE>   There are several other small, five-seat SUVs on the market. The
Subaru Forester, Land Rover Freelander and new Kia Sorento come to
mind, but because of higher prices and equipment levels, they may not
be practical alternatives for an Outlander shopper.</TE>
<TE>   But when compared with the RAV4, CRV and Escape/Tribute duo,
Outlander provides a number of standard features for the
front-wheel-drive LS model's $17,997 base price, including power
locks and windows, air conditioning, a 140-watt stereo system,
16-inch wheels and cruise control.</TE>
<TE>   There's even an industry-first feature that everyone should copy:
a hidden storage area under the cargo floor specifically for the
optional roll-up rear cargo cover that in every other SUV gets in the
way when the rear seats are folded flat to make room for bulky cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Outlander's base price jumps to $19,490 for the more lavishly
equipped XLS version. All-wheel drive adds $1,300 to each model.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Outlander doesn't top the competition in headroom or
legroom, it comes close in most passenger space matchups; ties with
Toyota in towing capacity at 1,500 pounds; and is second to the
$17,500, 148-horsepower RAV4 (with automatic) in base price and
engine output.</TE>
<TE>   Where the Outlander suffers most in the comparison charts is cargo
capacity. It has a maximum of 60 cubic feet with seats folded and
24.4 cubic feet with seats in use. Toyota's RAV4 leads the group with
68 cubic feet maximum and 29.2 cubic feet with seats in use, and the
Ford/ Mazda twins have 65 cubic feet of cargo space with seats down
and 33 cubic feet with seats up.</TE>
<TE>   The Mitsubishi does lead the class in ground clearance at 8.3
inches. But that's a dubious honor because even with all-wheel drive,
it is not intended to be much more than a light-duty weekend warrior.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: The Outlander definitely is worth a look and a
test-drive for those in the market for a small crossover SUV that's
more at home on the road than off and one that will stand out in a
shopping mall parking lot. But if zero-to-60 mph acceleration is
important, don't bother with this Mitsubishi.</TE>

<HD>GM to roll out refreshed passenger cars, a radical pickup</HD>
<DH>It hopes to regain some of the car volume lost to Asian and
European automakers. Mitsubishi adds a new SUV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., the only domestic carmaker to gain market share
this year -- on the strength of its redesigned trucks and SUVs -- is
ramping up for an onslaught of new passenger cars as well.</LD>
<LD>   The General wants desperately to regain some of the car- segment
volume that the Asian and European automakers have been taking away
for the last decade. GM's offerings include an all-new Chevrolet
Malibu for 2004; the radical '03 Chevy SSR pickup; and the 2004
Pontiac Bonneville GXP, the first in a new line of GM performance
cars.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Mitsubishi Motors America is launching its fourth SUV,
the mid-size Endeavor, as it pushes to nearly double U.S. sales over
the next five years.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a quick first look at these forthcoming models:</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac's GXP lineup</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac Bonneville GXP: The "GXP" is the new designation for all
Pontiac performance vehicles. The lineup starts with the limited
edition '04 Bonneville GXP with features that will include a
4.4-liter V-8 engine rated at almost 300 horsepower. Sheet metal is
unchanged from the '03 Bonneville, but all that Pontiac plastic
molding is gone, and the front fascia and rear end have been tweaked
for a sleeker, meaner look. Pontiac says GXP versions of the Grand
Prix and Grand Am will follow, and it also has shown concept versions
of Vibe and Sunfire GXPs with supercharged four-cylinder engines.</TE>
<TE>   Chevy's hot rod pickup</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet SSR: A three-seat pickup that GM says is intended to add
practical storage space -- the cargo bed is 5 feet by 3 feet -- to a
package that combines the open-air thrills of a roadster with the
style of a custom hot rod (although a mass-produced custom is an
oxymoron). Power for the rear-wheel-drive vehicle will come from a
6.0-liter V-8, and preliminary specifications call for it to be
portioned out via a four-speed electronic automatic transmission. The
SSR's curving steel hardtop folds up and slides away between the cab
and the bed. The package will ride on 20-inch rear and 19-inch front
wheels and tires.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu gets a new body</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet Malibu: The 2004 Malibu is a new car that will be built
from the same platform that supports the '03 Saab 9-3 and the '02
Opel Vectra sold only in Europe. The same platform will provide the
foundation for the Pontiac Grand Am and a future successor to the
Saturn L-series, GM officials say. The Malibu will be launched next
fall. GM's first drawing of the car shows a body that is slightly
smaller, but far more aerodynamic than the current Malibu. The new
platform makes it possible to increase passenger cabin volume despite
the smaller exterior dimensions. Styling cues will include a chrome
front bar and a gold Chevy bowtie emblem, part of a new Chevy family
look. The Malibu line will expand in '04 with the Maxx, a new body
style that GM calls a five-door extended sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi's endeavor</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi Endeavor: This initial sketch of the Endeavor concept
hints at what Mitsubishi's newest SUV will be: a sport wagon with a
lower roof- line than a standard SUV, a front end with jet-fighter
intake scoops and the stance of a sprinter at the starting blocks.
The five-passenger, mid-size Endeavor will have a V-6 engine and will
be built on a car-like unitized body instead of a truck's ladder
frame.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---
SSR Update</TE>
<TE>Los Angeles Times  Wednesday November 27, 2002
Home Edition  Highway 1  Part G  Page 2  Business Desk
1 inches;  60 words</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet's upcoming SSR roadster-pickup will be a two-seater with a
5.3-liter V-8 engine, not a three-seater with a 6.0-liter V-8 as
reported in the Showroom column in last week's Highway 1 (Nov. 20).
The larger engine and extra seat were part of the SSR concept
package, but specifications for the hot-rod-styled SSR have changed,
Chevrolet said.

<HD>Jesus in a Geo? It would be a miracle</HD>

<LD>Theologians have wrestled with some pretty bizarre questions over the
centuries, such as "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"
and "Do hair and fingernails keep growing in heaven?"</LD>
<LD>   The latest head-scratcher is "What would Jesus drive?" The
traditional answer is "a donkey." But what if Jesus had been born in
modern times? Would he choose public transit or a private car? Stick
shift or automatic? A sport-utility vehicle roomy enough for all 12
apostles or an economy model?</LD>
<LD>   Jim Ball, a Baptist pastor who runs the Pennsylvania-based
Evangelical Environmental Network, doesn't think such questions are
esoteric. His group is launching a "What would Jesus drive?" ad
campaign today designed to discourage Christians from buying
gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Ball argues that God would choose an environmentally friendly
vehicle, such as a Toyota Prius, which has a hybrid gasoline-electric
motor. But other "theologians" disagree.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler theorized that
Jesus would tool around in a vintage Plymouth because "the Bible says
God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden in a Fury."</TE>
<TE>   And our research department uncovered several other divinely
approved autos. For example, in Psalm 83, the Almighty apparently
owned a Pontiac and a Geo. The passage urges the Lord to "pursue your
enemies with your Tempest and terrify them with your Storm," although
theologians aren't sure how a Geo Storm could be considered
terrifying, unless it had those scary shooting flames painted on the
sides.</TE>
<TE>   Another scripture indicates that Yahweh favored Dodge pickup
trucks. Moses' followers are warned not to go up a mountain until
"the Ram's horn sounds a long blast."</TE>
<TE>   God also owned an AMC vehicle. In the book of Exodus, he promised
to "send the Hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and
Hittites out of your way."</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars insist that Jesus drove a Honda but preferred not to
discuss it. As proof, they cite a verse in St. John's gospel in which
Christ tells a crowd, "For I did not speak of my own Accord."</TE>
<TE>   Debate continues over whether the Lord's Honda had bumper stickers
that said, "My other car is a flaming chariot," "Honk if you love me"
or "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well-pleased because he was
an honor student at Galilee Elementary."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ostler has discovered another transportation-related
scripture: Moses rode an old British motorcycle, as evidenced by a
Bible passage declaring that "the roar of Moses' Triumph is heard in
the hills."</TE>

<HD>The Brit in all of us</HD>
<DH>Two symbols of modern British life have connected with
millions of harried Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mimi Avins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bridget Jones and Kate Reddy are heroines to millions of American
women, the beloved protagonists of two bestselling novels whose
overstuffed lives and conflicted emotions are as funny as they are
achingly familiar. The curious thing about these two frank,
self-deprecating symbols of suffering singlehood (Jones) and harried
working motherhood (Reddy) is that they aren't American at all. They
sprang from the imaginations of writers Helen Fielding and Allison
Pearson, respectively. And both Fielding and Pearson, as well as
their creations, are quite thoroughly British.</LD>
<LD>   We're long over being a colony trying to prove itself to the
motherland. And yet, isn't it odd that a number of novels conceived
in London so aptly describe the lives we live and our feelings about
them? Doesn't that chafe our national pride just a bit? Bridget Jones
was so adored that she was a natural as a movie's star, even if it
would take Texas-born actress Renee Zellweger -- sporting a British
accent and additional poundage -- to embody her. Kate Reddy, a
35-year-old hedge-fund manager and mother of two whose tale is
sarcastically titled "I Don't Know How She Does It" (Knopf, 2002), is
on her way to the big screen too: Miramax Pictures has purchased the
film rights.</LD>
<TE>   The phenomenon of contemporary British writers with their pens on
some kind of trans-Atlantic pulse isn't limited to books aimed at
women. No young American male author can boast of the rabid audience
of Nick Hornby, whose bestselling novels about men flummoxed by
relationships -- "High Fidelity" (Putnam, 1995) and "About a Boy"
(Riverhead Books, 1998) -- were made into movies as well.</TE>
<TE>   If those North Atlantic island dwellers who call running shoes
"trainers" and eat kippers for breakfast were really as
stiff-upper-lipped and repressed as our stereotypes of them suggest,
then how could they be as self-revelatory as Bridget and Kate? Of
course, they couldn't. So, it might be time to adjust our image of
the English, and even to admit at least temporary defeat in this
particular war of words.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the English men who are stiff and very unemotional," says
Caroline Graham, a former West Coast editor of the New Yorker and
Talk Magazine who, like her friend Tina Brown, immigrated to America.
"The women in Britain have tremendous interaction and are
tremendously open."</TE>
<TE>   "Bridget Jones's Diary" began as a column in the Independent, and
Kate Reddy came to life in a column in the Daily Telegraph, the
largest-circulation newspaper in London. Nigella Lawson, the British
author and star of "Nigella Bites," a cooking show seen here on the
E! and Style cable networks, was literary editor and a columnist for
the Sunday Times. "American journalists take what they do very
seriously," she says. "They're seekers after Truth. Over here, we
have such a horror of looking like we're trying too hard. We have so
many tabloids. So, British journalism is more a function of
entertainment. There are many more columns that don't attempt to be
heavyweight. That frees the writers and the readers up. There's a
Latin proverb that translates as 'art lies in hiding art.' That may
be the British way. Literary writers can have a hard time here,
because they're thought to be pretentious. We have a long history of
anti-intellectualism. With columns, it's not as if everything you sit
down and write must be lofty. It can be about the everyday, about how
you live your life."</TE>
<TE>   A few American success stories have challenged this particular
literary hegemony of the British. Candace Bushnell's "Sex and the
City" columns appeared in the New York Observer before they were
compiled and published in 1997 (nine months before "Bridget Jones's
Diary" hit the bookstores). They became the source for the hit HBO
series. "The Nanny Diaries," by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus (St.
Martin's Press, 2002), found a following and will be made into a
movie, although it offers more a poisonous look at how the other half
lives than a mirror in which many of its readers can recognize
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That social satire shares an important quality of the British
bestsellers: It is not set in an all-American milieu. Suzanne Gluck,
a William Morris literary agent who represents the "Nanny" authors,
says, "The closed world of the Park Avenue Mommy is exotic to most of
the American public. I think the slight exoticism of telling Bridget
Jones' or Kate Reddy's story through a British lens was incredibly
compelling. For an American audience, those stories are a little too
much like life if they're in an American context. It's charming to be
counting kilos instead of pounds or fags instead of cigarettes. I
don't think you can assume that no one here has tried to write those
books. They just didn't seem exciting to American agents or
publishers."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the details differ, American women have responded
to the novels' universal feminine themes. It makes no difference that
Kate Reddy distresses store-bought mince pies so they'll look
homemade for a school Christmas party. Pastries vary. Working-mother
guilt is constant.</TE>
<TE>   "After the holidays, I always sense a special edge to the
children's neediness," Kate muses in the book. "Far from being
satisfied by the time we've had together they seem famished, as
ravenous for my attention as newborns. It's as though the more they
have of me, the more they're reminded how much they want. (Maybe
that's true of every human appetite: sleep begets sleep; eating makes
you hungry; [sex] stokes desire.) Clearly, my kids have not grasped
the principle of Quality Time."</TE>
<TE>   "Before I was married, I was Bridget Jones," says New Yorker Meryl
Poster, "and now I'm this character, Kate Reddy." The 38-year old
Miramax Films co-president of production first read some of the Kate
Reddy columns when she was pregnant with her second child. "The day I
go for amniocentesis is my favorite time," she says, "because I can't
take any business calls. All I do is lie around and eat Mallomars and
read. A woman like me doesn't usually get to read for enjoyment. What
struck me about Kate Reddy is a lot of it is sad and a little
depressing, but it's so real. It spoke to me, both personally and
professionally."</TE>
<TE>   With a 4-year-old daughter, a 10-month-old son and a high-octane
job, Poster understands Kate Reddy's struggles. "No matter how
helpful the husband is, and my husband is extremely helpful, there
are some things that a mother takes responsibility for -- doing the
birthday party, scheduling the child's appointments and activities,"
she says. "And those are the highlights in a working woman's day.
They just fall to the mother. It's an evolutionary skill, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Miramax bought Kate Reddy's story before the novel was completed.
"We were interested in doing another 'Bridget Jones'-type movie,
something that speaks to women on an emotional and humorous level,"
Poster says. "It's really hard to replicate these really well-done
books. Americans wear everything on our sleeves. We're very open
about how hard it is to be a working mother, but we go on 'Oprah' and
talk about it. The British have the same kinds of thoughts, but
instead of just talking about them, they write them down in these
novels that are so current and meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   The category of "chick lit" did grow steadily in
turn-of-the-millennium America, with such notable contributions as
Melissa Bank's "The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing" (Viking,
1999), Lucinda Rosenfeld's "What She Saw" (Random House, 2000) and
Laura Zigman's "Animal Husbandry" (Dial Press, 1998). But no American
character challenged Bridget Jones' iconic status. Rather, American
faith in the Popular Mechanics approach to life -- follow these steps
and the engine will roar -- produced a nonfiction canon of manuals on
sex and love. Londoners laughed along with Bridget Jones. Angelenos
earnestly studied "The Rules."</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Kunes, Redbook editor in chief, is married with 5-year-old
twin sons.</TE>
<TE>   "American women have always had a very can-do attitude," she says.
"When you go out into this country, you find that women aren't
obsessing so much about their lives, they're living them. We find in
our magazine that what women want are the tools to make their lives
work better."</TE>
<TE>   Fielding now lives in Los Angeles, where she's observed more
action than introspection. "In England, there's a tendency to be
quite self-conscious," she says. "We spend more time sitting,
drinking bottles of wine in front of the fireplace and contemplating
our navels instead of galloping across the plains." The author
credits a smaller literary pond for helping her novel sell so
swimmingly. "There's less media in England, so it's easier to get
attention there."</TE>
<TE>   Nita Taublib, executive vice president and deputy publisher at
Bantam Dell, agrees. "The U.K. book market is so much more publicity
driven, especially for fiction, than ours," she says. "There is a
much more circumscribed audience there, and they make a more
intensive publicity effort and create more of a buzz. The parties
they throw and the stunts they do, it's astounding." Taublib has
published British author Sophie Kinsella's "Confessions of a
Shopaholic" (2001) and "Shopaholic Takes Manhattan" (2002),
bestselling comic novels featuring dedicated spendthrift Becky
Bloomwood, a 25-year-old financial journalist. "Universal themes,
treated in a way everyone gets, translate whether readers are in
London or New York. What makes these books work is the writer's
voice."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson believes the British gift for pessimism and irony has well
served her, and her countrymen, in print. She says, " 'Bridget Jones'
and Nick Hornby's books and mine have extreme irony in common. And
irony isn't the normal American mode. It may be a weaker country's
mode. Irony is for wimps. Britain has been losing power and prestige
for the last 50 or 100 years. That brings a certain ruefulness. The
British capacity for moaning is considerable. Gloom is the national
hobby."</TE>
<TE>   A relentlessly positive attitude leaves little room for a sense of
humor, something American feminists have long been accused of
lacking. Kate Reddy doesn't pretend she can have it all, unless "it"
can be defined as baby drool on her blouse, sleep deprivation and the
distant memory that sex used to be fun.</TE>
<TE>   "The women I've encountered in the U.S. feel that owning up to
weakness is taboo," Pearson says. "American women keep looking for
the positive aspects of juggling motherhood and a career. They're
still hoping to find out that day care is good for your kids. My book
is saying all kinds of things that have been unsayable. For a woman,
especially Americans, owning up to anything that might make you
unlikable is difficult. We want to have everything men have, and to
be liked as well."</TE>
<TE>   Redbook editor Kunes believes British authors complain more,
albeit humorously, because their pain is greater than ours. "The
feeling that kept coming back to me, reading about Kate Reddy, was
that her problems were so 1989," she says. "Our society makes it
easier for a woman to lead a full life, one with work and family.
These books are wonderfully written and they're biting and
wonderfully honest and fun, but it's clear theirs is a more
male-dominated, traditional society, and they're dealing with more
ingrained chauvinistic attitudes. The good news for American women is
our society is way more progressive. We aren't writing these books
because we aren't experiencing these problems as intensely."</TE>
<TE>   Writing is often a no-guts, no-glory endeavor. On the subject of
working mothers, the spoils seem to be going to Pearson, a woman
brave enough to whine and clever enough to infuse her lament with
comedy. Los Angeles transplant Graham thinks Americans dump their
frustrations in the wrong place: "I see more depression and visits to
doctors here in the States. Perhaps it is writing that is cathartic,
not a trip to the psychiatrist. The English have figured out that
writing can be a form of therapy that pays better."</TE>

<HD>Orange finishes in the red</HD>
<DH>Eclectic festival lost $434,000 at box office; donors
covered the shortfall. It spent $2.2 million to present equestrian
troupe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Philharmonic Society of Orange County lost $434,000 on its recent
Eclectic Orange Festival but was able to tap some of its regular
donors to make up the shortfall, executive director Dean Corey said.</LD>
<LD>   In its fourth season, Eclectic Orange spent $2.2 million --
two-thirds of the festival's $3.3-million budget -- to become only
the second U.S. presenter of the French equestrian troupe Theatre
Zingaro. Zingaro accounted for 22 of the 41 performances, and for 78%
of the festival attendance of 35,563. But Corey said it also
accounted for most of the shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Needing $1.985 million to break even, the Philharmonic Society
took in $1.551 million at the box office.</LD>
<TE>   Sixteen additional festival performances, including Opera
Pacific's five stagings of "La Boheme," were presented by other
organizations and are not included on the Philharmonic Society's
books, Corey said.</TE>
<TE>   Zingaro's blend of horsemanship, modern dance, somber themes and
oblique, story-less presentation "was more sophisticated, probably,
than some people imagined," Corey said, but "it's something people
will remember for a long time." He said attendance at the Oct.
11-Nov. 10 festival also was hurt by the poor economy and competing
telecasts of the Anaheim Angels' World Series run.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic Society, Orange County's leading presenter of
touring classical musicians, probably won't stake so much on a single
attraction again, Corey said.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't rule out a return of Theatre Zingaro in 2005.</TE>

<HD>Forget the fury; TLC is missing a friend</HD>
<DH>In the aftermath of Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes' death, surviving
members ponder the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A button was pushed in error and, just like that, her voice was back
in the recording studio, rhyming and reminding. It had been only a
few weeks since the death of Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, and the
unexpected sound of her voice was jolting to the other members of
TLC.</LD>
<LD>   "I just lost it there for a little bit," Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins
said of the eerie moment. "It was really hard. We had to go home
early. We were already not reading the papers and not watching TV,
trying to keep it out of our mind. As if we could do that."</LD>
<LD>   They had bickered and declared bankruptcy, fought criminal
charges, endured medical maladies and been the constant target of
rumors. But most of all, TLC made memorable hits with a slinky,
dance-floor feminism and sold 14.5 million albums in the United
States, a career total that trails only the Dixie Chicks on the tally
of pop's most successful female groups.</LD>
<TE>   Now, though, the end may be near.</TE>
<TE>   The group's fourth album, "3D," arrived in stores last week and is
expected to debut in the Top 10 of the pop album charts that will be
released today by SoundScan. More than a new chapter, Watkins says
"3D" will write the ending of the group's remarkably volatile career.
As Watkins asks: "Can there be a TLC without Lisa?"</TE>
<TE>   The flamboyant Lopes, the resident rapper in TLC's construct of
R&amp;B and hip-hop, died in April in a car crash in Honduras. That
tragedy has closed the book on a group that has been defined for a
decade by drama and resilience.</TE>
<TE>   TLC had been in the studio in the weeks before the death of the
30-year-old Lopes, and according to Watkins, the group was in a
groove and enjoying each other's company more than ever. "We've been
through so much," Watkins said. "And then for this to happen.... "</TE>
<TE>   Lopes, Watkins and Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas became TLC in 1991 in
Atlanta and a year later gained national attention for the songs
"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg" and "Baby, Baby, Baby." The group would go on
to have signature hits with "Waterfalls," "No Scrubs," "Unpretty" and
"Creep," but they were constantly rumored to be breaking up amid a
series of setbacks and occasional public spats. Lopes pleaded guilty
to burning down the home of her boyfriend, Watkins was found to have
sickle-cell anemia, and all three claimed to be in dire financial
straits despite their huge record sales.</TE>
<TE>   All of that seems trivial now, Watkins said, following the death
of "someone who was a sister to me, no matter what we went through or
said."</TE>
<TE>   The pixieish Lopes brought attitude and many of the style concepts
that would make TLC a distinctive force in pop with its album titles
and themes, music videos and stage fashions. The new album, "3D," was
a Lopes idea -- three members, each bringing a varied voice and
talent and each evident in strong relief. Lopes also set the
blueprint for the visual imagery for the project.</TE>
<TE>   The album is dedicated to Lopes, and the track "Turntable" is an
especially poignant song dedicated to the late rapper. Lopes herself
is heard on five tracks. A chunk of her vocal work on the disc was
pulled from a stash of solo work she had put together for an album
called "Supernova" that was never released in the U.S., and producers
including Dallas Austin grafted her voice onto tracks such as
"Quickie."</TE>
<TE>   "She had a lot of stuff laying around and we went through it, and
the interesting thing is Lisa is probably on this album more than any
other TLC album," Austin said. "We took pieces of two or three other
songs, for instance, and made this one song called 'Quickie,' and
somehow it all worked. It worked almost like she was there."</TE>
<TE>   Austin was joined by a squad of top producers, such as Rodney
Jerkins, Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds and the Neptunes and the result
is a wider musical variety than perhaps any other TLC collection.
Austin, for one, is also certain it will be the final TLC album.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see them going on," said the producer, who has worked
with TLC since its earliest days in the studio. "I used to call them
the 'cats,' because you could throw them out the 99th floor of a
building and they would land on their feet. So many things have
happened to them. But they were all there together, but now they
won't go on without that group all together."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has says she is intent on finishing up a solo album and, if
it is successful, it is easy to imagine TLC calling it quits. Even if
"3D" is the final full album of new material, the group will be back
next year with a greatest-hits album that will include several tracks
finished in the sessions over the past year in Atlanta studios. The
labors, Watkins said, were especially difficult after Lopes' death.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins and Thomas have promoted the album with select public and
television appearances -- among them "Total Request Live" on MTV,
where hundreds of TLC fans showed up, many sporting a black stripe on
their left cheeks, a nod to Lopes' trademark look. "I think Lisa
would be proud of us and this new album," Watkins said. Fans
shouldn't expect the surviving members of TLC to share their
memorializing spirit in live performances, however. "I can't see us
touring or doing anything like that," Watkins said. "TLC is not what
it was and we aren't going to pretend that is."</TE>

<HD>TV's big noisemaker -- and proud of it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Fleiss is 6-foot-4, broad-shouldered, with long, close-shaven
sideburns that form parentheses on either side of his face. He wears
sunglasses during staff meetings and talks to his agent 10 times a
day. Fleiss' second cousin is Heidi Fleiss, the infamous ex-Hollywood
madam. But Mike Fleiss says the two are not really that close.</LD>
<LD>   As a TV producer, a macher-in-progress, Fleiss, who is 38, has two
offices -- one in the old Sherman Oaks Galleria, where he runs "The
Bachelor," his hit ABC series whose second season climaxes tonight at
9, and another one on the Warner Bros. lot that Fleiss says used to
belong to Tom Selleck. "I hardly ever go there," Fleiss said of the
Selleck office, which he got when he signed a deal two years ago with
Warner Bros.' Telepictures Productions. "It's awesome, it's got a
shower."</LD>
<LD>   Showering is what some people feel like doing after watching the
television Fleiss makes, which before "The Bachelor" included
cut-and-paste jobs like "Before They Were Stars" and, later, "Who
Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire." That Fox special drew great
ratings but was promptly engulfed in scandal, when it was revealed
that producers -- namely, executive producer Fleiss -- had failed to
discover a restraining order in groom Rick Rockwell's past.</LD>
<TE>   The episode briefly derailed his career -- but ever so briefly --
and in the end it more than likely helped, because it proved that
Mike Fleiss could create noise. According to Fleiss, who at the time
was hiding from the media while Fox conducted damage control, two
rival network presidents called him in the midst of the scandal to
see if he could duplicate the on-air shotgun marriage for them. A
short time later Fox -- after Sandy Grushow, the studio's top TV
executive, loudly declared his network was out of the shock business
-- bought two more of Fleiss' shows. The concepts, to Fleiss' way of
thinking, weren't all that chancy, but a sale is a sale. One of the
specials was called "Million Dollar Mysteries" and the other "Battle
of the Child Geniuses." Citing "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"
Fleiss calls this his Bolivia period.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true what they say, man," Fleiss said of the TV business
during an interview in his office last week, where framed posters on
the wall suggest his cultural influences (Jimi Hendrix, "The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre"). "They don't care. If you've got what they want,
they'll buy it."</TE>
<TE>   They are now. On Tuesday, ABC announced it was picking up another
show from Fleiss' Next Entertainment, this one called "Are You Hot?,"
described as a talent search for the sexiest person in America. In
addition to "The Bachelor," three other Fleiss series are either in
production or have received network pickups: "The Bachelorette" for
ABC; "High School Reunion" for the WB; and "The Will," in which an
actual family will fight over an actual rich guy's will. The show,
picked up by ABC, is still in search of a family amenable to airing
its dirty laundry on national TV. It seems safe to say Fleiss will
locate one.</TE>
<TE>   Should all four of these shows fulfill their network orders,
Fleiss will be responsible for more prime-time shows than many top
producers in the business, including David E. Kelley and Steven
Bochco.</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss' ascension, you could say, mirrors the networks' deepening
commitment to staged reality television, despite howls of protest
from social commentators and embarrassing behind-the-scenes gaffes
like the Rockwell imbroglio.</TE>
<TE>   Today, none of that matters. Fleiss' "Bachelor" is outperforming
"The West Wing" Wednesday nights at 9, averaging nearly 14 million
viewers and, more importantly, outpacing the competition among young
viewers, particularly females.</TE>
<TE>   From an economic standpoint, "The Bachelor" is doing what
countless costly ABC situation comedies and dramas have failed to do:
Draw young viewers to the network and create a PR splash, featuring
civilians as stars -- neophytes who are both grateful for the
opportunity and easily replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight on "The Bachelor," millions will watch Missouri banker
Aaron Buerge choose either Helene or Brooke, the final beauties
culled from a crop of 25.</TE>
<TE>   "As a programmer, I love this show. As a woman, I'm really
intrigued by it," said Susan Lyne, entertainment president at ABC,
which recently signed Fleiss to a multiyear development deal. "It's
not a mean-spirited show. If anything, it's like the big debutante
ball where there are lots of eligible girls and a guy who's deciding
which one he wants to ask to dance."</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss knows his shows lack complex, fully developed characters,
and that reality concepts tend to flame out of their own accord. In
this universe, the concepts currently in fashion matter less than the
ability to keep generating new twists on what's working, something
that will have a short, but spectacular, run on TV before the next
distraction comes along.</TE>
<TE>   This is a game that Fleiss -- who grew up in Fullerton and
attended UC Berkeley, where he gravitated toward journalism -- has
been playing since he landed his first real job in television in the
early '90s, writing stunts for the Fox show "Totally Hidden Videos."
He was in his 20s, his wife pregnant, writing up treatments for funny
stuff you could do to unsuspecting people with a hidden camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it so bad, dude," Fleiss said of the hidden videos job.
"I wanted it so [expletive] bad."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Fleiss proved adept at canvassing the country for
videotape, cold-calling and trolling the Internet for footage to
license, something you could package as, say, Fox's "World's Scariest
Police Shoot-outs." In the course of his early travels in the
frontiers of shock TV, he befriended others who today play a big role
in the genre -- Mike Darnell, Fox's executive vice president of
alternative programming and specials, and Bruce Nash, with whom
Fleiss worked on such shows as "Breaking the Magicians' Code," before
the two had a falling out and became rival producer/salesmen.</TE>
<TE>   A former Fleiss show staffer summed up his talents this way: If
anyone could pitch a show in which you either win a Range Rover or
get killed on national TV, it's Fleiss.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never given away a Range Rover," Fleiss deadpanned. "I don't
even like Range Rovers."</TE>
<TE>   Recycled 'Bachelorette'</TE>
<TE>   Around the office, Fleiss has a reputation for wearing shorts and
flip-flops, but Friday he was dressed professionally -- jeans, black
boots, a black shirt and black leather jacket.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview, he took a call from Trista Rehn.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing, honey?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rehn, a former cheerleader for the NBA's Miami Heat, was the
hard-luck loser on the first installment of "The Bachelor," surviving
the cut from 25 women to become one of two finalists, before Alex
Michel, the Stanford MBA, chose to ride off into the TV sunset with
Amanda Marsh, an events planner from Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleiss the master recycler has recast Rehn for "The
Bachelorette": This time, Trista gets to choose from her own pool of
pining men, all of whom, like the female contestants on "The
Bachelor," are conventionally attractive, in the kind of objectified
way that prompted the National Organization for Women recently to
state: "Sexual exploitation has reached a new low on programs like
'The Bachelor.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss is running too fast to care about such matters. In the
opening minutes of "The Bachelorette," Rehn, looking a little
terrified but determined, stands in front of her soft-core Cinderella
pad (a giant rented home in Encino) as a series of square-jawed and
moussed men climb out of limousines and greet her awkwardly.</TE>
<TE>   According to Fleiss, 600 hours of footage of Trista being wooed,
Trista wooing back, Trista being fought over and Trista being
discussed have already been shot; now the job is to whittle the raw
film down to six hours of prime-time television.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's an enemy of the show is camaraderie among the
guys," Fleiss told 25 of his staffers during a story meeting. He
wanted footage of "guys trashing guys," particularly during their
ITMs (reality-showspeak for "in the moment" interviews"). There was
conflict in those 600 hours, and finding it involved reducing the men
to easily recognized stereotypes and then conjuring whatever tension
there was to be conjured in the editing room. Around a conference
table littered with pizza boxes, there was talk of "the chiseler,"
and "the nerd guy" and "Mr. Schadenfreude." "The chiseler," you could
tell, was an emerging character.</TE>
<TE>   Casting, Fleiss said, involves weeding out the people simply
looking for a way into show business, something the syndicated dating
shows like "Blind Date" don't do, he claimed. People try out for
shows like "The Bachelor" because "it's an adventure and it's a new
experience and I think that's attractive to a larger sector of people
than you would think," Fleiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Background checks, a subject Fleiss learned about the hard way,
include blood tests for sexually transmitted diseases. A third of the
people brought in for casting, Fleiss said, get dismissed because
they test positive for herpes.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's a whole industry of these background-check companies,
and whenever I hire one of them they all come in and thank me,
because I put them all in business."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire." When
Fleiss was making the show for Fox, he says, the network had only one
vague directive: "Make sure the guy's a good guy."</TE>
<TE>   The title for the show came from Fox's Darnell, who then turned to
his old friend Fleiss to produce it.</TE>
<TE>   This was at the end of 1999. At the time, Darnell and Fleiss were
going to crash a plane in the desert for a special called "Jumbo Jet
Crash: The Ultimate Safety Test," before Fox backed down. Instead
they did "Multi-Millionaire," concocting a sensation on the fly, only
to touch off a media backlash. An ex-girlfriend of Rockwell's, it was
revealed, had taken out a restraining order against him. Further
questions arose surrounding Rockwell's "millionaire" status and bride
Darva Conger's claims of being a Gulf War veteran.</TE>
<TE>   The debacle, some said, was the result of a producer in over his
head. Today, Fleiss says he would attempt the show again, because it
was good TV. Further, he feels vindicated that subsequent reality
series, including CBS' "Survivor" and "Big Brother," encountered some
of the same problems with contestants that "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" did.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take this stuff seriously," Fleiss said of the notion
that his shows are corrosive or harmful. "I really don't. Even Darva
herself made millions posing for Playboy. You think she's not happy
she did that? Call her at her beach house and find out."</TE>

<HD>James Coburn: Versatile, with a beguiling charm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Champlin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years ago, at a small theater on La Cienega, I went to see a
performance of a play by Edna St. Vincent Millay called "Conversation
at Midnight." At its center -- I remember no one else on stage -- was
a dynamic and fiery young actor named James Coburn.</LD>
<LD>   He was playing, in fact, a fiery and eloquent rebellious young
man, and making the words by Millay ring with truth. So far as I can
remember, I had never seen Coburn before, but his performance was
unforgettable. He seemed larger than the small theater where he was
performing.</LD>
<LD>   Whether you knew his work before, what you recognized in his
performance was that here was an actor to watch -- and so he was.</LD>
<TE>   Coburn, who died Monday at age 74, proved to be a remarkably
versatile performer with a sure command of very literary material
like the Millay work, but capable of doing heroes and villains and,
perhaps above all, comedy that arose from character rather than funny
lines.</TE>
<TE>   He had a kind of mocking insouciance that seemed to go well in a
10-gallon Stetson or no hat at all. He had an easy, wide-mouthed
grin, lots of teeth showing, a kind of trademark in many of his
roles. He could be suave and almost supercilious now and again.</TE>
<TE>   Like many a fine actor who does not quite make it all the way to
superstardom, Coburn became one of the most versatile and best-liked
actors around, one of those actors of character who enriched every
film he was in and gave depth even to those parts that seem
constructed of cardboard. As James Stewart once said, "Those
cardboard parts are the hardest of all to play."</TE>
<TE>   Coburn brought something special to those roles and gave them a
third dimension, however two-dimensional they seemed.</TE>
<TE>   He was such good company on the screen that he figured most often,
or perhaps most successfully, in sophisticated comedies. But like all
good actors, he had a range like a Steinway Grand. He appeared in a
couple of early classic westerns, "Ride Lonesome" and "Face of a
Fugitive." He was part of "Magnificent Seven," which is still one of
the classics of the action genre. At that, Coburn's beguiling charm
will probably be most closely associated with the two "Flint" films
-- "Our Man Flint" (1966) and "In Like Flint" (1967) -- which still
stand as models of sophisticated crime adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Not least, Coburn will be remembered for his valiant triumph in a
battle with arthritis that threatened to shorten his career, but
thankfully never did.</TE>

<DH>BEHIND DEEP BLUE: Building the Computer That Defeated the
World Chess Champion; By Feng-Hsiung Hsu; Princeton University Press
$27.95, 298 pages</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Day</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are deeply into computers or chess, "Behind Deep Blue" will
fascinate and exhilarate you. And if you're interested in learning
about the differences between Chinese and American educational
systems, this book will be extremely insightful.</LD>
<LD>   Even if you have only a passing acquaintance with these things,
you can still read with profit Feng-Hsiung Hsu's account of the
12-year effort to create the machine that, in May 1997, defeated the
world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.</LD>
<LD>   This was not, Hsu firmly and rightly insists, a contest between
man and machine. "The contest," he writes, "was really between men in
two different roles: man as a performer and man as a toolmaker." In
the 1996 match between Kasparov and an IBM computer, Hsu says, man as
performer -- Kasparov -- won; in the 1997 match between Kasparov and
the earlier computer's successor, Deep Blue, man as toolmaker won.</LD>
<TE>   Hsu was the leader of the team that designed the victorious Deep
Blue. When he got the notion that a computer could be built that
could challenge the world chess champion, chess was already being
played by computers. Hsu's singular idea, which came to him when he
was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
was that a computer could be made powerful enough to take on the most
powerful human mind in chess.</TE>
<TE>   Hsu's account is written in an easy, flowing style, and, as he
says, it is rather light-hearted. He attributes this style to two
reasons: his belief that building a computer to play chess is
"seemingly frivolous" and his great admiration for the late Nobel
laureate Richard P. Feynman, who gave a light, humorous touch to his
book " 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!': Adventures of a Curious
Character."</TE>
<TE>   The point that Hsu makes is that building and programming a
computer that can calculate 2 million chess moves a second is not
frivolous, and Feynman was not joking. All science is a kind of play,
in the sense of a play of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Hsu says of himself that he was "lazy" and didn't like to work
very hard when he as growing up in Taiwan. Others would study
continuously; Hsu would study only on the night before an exam, when
he simply filled his head with what he had to know. The Chinese
educational system dated from the Tang Dynasty, which put in place a
rigid system of examinations, based strictly on memorization, that
were intended to ensure high places for smart Chinese regardless of
social station. This system, Hsu writes, does not reward mental
fluidity and innovation as the American system does.</TE>
<TE>   Hsu's lightning-quick, acquisitive intelligence got him in trouble
through a couple of pranks at Carnegie Mellon, until he conceived of
his chess-playing computer. When he and the team he formed there
moved on to IBM -- "Big Blue" -- they ran into some unaccustomed
bureaucracy but also got the enthusiastic backing of the giant firm.</TE>
<TE>   Most of "Behind Deep Blue" is Hsu's tale of encountering and
overcoming obstacles in the design and programming of the computer to
enable it to play chess like a human being. The technical aspects of
both computers and chess will be fully comprehensible only to those
with the appropriate experience and skill. The human story, though,
is clear and exciting: adversity encountered, challenges met, all
with the human elements of pride and anxiety and triumph. And the
human elements, too, of anger and resentment.</TE>
<TE>   Hsu recounts how, during a news conference in the midst of the
1997 contest, Kasparov accused the IBM team of interjecting a human
move into Deep Blue's calculations, an accusation, that is, of
cheating. We do not have from Hsu a fuller account of Kasparov's
complaint. Hsu and his colleagues plausibly deny it, and in any case
Kasparov has never again played against a powerful computer.</TE>

game. Ohio State. Miami. Instead, I get this, a sexy woman on the
make. Like I don't get enough of that in real life.</TE>
<TE>   "To you, words are just play things," Cary Grant is telling Grace
Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "Six centimeters," I tell my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Shhhhh," she says, turning up the TV.</TE>
<TE>   Cary Grant and I have a lot in common. Time and again, we're drawn
to glamorous women of dubious circumstance. Women with a healthy
bosom. Nice jaw line. Credit card balances through the roof.</TE>
<TE>   You know the type. The only sunlight in the room tends to fall on
their delicate faces. Cabs find them on rainy days. Perfect strangers
pick up their bar tabs.</TE>
<TE>   They have this special aura, these women. Nice teeth. Necks like
violins.</TE>
<TE>   "You know as well as I know, this necklace is an imitation," Cary
Grant points out.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm not," Grace Kelly purrs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I make out my soccer lineup on the kitchen counter. The
game is in an hour. I have butterflies in the belly. A game plan
swirling in my head.</TE>
<TE>   Do I play Brittany at midfield? No, Brittany at forward. Do I play
Marisa at forward? No, Marisa at defense.</TE>
<TE>   It's playoffs, you know, and I restructure this lineup over and
over. At work. In my sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Amy at midfield, or Amy at goalkeeper? Kristina at goalkeeper, or
Kristina at defender? Playoffs make you crazy like this.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," I tell my wife, "that we'll try using four defenders
this week."</TE>
<TE>   "Why not eight," she says, "why not nine?"</TE>
<TE>   "Is everything a joke with you?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not 12? Why not 14?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're using four," I say.</TE>
<TE>   I already have nicknames for our new defense. The Four Horsemen.
The Fab Four. The Four Signs of the Apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   It's a brilliant adjustment, four. Why didn't I think of it
earlier? Maybe my coaching position would be more secure.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents haven't fired you yet?" my friend Paul asked the
other day.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard talk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we've all heard the talk: "He's lost control of the players.
The game has passed him by."</TE>
<TE>   It's pointless, this talk. All it does is tear down what we've
worked so hard to build. Such as this new four-defender formation.
The Fearsome Foursome, we'll call them. Or the Four Seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "One parent thinks you don't yell enough," Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your wife," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The pregnant woman?"</TE>
<TE>   "She might be right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Or she could just be upset over this crib situation. For weeks,
she's been asking me to put the old crib together, the one we'd
stored away for the grandkids. The one we need now ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   When I finally did, I found a cross-piece was missing. No big
deal. I'll cut a replacement piece after the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, that baby could come any day," my older daughter warns.</TE>
<TE>   "It could?"</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, the due date is three weeks away."</TE>
<TE>   "It is?"</TE>
<TE>   "Poor Mom," she says.</TE>
<TE>   What about poor Dad? The pregnant dad. I'm dilated at least 7
centimeters now. My coaching career is in disarray. My own kids don't
listen to me. Only the dog will kiss me like he means it.</TE>
<TE>   And, in my heart of hearts, I know that if I repair this old crib
-- say, this afternoon -- I know that there will be a new baby in it
by nightfall. In our family, an empty baby crib becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   All night long, there'd be a newborn in there, demanding things I
can't give. Milk. Talc. Money. As Lenny Bruce once asked about
babies: "Why invite a stranger into the house?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I should just go out and buy a new crib," Grace Kelly
threatens.</TE>
<TE>   Or was it my crazy-pregnant-glamorous wife, the one I can no
longer wrap my arms around? The one with the movie star glow.</TE>
<TE>   These drama queens, you can hardly tell them apart anymore.</TE>

<HD>Oxford choristers make robust L.A. history</HD>
<DH>Dana Marsh, former Paulist director, leads his new ensemble
in its first U.S. appearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The name Dana T. Marsh should have a familiar ring to Southland early
music mavens; he spent several years here (1992-2000) directing the
Paulist Choristers of California before moving on to Oxford to pursue
graduate studies. Last year, Marsh founded a new vocal ensemble
there, Musica Humana Oxford; fittingly, the Da Camera Society of
Mount St. Mary's College's Chamber Music in Historic Sites series
lured Marsh and company to Los Angeles for their first American
appearance Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Musica Humana Oxford has already achieved a tightly knit, flowing,
robust blend of seven male and two female voices that avoids
preciousness and a cloistered scholarly attitude. And they were
placed in a space that made the voices bloom, the vast First
Congregational Church on Commonwealth Avenue at 6th Street.</LD>
<TE>   William Byrd's Mass for Four Voices served as an overall unifying
structure in the first half, in which the rather plain, predictable
sections of the Mass were juxtaposed with richer, more polyphonically
involved responses by Byrd, Tallis and Christopher Tye. The more
emotionally charged music of Purcell occupied most of the second
half, with a patina of anguish coloring his "Funeral Sentences" and
"Lord, I Can Suffer Thy Rebukes." Eventually, Purcell's joyous "O
Sing Unto the Lord" brought us out of the darkness and even several
decades ahead of its time, for the line "Tell it out among the
heathen that the Lord is king," points the way startlingly toward
Handel's "Messiah."</TE>
<TE>   As a prelude, ensemble organist Matthew Martin played the church's
massive Skinner-Schlicker instrument, giving it a flamboyant workout
with Byrd's Fantasia in D Minor.</TE>

<LD>As the holiday season approaches, you might read a book about a
reindeer with a bright red nose that leads Santa's sleigh ("Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer") or one about a dog that thinks she's a
reindeer ("Olive, the Other Reindeer"). Or maybe you'll hear about
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen in
"The Night Before Christmas." Here is some information about reindeer
that may not be covered in these stories. Use it to astound your
friends and family.</LD>
<LD>   Reindeer are members of the deer family.</LD>
<LD>   They are herd animals and dislike being alone.</LD>
<TE>   When they get upset, they make grunting and barking noises that
make them sound a lot like pigs.</TE>
<TE>   When reindeer walk, they make a clicking noise with their hoofs.</TE>
<TE>   The only female members of the deer family that grow antlers are
reindeer and their cousins the caribou.</TE>
<TE>   Reindeer shed their antlers every year in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Reindeer can float easily while swimming because their hair is
hollow.</TE>
<TE>   Four reindeer named Belle, Jingle, Noel and Velvet come to the Los
Angeles Zoo every year at this time. You can see them Nov. 28 through
Jan. 1. While you are there, don't miss the zoo's annual Reindeer
Romp event from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. On weekends there will be
carolers, holiday crafts for children and photo opportunities with
Santa Claus. For more information, call (323) 644-6400 or visit
www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<LD>"We all want to make this place the best spot in the world right
now!" roared Ebbot Lundberg on Monday at the Troubadour. The singer
for the Soundtrack of Our Lives let the feedback fade just long
enough, then unleashed his leaping, kicking, posing, six-Swede front
to fill the room again with unrestrained lust for rock catharsis and
sonic liberation.</LD>
<LD>   Rock believer Lundberg has transformed the Stooges churn of his
former band, Union Carbide Productions, into a chiming, epic,
primordial experience.</LD>
<LD>   Swooping around the stage like a modern-day Rasputin in long hair,
beard and black cassock, Lundberg had a terrifically charismatic
presence made that much more bizarre by the pretty-boy cliches of the
rest of the band. Wearing perfect Keith Richards and Mick Ronson
haircuts circa 1972, sporting double-neck guitars, and punctuating
every power chord with seriously weird mock-rock poses, they even
repeatedly pointed their guitars like guns at the audience. If it
weren't for the utterly convincing sounds coming out of them, the
whole thing would have collapsed as a joke.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Soundtrack's naive enthusiasm was a strangely clever
costume for deeper-felt emotions, dealing squarely with rock's most
enduring themes: alienation, not belonging, looking for something
beautiful in a world that seems dead set against it.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Lundberg got to the encore, rolling his eyes and
motioning like a psychedelic shaman, he revealed where this was
really heading, shouting his lyrics, "To the center of the Milky
Way!"</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the lightweight '60s garage homage of Norwegian opener
Cato Salsa Experience, this was a rich, mature and masterful
performance by a group deserving a wider audience.</TE>

<HD>It's Frank's kind of hall</HD>
<DH>In a salute to his legacy and love of education, Sinatra's
family and friends gather at USC's Norris Cinema Center to dedicate
an auditorium named for him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monday was a very good night at USC. The moon was yellow, the breeze
soft, and Frank Sinatra's music hung like stardust in the balmy air.</LD>
<LD>   The Eileen Norris Cinema Center at the school was transformed for
the evening into a celebration honoring the life and times of the guy
some called The Chairman of the Board. It was an event to dedicate
the new Frank Sinatra Hall, a state-of-the-art auditorium at the
university's cinema and television school. The space has been
completely refurbished and updated with funds donated by Sinatra's
daughters, Tina and Nancy, to honor and perpetuate their father's
legacy.</LD>
<LD>   "My dad thought education was the answer to all the world's
problems, and we could think of no more appropriate way to honor
him," Tina said as she greeted friends and family who turned out for
the building dedication. The hall's outer lobby was filled with
Sinatra's Oscars, Grammys, gold and platinum records and an
astounding assortment of movie posters from the Cary Grant, Gene
Kelly and Doris Day days. Old photographs of the Rat Pack and his
ex-wives, Mia, Ava and Nancy, dotted every available surface.</LD>
<TE>   Sinatra's first wife, Nancy (they were married from 1939 to 1951),
who's the mother of his children, arrived with actress and family
friend Suzanne Pleshette. "We're old friends, our families go way
back together," Pleshette said. "My father ran the Paramount theater
in New York when Frank was playing there."</TE>
<TE>   Also among the hordes on hand were Alana Stewart; Wendy Stark;
John Burnham; Barbara Davis; Wendy Goldberg; Tita Cahn (whose late
husband, Sammy, wrote lyrics for dozens of Sinatra's top hits);
daughter Nancy's two children, Amanda and A.J.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad wanted me and all his kids to go to school," Nancy later told
the crowd during the ceremony. But she slept through her Italian
exam, among other things; she was more interested in pursuing a music
career than a college degree. Tina "never even considered" college,
Nancy added. And their brother, Frank Jr. (not on hand for this
event), likewise dropped the academic ball.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy's daughters, however, would have made their grandfather
proud. One graduated from USC, the other from Loyola Marymount. Nancy
and Tina, sitting at that first family college graduation, realized
that "we ought to do something to honor Dad, who would have been so
proud," Nancy concluded, breaking into tears.</TE>
<TE>   Quincy Jones, an American icon in his own right, showed up at the
event wearing a replica of Sinatra's favorite gold ring, given to him
by Tina, he said. "I never take it off. I think about him every day.
He made me feel part of his family and his life. I can see him up
there now, smilin' down."</TE>
<TE>   Sinatra's legacy will never die, Jones believes, "because
Sinatra's got the street sensibilities of bebop and hip-hop. The kids
today love him, the rappers. They call him the O.G.," for original
gangster. Jones led a student jazz band in renditions of famous
Sinatra songs. The night wound down with a party in the outdoor plaza
and strains of "I've Got You Under My Skin" filling the air.</TE>

<HD>Aiello's group appeals N.Y. 'no' on studio</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A group including actor Danny Aiello has gone to court to prevent a
city agency from halting its efforts to build a movie studio on an
abandoned Navy yard in Staten Island.</LD>
<LD>   The developers of the Stapleton Studios project received a
six-month occupancy permit at the start of the year, then got that
extended to Oct. 31 while transforming one building -- a large
refrigeration shed -- into a soundstage. But the city's Economic
Development Corp. refused to extend the permit, citing what one
official called a "series of deficiencies" in the group's plan.</LD>
<LD>   The developers have acknowledged that one partner's son had been
convicted of a stock fraud conspiracy charge but said he was not
involved in the project. They have asked the Staten Island Superior
Court to allow them to continue to use and develop the 35-acre site,
where Aiello said last year that he hoped to create more than 10
soundstages and 5,500 jobs.</LD>
<TE>   "We've spent in excess of $2.5 million," another of the partners,
Robert DeMilia, said Tuesday. "We do have the funding."</TE>
<TE>   A court hearing on the dispute is scheduled Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "The city is still very much in favor of a studio project at the
Staten Island home port," a city official said, "but not with this
group."</TE>
<TE>   The Staten Island venture is the latest in a series of projects to
build more soundstages in New York, whose officials frequently
complain about how many movies set in the city are shot elsewhere.</TE>

<LD>   Pressed for more expression, DiCaprio -- anchored protectively for
this interview between his "Catch Me If You Can" co-star Tom Hanks
and his director Steven Spielberg -- manages to muster up, "I think
ultimately, success is good. Failure not so good ... uh .... " To
that, we respond with "Duh!"</LD>
<LD>   Walters' interview with Di- Caprio, his first TV sit-down since
1997, airs Friday on ABC's "20/20." The young actor, who seems shy
and sensitive to the extreme for someone who has chosen a public
career, does expound a bit more fully on what his life turned into
after the mega-success of "Titanic."</LD>
<TE>   He says, "There's no handbook for fame ... there's no handbook for
being splashed on the cover of People when you didn't want to be
there, or the cover of the National Enquirer. I had nobody to talk
to, nobody to guide me. But on that same token, I'm not at all going
to sit here and say that I'm not completely grateful and feel
completely blessed for everything that's happened in my career."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm -- not to be mean to Leo, but I must ask here, what did he
expect after they told him he'd star in one of the biggest-budget
films of all-time -- "Titanic"? Did he think he wouldn't be on the
covers of People and the National Enquirer? And didn't he have people
like Michael Ovitz he could talk to and guide him? These days, it
seems to me that he is surrounded by protectors and handlers who
treat him as if he were made of spun sugar.</TE>

<HD>Forget ratings, ranking and reviews, 'Scrubs' is judged by
the company it keeps</HD>
<DH>HOW can a show be watched by more than 18 million people a
week, rank ninth among all programs on television, see its audience
soar 65% over the previous year, garner mostly positive reviews and
still be dismissed as a paper tiger?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy when you have "Friends."</LD>
<LD>   Such is the lot of "Scrubs," which took up residence in prime
time's most unforgiving prime-time acreage this season when NBC
positioned it after "Friends." Based on the hospital comedy's Nielsen
chart, all life signs should be vital, were it not for the mitigating
fact that 30% of "Friends" viewers -- nearly 8 million people --
don't hang around to "Must-See" it each Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Television executives have developed a roster of terms to politely
describe the programming pilot fish that draw sustenance from TV's
big predators. They are "satellite" shows, which, when lucky enough
to be sandwiched by two popular series, are "hammocked" between "tent
poles."</LD>
<TE>   As a result, their performance is judged more by "lead-in
retention" (sounds like a medical condition, doesn't it?) than raw
tonnage. Such a show can be a "time-period hit" and a failure, which
explains the demise of "Friends' " previous neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the weirdest barometer in the world to talk about
'retention,' " said "Scrubs" creator and executive producer Bill
Lawrence. "You find yourself depressed when you're the
fifth-most-watched show in the country. It's a strange position to be
in."</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, a cursory trip through the weekly Nielsen
standings often doesn't tell you much. Because for all the new
technology available -- not the least being the old-fashioned remote
control -- millions of viewers lumpishly sit through marginal
programs if they happen to dwell next to well-established ones.</TE>
<TE>   Several newer series fall into this category of perceived
parasites, from CBS' "Yes, Dear" and "Still Standing" on Mondays to
NBC's "Good Morning, Miami," which replaced "Just Shoot Me."</TE>
<TE>   Satellite shows thus become the Rodney Dangerfields of television,
garnering scant respect, frequently with good reason. "Just Shoot
Me," for example, did just fine situated between "Will &amp; Grace" and
"ER" but has seen its audience plunge since being separated from
those lengthy coattails. CBS' "Becker" learned the same hard lesson
once removed from "Everybody Loves Raymond's" halo.</TE>
<TE>   In this respect, television, like real estate, tends to be all
about location. Although there are occasional self-starters -- ABC's
"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" and "My Wife and
Kids" come to mind -- the best way to get a new program sampled is to
let it ride piggyback on a known commodity. Theoretically, in TV's
big circle of life, the old show can then die and the new one carry
on the task of entertaining America.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule of thumb, a satellite show must generally yield no more
than 20% of the mother ship's audience to be deemed a success. Slip
much more than that and the newcomer is apt to be tossed out of orbit
by antsy network executives.</TE>
<TE>   Because "Friends" sets the bar so high, CBS' "Survivor" provides
formidable competition and so many NBC shows have died on Thursdays,
a bigger drop for "Scrubs" is deemed acceptable. Last week, in fact,
NBC was doing back-flips because the program retained 84% of
"Friends' " rating in the advertiser-friendly demographic of 18 to
49, a higher percentage than anything to fill that adjacent space
during the last 18 months other than "Friends" itself.</TE>
<TE>   The networks, meanwhile, endeavor to foster the impression that
these programs are bona fide hits, with the spin sometimes reflecting
more creativity than the actual shows. NBC once famously suggested
that its 8:30 and 9:30 "Must-See TV" series suffer because people
were busy and needed to do the little things -- write checks, walk
the dog, put the baby to bed, watch 30 minutes of a college football
game they couldn't care less about -- during the precious half-hours
between "Friends," "Seinfeld" and "ER."</TE>
<TE>   It's all about helping new series take root, which clearly assumes
a greater sense of urgency as long-in-the-tooth stalwarts like
"Friends" (which began life after "Mad About You") and "Frasier"
(launched via "Seinfeld") march toward oblivion, crossing over to the
great television burial ground.</TE>
<TE>   As anyone who has tried to tape a favorite show has doubtless
discovered, programmers have even initiated scheduling stunts to try
to pull viewers into that next half-hour, with "Friends," "Raymond"
and "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" all spilling a minute or two
past their allotted time.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, no one really expects "Scrubs," in the second year
of its network residency, to continue attracting as many viewers
without "Friends" funneling demographically desirable young adults in
its direction but, inevitably, every show must lose its training
wheels.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Lawrence noted, is that in a not-unrelated
development, the duration of TV executive tenures and the time frame
for nurturing series both keep shrinking, ratcheting up the pressure
for programs to stand on their own.</TE>
<TE>   While producers can find validation in various ways, he conceded,
"we find ourselves asking the same questions networks do: Are people
watching our show because of where it is or because they actually
like it?"</TE>
<TE>   So when can a satellite show fly on its own or rest easy without
the aid of a hammock? Such determinations remain an inexact science,
a guessing game with careers, networks' fortunes and viewers'
precious time hanging in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it's a gut check, but the best test might boil down to
this: Would you watch "Scrubs" or "Yes, Dear" if they weren't propped
up by "tent poles," or does the thought make it suddenly seem like a
good time to go walk the dog?</TE>

<HD>Going way beyond the liner notes</HD>
<DH>'Classic Albums' series deconstructs some of rock's most
popular and interesting albums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Matsumoto</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Great rock and pop albums endure for years and are often consumed by
multiple generations of music lovers. Yet rarely do the artists
themselves -- and the people who assist them in the recording studio
-- get an opportunity to reveal the details behind the creation of
these masterworks.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of Elvis Presley may be able to sing the King's classic songs
by heart and know the ins and outs of his private life, for instance,
but few may be privy to the inside story about how Presley's
legendary self-titled album was created in the mid-1950s.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly five years, Eagle Vision's "Classic Albums" series has
helped fill this void by offering usually insightful home videos and
DVDs documenting the making of pioneering and/or popular albums
through original interviews and archival footage. Eagle Vision is the
home video-DVD division of London-based Eagle Rock Entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   In the documentary about Elton John's classic 1973 album "Goodbye
Yellow Brick Road," for example, John, lyricist Bernie Taupin,
producer Gus Dudgeon, engineer David Hentschel and members of John's
band talk candidly about making the ambitious double album.</TE>
<TE>   Much is revealed. Dudgeon explains how he went about adding the
indispensable audience applause to the studio hit "Bennie and the
Jets." Drummer Nigel Olsson, guitarist Davey Johnstone and Dudgeon
explain in detail how some of the album's vocal harmonies were
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with artists, producers and engineers often are
conducted in the studios where their albums were recorded. This helps
bring back memories and gives them the chance to play original tapes
from the album.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the artist will say, 'I'm not sure I can remember
anything" about recording certain songs," says Nick de Grunwald, the
English producer of the "Classic Albums" series. "Some of these great
artists are nervous in a funny way. It's not like standing up on
stage and performing. They are opening up their hearts and souls. But
when they actually sit and listen to [the original recordings], the
music triggers a lot of memories."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty documentaries are available in the series, among them
"Electric Ladyland" by Jimi Hendrix, "Who's Next" by the Who, "The
Joshua Tree" by U2, "Hysteria" by Def Leppard, Stevie Wonder's "Songs
in the Key of Life" and Elvis Presley's self-titled album.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the featured albums have sold millions of copies. But a
few were just great pieces of art that were never hits, such as the
Band's eponymous 1969 disc and Lou Reed's 30-year-old "Transformer."</TE>
<TE>   A documentary on the Sex Pistol's "Never Mind the Bollocks Here's
the Sex Pistols"--a revolutionary 1977 punk album that didn't make
the Top 40 charts -- is the latest offering in the series. It was
released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Though the documentaries place these albums in a social-historical
context, the emphasis is on the making of the music rather than the
sex, drugs and controversial behavior that might surround the artist
or band.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the high road has helped convince press-shy artists such as
Reed to participate, says Steve Sterling, the president of Eagle
Vision's North American operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Reed documentary is one of the best in the series. He plays
some of the "Transformer" songs solo on his guitar and explains their
origins with the help of people like critic David Fricke and engineer
Ken Scott. Bassist Herbie Flowers demonstrates firsthand how he came
up with the famous bass lines to the album's definitive song, "Walk
on the Wild Side."</TE>
<TE>   "Classic Albums" was originally made for British television and
has subsequently been seen in numerous countries. But only the first
six -- including the making of Paul Simon's "Graceland" and Fleetwood
Mac's "Rumours" -- were televised in the United States on VH1. Today
VH1 airs a series called "Ultimate Albums" instead. It also tells the
story of noteworthy albums but tends to be heavier on the titillating
gossip and nonmusical sociology surrounding the artists than the
"Classic Albums" series.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling says Eagle Vision is searching for a cable outlet in the
United States that will air "Classic Albums" in 2003. But even if the
series finds a U.S. television home, the DVD versions of some of
these documentaries will still possess more material than will fit
into a one-hour commercial-laden television presentation. For
example, with bonus materials, Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road" documentary clocks in at about 90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Vision and De Grunwald's Isis Productions have a list of
more than 100 album documentaries they are considering making.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes artists as diverse as Frank Sinatra and Green
Day. The company is in pre-production on a documentary examining the
making of Nirvana's epochal 1991 album "Nevermind."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the good things about the series is we can kind of go in
different directions," notes De Grunwald. "We've done something on
[the heavy metal band] Iron Maiden. But I would also love to do Miles
Davis' 'Kind of Blue.' "</TE>

<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Rather than dwelling on the untimely loss of Lisa "Left Eye"
Lopes, Rozanda "Chilli" Thomas and Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins use this
album to celebrate their late partner while adding to the group's
sassy, thought-provoking and innovative legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes worked on about half these tunes, and her rapping is key to
such taunting numbers as "Girl Talk" and the lover-man-skewering
"Quickie." "3D" suffers slightly from the inevitable lack of TLC's
usual freewheeling unity. But in a genre where big-name producers are
often more distinctive than the artists themselves, the group again
manages to employ such heavies as the Neptunes, Rodney Jerkins,
Babyface and Raphael Saadiq without losing its own identity.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Watkins must have found it hard to finish without
Lopes, but they still push their blend of R&amp;B, soul, hip-hop and rock
forward. The squishy funk of "Dirty" offers a "moment of silence" for
Left Eye. But the acoustic-flavored "Turntable" speaks more
eloquently, albeit indirectly, to Lopes' absence as Chilli and T-Boz
wistfully reflect on life's unexpected changes.</TE>

<HD>The big picture on a small scale</HD>

<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cliche that bigger is better has taken hold of the art world in
the same way that SUVs have taken over America's roads. Enormous
museums are popping up everywhere and super-sized exhibitions are
being mounted with increasing frequency. Taking advantage of new
digital devices, photographers are regularly printing pictures of
such vast dimensions that they don't fit into homes.</LD>
<LD>   At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a survey of Donald
Blumberg's domestically scaled photographs from 1964 to the present
stands out because it's anything but bloated. Lean, down to earth and
inquisitive, the Los Angeles photographer's 110 pictures fuse
ambition and humility in a body of work that is accessible and
idiosyncratic -- at once part of its age and an exception to the
general tendencies of the times.</LD>
<TE>   As a photographer, Blumberg initially appears to be a dabbler, a
restless experimenter too excited by possibilities to stick with a
single line of inquiry long enough to produce highly resolved
results. Images from 21 series (each with its own title, such as
Button Collage series, New York Design series, Collaboration with
Rachel series and Space and Tonal Field series) hang beside untitled
works (mostly landscapes) and more than a fair share of oddballs. The
misfits include a super photo-painting hybrid from 1966 (made in
collaboration with Charles Gill) and a Minimalist photogram, made by
placing an object on photographic paper and exposing it to sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   But as soon as you slow down, stop trying to read everything in an
instant and refrain from shoehorning Blumberg's photographs into tidy
categories, you see that his wide-ranging works spiral around two
fundamental questions: How do time and space change as they are
filtered through a camera's lens? And, what happens when photographs,
which begin as depictions of everyday reality, take on a life of
their own?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the way the exhibition has been installed makes it
more difficult to understand what Blumberg is up to than if his works
were laid out chronologically. Organized by associate curator of
photography Tim B. Wride, the retrospective divides Blumberg's
conceptually consistent but stylistically diverse images into four
categories: grids, landscapes, color prints and portraits.</TE>
<TE>   To scan the photographs in one room is to ricochet through four
decades of history. Rather than letting viewers follow the organic
path of Blumberg's spiraling development, which regularly circles
back on itself, the exhibition tries to wrap his multilayered pieces
into four unnecessarily neat packages. Although the form-driven
installation is meant to echo what happens in the photographs, it
comes off looking over-designed and artsy.</TE>
<TE>   Putting such a high priority on formalist design goes hand in hand
with the idea that bigger is better. Both approaches puff things up
because they have little faith in the value of everyday experiences
and direct perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   That's the territory Blumberg traverses in his unpretentious
works, which invite viewers to participate in the little mysteries
that make the ordinary world seem extraordinary. The light touch,
deft step and casual demeanor his best photographs embody suggest
that he's just doing his job, which happens to fascinate him. The
attitude is infectious -- and sometimes inspiring, in the manner of a
journeyman who loves what he does even if no one notices.</TE>
<TE>   Space expands and contracts in many of Blumberg's images. Some,
made up of more than 100 tiny pictures of urban and natural
landscapes, transform the jittery visual energy of David Hockney's
photo collages into an experience of Zen stillness. To look at
Hockney's signature images, your eye must dart back and forth as if
it were a fly zigzagging through the air. In contrast, Blumberg's
tile-like arrangements of snapshots of a Roman aqueduct, the Pompidou
Center, Inyo Crater and Convict Lake compel you to stand still as the
focus of your vision expands. Looking at these works makes you feel
as if your visual field were a pond into which Blumberg had tossed a
pebble, and then left you alone to watch the water ripple outward.</TE>
<TE>   Time doesn't stand still in his art as much as it spirals around
shifting focal points. In Blumberg's Sequential Color series, he cuts
several photographs into thin strips and pastes them between the
lines of pages torn from ordinary legal pads. Turning the world into
a drama glimpsed through Venetian blinds, these works load single
moments with events of considerably longer durations.</TE>
<TE>   In other series, Blumberg glues color snapshots atop page-size
black-and-white images or juxtaposes photographs whose scale shifts
force your eye to operate as if it were a zoom lens. Like John
Baldessari, Blumberg treats the world as if it were so loaded with
meaning that it's impossible to know it completely.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't cause him to set his sights lower or to focus on
more manageable goals. His In Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral
series, which depicts ordinary folks before a black background, makes
a mess of balanced compositions and sensible perspectives to suggest
that the world is weirder than we usually assume. All you have to do
is look closely.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to more famous artists, Blumberg never lets a single
line of inquiry become a line of products, maintained for the market
long after the questions they began with have been answered. If his
photographs lack the earth-shattering originality of masterpieces,
they more than make up for it with the fresh look they bring to
mundane surroundings. Based in the nitty-gritty details of real
things, Blumberg's photographs give us a glimpse of the big picture
without ever letting us forget that it's made up of messy
inconsistencies -- both happy accidents and unresolvable conundrums.</TE>

<HD>Speaking a universal language</HD>
<DH>For Japanese violin prodigy Midori, education, like music,
is an important form of communication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midori, planted in front of two chalkboards in a packed high school
classroom, sways rhythmically as she draws her bow across her
burnished violin. With an upsweep, she finishes a Mozart piece and
elicits loud applause.</LD>
<LD>   But she gets even louder and more spontaneous cheers when she
says, "To be honest, I was not a very good high school student. I
didn't fail anything" -- this draws groans -- "In college, I was
pretty much straight A's."</LD>
<LD>   Born in Osaka, Japan, Midori, 31, started playing violin when she
was 4, studying with her mother, until she went to play for famed
pedagogue Dorothy DeLay at the Aspen Music School at 9 and a year
later went to study with DeLay at the Juilliard School in New York.
She made her debut with Zubin Mehta conducting the New York
Philharmonic at age 11. By high school, she had already launched a
major international career to excited reviews.</LD>
<TE>   Midori's Monday visit to the Music Academy at Hamilton High in Los
Angeles is part of her two-week "On Location" residency with the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, which ends with performances this weekend at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The residency also has included
chamber music concerts with members of the Phil and the American
Youth Symphony, a master class at USC, a luncheon for music educators
and school administrators and a performance Friday at the Wilshire
United Methodist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of project is a good fit for me," Midori says. "I like
being involved in activities that attempt to bring people together
and enhance communication."</TE>
<TE>   Midori sees it all as education, a particular obsession for her.
While maintaining her solo career, she finished a bachelor's degree,
magna cum laude, in psychology and gender studies at the Gallatin
School of New York University in 2000 and is now finishing a master's
in psychology there.</TE>
<TE>   She also created a foundation, Midori &amp; Friends, in 1992 to
provide New York City public school students with music education at
no cost to the stu- dent.</TE>
<TE>   From a grass-roots effort in which she did all the work, the
foundation has grown to an organization with a full-time staff of
four, up to a dozen teaching artists, a $1-million budget and a
tiered series of general music and instrument instruction programs
for students in 12 to 15 schools annually; it has reached more than
100,000 children.</TE>
<TE>   The idea isn't to create future classical music audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "That was nowhere near my thinking," she said. "I believe that
music is something that we should all be able to take for granted, to
have in our lives. It's one of the ways that make each one of us
individual and also makes us have an identity as human apart from
other living beings, to have the arts as a conscious form of
expression."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's high school session is typical of Midori's appearances
for Midori &amp; Friends. She plays first, takes questions later.</TE>
<TE>   All of the 80 students packed into the purple rehearsal room are
music students, so most of the questions they address to Midori have
practical points.</TE>
<TE>   How much do you practice?</TE>
<TE>   "About five hours a day, average. I don't practice every day.
Yesterday, at rehearsal [with the Philharmonic], I played 10 or 11
hours. I took breaks whenever I could, but I'd play three or four
hours at a stretch. Rehearsing isn't practicing."</TE>
<TE>   How do you practice?</TE>
<TE>   "I always start by warming up correctly. If you're not relaxed,
you can harm yourself. Sometimes I play etudes, sometimes scales,
sometimes a piece I'll be playing, then the main body of work."</TE>
<TE>   How much did you practice when you were a teenager? Did you go out
much?</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty dedicated when I was 15. When you're memorizing and
rehearsing a difficult piece, you don't have time for much else."</TE>
<TE>   What's your instrument?</TE>
<TE>   "A 1734 Guarnerius del Gesu." (More gasps.)</TE>
<TE>   What's the most difficult concerto?</TE>
<TE>   "Every concerto has different difficulties. Mozart, you have to
play very beautifully and you have to have an emotional reaction to
it so that the audience feels an emotion. The Tchaikovsky is easier
to get involved with emotionally, but it's very difficult. It's
difficult to say which one is the most difficult."</TE>
<TE>   I love your recording of the Paganini Caprices. When did you start
playing them?</TE>
<TE>   "I started when I was 5 or 6, playing them as etudes. It took
about two years to do the entire cycle. I recorded them when I was in
high school." (Gasps, again.)</TE>
<TE>   Did you ever get discouraged?</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating trying to get a passage down and finally getting
it but coming back the next day and finding it's not right. But you
just have to overcome fears and disappointments. Just get it done."</TE>
<TE>   What got you interested in studying psychology?</TE>
<TE>   "I was in my 20s when I went into college. I went from high school
right into my career. I always wanted the college experience. I
expected I'd go for a few semesters and major in something about art.
Then I took an introduction to psychology course and fell in love
with it and stayed with it for every semester and every summer."</TE>
<TE>   What's the connection between psychology and music?</TE>
<TE>   "I never tried to force a reason for why I like psychology. That's
OK. It used to be that people felt that a musician liked math."</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a role model?</TE>
<TE>   "My best friend. People want me to mention names that are
recognizable. But my best friend is my role model."</TE>
<TE>   Set to talk for an hour, she ends the session with a thank you and
bows slightly. The students, transfixed for a minute in her wake,
finally start buzzing.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw her at the Phil on Saturday," said Marshall McDaniel, a
senior and a cello player. "Up there, she's this god. It was kind of
interesting to get close. She's much more down to earth than she
seemed onstage."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a really good experience seeing her play right in front of
me," said ninth-grade violinist Edler Arreortua.</TE>
<TE>   Another violinist, senior Gala Porras, said, "You understand she
plays so well because she practices like a whole day."</TE>
<TE>   Midori returned the compliments the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "I was impressed with how relaxed the kids seemed to be around the
arts," she said. "It's very clear that they have the arts in their
schools as a very important part of their education."</TE>

<LD>Singer Michael Jackson briefly dangled a barefoot baby over the
railing of his fourth-floor hotel window Tuesday in Berlin, providing
a momentary if odd thriller for fans waiting below.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, who testified in a Santa Maria, Calif., courtroom last
week, is due to receive an award at a ceremony in the German capital
Thursday night. Greeted by screaming fans when he arrived at his
hotel, the entertainer went to his room, opened his window and held a
baby, a white towel over the infant's head, over the metal railing.
Jackson also showed off another child who was about 4 or 5 years old.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Jackson confirmed he was traveling with his
children.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>HBO and Bill Maher have reached terms on a weekly, hourlong talk show
that is scheduled to debut on the pay cable network Feb. 21.</LD>
<LD>   The show's title and format are still being determined, but Maher
probably won't be duplicating the discussion format of his former
Comedy Central and ABC late-night series, "Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher." Scott Carter, a former executive producer of
"Politically Incorrect," is expected to be named producer of Maher's
HBO show, which has been given a 20-episode order.</LD>
<LD>   ABC canceled "PI" earlier this year and announced a talk show
starring comedian Jimmy Kimmell would replace Maher weekdays at 12:05
a.m. in January. Maher, meanwhile, has been on tour for his new book,
"When You Ride Alone, You Ride With Bin Laden: What the Government
Should Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism."</LD>

<LD>Placido Domingo will perform Dec. 12 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
his spokesperson announced Tuesday. The concert is part of a renewed
effort in Dubai to draw music and sports events to the troubled
region, and tickets for the show are included in several tourist
packages from European travel agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The tenor and Los Angeles Opera artistic director will perform 10
pieces, three of them duets with Chilean soprano Veronica Villarroel
and one duet, sung in Arabic -- a first for Domingo -- with Egyptian
singer Ali al-Hajjar. Domingo's pieces will include selections from
Puccini's "Tosca," Verdi's "Otello," a Spanish operetta, and the song
"Tonight" from Bernstein's "West Side Story." The singers will be
accompanied by the 70-piece Baden-Baden Philharmonic Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   "For the last seven or eight years, it has been my dream to put
together a show like this right here in the UAE," concert promoter
Sheikh Faisal bin Khaled al-Qassimi told Gulf News, a local
English-language newspaper.</LD>

<LD>With money and assistance from the country's largest Spanish-language
television network, the Museum of Television &amp; Radio will add a
collection of Spanish-language radio and TV programs from this
country, Spain and Latin America to its archives.</LD>
<LD>   Univision, which is providing the grant, reaches the overwhelming
majority of Spanish-speaking viewers in the United States. In the
coming months, Univision will donate 100 hours of programming,
including the 50 years of broadcasts of "Premio Lo Nuestro," the
network's annual Spanish-language music award show.</LD>
<LD>   "Particularly after the 2000 Census came out, we realized how
significant the Spanish-speaking population was, and we wanted
Spanish-language programming," said Bob Batscha, the museum's
president, who said Spanish-language content had been a priority for
some time. "But we're a relatively new institution, and you can't do
everything at once."</LD>

<HD>Is fast probe a press to reopen papers?</HD>

<LD>A task force of federal, state and local prosecutors this week began
taking sworn testimony from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the
deal that split the Los Angeles and Cleveland markets between the
country's two leading alternative newspaper chains.</LD>
<LD>   For several weeks, prosecutors have been demanding documents and
interviewing prospective witnesses as part of their probe into
whether the arrangement that closed New Times Los Angeles and the
Cleveland Free Times violates federal and state antitrust laws. But,
according to sources in Cleveland, where government lawyers are
collecting the first depositions under oath, attorneys for the
Department of Justice also are weighing the possibility of seeking a
legal remedy that actually facilitates the reopening of additional
alternative newspapers in both cities.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors' decision to begin taking sworn depositions is a
significant step forward in the unusually fast-paced investigation,
according to Don T. Hiber, an antitrust specialist with the Los
Angeles firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton. "It gets the
ball formally rolling toward either a civil complaint or a criminal
prosecution," he said. "Clearly, they've decided to move before the
bodies get too cold -- and I think it's for a reason."</LD>
<TE>   According to Eliot G. Disner, an antitrust lawyer with Manatt,
Phelps &amp; Phillips, taking testimony under oath before filing a
complaint often sidesteps the problem of witnesses invoking their 5th
Amendment rights against self-incrimination and allows authorities
"to cast the widest possible net. If they decide there's been a
criminal violation, this lets them go to the grand jury with the
testimony in the bag and ask for indictments. Naked market divisions,
which we're not accustomed to seeing anymore, are a criminal
offense."</TE>
<TE>   Repeated calls to the U.S. Department of Justice went unreturned
this week. However, Tom Dressler, a spokesman for California Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer and Joe Scott, a spokesman for Los Angeles County
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, confirmed that federal, state and local
prosecutors are jointly probing the chains' agreement, which was
executed last month.</TE>
<TE>   Under its terms, Phoenix-based New Times Media agreed to shut down
its 6-year-old Los Angeles newspaper in exchange for more than $8
million, surrendering its Southern California niche to the L.A.
Weekly, which is owned by New York-based Village Voice Media. As part
of the arrangement, the latter closed its Cleveland Free Times in
return for a substantially smaller payment from New Times, which
continues to publish the Cleveland Scene.</TE>
<TE>   (In California, the attorney general and local prosecutors have
jurisdiction to prosecute such cases under the Cartwright Act, the
state's equivalent of the Sherman antitrust statute.)</TE>
<TE>   According to employees of the closed newspapers interviewed by
prosecutors over the past week, Justice Department lawyers have
informally inquired about what it would take to allow new investors
to launch alternative weeklies in both Los Angeles and Cleveland.
Would it be helpful, for example, if New Times and Voice Media were
compelled to cede the name equity of the closed newspapers to new
owners? How valuable would lists of advertisers and the weeklies'
news racks and distribution systems be to a start-up publication?</TE>
<TE>   "They're very interested in what penalties and remedies might be
available in both markets," said one interviewee, who asked not to be
identified. "I told them all of those things would help, but that the
longer you wait, the harder it is to restart one of these things."</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the lead federal prosecutor in the probe -- Maurice E.
Stucke -- flew to Cleveland to take the deposition of David Eden, who
was editor of the Free Times when it closed. Stucke was joined by a
Cleveland-based Justice Department lawyer, John Smibert; by a
representative of the Ohio attorney general; and -- on the phone --
by California Assistant Atty. Gen. Winston Chen and L.A. County
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen Tuttle.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave a deposition to the Justice Department regarding Village
Voice Media's trade of the Cleveland Free Times for New Times Los
Angeles," Eden said. "The government is looking into whether that
violated the antitrust laws. They told me they are taking this very,
very seriously and it is my belief they are trying to expedite this
case because two publications were closed down and, if you want to
restart them, you have to do that quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Though Eden declined to give details about his testimony, sources
said he was questioned for 2 1/2 hours about his knowledge of the
deal, his conversations with Voice Media CEO David Schneiderman and
about the Free Times' editorial and financial health prior to its
closure. Prosecutors also are said to be interested in deposing the
paper's former publisher, Matt Fabyan, who was interviewed by the
task force earlier this month. Sources in Cleveland said that, last
week, when New Times Media learned of Fabyan's earlier conversation
with prosecutors, the company withdrew an offer to name him
co-publisher of its Cleveland Scene.</TE>
<TE>   Sources in Cleveland say those interviewed have told prosecutors
that, since the Free Times' closure, representatives of the Scene
have told advertisers that their rates will double when their current
contract expire. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum -- a
popular Cleveland attraction -- reportedly was told its rates would
increase by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "New Times now has a monopoly market in Cleveland," said one
witness, "and they want to milk it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also are looking beyond Los Angeles and Cleveland in
an attempt to assemble a portrait of New Times and Village Voice
Media's business practices. Last week, for example, they attempted to
interview one of the alternative press' elder statesmen, Bruce B.
Brugmann, owner and editor of the Bay Guardian.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really surprised," Brugmann said. "They started out by
saying, 'This is a very sensitive investigation and we would like to
ask you these questions, but please don't say anything about our
conversation.' I said I don't want to be an informant for John
Ashcroft's Justice Department and if you don't want me to write about
it, forget it. It was all very polite, but they said, 'Thank you and
goodbye.' "</TE>
<TE>   Brugmann, however, has repeatedly railed against what he alleges
are the "predatory practices" of New Times' S.F. Weekly and East Bay
Express, which compete with his paper. He was particularly alarmed
last month, he said, when another group of alternative papers --
Metro Silicon Valley, Metro Santa Cruz and the North Bay Bohemian --
announced that the Ruxton Group would be their national advertising
representative. Ruxton is owned by New Times Media and its
announcement of the agreement said its combined Bay Area circulation
of 345,000 makes it "the largest single metropolitan advertising
combination in the alternative newsweekly industry."</TE>
<TE>   Brugmann alleges that the agreement is a prelude to further
consolidation. "When a paper joins Ruxton, it usually means New Times
will be buying them," he said. "That's what happened in Kansas City,
where they brought the Pitch Weekly into Ruxton just before they
bought it. That's what we're watching for here."</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors file an antitrust case against New Times and
Village Voice Media -- and if they do, in fact, seek the remedy now
being weighed -- its beneficiary in L.A. could be an unlikely person:
former mayor and one-time Republican gubernatorial hopeful Richard
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Riordan has been discussing plans to launch his own
newspaper with prospective investors and journalists. This week, he
met with former employees of the L.A. Weekly and discussed the
prototype currently under development. His Honor has said he is
considering calling his paper The Dick, but perhaps Riordan's New
Times wouldn't be a bad alternative.</TE>

<HD>'The Warming House'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Great-Aunt Gretchen is telling Karen a
story from her childhood in Minnesota. Gretchen has just gotten new
figure skates and hopes they will help her fly across the ice.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I stepped onto the ice. My heart beat fast. I was ready to fly.
Push, glide. Push, push ...</LD>
<LD>   "But I did not fly. I skated just as plain as I had in Rolf's old
skates.</LD>
<LD>   "I tried again. Push and glide and spin.... Instead, my feet slid
out from under me. In a flash I toppled over next to a snowbank. I
remember feeling as if my heart was sinking deep to the bottom of
that mound of snow. My new skates were not magical after all.</LD>
<TE>   " 'Hey, Gretchen,' Rolf shouted, coming toward me. He did a little
sideways twist with a jump, landed back on the ice and skidded to a
sudden stop. His blades scraped a misty spray in the air.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Do you want to go back inside the warming house?' he asked,
helping me up.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No,' I murmured into my woolly scarf.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Well, maybe you should ... ' he said.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No,' I said stubbornly. I stood, swung my arms wide, got myself
moving again and circled the pond a few times. It was just plain old
skating, but at least I didn't fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I saw a girl in a short red skirt and tights and a knit cap
with a pom-pom. She cut a perfect figure-eight, shifting and
twisting, forward and backward, cutting the figure -- all on one
foot.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer I watched her, the more I wanted to cut a figure like
that too. Maybe this time I would do better, I thought. Maybe if I
tried just one loop instead of the two needed for a figure-eight ...
so I tried one loop. But when I swerved and turned to skate backward,
I fell. Hard. How hopeless I felt!"</TE>

<LD>Talk show host Rob Nelson is promoted as, "Finally ... a man who
listens." He may listen, but apparently not enough people were
watching "The Rob Nelson Show," so the 2-month-old daytime talk fest
has been overhauled.</LD>
<LD>   The result is like a menu makeover at the Olive Garden: More
palatable but not exactly fine dining.</LD>
<LD>   In its original form, the program, which airs weekdays at 11 a.m.
on KTTV in the L.A. market, played up Nelson's do-gooder nature as a
Gen X Phil Donahue. In the 1990s, Nelson wrote the book "Revolution
X: A Survival Guide for Our Generation" and co-founded the political
group Lead ... Or Leave.</LD>
<TE>   In its first six weeks, "The Rob Nelson Show" took the standard
approach to such familiar topics as female body image and the
dangerous lure of gang life, bringing half a dozen or so guests on
stage to hash things out. It sent a positive message -- in a dull
way.</TE>
<TE>   New executive producer David Armour has quickened the pace and
given the show a more colorful look with graphics, building each
episode around a broad theme such as "selling out" or "secrets and
lies." The set has been redone and Nelson has traded in his sweater
for a snazzy gray suit. To keep things hopping, he dashes around the
studio getting interactive with the audience, Donahue-style, but most
of all he has gotten in touch with his inner Jerry Springer.</TE>
<TE>   The recent episode on selling out featured "Freck," a man raising
money on the Internet to cut off his feet with a guillotine; a mother
who became a legal prostitute in Nevada; and a human guinea pig whose
weirdest experience was testing an anti-narcolepsy drug for 10 days
("For six days you're like, 'Hey, I got a lot of extra hours in the
day, more free time.' By day, like, nine, I started seeing
monkeys.").</TE>
<TE>   Streaming factoids come fast and furious -- some more illuminating
("the guillotine blade falls at 21 feet per second") than others
("most amputees experience issues with body image").</TE>
<TE>   Nelson may have summed it up best at the end of the selling-out
episode: "What's your price?" he asked viewers. "I'm still trying to
figure out mine."</TE>

<LD>The eclectic roster of "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent," "Fear Factor,"
"Dateline NBC" and "Ed" all recorded season-high ratings to help NBC
post its first overall ratings victory this fall and extend its
winning streak in young-adult demographics, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC also nabbed its biggest Saturday audience since March with a
movie based on the series "Hunter," while CBS' once-formidable Sunday
movie continues to struggle, as the second part of "Master Spy: The
Robert Hanssen Story" ran fourth in its slot.</LD>
<LD>   CBS has finished second in the weekly standings twice this season,
the other time coming when Fox carried the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   ABC, meanwhile, again benefited from combining "The Bachelor"
(which out-rated "The West Wing" for the second straight week) with a
pop-culture interview, in this case Jennifer Lopez on "Primetime."
The network ranked second among adults age 18 to 49 for the first
time this season, as "Monday Night Football" drew its biggest
audience since September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's "24" has cooled considerably from its premiere, hurt in part
by last week's migration to "Frasier's" brush-with-death story line.
Another critically acclaimed show, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," closed its
season Sunday, with HBO channels amassing 4.7 million viewers in that
half-hour -- solid for the pay service but still a 55% drop from
tune-in during "The Sopranos."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We have so many things to be thankful for, those of us who cook and
eat in California -- the richness of the state in terms of
ingredients and culinary traditions is incomparable. But with this
long list of blessings let's not forget to include Helen Evans Brown.
After all, she's the one who first laid out what it means to be a
California cook.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who lived in Pasadena from 1937 until her death in 1964,
was perhaps the state's first serious cookbook author. She certainly
was the foremost chronicler of cooking on the West Coast in the
transitional post-World War II era, when California was awakening to
its full potential, both economically and culinarily.</LD>
<LD>   In all, she wrote 15 books starting in 1950, including "Complete
Book of Outdoor Cookery" in partnership with her friend James Beard.
(Some of her correspondence with Beard was captured in the wonderful
"Love, Kisses and a Halo of Truffles," published in 1996.) She also
wrote for magazines such as Sunset, House &amp; Garden and Atlantic
Monthly.</LD>
<TE>   But her most important book by far was "The West Coast Cook Book."
Published 50 years ago, it lays out the framework for all of those
things we enjoy so much today. Here are recipes using then-exotic
ingredients such as artichokes and asparagus, feijoas and figs -- all
of them grown here and appreciated by good cooks even then. Beyond
raw materials, Brown drew on the expertise of cooks from many
cultures, not out of any obligation to seem "balanced," but because
she quite honestly liked their food and found it interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, she took food seriously, digging deep in regional
historical sources to firmly ground the food in its fullest context.
This lends her work a seriousness of purpose that is missing in most
cookbooks even today.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say the books are dreary or academic. Though the
recipes are not always of the current fashion, they are delicious.
And uncompromising.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the "Walnut-Fattened Turkey" from "The West Coast Cook
Book" that she resurrected from a recipe collection called "Los
Angeles Cookery" published in 1881.</TE>
<TE>   The first step? "Get your turkey six weeks before you need it; put
him in a coop just large enough to let him walk, or in a small yard;
give him walnuts -- one the first day, and increase every day [by]
one until he has nine; then go back to one and up to nine until you
kill him, stuffing him twice with cornmeal dough each day in which
you put a little chopped onion and celery."</TE>
<TE>   As Brown points out, "the geese of Perigord hadn't much on us when
it came to stuffing: this poor bird was stuffed before and after it
was killed."</TE>
<TE>   Although "The West Coast Cook Book" has been reprinted repeatedly,
it is once again out of print, though it is pretty easy to find at
used-book stores. Check Janet Jarvits Bookseller, 1388 E. Washington
Blvd., in Pasadena or shop online at www.abe.com. And though it's too
late to buy your live turkey, these recipes from Brown's masterwork
certainly qualify as classic -- and more practical -- California
holiday dishes.</TE>

<TE>   Cheddar pennies</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 45 minutes, plus 2 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 96 coins</TE>
<TE>   Note: These savory little crackers would make a good complement to
a crudite or relish platter. Helen Evans Brown offers several
variations, including sprinkling them with seeds or nuts before
baking and mixing chili powder or minced herbs during the kneading.
We added sesame seeds here.</TE>
<TE>   1/2pound Cheddar cheese</TE>

<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   Sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   1. Grate or chop the cheese, and cream it with the butter on
medium speed until blended, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour, salt
and a "whisper" of cayenne ("about as much as you can take up on the
end of a toothpick," Brown says). Mix, starting on low speed, then
increase the speed to medium until combined. Form the mixture into
2-foot-long logs, wrap in wax paper and then chill until firm, 2 to 3
hours or overnight.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Using a very sharp knife, slice
the cheese logs into 1/4-inch-thick coins. Sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Place the coins on baking sheets lined with parchment paper
and bake until the coins are pale gold and brown around the edges, 10
to 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The least little bit of overbaking will spoil the flavor, for
overcooked cheese acquires an unpleasant bitterness."</TE>

<KH>THE CALIFORNIA COOK</KH>
<HD>The season's new glow</HD>
<DH>From all over the state, fall's harvest is the beginning of
a refreshing take on Thanksgiving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ON my Thanksgiving table we usually have dishes that come from all
over the United States, from Wapakoneta, Ohio, to Montgomery, Ala.
Add it all up and you've probably got something like the definitive
California spread.</LD>
<LD>   After all, almost half of all of us come from someplace else
(according to the 2000 census, 22.5% were born in other states and
26.2% in other countries). Those food traditions are important. They
are the things we've carried with us. They are how we tell ourselves
one from another and how we proclaim whom we've been and, to a
surprising extent, whom we hope to be.</LD>
<LD>   But what seems to get overlooked in the whole mix is anything from
California itself. Isn't it ironic that in this golden state that
feeds the rest of the country, on our one national food holiday, we
Californians serve dishes mainly from other places?</LD>
<TE>   All of this started me wondering about what an all-California
Thanksgiving menu might look like.</TE>
<TE>   There are some things that are certain. It would have to be
seasonal and it would have to be based on ingredients that come from
here.</TE>
<TE>   After all, we do live in a place where food actually grows at this
time of year, unlike the barren hinterlands of, say, North Dakota or
New York.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean persimmons, either the small, crisp, slightly tart
Fuyus or the larger, acorn-shaped Hachiyas, among the most decadent
of fruits when they've softened. Or it could mean Bartlett pears from
the hills in Lake County, greens from Salinas or all of those nuts
from the Central Valley. Can anything be sweeter than a date from
Coachella? (Try slicing them, digging out the pits and stuffing them
with orange-flavored almond paste.)</TE>
<TE>   You want local? We've even got food from our own backyards:
guavas, avocados and right about now the first navel oranges and
Meyer lemons. There's more to the state than a shopping list; the
menu would have to reflect a certain approach to cooking as well.
Food here seems to be freer and simpler, more in balance. As we've
said before: Get good ingredients and get out of the way. Adornment
and complication can be fun in their proper places, but they are not
necessary to good cooking.</TE>
<TE>   And there is freedom. Let's face it: If we were all back where we
came from, our menus couldn't be the artful blending that they are.
Back home, if we chose not to serve grandma's pumpkin cheesecake,
we'd have to answer to her.</TE>
<TE>   There are demands that are made of us as well. The first one that
comes to mind right now is the need for a certain amount of
flexibility. Two weeks ago when I began planning this menu, the
weather was cold and rainy. Last week when I was doing the final
testing, it was sunny and in the mid-80s. Who can guess what the
weather will be like a week from Thursday?</TE>
<TE>   With all of those things in mind and after walking through a
couple of farmers markets, I began to cook in serious.</TE>
<TE>   No shortage of inspiration</TE>
<TE>   The first course is a riff on something I first had several years
ago at the home of cookbook author and filmmaker Anna Thomas. We tend
to think of persimmons as a sweet fruit, but those little Fuyus are
no more sugary than a good tomato. They've also got a wonderful
crispness about them that is accentuated by the lime juice.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the winter squash recipe is based on an old favorite
from Helen Evans Brown, perhaps the finest cookbook writer the state
has known. She probably wouldn't recognize this variation -- with all
the nuts ground into the batter, the filling bakes into something
like a light, savory cookie, the butter melting down into the squash.
This would make a nice vegetarian entree if you served a half squash
rather than a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The bird was pretty much a no-brainer. I'm one of those people who
like the flavor of turkey. I don't think it's bland at all, just that
it could use a little help sometimes. I was planning on simply
brushing it with rosemary-lemon butter (the fruit on my Meyer lemon
tree is just getting ripe, which means the next three or four months
I'll be looking for any excuse I can find to use it).</TE>
<TE>   But Donna Deane, our Test Kitchen director, also suggested
stuffing whole rosemary sprigs under the skin, so, when it tightens
and crisps, you can see the outlines of the herbs -- a lovely
adornment. Be sure to pick the tenderest branches (no twigs between
your teeth) and to blanch them first; rosemary is notoriously
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   The bittersweet flavor of braised escarole is a counterweight to
the turkey. This dish also has the virtue of being easy to fit into
the crowded cooking schedule. Blanch and chop the escarole the day
before (be sure to pull out any of the pale yellow leaves; they'll
turn brown when cooked).</TE>
<TE>   While the turkey is resting before carving, stir the chopped
greens in all of the browned bits left in the bottom of the roasting
pan. The moisture in the leaves will act as a deglazing liquid --
punching up the flavor of the escarole and cleaning the pan at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   Any big deal meal has to have cheese. So many good ones are made
in California that it's hard to choose.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it comes down to sentiment, cheeses that have a personal
connection. I always try to have Humboldt Fog on the tray not just
because it is a great cheese, but also because Humboldt County is
where my daughter lives.</TE>
<TE>   For a hard cheese, I'll probably go with Vella Dry Jack, the
Special Select, since to me it represents the height of traditional
cheese making in the state. Then to round out the selection, I'll try
to find a well-aged piece of Peluso Teleme. Tasting a glorious one
several years ago in New York proved to me how great California
cheese can be (and how far we have to go in marketing it -- aged
Teleme seems to be all over Manhattan, but just try to find a chunk
in Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   For a big finish, try this pear tart filled out with a gorgeous
puffy orange-and-almond paste. Frangipane is one of those food words
that can mean many different things, from a kind of almond pastry
cream to this, which is more like a slightly dense, fragrant cake
that crisps a little on top.</TE>
<TE>   Which wines? How about a nice rose sparkler with the persimmons --
my favorite (and one of the best food wines around) is from Roederer
Estate. If you prefer a still wine, try the Foley Sauvignon Blanc
from Santa Barbara County. That will also work with the turkey, but
if you'd like to switch to a red, try one of the lighter and more
elegant ones, say Sinskey Vineyards' Carneros Merlot, or Babcock
Winery's Santa Barbara Pinot Noir.</TE>
<TE>   Bring a favorite dish</TE>
<TE>   Pick and choose among these recommendations as you wish, but even
if you cook every recipe, be sure to bring to the table something of
your own, a pumpkin pie or a favorite appetizer, tamales or chow fun
-- even cranberry jelly straight from the can, so you can laugh about
cousin Jennifer who always tries to slice it perfectly along the
lines. At my house, there'll be jellied cranberries from my mom's
Midwestern family and creamed onions from my wife's on the East
Coast. There'll probably be the pecan pie I love from growing up in
the South and a smoky sausage and greens dressing from when we lived
in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Being Californian isn't about abandoning traditional dishes, it
just means being free to choose among them and adapt them to fit our
new menus.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fuyu persimmon salad with cumin-lime vinaigrette</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8 servings</TE>
<TE>   Note: Fuyus are the small, crisp persimmons. They're only slightly
sweet, so when paired with an assertive vinaigrette, they make a
refreshing salad.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds Fuyu persimmons</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lime</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1/2 serrano chile, seeded and minced</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon walnut oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup pomegranate seeds (about 1/4 pomegranate)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chopped walnuts, toasted</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1. Cut off the tough green calyxes and slice each persimmon in 10
to 12 wedges.</TE>
<TE>   2. In a small lidded jar, combine the lime juice, cumin, about
half of the chile, a dash of salt and the walnut oil. Tightly cover
and shake hard to mix well. Taste the dressing on a small piece of
persimmon. There should be just enough chile to add a suggestion of
heat. If you'd like it hotter, add more and shake again.</TE>
<TE>   3. Combine the persimmons and the dressing in a work bowl and toss
to coat well. Turn the salad out into a decorative bowl and sprinkle
with the pomegranate seeds, walnuts and cilantro. Taste and add more
salt or lime juice if necessary.</TE>

<TE>   Pear frangipane tart</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Pastry for 9-inch tart pan</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound blanched almonds</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons grated orange zest</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Oloroso or other sweet Sherry</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter, cut into 8 pieces</TE>
<TE>   3 ( 1/2-pound) Bartlett pears, firm but ripe</TE>
<TE>   Apple cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter, melted</TE>
<TE>   1. Prepare the pastry and fit it into a 9-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 20 minutes.
Prick the shell with a fork and bake until lightly golden, about 10
minutes. Remove from the oven and let come to room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the oven to 375 degrees and place a baking sheet on a low
rack.</TE>
<TE>   3. In a food processor, grind the almonds. Add 2/3 cup sugar, the
eggs, vanilla, orange zest, Sherry and salt, and process to make a
smooth, sticky paste. With the motor running, drop in the butter
through the feed hole, piece by piece, and process until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   4. Peel the pears, cut them in half lengthwise and with a spoon
remove the vein for the stem and the seed pit. As you finish each
pear half, slip it into a work bowl filled with a mixture of 1
tablespoon apple cider vinegar and enough water to cover all of the
pears.</TE>
<TE>   5. Spread the almond mixture in the base of the tart, using the
back of a spoon to spread it as evenly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   6. Pat each pear half dry and carefully cut it into thin crosswise
slices, about 1/8 inch, keeping the pear in its original form. As you
finish each pear half, lift it, using the flat of the knife as a
spatula, and carefully place it in the tart pan, with the narrow stem
end toward the center. Gently press down into the frangipane. Place
each subsequent pear half next to the previous one in a spoke pattern
until the tart is filled. Brush the pears with the melted butter and
sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon sugar.</TE>
<TE>   7. Place the tart pan on the baking sheet and bake until the
almond mixture is puffed and golden and the pears are tender, 40 to
45 minutes. Serve at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Rosemary-Meyer lemon turkey with wilted escarole</TE>
<TE>   Total time: About 4 hours, depending on the size of the bird</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Brining results in an incomparably moist, flavorful turkey.
Combine 2/3 cup salt with 1 gallon of water in a large stockpot or
clean pail. Add the turkey and let it soak overnight in the
refrigerator. Remove the turkey early the day of roasting, pat it dry
and set it in the refrigerator uncovered to air-dry for at least an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   6 sprigs fresh rosemary (choose the most tender young sprigs from
the outside of the plant)</TE>
<TE>   1 (10- to 12-pound) turkey</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, smashed but not pureed</TE>
<TE>   Juice and zest of 1 Meyer lemon (or combination of half lemon and
half orange), plus more if necessary</TE>
<TE>   3 heads escarole</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Blanch the rosemary in rapidly boiling water for 10 to 15
seconds. This will further tenderize the sprigs and will also make
your kitchen smell great. Pat dry and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Remove the giblets and rinse the turkey thoroughly under cold,
running water. If you want to brine it, do so the day before serving.
Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with a tea towel. Pull up the skin
covering the breast on both sides of the central "keel" bone. Do not
remove the skin, just separate it from the meat enough so that you
can stick your fingers in between. Do the same with the skin on the
inside of the thighs.</TE>
<TE>   3. Insert 2 sprigs of rosemary under the skin of each breast,
being careful not to bend or break the stems. In the same manner,
insert 1 sprig of rosemary under the skin of each thigh. If the
turkey has not been brined, salt it well inside and out.</TE>
<TE>   4. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   5. Heat the butter, garlic and the juice and zest of the Meyer
lemon in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the garlic
begins to soften and become fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from
the heat, but keep warm while the turkey is roasting.</TE>
<TE>   6. Place the turkey breast-side down on a rack in a shallow-sided
roasting pan. Brush with the butter and begin roasting the turkey in
the oven. After 30 minutes, baste the turkey once more with the
butter mixture, then turn the turkey so the breast side is up. Brush
the breast side with the butter and continue roasting, basting every
30 minutes, until a thermometer inserted in the deep part of the
thigh registers 165 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   7. While the turkey is roasting, blanch the whole heads of
escarole in plenty of rapidly boiling water just long enough for them
to soften slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and press them dry, and cut
out the tough bottoms and chop coarsely. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   8. Remove the turkey from the oven, brush with butter once more,
cover loosely with foil and set aside for 15 minutes to rest before
carving. While the turkey is resting, pour off all but 2 tablespoons
of the grease from the roasting pan and add the blanched, chopped
escarole to the pan. Return the pan to the oven and roast, stirring
occasionally, about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   9. Carve the turkey, reserving some of the juices. (Be sure to
remove the rosemary sprigs after carving, unless you have guests who
are very fond of the flavor.) Taste the escarole in the roasting pan
and add salt and a generous grinding of pepper, some of the carving
juices and more lemon juice as necessary. Neither the flavors of the
turkey nor the lemon should be pronounced. Rather, they should be
accents to the bittersweet flavor of the escarole.</TE>
<TE>   10. Place the escarole in the center of the turkey platter,
arrange the carved bird over it and serve.</TE>

<TE>   Acorn squash with hazelnut butter</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Acorn squash is very hard, so take care when cutting it in
half. We set each squash on a cutting board, wedged a knife in
slightly, then carefully pressed down on both ends of the knife.</TE>
<TE>   2 acorn squash</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons orange liqueur or rum</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Cut
each half in half again so you have 8 pieces. Arrange the squash in a
9-by-12 baking dish skin-side up and add 1/2 cup of water. Cover
tightly with foil and bake until the squash can be easily pierced
with a knife or carving fork, 45 to 50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. While the squash is roasting, pulse together the butter and the
hazelnuts in a food processor to make a rough paste, almost like a
soft cookie dough. Add the liqueur and pulse again to mix it in.</TE>
<TE>   4. When the squash is soft, remove it from the oven and increase
the temperature to 450 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   5. Drain the water from the baking dish and invert the squash so
that it is skin-side down. Salt it lightly, then divide the hazelnut
butter evenly among the squash pieces, spooning it into the cavity.
It will take a bit more than a tablespoon per piece.</TE>
<TE>   6. Return the squash to the oven and bake until the tops are
lightly browned, about 15 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Dessert to share -- or not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Jessica Strand</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ISN'T it strange that here, in this town obsessed with fitness,
desserts keep getting bigger?</LD>
<LD>   Look at the dense, three-inch-square slice of chocolate cake they
serve at Nick &amp; Stef's Steakhouse downtown. "A large dessert," sous
chef Brian Kiepler says, "makes people happy."</LD>
<LD>   Or the banana beignet at Morton's. You'd have to skip dinner to
consume the whole goblet of fried bananas topped with ice cream and
caramel sauce.</LD>
<TE>   And then there's the one widely considered the ultimate: Sonora
Cafe's Southwest sundae, a 24-inch behemoth of ice cream, caramelized
bananas, hot fudge, caramel-like cajeta and chopped toffee. The big
secret here: it costs just $7.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most of these big desserts are relatively low-priced,
considering that one is enough to feed the entire table. That cake is
$6. The beignets, $8.</TE>
<TE>   Many chefs say they go big on dessert for exactly that reason: The
entire table ends up eating just one. "If you share, you don't have
to make a commitment to an enormous sweet thing," says Natasha
MacAller, executive pastry chef at Union in Santa Monica. "You can
just nibble."</TE>
<TE>   Pam Morton of Morton's says, "People like to take bites of each
other's desserts. It's festive. Very few people eat a whole dessert
on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Ahem. We doubt that we're the only ones who innocently ordered one
of these things -- none of the menus say what you're getting into --
and ended up eating every last bite, all by ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   At least Whist in Santa Monica gives fair warning. Pastry chef
Shelly Register has an entire menu of enormous desserts, under the
heading, "Desserts for the Table."</TE>
<TE>   No excuses there.</TE>
<TE>   -- Jessica Strand</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Designer water for discriminating palates</TE>
<TE>   There's sparkling, there's flat, and now we're hearing a lot about
something in between, a lightly carbonated water named Badoit. While
it's more carbonated cousins can make their way right into your nasal
passages, this French brand just gently tickles your tongue.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to come by, but it has found its way onto a number of
tables around town. At Bastide in West Hollywood, restaurant manager
Donato Poto describes it as "the opposite of Perrier."</TE>
<TE>   "It goes beautifully with food," he says. "It's low in sodium, so
it doesn't alter the taste of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Badoit has also been spotted at the Little Door, Cafe Midi,
Melisse, Figaro Brasserie -- and on the shelves at Surfas in Culver
City for $2.70 for a half-liter, and $3.85 for a liter.</TE>
<TE>   -- Jessica Strand</TE>

<TE>   Small bites</TE>
<TE>   After only six months, chef/owner Josiah Citrin has closed his
casual French bistro in Valencia. Though Cafe Melisse had gotten good
reviews, it wasn't generating the business Citrin had hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday and Sunday were busy," says Citrin, "but the rest of the
week there was nothing. It couldn't keep losing money."</TE>
<TE>   As for Executive Chef Mario Perez, he's gone on to Zax in
Brentwood.</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / David Shaw</KH>
<HD>The wine you invite to dinner</HD>
<DH>When each part of the meal is forged in memory, what you're
drinking takes on special meaning too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'VE long had the feeling that Mother's Day was invented by Hallmark,
Valentine's Day by See's or FTD and Christmas by Toys R Us. But
Thanksgiving -- praise the Lord and pass the yams -- has always
seemed blissfully free of oppressive materialism, commercialized
sentimentality and obligatory religiosity.</LD>
<LD>   Thanksgiving is about things that really matter. Family. Friends.
A genuine appreciation of life's blessings. Besides, the main focus
of Thanksgiving Day is the dinner table -- and not a fancy restaurant
table nor even fancy food, just a table at home, filled with roast
turkey, gravy, stuffing, pumpkin pie....</LD>
<LD>   Even the wines for Thanksgiving tend to be simple. Oh sure, you
can break out your special-occasion wines if you want, but unless you
have a big cellar and an even bigger bank account, you probably don't
have enough bottles of the really good stuff to serve everyone. I
sure don't. (And you don't want to do what former President Nixon --
a turkey if there ever was one -- used to do at White House dinner
parties: Drink Chateau Lafite-Rothschild himself and pour lesser
grape juice for his guests.)</LD>
<TE>   There are so many different flavors competing at the Thanksgiving
table that it's one meal for which almost any wine works -- the one
meal at which you should definitely follow what I think is usually
the best wine advice anyway: Drink what you like.</TE>
<TE>   The search starts early</TE>
<TE>   Because Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday, many people
choose to accompany their turkey with a uniquely American wine --
Zinfandel. Others opt for Cabernet or Pinot Noir. Some drink
Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. My less chauvinistic wine-loving
friends have tried everything from the reds of Burgundy, Bordeaux and
Piemonte ("Barolo goes with everything," one friend insists) to the
whites of Alsace and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever wine I choose in a given year, I choose early. Indeed, my
Thanksgiving dinner planning actually starts with the wine discussion
and selection. At least it has for the last 16 years, ever since I
began celebrating Thanksgiving at my wife Lucy's family home in the
rolling Berkshire Hills of southwestern Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Aunts and uncles and cousins come in from New York, Connecticut,
Maine, Florida, Illinois and Wisconsin -- sometimes from as far away
as Italy and Greece -- and we turn Thanksgiving weekend into a
four-day orgy of eating, drinking, football, bowling, eating,
drinking, snowball fights, movies, eating, drinking, charades, chess,
eating, drinking, trips to the baseball or basketball Hall of Fame,
eating, drinking....</TE>
<TE>   I have two duties on Thanksgiving weekend -- carving the turkeys
(one of which, I'm told, will be deep-fried this year) and choosing,
buying and serving the wine for all that eating and drinking --
lunches at our house every day, dinners at our house Wednesday and
Friday, Thanksgiving dinner at Lucy's cousin's house nearby and the
grand finale, the big, multigenerational charades party at our house
on Saturday night. For Thanksgiving dinner, we have about 20 adults
(and eight or 10 children).</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, I've become friendly with Jack Cowles, who runs
Nejaime's Stockbridge Wine Cellar, an excellent shop about five
minutes from our Berkshires house, and every year -- in early to
mid-October -- I give Jack a call and we chat at length about that
year's wine options.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy's late mother used to like Beaujolais, so for a while, even
after her death several years ago, I'd sample a few cru Beaujolais
here and discuss their relative merits with Jack, and then order the
one I liked best. I did that in part to honor her memory (ritual and
tradition are as much a part of Thanksgiving as turkey is) and in
part because the light, fruity taste of Beaujolais seemed to please
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The last couple of years, I went Italian -- once with Chianti,
then last year with a Falesco Vitiano from Umbria. But when I called
Jack this year, he immediately suggested several Spanish wines. I
bought three of them, and we did a blind tasting at home, trying
those wines alongside the newest vintage of Falesco Vitiano, a cru
Beaujolais (Chiroubles) and a California Zinfandel.</TE>
<TE>   There was, to our surprise, no clear winner.</TE>
<TE>   Serendipity strikes</TE>
<TE>   Then, the next night, we went out to dinner with friends, and I
mentioned our tasting to the sommelier. I told him I'd been unable to
find one of the Spanish wines that another friend had recommended --
something called Tres Picos. He laughed. "We pour that here by the
glass," he said, and he hustled off to bring us a taste.</TE>
<TE>   It was excellent.</TE>
<TE>   The next day I called Jack and ordered a case and a half, at
$10.99 a bottle. (I've since seen the wine at a discount shop here
for $8.99, but I'm accustomed to paying a little more at Jack's; his
store is neither large nor discount nor in or near a big city, and I
figure I'm also paying extra for personal service.)</TE>
<TE>   The wine will be waiting in Jack's store when I walk in next
Wednesday morning. If we don't finish the Tres Picos with
Thanksgiving dinner, what's left will give me a head start on
provisioning for Saturday night's charades game, the guest list for
which -- in recent years -- has swollen past 50. It's become one of
the highlights of the fall in the Berkshires. No wonder. The
participants are bright and uninhibited -- academics, artists,
writers and their offspring -- and the competition can be challenging
and amusing, especially after a few glasses of wine.</TE>
<TE>   You haven't lived until you've seen a 60-year-old woman squatting
on the living room floor, acting out "Please don't squeeze the
Charmin" -- or an 8-year-old boy squirming on the floor until a
75-year-old former United Nations diplomat shouts out, correctly,
"Free Willy." Over the years, I've seen our guests act out clues as
diverse as a Latin phrase ("Deus ex machina") and a 1950s pop tune
("Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight?"),
and I've been stuck with doing Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president;
"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," the Picasso painting; and Limp Bizkit,
the rock group.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy makes dinner on charades night for all 60-plus guests, so I
always need more wine -- and some hard liquor. Lucy's mother was
famous for her generosity at table, as elsewhere, and Lucy and I
share that spirit of abbondanza -- so there's always more than enough
of everything, which means I get to bring the leftover wine back to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Having only relatively recently discovered the pleasures of
Spanish wines, I'm especially look forward to that fringe benefit
this year. I love turkey, and I'm sometimes able to persuade Lucy to
make another one the week after we get home. I expect to have at
least a couple of bottles of Tres Picos to go with it this year.</TE>

<HD>What the glamour birds are wearing</HD>
<DH>To judge by the magazines, from Good Housekeeping to
Gourmet, there's just one acceptable look this year. And kumquats are
the must-have accessory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IF all the Thanksgiving turkeys in this month's magazines weren't
trussed so tightly, they would probably be writhing in embarrassment.</LD>
<LD>   They're all wearing the same outfit.</LD>
<LD>   Pick up Gourmet, Good Housekeeping, Bon Appetit or even Family
Circle and you'll see the turkey of the month reclining on a platter
bedecked in greenery and kumquats.</LD>
<TE>   In other magazines, the accessories may vary slightly, but the
effect is the same. The free-range fashion police have spoken, and
they're talking orange and green.</TE>
<TE>   It's bad enough that the turkeys themselves bear as much
resemblance to what most Americans will confront on Thanksgiving as
Kate Moss does to the average Safeway shopper.</TE>
<TE>   No big bird stuck in an oven for four hours ever emerges as
shapely and perfect as Bon Appetit's does, with its breast under a
veil of suspiciously bright green minced thyme. (I did the herb rub
one Thanksgiving. My turkey looked like an ashtray.)</TE>
<TE>   Same old, same old</TE>
<TE>   But with fantasy food, you expect a little more creative flair.
Flip through four or five magazines this month and you're likely to
feel as if the holiday is really "Groundhog Day": Didn't I just see a
turkey in kumquats and leaves?</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet, the Vogue of the food world, carries the look off most
successfully, partly because its bird is roasted to a George Hamilton
turn but mostly because it's presented feet first rather than breast
forward. Even a classic suit can pass for couture if the model is
doing a handstand on the cover.</TE>
<TE>   Good Housekeeping, the Gap of the food world, actually follows the
same pattern as Gourmet but the leaves and fruit are arranged in
clumps rather than laid out like a blanket. Family Circle also uses
the same leaves and fruit, but its turkey makes it literally seem
like a pale imitation of the Gourmet cover; the poor thing looks as
if it were interrupted in a tanning booth.</TE>
<TE>   Taste of Home is the most surprising knockoff. The magazine,
published far from big-city stylists, is to Gourmet what Wal-Mart is
to Armani. But its buttery bird is surrounded with those same
fashion-forward kumquats and green herbs, along with lady apples and
sliced star fruit (possibly to pull your eye away from the stuffing
that protrudes from the turkey like a tumor).</TE>
<TE>   Sunset's turkey has greenery around it but with trend-bucking
pomegranates. For Select magazine, though, which it publishes for
supermarket chains, the big bird was surrounded by squash slices and,
of course, kumquats and greenery.</TE>
<TE>   A few magazines tried to think out of the hatbox, like Saveur,
which has a long-standing aversion to anything cutting-edge. Its
turkey is part of a feature on Clementine Paddleford, and the
garnishes are vintage: era-appropriate curly parsley and cherry
tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Food &amp; Wine went for the minimalist look, with a few flashes of
green around its soft-focus bird, while Martha Stewart Living
presents a fashion victim, with way too many leaves and berries and
pods. Both turkeys have a forlorn aspect, though; they make you feel
as if Thanksgiving must be a sad season for the rich.</TE>
<TE>   When bad things happen ...</TE>
<TE>   Probably the scariest bird is the one on the cover of Fine
Cooking, the one with just a halfhearted scattering of sage leaves
around its contorted body. The legs are not tied together tidily but
are tucked under the fanny strip, and the skin is oddly taut. It
looks as if something really bad happened in a yoga class.</TE>
<TE>   Given that every food magazine except Vegetarian Times feels
compelled to feature a stylized turkey in its pages this month, it's
probably not surprising that there is so much overlap in the
accessories department.</TE>
<TE>   Most food stylists are apparently too busy dressing next year's
turkey to talk, but Paul Grimes, who deserves credit or blame for
Family Circle's turkey, had a simple explanation: They went for the
seasonal and the dramatic. Also, he said, "kumquats come with those
beautiful leaves. You just pull them out of the little box and jam
them around the bird."</TE>
<TE>   Grimes refused to say what the well-stuffed turkey will be wearing
next Thanksgiving. But he insisted that all the froufrou is always
meant to inspire readers to try the same look at home.</TE>
<TE>   And that seems rather silly considering no safety-conscious cook
would ever set out a turkey with the stuffing still in it breeding
bacteria, let alone with leaves lying in the path of the carving
knife.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, any reader knows the best accessory for a turkey is not
greenery but gravy. It may not be pretty, but it covers a multitude
of sins.</TE>

<HD>A quick trip to Tuscany</HD>
<DH>Toscana in Brentwood looks right and sometimes its dishes
even taste right. If only the trattoria's pace were as leisurely as
the real thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WHEN Toscana opened in 1989, who could have predicted that Tuscany,
the region in central Italy, would become such a star?</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills and Napa Valley are sprinkled with "Tuscan villas."
Bistecca fiorentina and pollo al mattone, both classic Tuscan dishes,
rule on Southern California's Italian menus. Top level Chianti
Classico and super-Tuscans are as much at home on wine lists at
French or California restaurants as at Italian ones. And the word
"Tuscany" now conveys not only a region but also a lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   Toscana, too, has had a remarkable 13-year run. I don't think it
has the best Italian food, or even the best Tuscan food, in L.A., yet
loyal fans continue to fill the tiny spot night after night. One
thing it has going for it is its looks. Urban and contemporary, it
has an edgy big-city Italian style that has worn remarkably well. The
Italian beaded hanging lampshades, the inspiration for countless
schlocky knockoffs, are as beautiful as ever, warming up the stark
white space with their golden glow.</LD>
<TE>   To the right, as you walk in the door, is a heart-stopping display
of desserts. And beyond that, there's a long marble counter that
functions as a sort of neighborhood regulars' table. From here, you
can keep an eye on the pizzas and steaks as the cooks slide them into
the handsome wood-burning oven. But the center of the action is the
long country table in the middle of the room, which functions as
maitre d's desk and waiters' station.</TE>
<TE>   Toscana is a well-oiled machine. It's fascinating to sit at the
table just vacated by Julie Andrews and watch the waiters and support
staff, who seem to number in the dozens, clear a table in a flash,
unfurl a clean tablecloth and fling on plates and silverware moments
before the suave maitre d' ushers the next guests in that direction.
Toscana's Italian waiters can lay on the schtick. Some nights, it can
seem like a kiss fest at the door as wave after wave of diners walk
in chirping "Ciao."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, after a few checkup visits, I wondered again whether
Toscana's runaway success is due more to the way the staff coddles
the guests than to the food. Because, even at its best, it's not all
that inspiring. It's not even all that Tuscan. For example, the
ribollita, the traditional rustic soup "reboiled" with a piece of
stale bread to thicken it, doesn't even have any bread. (Though it
now sports some swatches of cavolo nero, or Tuscan black cabbage,
along with the beans and vegetables.)</TE>
<TE>   The founding chef, Agostino Sciandri, who has since left to open
Ago in West Hollywood, took Toscana's popular pollo al mattone and
spun it off into a chain of take-out rosticcerias called Rosti.
Toscana's version is still pretty good, served with little roasted
potatoes and what tastes like completely unseasoned frozen leaf
spinach. But where are such classic Tuscan dishes as chicken liver
crostini, or, in summer, panzanella, the refreshing salad of bread,
tomatoes, cucumbers and basil?</TE>
<TE>   Aside from bistecca fiorentina, Tuscan touches are token. But the
bistecca, a thick slab of steak finished in the wood-burning oven, is
consistently one of the best dishes on the menu (still, certainly not
one of the best steaks in town).</TE>
<TE>   Why, I wonder, when everyone comes back from Italy raving about
the food, do restaurateurs here shy away from the real thing? One
reason may be that Tuscan cuisine is so plain, there's no way to
disguise the quality of the ingredients. Though the kitchen has
regained ground under chef Piero Topputo, even something as simple as
pasta fagioli, the cannellini bean and pasta soup, needs a swirl of
peppery Tuscan extra-virgin olive oil to make the flavors sing. The
complimentary pinzimonio -- crudely cut raw vegetables -- to dip in
olive oil needs better than the pallid olive oil offered here (and
it's swirled with cheap balsamic vinegar, something you'd never see
in Tuscany).</TE>
<TE>   Every table at Toscana also gets a complimentary plate of plain
thin-crusted pizza bread perfumed with rosemary. Hot from the oven,
it's a treat. Pizzas from the wood-burning oven are generously sized
and very Italian. Best bets are the Margherita and the quattro
stagione, the "four seasons" pizza traditionally divided into four
quarters, each with a different topping. Here, though, the
artichokes, olives, cooked ham and other ingredients are strewn
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Raw artichokes, thinly shaved and dressed in olive oil and lemon
with a shaving of Parmesan is another fine starter. A seafood salad,
though, is a medley of shrimp and calamari that taste as anonymous as
something from the frozen food case.</TE>
<TE>   Pasta dishes tend to be workmanlike and filling, but not ravishing
enough to lure you onto the next plane to Italy. The kitchen does a
nice job with spaghetti alle vongole made with tiny clams in the
shell, though, and trenette al pesto, flat noodles in a classic
Genovese pesto. Penne in a rustic sauce of anchovies, olives, capers
and garlic is generally a good bet too. But spaghetti with calamari
features tasteless squid and an oily sauce. The best of the risotto
dishes is that made with a mix of domestic and wild mushrooms.
They'll make one with truffles too, but before you sign on, make sure
it's clear which kind of truffles: the less expensive and less
fragrant summer truffles or the real thing, white truffles from Alba.
At times, Toscana has served both.</TE>
<TE>   I have more trouble finding a main course other than the chicken
and the fiorentina to recommend. The regular bistecca isn't as
flavorful. Poached salmon tastes like a last resort choice for
dieters. Grilled branzino or sea bass is pallid, and the Milanese
(that's pounded veal chop rolled in egg and bread crumbs) tastes like
a mystery meat it has so little inherent flavor. If you crave
seafood, go with the Tuscan calamari inzimino. I wish the calamari
were tastier, but when stewed with Swiss chard or spinach, tomatoes
and white wine, it makes a delicious dish.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts are entirely forgettable. If you must have one, go with
the restrained ricotta cheese cake.</TE>
<TE>   The place is incredibly noisy, boisterous and, if you're not
concerned about actually hearing what anyone at your table is saying,
fun. Since I don't think anyone enjoys feeling hustled, I have to
surmise that either everyone here has come to terms with it or
doesn't notice the staff aggressively topping off water, the sooner
to open a new bottle. Or the well-heeled crowd has such deep pockets,
the high wine markups don't even register. For a relaxed evening of
dining, the food comes out far too fast, but then that may be another
reason why Toscana is so popular with A types: You can be in and out
in an hour.</TE>

<HD>Go ahead, bake them</HD>
<DH>There's only one way to have real rolls, the kind with soft
centers, a thin crust and the rich flavors of yeast and butter. The
good news: It's easy to do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BACK in the '80s, a cantankerous friend with a taste for prefab food
used to insist on bringing his own turkey and trimmings to my
Thanksgiving for a taste-off. He was convinced that nothing cooked
from scratch would be substantially better than what he could buy at
some takeout shop.</LD>
<LD>   Occasionally, in those Butterball days, he might have won the
turkey battle. But he always lost the war of the rolls.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing produced by even the best traditional bakery can compare
to what comes out of a home oven. Half the pleasure is the smell --
only garlic sauteing can compare to yeast dough baking -- but there
are bigger reasons not to settle for the brown-and-serve kind.</LD>
<TE>   Real rolls have texture, not to mention a delicate but discernible
crust and a strong taste of yeast and butter.</TE>
<TE>   And they have to be eaten straight out of the oven, while steam is
still rising from the soft centers.</TE>
<TE>   Now that artisanal bakeries promoting crust and density have
changed the breadscape in America, homemade dinner rolls have a bit
of the same retro feel as ripe olives and canned cranberry sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Cookbooks have pretty much abandoned them in recent years. But to
me they will always be the essential ingredient in a true
Thanksgiving, and knowing they are a do-it-yourself indulgence only
adds to their appeal.</TE>
<TE>   They also happen to be surprisingly easy to make, even on the most
frenzied cooking day of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Get the dough ready</TE>
<TE>   You can start them the night before, let them rise slowly in the
refrigerator overnight, then finish them off as part of the whole
carving/gravy-making choreography. The dough needs to warm up to room
temperature, and once it's shaped into rolls it has to sit again,
until it's doubled in bulk (the baker's way of saying lightened up).</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the turkey comes out of the oven to rest before it's
carved, you can slide the rolls in to bake, and everything gets to
the table at once.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, the dough needs no kneading; you just stir with a
wooden spoon. If your yeast is fresh and all the ingredients are at
the right temperature, the dough can't help but rise. But
Thanksgiving also provides optimum baking conditions, because the
kitchen is so warm and humid.</TE>
<TE>   A sticky dough yields a more tender roll, but it can be a little
hard to handle. If it's too tacky, you can just oil or butter your
hands while you tear off and shape each piece.</TE>
<TE>   Flat rounds can be folded over into little pockets to make
Parkerhouse rolls, or three balls of dough can be fitted into muffin
cups to produce pull-apart cloverleaf rolls, or chunks of dough can
be rolled into rounds to make classic rolls.</TE>
<TE>   The whole process does take hours, but then Thanksgiving should be
about slowing down and taking time to smell the cooking.</TE>
<TE>   The best recipe I have come across since my mom's Betty Crocker
cookbook is from Kathy Cary, the chef who owns Lily's in Louisville,
Ky. It's a superb blend of Southern biscuit and airy roll, both
buttery and yeasty. She shapes them into little pockets brushed with
more butter, but I like to shape them into cloverleafs to maximize
the contrast between the crust and the soft center.</TE>
<TE>   As a variation, pumpkin rolls scented with thyme are denser and
more strongly flavored. For the lightest dough, these need to rise
before they are refrigerated, but that just saves time the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Either of these would have defeated my friend from way back when.
The real reason he brought his own turkey was to be sure he went home
with leftovers. And with homemade rolls there are none.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How to get your dough in good shape</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slow-rising Southern dinner rolls</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours standing and 8 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12 cloverleaf or 18 dinner rolls</TE>
<TE>   Note: This is adapted from a recipe by Kathy Cary of Lily's in
Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   1 ( 1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup scalded milk</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour, plus 1/2 cup more if needed</TE>
<TE>   1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let
stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. In a 1-quart bowl, beat the egg
well, then whisk in the sugar, salt, milk, 1/2 cup of the butter and
the yeast and water. Gradually stir in the flour, adding if needed up
to 1/2 cup more, just enough to make a soft, very sticky dough. Use a
little of the remaining butter to grease a 2-quart bowl. Transfer the
dough to the bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at
least 6 hours, or overnight.</TE>
<TE>   2. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand at room
temperature for 1 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter either a 12-cup muffin tin
or 2 (8-inch) cake pans.</TE>
<TE>   4. Knead and shape the dough into rolls. For cloverleaf, tear off
tablespoon-sized balls and place 3 in each muffin cup; for dinner
rolls, divide the dough into equal rounds and arrange half an inch
apart in pans. If the dough is too sticky, butter your hands well
when you handle it. Cover the rolls with a dish towel and let rise in
a warm spot until doubled in bulk, 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   5. Lightly brush the rolls with the remaining melted butter. Bake
until the rolls are just browned on top and bottom, 15 to 18 minutes.
Serve warm with plenty of butter.</TE>

<TE>   Slow-rising pumpkin-thyme dinner rolls</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours standing and 8 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12 cloverleaf or 18 dinner rolls</TE>
<TE>   2 ( 1/4-ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 cup canned pumpkin puree</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour, plus up to 1 cup more</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil, for greasing bowl</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons melted butter</TE>
<TE>   1. Sprinkle the yeast over the water in a large mixing bowl and
stir to dissolve. Using a wooden spoon, beat in the eggs, pumpkin,
soft butter, sugar, salt, thyme and cayenne. Add 3 cups of flour and
beat until smooth, gradually adding more flour as needed to make a
soft, sticky but still manageable dough. Make sure the dough is well
mixed. Oil a larger bowl and scrape the dough into it, turning to oil
all sides. Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free
spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down,
cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   2. Grease 2 (8-inch) cake pans with melted butter. Punch the dough
down again and shape into round dinner rolls, arranging them in pans
with about 1/2 inch between each (if the dough is too sticky to
handle easily, lightly butter or oil your hands), or cloverleaf
dinner rolls as directed in the Southern rolls recipe. Cover the
rolls with a dish towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in
bulk, 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the rolls until browned, 20
to 25 minutes. Serve hot or warm.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: Do you have recipes for casseroles to take to Thanksgiving
dinner for 12-16 people?</LD>
<LD>   Betty Norton</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   Dear Betty: This corn bread pudding comes from "Tom Douglas'
Seattle Kitchen" by Tom Douglas (William Morrow, $30). It's herbal
and custardy, and would be delicious with turkey or any meat. And it
can be made a day ahead: Just cover it and refrigerate. To reheat,
cover it with foil and bake at 375 degrees for about 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Etta's corn bread pudding</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours, 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 16</TE>
<TE>   Corn bread</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup medium-ground yellow cornmeal</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated pepper Jack cheese</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons honey</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter an 8-inch square baking
dish.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the flour, cornmeal, cheese, baking powder and salt in
a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk and
honey. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until
just combined. Stir in the melted butter.</TE>
<TE>   3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a
toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
Cool completely before cutting.</TE>
<TE>   Pudding</TE>
<TE>   1 recipe corn bread, cut into 1-inch cubes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   2 cups thinly sliced onion (about 1 large onion)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated dry Jack cheese</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   4 1/2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   8 eggs</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Put the cubed corn
bread in a buttered 13-by-9 baking dish and set aside</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the butter in a skillet over low heat and cook the onion
very slowly until soft and golden brown, at least 20 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   3. Scatter the onion, cheese, parsley, rosemary and thyme over the
corn bread cubes. Whisk together the cream and eggs with the salt and
pepper and pour over the corn bread. Let sit for 10 minutes so the
corn bread absorbs some of the custard. Set the pudding dish in a
larger roasting pan filled with hot water to come up two-thirds of
the way the sides of the dish.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bake until the top of the pudding is golden and the center
slightly set, 70 to 80 minutes. Don't wait for it to be too firm, or
the whole thing will curdle. Remove the pudding from the water bath
immediately or else it will continue to cook. Serve hot.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: Three generations of my family are clamoring for me to make
pumpkin fritters for Thanksgiving. We all dined at the famous
Farnsworth House Restaurant in Gettysburg, Pa., this past summer and
gorged ourselves on its wonderful pumpkin fritters. Can you get them
to share their recipe?</LD>
<LD>   Barbara McDowell</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach</LD>
<TE>   Dear Barbara: These would be great for Thanksgiving breakfast with
good strong coffee or maybe latte. For the lightest fritters, start
heating the oil, and mix the batter together at the last minute. The
longer it stands, the tougher your fritters will be.</TE>

<TE>   Pumpkin fritters</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 7</TE>
<TE>   Oil or shortening, for frying</TE>
<TE>   3/4cup cooked or canned pumpkin puree</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon nutmeg, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1. Add enough oil to a heavy skillet to reach a depth of 1 inch.
Heat the oil to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the pumpkin puree and beaten eggs in a bowl. In another
bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, pumpkin pie
spice, 1/2 teaspoon of the nutmeg and the cinnamon. Quickly stir the
flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture just until blended. Do not
over-mix the batter or the fritters will be tough.</TE>
<TE>   3. Drop the fritter batter into the hot oil using a level
tablespoon for each. Do not crowd the skillet. Fry, in batches of 4
or 5, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. The fritters will turn as
they fry. Use a slotted spoon to remove.</TE>
<TE>   4. Combine the sugar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Roll the
hot fritters in the sugar mixture. You'll have about 21 fritters.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: How do I roast a 12- to 15-pound turkey that has been cut
into parts (breast, thighs and drumsticks)?</LD>
<LD>   Natalie Riezman</LD>
<LD>   Marina del Rey</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Natalie: Keep in mind that the parts will cook at different
times; they can't be pulled out of the oven at the same time. The
drumsticks and thighs, because of their connective tissue, will take
longer to cook. It might be best to roast them in one pan and the
breast in another. Still, you won't have to fuss over the oven as
long; the parts will cook more quickly than a whole bird.</TE>
<TE>   Use a meat thermometer to assure doneness. Season the breast,
thighs and drumsticks as you would the whole bird. Place the breast
in a shallow roasting pan, so it will cook evenly, and roast at 325
degrees until the meat thermometer reaches 165 to 170 degrees. You
might want to add one-half cup of water to the pan to make cleanup
easier. Roast the drumsticks and thighs, meanwhile, until they reach
a temperature of 170 to 175 degrees.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: We are going to smoke a turkey the day before Thanksgiving.
When should we slice it? We're also going to barbecue another turkey
and transport it by car. How would you wrap it?</LD>
<LD>   Pepper Patterson</LD>
<LD>   Banning</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Pepper: Why not slice it once it's smoked? You'll save
yourself the trouble on Thanksgiving Day. Just be sure to wrap the
meat well or cover it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it. Allow it to
come to room temperature before serving.</TE>
<TE>   You could also cut the turkey into parts, place them on plates,
wrap them well, and refrigerate them. Slice before serving. Again,
you'll want the meat to come to room temperature; if you reheat it,
it will lose moisture and become dry.</TE>
<TE>   As for the turkey you're transporting, Thanksgiving Day can
sometimes be warm, so for food safety reasons your bird probably
shouldn't travel more than 30 minutes or so. Ideally the turkey
should go from the barbecue (or oven) into a foil roasting pan, then
be covered loosely with foil, then clean kitchen towels, and
newspaper over that. Place the whole thing in a cardboard box.
Setting it in a foam container or ice chest (without ice) is another
option to keep it warm.</TE>

cutting the meat and chopping the vegetables -- just toss them away
after each job is done. (But before you do, you can use them to
transfer your handiwork to a bowl or pan.) Saran Disposable Cutting

<HD>As good as homemade</HD>
<DH>For Thanksgiving, do yourself a favor: Buy the pie. There
are so many top-flight bakeries in the region that a store-bought pie
isn't necessarily a cop-out; it may be the wisest choice. But if
that's the route you choose, order ahead. The best pies go fast.</DH>

<LD>Homey crust with a sassy filling</LD>
<LD>   Union Bakery's classic pie has a crust so plain it looks homemade.
But there is nothing plain about this delicious pie: The tender crust
is all-butter pate brisee, and the filling is subtly spiced with
cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, and a dash of bourbon. The
surprise is, it is made with butternut squash, not pumpkin.</LD>
<LD>   A 9-inch pie is $20 at Union Bakery, 1138 Fair Oaks Ave., South
Pasadena, (626) 403-1850.</LD>
<TE>   Flaky, but with staying power</TE>
<TE>   Bake &amp; Broil's pumpkin pie has a flaky crust and a generous load
of fluffy, gently spiced filling. It's a great pie for a long,
leisurely holiday meal. After standing for hours, it tastes as fresh
as when you bought it -- no soggy crust or solidified filling. A
fancy variation is topped with a brown sugar-walnut streusel flavored
with orange zest.</TE>
<TE>   A 9-inch pie is $7.95; streusel topped, $8.95, at Jongewaard's
Bake &amp; Broil, 3697 Atlantic Ave., Long Beach, (562) 595-0396.</TE>
<TE>   Deep dish, and a tall order</TE>
<TE>   Hearty eaters on your guest list will love the deep-dish pumpkin
pie from the Filling Station Cafe. It's as big as three or four pies,
a tall structure of soft, light filling in a fluted, 11-inch crust.
The filling is true pumpkin, and the crust is a cross between tart
pastry and sugar-cookie dough. The baker, co-owner Hyun-Sook Chung,
makes the pies by hand.</TE>
<TE>   Deep-dish pumpkin pie, $20 at the Filling Station Cafe and Coffee
House, 201 N. Glassell St., Orange, (714) 289-9714.</TE>
<TE>   A praline crunch, a buttery crust</TE>
<TE>   This one is a guaranteed spectacular finish: BakeAway's 2
1/2-inch-tall pie is decorated with thin tracings of praline and
chopped, roasted walnuts. It has a butter crust and a squashy-tasting
pumpkin filling (the bakery will not divulge the contents). Located
in an industrial strip of Robertson Boulevard, BakeAway is a
wholesale facility, but will fill retail orders with advance notice.</TE>
<TE>   A 9-inch pie is $17 at BakeAway Deluxe Baked Goods, 3380 S.
Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles, (310) 287-2772.</TE>
<TE>   Dressing a tart for any occasion</TE>
<TE>   Sugar Plum Bakery, a pretty Parisian-style shop, takes an elegant
spin on the pumpkin pie. Pastry chef Anna Delorefice calls it a tart,
though it's more substantial than the usual: A rustic shortbread
crust holds a creamy custard filling with a tang of mascarpone. The
top is adorned with a festive shortbread cookie, shaped like a
turkey, star or, for Hanukkah, a star of David.</TE>
<TE>   An 8-inch tart is $26 at Sugar Plum Bakery, 7122 Beverly Blvd.,
Los Angeles, (323) 934-7900.</TE>
<TE>   More dense, plus extra toppings</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Register, pastry chef for restaurateur-chef Tim Goodell,
runs this new bake shop. She goes a bit denser and less custardy with
her filling, more like a sweet potato pie. The crust is very flaky
and unsweetened, and for an extra $5 you can get whipped cream,
toasted pecans and caramel sauce to finish off this hearty dessert.</TE>
<TE>   A 9-inch pie is $15 at Village Bakery, the Camp, 2937 Bristol St.,
Costa Mesa, (714) 751-2220.</TE>

<HD>Ready? Here's how to tell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Lowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IF you want to avoid the stringy, dry turkey so many of us remember
from Thanksgivings past or, even worse, that awful bit of red peeking
out from the joints, there's only one thing to do, really -- don't
guess, use a thermometer.</LD>
<LD>   Some thermometers are as basic as ever, others are technologically
clever, but, in a general sense, there are just two kinds: An
instant-read thermometer, which takes a turkey's temperature as it's
pulled from the oven, and an oven-safe thermometer, which stays in
the turkey and keeps running track of the temperature.</LD>
<LD>   We tested two of each kind by roasting 3 1/2-pound whole chickens
to 170 degrees. (While the Department of Agriculture recommends 180
degrees for whole chickens and turkeys, our Test Kitchen has found
the meat becomes too dry at this temperature; we recommend 165
degrees for turkey, since there is usually a 10-degree rise as the
bird stands once out of the oven.)</LD>
<TE>   The most basic model was a 1-inch dial, the Taylor Classic Instant
Read Thermometer. It worked well, though we had to squint to read the
numbers and the needle was a little slow to register the temperature.
The crucial instructions for its use -- where to insert the tip --
were a bit weak, just like all the others. (Answer: Insert the
thermometer into the innermost part of the thigh, taking care not to
touch the bone.)</TE>
<TE>   The directions for the Polder Professional Digital Instant Read
Thermometer, which looks like a top-heavy pen, said to press the
"hold" button when the final temperature registers, to "freeze" the
readout. But the temperature never seemed to stop rising in
agonizingly slow 0.2-degree increments, so we weren't sure when to
press the button.</TE>
<TE>   The oven-safe Pyrex Digital Thermometer and Timer turned out to be
not all that oven-safe: its instructions warned against setting the
oven any hotter than 392 degrees (392?), or the metal wire connecting
the probe and the unit could be damaged. So we roasted that chicken
at 375 degrees (the rest were at 400). Despite this, we liked
watching the temperature rise on the digital display as the chicken
cooked, and an alarm beeped when it reached 170 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Our final thermometer, at $75, was the most outlandish. The Grill
Alert Talking Remote Thermometer from Brookstone connects a probe to
a transmitter, which beams information to a hand-held receiver, the
size of a large cell phone. You can be up to 300 feet away when a
woman's sensible voice will announce "your entree is almost ready."
Five degrees later, she'll say "your entree is ready."</TE>
<TE>   She was right; the chicken was golden, its juices ran clear, and
somehow her voice was strangely reassuring. Now, if she could just
tell us how to carve the turkey, we'd be set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nothing fancy here, just the good ol' basics</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: The Taylor Classic needs no batteries,
dependable, though a little slow.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: You can't miss with it; just give us the
large-print version.</TE>
<TE>   How much: $6-$10 at general merchandise and kitchen stores</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Promising, but don't ask us</TE>
<TE>   about the hold button</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: The Polder digital thermometer is easy to
hold. But the short probe makes removing it a bit of a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: Looked good, but a hold button made it harder to
use than the old basic.</TE>
<TE>   How much: $15-$17 at kitchenware stores and online</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sound the alarm! This bird's cooked</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: The Pyrex digital thermometer requires
instruction-reading and batteries. Alarm sounds when turkey is done.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: Felt some reassurance watching temperature slowly
rise as chicken cooked. Had to balance the unit on the oven handle;
it's magnetic back did not stick to our brushed stainless oven door.
But it won't work at the higher temperatures we like for roasting.</TE>
<TE>   How much: About $20 at kitchenware stores and online</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, she says when it's done</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: Technology, baby. The Grill Alert Talking
Remote Thermometer allows you to keep an eye on the temperature from
afar, then tells you when it's done.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: At first, we laughed. Something for the serious
gadget-head. But once we rigged it up, we felt like we had a new
friend in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   How much: $75 at Brook- stone stores and  www.brookstone.com.</TE>

<HD>1,000 folds on the road to compulsion</HD>

<LD>Filling the pepper grinder, polishing the wine glasses, lighting the
candles. Oh, the thousand thoughtful steps behind a well-laid table!
Or the eleven-hundred if you fall under the influence of the new book
"Simply Elegant Napkin Folding" (Sterling Publishing Co., $14.95).</LD>
<LD>   You might. Don't scoff. Italians set children at a kitchen table
and keep their little fingers out of trouble by having them roll
pasta dough into fanciful shapes, into little ears and bows and
twirls. A festive, make that hilarious, alternative for adults,
particularly an adult with a freshly poured glass of wine, could
easily involve cloth.</LD>
<LD>   Name an occasion, and this book has a napkin shape for it. There
are horns of plenty, fortune cookies, tulips, envelopes, boats, fans,
bows, bunnies. There is even, if the vicar comes to tea, a bishop's
hat. The constructions are often silly, occasionally delightful,
always there to briefly enchant or amuse us before we shake them out.</LD>
<TE>   But a warning. "Simply Elegant" does not mean simple. This is a
distinctly methodical pursuit of whimsy. Granted, it all starts
simply enough, with an introduction showing basic techniques,
including shapes called "quarterfold" and "centerpoint," along with
rectangles, triangles and pleats. All the fancier napkin shapes are
then derived from these basic folds, explains author Chris Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter after chapter, we are instructed in the art of making
these advanced shapes. Triangle tucks, candelabras, obelisks. But
beware of becoming cocky after early successes. Reviewing this book
involved turning my hand to a dozen or so formations. I was not even
through Chapter 2's "basic folds from squares" before failing to
achieve the "lotus blossom" position.</TE>
<TE>   "Lay the napkin on the table with the wrong side facing you and
fold it into a centerpoint square," read Step 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Wrong side?" I growled. "Pray tell what's the 'right side' of a
napkin?" I folded and fumbled enough to deduce that the "wrong side"
was the back of the cloth, the one where the hem is tucked, only to
falter again at Step 4. "Fold the center point down firmly with one
hand, reach underneath and gently pull a corner of the underneath
layer out until it sits up and frames the corner of the top layer."</TE>
<TE>   What?</TE>
<TE>   The lotus blossom proved my napkin-folding Waterloo. I was taking
it out on the test napkins when the food section designer wandered
through the test kitchen, nimbly pulled out some cotton and popped it
out like a shirt collar. Hey, presto, there it was. Lotus blossom.
Just like in the book.</TE>
<TE>   "I did origami as a kid," she explained diffidently.</TE>
<TE>   More than decoration</TE>
<TE>   Reader, take it from me: Napkin folding is not unlike tennis. It's
a psychological sport. "You did most of it," she added, worried,
perhaps, that she had shown me up too easily. I placate easily. I
decided that yes, I did. In fact, it was almost mine and I proudly
paraded lotus blossom around. Doing this, I realized that it would be
a good napkin shape for a kid. If you can get around unfolding it,
its tufting pockets are ideal for hiding bits of food that you can
pretend you've swallowed.</TE>
<TE>   The book closes with the reminder that napkins are not just
decoration. We wipe our mouths with them. I, myself, already knew
this. Napkins and sleeves: both for wiping mouths. But maybe it is
not so obvious. Our love of the bright linens displayed so enticingly
in kitchenware shops is such that it's not so silly to balk at
actually using them. My own solution was to become accepting of
stains. I had to. For as long as I can remember, I have only used
cloth napkins, which I launder every fortnight and usually iron. The
odd blotch is just part of the territory, particularly given my
preference for right-on, stain-friendly, bio-degradable detergents.</TE>
<TE>   But the author is more fastidious. There are 15 stain removal
tips, each stain requiring a different protocol, for everything from
berries to egg to lipstick to gravy to wine. Then there are the tips
about how to store these now immaculate linens: in suitcases under
the bed.</TE>
<TE>   Oh dear. Not my cup of compulsion. And I wonder if it doesn't
somehow undermine the crowning beauty of napkin folding? Nothing
conceals the odd stain better than a quick triangle tuck.</TE>

<LD>Barbera's lush fruit, lively acidity and soft tannins make for easy,
pleasurable drinking. But this example, from a famous Barolo
producer, is much more than that -- it's an absolutely gorgeous wine.
Using grapes from three vineyards in the Asti area, it shows
beautiful fruit and a bright thread of acidity that sings on the
palate.</LD>
<LD>   This supple and delicious wine, tasting of plums and cherries, is
anything but simple. And this year, it just may be the bottle to
stand up to all the competing flavors in a Thanksgiving dinner.</LD>
<LD>   By the way, if you come across the 1999 vintage somewhere, grab a
bottle of that too. It's a lot of juice for the money.</LD>

<LD>Melville Winery is so committed to Pinot Noir that is has planted 11
different clones on its Santa Ynez Valley estate. This bottling is
just delicious: silken in texture, tasting of lush ripe cherries and
plums with a scent of rose petals and raspberries. At less than $20,
this is a terrific bargain for dedicated Pinot fans. A wine this
graceful goes with just about anything, making it a perfect bottle to
pour for Thanksgiving.</LD>

<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are three wines for the Thanksgiving table, all under $20. It's
hard to believe that a little more than $10 will buy a Chardonnay of
this quality. Although it isn't touted prominently on the label, West
Slope Chardonnay is produced by Mount Eden, one of the biggest and
most reliable names in California Chardonnay. Made from grapes grown
on Edna Ranch in the Edna Valley, barrel-fermented and aged in French
oak, this is a classy and classic California Chardonnay. It's rich
and full with a moderate touch of oak and a lilting note of citrus, a
wine that can hold its own against much pricier bottles. Pour with
abandon for the Thanksgiving feast.</LD>

In fact, Chevrolet, the manufacturer of the Caprice, did not produce
that car until 1965. Mays misspoke -- his family's car at the time
was a Chevrolet Impala.</LD>

<HD>First Alliance to Issue Refunds to Borrowers</HD>
<DH>Judge closes case of home-equity lender accused of tricking
clients into paying exorbitant fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge closed out the predatory-lending case against
Irvine-based First Alliance Corp. on Tuesday, clearing the way for
settlement checks to go out next month to more than 18,000 borrowers
who, according to private lawsuits and the Federal Trade Commission,
were routinely tricked into paying exorbitant fees.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana closed the
bankruptcy case of home-equity lender First Alliance and signed
orders causing about $50 million to flow into a fund from which
damages will be paid to borrowers.</LD>
<LD>   "The game plan is to have the checks mailed in the first couple of
weeks of December," said Dan Mulligan, a San Francisco attorney who
represented borrowers.</LD>
<TE>   The fund is expected to get an additional $25 million early next
year from the sale of a final batch of loans and receipt of a tax
refund owed to First Alliance, bringing the total settlement to about
$75 million.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers could receive more depending on the outcome of a related
lawsuit against Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., which funded First
Alliance and bundled its loans for sale as securities. Carter has
scheduled a trial in that case for Jan. 28. A Lehman attorney
couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Another wild card is what Reliance Insurance Co. will pay on
professional liability policies it issued to First Alliance from 1996
to 1999. The policies have a face value of $11 million. Reliance is
in bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The First Alliance settlement includes $20 million paid by the
company's founder, Brian Chisick, with the rest coming from the
company's assets. Chisick's attorney, Ron Rus of Irvine, said his
client is glad to get the case closed "so he can continue with his
retirement."</TE>
<TE>   When first announced, the $75-million settlement with First
Alliance set a record for an FTC lending-abuse case.</TE>
<TE>   It soon was eclipsed, however, by Citigroup Inc.'s $240-million
settlement of FTC charges and Household International Corp.'s
agreement to pay $484 million to end predatory-lending investigations
by state attorneys general. Many additional cases charging lending
violations are pending and more are expected, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's inevitable," said Mulligan, who was involved in
litigation against Citigroup as well as First Alliance. "The
marketing tactics are very similar."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street is closely watching the Lehman case, which attorneys
said appears unlikely to be settled before trial. The plaintiffs are
seeking about $400 million, but Lehman has made no settlement offers.</TE>

<HD>Clive Davis to Run Merged RCA, J Labels</HD>
<DH>Bertelsmann says move would 'right the wrong' done to the
68-year-old industry legend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertelsmann Music Group merged its RCA and J labels Tuesday and
called on industry legend Clive Davis to take charge of the new
division. The move marks the latest twist in a remarkable career for
the 68-year-old Davis, who discovered Santana and Janis Joplin but
was told recently that he was too old to work at BMG.</LD>
<LD>   He was driven out of his Arista label three years ago by a team of
executives who soon after lost their jobs. Trying to defuse the
negative publicity surrounding Davis' treatment, BMG's new management
offered him $150 million to launch J, a start-up label consisting
primarily of acts that he recruited from his former Arista roster.
BMG retained half ownership.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, BMG announced it would buy the other half of J and
combine it with RCA -- with Davis running the entire show, to be
named RCA-J Records. The terms of the deal are unclear, as is the
future of former RCA chief Bob Jamison.</LD>
<TE>   "Today we open a new chapter between BMG and Clive," said BMG
Chairman Rolf Schmidt-Holtz. "We right the wrong with this major
step."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is incredibly gratifying," he said. "A ringing affirmation.
A great day. A terrific challenge."</TE>

<HD>Charter Receives Informal SEC Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Derek Caney</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc., already facing a criminal investigation
of its accounting, said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it
recently had received an informal, nonpublic inquiry from federal
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, the cable firm acknowledged that it
understated its costs and tax liabilities related to acquisitions in
1999 and 2000, requiring a restatement of earnings dating to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   In connection with the criminal investigation, the company has
denied wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   St. Louis-based Charter, which has about 500,000 subscribers in
Southern California, repeated Tuesday that revenue and operating cash
flow -- the measurements of performance preferred by cable companies
-- would not be affected by the restatements. However, analysts said
credibility is an issue.</TE>
<TE>   In its earnings filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company disclosed that it had received Nov. 4 an SEC
inquiry that concerned "its prior reporting of its customers and
policies and procedures relating to its disconnection of customers."</TE>
<TE>   Charter, which is controlled by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul
Allen, said it would record an additional $1.4 billion in franchise
costs and $1.2 billion in deferred tax liabilities. The company said
statements for 2000 and 2001 and the first and second quarters of
2002 would be restated, and 2000 and 2001 statements would be
re-audited.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's filing, the company reported a loss of $239.5
million, or 81 cents a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30,
compared with a loss of $326.6 million, or $1.11 a share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company released its quarterly revenue and operating cash flow
results this month, before its scheduled conference call with
analysts, but it withheld a complete income statement.</TE>
<TE>   Charter's shares rose 1 cent to $1.19 on Nasdaq.</TE>

censorship technology also fails.</DH>

<BD>From Times Staff and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc. investors on Tuesday rejected a proposal calling
for the world's largest maker of computer-networking equipment to pay
a cash dividend for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   But Chief Executive John Chambers, speaking at the company's
annual meeting in Santa Clara, Calif., said Cisco might consider
paying dividends -- if federal tax policy is changed.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal for a dividend was placed on the company's proxy
ballot by Barry Carney, a shareholder from Woodbridge, Va.
Shareholders rejected the idea by a 10-1 ratio, Chief Financial
Officer Larry Carter said. The proposal wasn't for a specific
dividend amount.</LD>
<TE>   Major technology firms historically have paid little or no cash
dividends, preferring to retain earnings for reinvestment or to use
earnings in part to buy back shares in the open market.</TE>
<TE>   But with the crash in tech stocks since 2000, and with the
industry's growth rate slowed, some investors have argued that it's
time for cash-rich giants such as Cisco and Microsoft Corp. to return
some of their profit directly to shareholders in the form of
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's cash and cash-equivalent holdings as of Oct. 26 totaled
nearly $7 billion. The company also held $3.3 billion in other
short-term investments.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco had asked investors to reject Carney's measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people want a dividend because they're worried about the
growth rate of the company," Chambers told the audience of several
hundred people. "If tax policy were to change or if we would hear
more shareholders want to do it, we always want to listen. We don't
have a religious view on dividends."</TE>
<TE>   Some in Congress have proposed changes in tax law to make
dividends more appealing. One idea would be to exempt from federal
tax all or part of the dividends investors earn. The argument for an
exemption is that dividends are effectively taxed twice -- once as
corporate profit, and again when that profit is paid to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Carney wasn't at the meeting and couldn't immediately be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers conceded that the dividend idea is a bigger topic of
conversation these days. "Most shareholders a year ago would not have
talked about dividends at all. In the last six months it has started
to be an issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders also rejected a proposal, brought by investor Ann Lau
of Los Angeles, to recommend that Cisco's board report on countries
that use Cisco products to monitor or block citizens' Internet use.
Lau singled out China as a country that "has used technology
effectively to monitor their citizens," according to Cisco's proxy.
Her proposal failed 25 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco shares fell 25 cents to $13.66 on Nasdaq on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Admission Impossible</HD>
<DH>Latest Wall Street scandal shows how brutal competition is
for a spot in elite preschool</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Folks in this town grow their famously thick skins jousting for taxis
during rain showers, vying for Yankees playoff tickets and trying to
talk their way past the clipboard squad at hot clubs and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   And if you had any illusions that nursery school offered a respite
from the Darwinian struggle of the Naked City, well, fuhgedaboutit.</LD>
<LD>   A major topic of conversation these days on commuter trains, at
deli counters and, yes, on the mean streets of the Upper East Side is
Citigroup Inc. Chairman Sanford I. Weill's extravagant effort to buy
entree into one of the city's most prestigious nursery schools for
the twin sons of a key employee.</LD>
<TE>   "You do need connections," mail carrier Elliot Reyes said Tuesday
as he wheeled a mail satchel down wind-whipped 3rd Avenue. "I have a
couple of celebrities in one building here, and even that doesn't
help. You have to know somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes delivers mail to the upscale apartment buildings a
block east of the 92nd Street Y, which runs the ultra-exclusive
preschool in question, attended by the offspring of such New York
icons as Woody Allen.</TE>
<TE>   The program charges up to $14,400 a year for youngsters aged 2 1/2
to 5. It has about 65 openings annually and limits the number of
applications to 300. Otherwise, Y spokeswoman Alix Friedman said
Tuesday, "our staff would do nothing but interview parents."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of money or connections, "no child is guaranteed
admission," she said. "Every child is evaluated in the same careful
way as every other child."</TE>
<TE>   Weill acknowledged last week that he had gone to bat with the Y on
behalf of Jack Grubman, former star telecommunications analyst at the
firm's Salomon Smith Barney unit. Citigroup also provided a
$1-million donation to the Y.</TE>
<TE>   What interests New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and other
investigators is whether there was any quid pro quo involved.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman bragged in a string of e-mails examined by
authorities that his part of the bargain was to upgrade his investment
rating of a stock he didn't believe in -- namely, AT&amp;T Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Weill, according to Grubman's e-mails, intended to use the upgrade
to butter up AT&amp;T Chairman and Citicorp director C. Michael Armstrong
and enlist his aid in ousting Weill's rival, then Citicorp
co-Chairman John Reed.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman later disavowed the e-mail messages, saying they were lies
that he had invented "to inflate my professional importance."</TE>
<TE>   Weill also has denied any connection between the AT&amp;T upgrade and
his effort to help Grubman, who left the company in August. He called
Grubman's e-mail boasts "sheer nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense or not, the flap has the city -- and some of the rest of
America -- talking.</TE>
<TE>   Don Imus, who broadcasts his nationally syndicated radio talk show
from New York, recommended with characteristic restraint that Weill
be "hung by his toes."</TE>
<TE>   Winning points for creativity, Brooklyn-born Al Michaels even
worked in a reference to the controversy on ABC's "Monday Night
Football." Noting the St. Louis Rams' terrible start this season,
Michaels quipped: "Even Jack Grubman couldn't have made a cockamamie
'buy' recommendation on this team."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, three nannies pushing tots in strollers on 91st Street
said the brutal competition for preschool slots was nothing new in
that well-to-do neighborhood. "Money always talks," said one of the
trio, Jean Rowen.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Kolben, executive director of New York-based Child Care
Inc., a lobbying and referral agency, said the Grubman flap has put a
spotlight on a very real issue: the lack of adequate and affordable
preschool options for parents in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The waiting list for child-care subsidies in the city, she said,
is 30,000 families long, and even a subsidy doesn't guarantee that a
place will be available.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's talking about" the Grubman situation, Kolben said.
"This has caught the eye of people with children because they're
living it. And this story shows it isn't just poor people."</TE>
<TE>   Not far from the 92nd Street Y, a father with a backpack and a
salt-and-pepper goatee was walking with his 3-year-old. The boy
attends a less expensive nursery school, the man said, but the
admissions process is just as harrowing. "It's treacherous," he said.
"People will do anything."</TE>

<HD>Conseco Posts Wider Loss, Could Face Chapter 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Insurance firm Conseco Inc. on Tuesday reported a
larger-than-expected third-quarter loss and reiterated that its talks
with creditors to restructure more than $6 billion in debt may lead
to a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Carmel, Ind.-based Conseco also named William Shea as chief
executive, a role he assumed on an acting basis after Chairman Gary
Wendt stepped down as CEO last month.</LD>
<LD>   Conseco, whose purchase of mobile-home lender Green Tree Financial
Corp. in 1998 left it saddled with debt and bigger-than-expected loan
losses, has proposed converting some of its debt to equity, which
would give bondholders control of the firm.</LD>
<TE>   The company's losses climbed as a rising number of customers of
its finance unit were unable to pay back loans during the recession.
Conseco's insurance units also were hurt by the long bear market in
stocks and by low interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   The company posted a net loss of $1.8 billion, or $5.11 a share,
for the third quarter, significantly wider than the loss of $410.6
million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco has until Nov. 27 to reach an agreement with its
creditors, or waivers on its debt will expire. If an agreement with
creditors can be reached, "the company would present the plan for
judicial approval under Chapter 11" of U.S. bankruptcy laws, Conseco
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Conseco, which traded at $4.25 at the start of the year,
now change hands at about 5 cents in over-the-counter Bulletin Board
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company has hired financial advisors to help sell its Green
Tree unit, now called Conseco Finance, which Conseco said had a book
value of $1.2 billion as of Sept. 30. Conseco paid $6 billion for the
business four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   If Conseco is able to sell its finance unit, "there is potential
interest in its insurance operations," said Timothy Clark, an analyst
at Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   The latest loss included $1.2 billion in costs to write down the
value of securities and goodwill -- the difference between the price
paid for an acquisition and its book value.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco had investment losses of $277.8 million in the quarter and
absorbed a $140-million cost related to the sale of its variable
annuity business.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco's main insurance units -- Bankers National Life Insurance
Co. and Conseco Life Insurance Co. of Texas -- entered into a consent
agreement with Texas regulators that prevents the firm from taking
any money from its insurance units.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Delays Launch of Delta IV Rocket</HD>
<DH>Problems with a valve and high winds force the postponement
of first voyage. The company says it will try again today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. scrubbed the first launch of its Delta IV rocket Tuesday
and said it would try again today after a computer detected problems
with a valve that vents liquid oxygen from a rocket tank.</LD>
<LD>   Alarms detecting minor mechanical problems and high winds delayed
the launch Tuesday afternoon, frustrating about 1,500 Boeing
employees who sat through the delays as they watched the events
unfold on a giant outdoor screen in Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The scheduled launch at Cape Canaveral, Fla., was scrubbed with 2
minutes and 22 seconds left in the countdown, prompting a loud groan
from the engineers and employees in Huntington Beach who work on the
rocket. The launch was initially set for Saturday but was pushed back
to Tuesday because of a mechanical problem.</LD>
<TE>   "A valve that helps vent the liquid oxygen tank was not operating
properly," a Boeing spokesman said. "It seems to be a simple fix and
we're going to try again" today.</TE>
<TE>   The Delta IV, powered by the nation's first new rocket engine in
decades, is designed to compete with rival Lockheed Martin Corp. for
military and commercial satellite launches.</TE>

<HD>Another Boost for E-Books</HD>
<DH>OverDrive's service would make available more than 35,000
titles that can be lent online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with new technology, a leading distributor of electronic books
unveiled a service Tuesday allowing libraries to offer more than
35,000 titles that can be borrowed through the Internet and read on
portable devices.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by OverDrive Inc. of Cleveland offers a
much-needed boost to the nascent electronic-book industry, which has
been slow to make inroads with publishers and readers.</LD>
<LD>   Combined with a similar move last month by rival Fictionwise Inc.
of Chatham, N.J., the offering helps solve one of the main hurdles
for libraries that want to lend so-called e-books: They can't do so
without specialized technology and permission from publishers.</LD>
<TE>   The new services should help make strides in both of those areas,
executives of the two companies said, while also whetting the
public's appetite for e-books.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, their way of managing digital content also could
provide a model for libraries to loan other media via the Internet,
including music and movies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are many hurdles yet to overcome if the approach is
to be applied more widely.</TE>
<TE>   "Each medium has a different business model and a different
culture," so it's going to be a tough battle for libraries to obtain
the rights to lend digital movies and music through the Web, said
Frederick Weingarten, head of technology policy at the American
Library Assn.</TE>
<TE>   An e-book trades ink and paper for bits of computer data,
presenting each page as an electronic image. Like other electronic
media, e-books are governed by a different set of rules than printed
books or discs.</TE>
<TE>   When a library buys a physical copy of a book, federal copyright
law allows it to lend it, sell it or give it away without the
publisher's permission.</TE>
<TE>   It's not technically possible, however, for a library to lend an
e-book without making a digital copy of the original file. And under
federal law, libraries don't have the right to make that copy without
the publisher's OK.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, early e-book technologies locked the files to a
single computer or specialized device, making it difficult to lend
titles even if the publisher approved.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some libraries have managed to circulate e-books by
lending tablet-size devices loaded with multiple tomes -- an
expensive approach that puts a sharp limit on the number of patrons
who can be served at any given time.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including the Los Angeles Public Library, have used
technology from netLibrary, a division of the nonprofit Online
Computer Library Center, to let patrons read e-books on computers
connected to the Net.</TE>
<TE>   These approaches have made e-books far less appealing than
conventional books because they could be read only on a bulky
portable device or a stationary PC.</TE>
<TE>   To address those problems, Fictionwise and OverDrive adopted new
technologies that made it possible to duplicate digital files a
limited number of times. Each copy, in turn, could have a short
lifespan before it would automatically expire.</TE>
<TE>   When applied to e-books, those technologies might allow a library
that buys three copies of a title to loan it to three patrons for two
weeks at a time. Alternatively, libraries could enable each title to
be read 100 times before it expired electronically.</TE>
<TE>   With the technology in hand, the companies struck deals with
publishers to permit selected titles to be loaned out.</TE>
<TE>   OverDrive boasts deals that cover more than 35,000 titles from
more than 400 publishers, including several major ones. Fictionwise's
agreements cover about 2,000 titles from smaller publishers, although
it is close to deals with some major ones, said co-founder Steve
Pendergrast.</TE>
<TE>   About half a dozen libraries in North America are using
Fictionwise's new service, Pendergrast said. OverDrive expects to
have deals by the end of the year with five of the top libraries in
the United States, according to Ray Leach, senior vice president of
business development.</TE>
<TE>   Though the technology solves some of the fears at top publishing
houses about digital piracy, it doesn't clear up all of the
uncertainties about e-books.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers are still trying to find a business model that makes
sense for electronic-book lending, said Kate Tentler, vice president
and publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster Online, a subsidiary of Viacom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't necessarily feel we've come across the right one yet,"
she said.</TE>

second-highest level on record and was worse than economists
expected, while higher energy costs pushed up consumer prices in
October, government reports on Tuesday showed.</LD>
<LD>   The September U.S. trade deficit shrank just 0.7% to $38.03
billion from the record of $38.28 billion set in August, the Commerce
Department reported. But for the first nine months of this year the
deficit hit a new high, probably setting the stage for the worst U.S.
trade performance on record.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, consumers were hit by the biggest energy price increase
in six months, according to the Labor Department.</LD>
<TE>   In its latest report, the department said a 1.9% rise in energy
prices accounted for half of the overall October 0.3% advance in the
consumer price index, the government's closely watched gauge of
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the CPI was up a
moderate 0.2%, leaving economists with little worry that inflation
would be getting out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "Inflation is not a problem, but it is not completely tame," said
Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Though the September trade deficit was a slight improvement over
the previous month, the near-record figure renewed concerns that such
a trade imbalance could trigger a sharp fall in the dollar, which
already has declined 15% this year on a trade-weighted basis.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Department Undersecretary Kathleen Cooper said the data
would not have a big effect on third-quarter gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   The next estimate for the third quarter is scheduled to be
released next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the data that came out today will make much of a
change at all," she said, adding that higher oil prices, caused by
concern about a possible war with Iraq, continue to be a drag on the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The latest monthly trade deficit tally exceeded the average
estimate of $37.33 billion made by analysts surveyed before the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists were expecting imports to take a bigger tumble in
September after a jump in August as companies stockpiled goods in
anticipation of a dockworkers strike on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Ports were closed the last two days of September and the first
eight days of October because of a labor dispute between dockworkers
and port operators.</TE>
<TE>   However, imports totaled $120.19 billion in September, down just
0.5% from the year-to-date high of $120.78 billion in August.</TE>
<TE>   Exports, which rose steadily in the first half of 2002, declined
for the second consecutive month in September to $82.16 billion, down
0.4% from August, as the global economy struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said stockpiling ahead of the port labor dispute could
lead to narrowing of the trade deficit in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that August and September involved some
front-loading ahead of the dockworkers' ... [lockout], I would assume
the trade deficit in October is going to be quite a bit narrower,"
predicted Ram Bhagavatula, chief economist with Royal Bank Scotland
Financial Markets in New York.</TE>

<HD>EMI Profit Is Up; Sales Expected to Fall Short</HD>
<DH>Earnings jump for the first half after cost cuts. Revenue
for the year is expected to slip 6%.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>British music giant EMI Group swung to a first-half profit after a
dramatic cost-cutting drive, but the company said Tuesday that sales
for the year would fail to meet earlier projections.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which releases music by such acts as the Rolling
Stones and Coldplay, said net income for the six months ended Sept.
30 jumped to $218.6 million, or 5 cents a share, up from a loss of
$85.9 million, or 1 cent, for the same period a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   EMI executives said full-year sales for the recorded music
division would slip as much as 6%, scrapping their earlier prediction
that revenue would hold steady.</LD>
<TE>   EMI said the profit increase resulted from the restructuring
undertaken by Alain Levy, who was brought in to run the company's
recorded music division last year after an extended period of
management turmoil and failed merger efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks included eliminating 1,900 jobs, firing 400 artists
and severing money-losing deals with such labels as Blackground.</TE>
<TE>   EMI's overall revenue declined 9.9% to $1.5 billion. Sales for the
record division slid 12.4% to $1.1 billion, which Levy attributed to
the delay of album releases during the reorganization and to
counterfeiting and online piracy. EMI's music publishing division
posted a 4.1% sales increase.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firms Propose Trading Guidelines</HD>
<DH>The voluntary plan follows accusations of widespread market
manipulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Johnson</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp., Mirant Corp., Dynegy Inc. and other energy-trading
companies Tuesday proposed voluntary guidelines for disclosing risks
of buying and selling electricity and natural gas.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition of 31 energy companies said the new standards were
devised to make the industry more transparent for investors,
credit-rating companies and regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Federal energy, securities and commodities-trading regulators are
investigating sales and trading practices at energy companies after
profit restatements and disclosures of sham trades.</LD>
<TE>   Executives at Dynegy, CMS Energy Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc.
have resigned under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Mirant, Duke, Williams Cos. and others with energy-trading
businesses have been accused of manipulating markets, including a
tenfold increase in California power prices in 2000 and 2001. The
state's two largest utilities became insolvent buying electricity for
more than the law allowed them to charge customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think investors are going to ascribe any value to energy
trading until it's done under strict rules," said Donald Coxe, who
manages $450 million in assets at Harris Investment Management,
including shares of El Paso Corp. and Southern Co.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't just a couple of rotten apples," Coxe said. "This is a
rotten orchard."</TE>
<TE>   The committee's proposals include summarizing information in
tables to reflect companies' business activities for easy comparisons
and ensuring that risk and accounting officers have no involvement in
trading operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the industry's leadership in this," Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood III said through a spokesman.
"It's badly needed."</TE>
<TE>   The group also suggested using a trading clearinghouse to reduce
company collateral requirements and encourage trading by more
participants.</TE>
<TE>   This year, CMS, Dynegy and other energy companies said they made
"round-trip" trades, in which they simultaneously bought and sold
electricity and gas at the same price and quantity, in some cases to
inflate revenue or trading volume.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at our industry and the Enron fallout, we need to
do something as risk officers to provide more transparency and
improve the confidence in our industry," Mike Smith, Mirant's chief
risk officer, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's shares rose 16 cents to $18.66 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock has lost 52% of its value this year. Mirant fell
14 cents to $1.62 on the NYSE and is down 90% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Aquila Inc. and Williams, once two of the largest power and
natural-gas traders, aren't part of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies are getting out of the energy-trading business.</TE>

<HD>State Sees 8% Slide in Exports in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Slumping demand for high-tech equipment leads to a decline
in shipments year to date as well. Other key sectors record sharp
falloffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's exports slid more than 8% in the third quarter, led by
continued steep declines in shipments of technology equipment,
according to trade statistics released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   For the three months ended in September, California exports
totaled $22.9 billion, down from $25 billion in the same period a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Government trade statistics compiled by the Massachusetts
Institute for Social and Economic Research showed that the
year-to-date decline is even worse. Through the first nine months of
the year, California's exports plunged 16.2%, compared with a 7.3%
drop for the United States as a whole.</LD>
<TE>   The major culprit is the slump in demand for high-technology
goods, which account for nearly half of California's exports. The
Golden State shipped $30.2 billion in computers and electronic
products in the first nine months of the year, a 22.6% slide compared
with the first three quarters of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Two other sectors -- machinery and transportation equipment --
that make up California's Big Three export industries got hammered as
well. Through the first nine months of the year, exports of machinery
were off 17.4% to $7.1 billion. The transportation sector, which
includes commercial aircraft, tumbled 22.3% to $5.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Wilson, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, said the decline in California's technology exports
reflected a variety of factors, including a relatively strong dollar
that makes U.S. goods expensive overseas; work disruptions at West
Coast ports; a sluggish global economy that has weakened demand for
high-tech products; and the continued shifting of U.S. manufacturing
operations offshore, particularly to Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "The recession pushed companies to look harder at their
cost-cutting options, and a big one is outsourcing," Wilson said,
noting that many of the resulting job losses "are permanent."</TE>

<HD>Private Equity Fuels Growth of Small Calif. Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Halex Corp. is a world leader in manufacturing the lengths of
nail-studded plywood that hold wall-to-wall carpeting to the floor.
What is helping to hold Halex itself together, meanwhile, is private
equity capital.</LD>
<LD>   The Pomona company recently received $33 million in such financing
from investment firms in Bethesda, Md., and Chicago in a deal
brokered by Barrington Associates of Los Angeles. The money will
enable Halex's entrepreneurial owners to expand their line with other
products.</LD>
<LD>   It may be tough for companies to sell shares in the public market
or secure big bank loans these days, but private equity is pouring
across California.</LD>
<TE>   In the last 12 months, according to Barrington, some 2,000 private
equity transactions involving nearly $95 billion have been executed
by California financiers and others for the small- to medium-sized
firms that are the heartbeat of the state's economy. Some of these
investments are as tiny as $5 million to $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The less-glamorous cousins of high-tech venture capitalists,
players in the private equity market tend to invest in companies that
make and sell more mundane items. In L.A., they have quietly filled
the void left by the collapse of earlier forms of financing, from
junk bonds to initial stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Purveyors of private equity form "a stealth industry in Los
Angeles," says Michael Tennenbaum, who raised $900 million last
summer from investors in Asia, Europe and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Water Pik Technologies Inc., the Newport Beach-based maker of
electric toothbrushes, shower heads and swimming pool cleaning
products, needed to raise capital quickly three years ago when it was
spun off from Allegheny Technologies Inc. So it tapped Tennenbaum &amp;
Co., which invested $20 million for a 20% stake.</TE>
<TE>   When Tom Peterson, the inventor of urethane wheels for in-line
skates and the founder of Cypress-based Bravo Sports, wanted to cash
out in the late 1990s, he turned to private equity capital from Los
Angeles' Center Partners, which bought his firm for more than $20
million and then financed its expansion. Bravo Sports, with more than
$40 million in annual sales, now manufactures apparel and skateboards
and other equipment in Italy and Thailand, as well as in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Private equity also finances mergers and acquisitions among
smaller businesses, allowing them to be assembled into sizable
companies better able to compete nationally and globally.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Aurora Capital Partners, a Los Angeles firm led by
former Assistant Treasury Secretary Gerald Parsky, has put together a
highly competitive entrant in the packaging industry called Impaxx
Inc. In eight years, Vernon-based Impaxx has acquired 11 other
companies and now boasts more than $200 million in annual sales and
1,100 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Aurora Capital also has put together United Plastics Group Inc.,
which has 14 molding plants worldwide, including a major facility in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, Southern California pioneered private equity when
Leonard I. Green, who died last month, opened Leonard Green &amp;
Partners in Los Angeles in 1969. Over the decades, the firm has
backed everything from Thrifty Drug to El Segundo-based Big 5
Sporting Goods Corp. to San Diego-based Petco Animal Supplies Inc.</TE>
<TE>   And it is going stronger than ever. Four years ago, the Green firm
raised $1.2 billion from pension funds, banks and insurance companies
to invest in small- to medium-sized companies. This year, it has been
pulling together a similar fund, and by all accounts the response has
been even greater, adding up to almost $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   New York, Chicago and San Francisco still have bigger</TE>
<TE>   investment firms and bigger deals, mostly because of the
relatively small size of companies in this region.</TE>
<TE>   But Southern California is gaining -- and it's no mystery why. The
Southland is particularly rich in start-ups and family firms. It also
has 750,000 companies owned by new immigrants and ethnic minorities,
more than anyplace else in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more action" than ever before, says Alex Cappello of
Cappello Capital, a Santa Monica investment firm. "Money is flowing."</TE>
<TE>   What investors are looking for is simple: fat returns -- as much
as 30% annually, compounded over a five- to seven-year period. And
why can such profits be expected from smallish companies making and
selling perfectly banal products?</TE>
<TE>   Because new equity financing "unleashes possibilities that may not
be pursued as aggressively by the founding family owners," explains
investment banker James Freedman, managing partner of Barrington</TE>
<TE>   Associates. "It enables companies to grow."</TE>
<TE>   In an economy like Southern California's, which is constantly
changing and expanding with new people and new businesses, private
equity is the fuel powering things forward. Tennenbaum, a former Bear
Stearns investment banker, rightly calls the environment "yeasty."</TE>
<TE>   The dough, in other words, is rising.</TE>

<LD>Gateway Inc., maker of personal computers, joined with online music
service Listen.com Inc. on Tuesday to offer consumers subscriptions
for downloading songs from the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway is shipping desktop PCs with software that enables them to
subscribe to Listen.com for $9.95 a month. Customers can sample a
selection of 250,000 songs and record selected tracks onto compact
discs for 99 cents apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway, which posted losses in seven of the last eight quarters,
is trying to increase sales by offering customers new ways to use
computers. Listen.com offers co-branded versions of its service
through several companies, including cable television operator
Charter Communications Inc. and Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV.</LD>
<TE>   Closely held Listen.com competes with Pressplay and MusicNet.
Listen.com has contracts to provide music from five of the world's
largest music companies, Bertelsmann's BMG, EMI Group's EMI Recorded
Music, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment, Vivendi Universal's
Universal Music Group and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Poway, Calif.-based Gateway fell 23 cents to $3.51 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have dropped 56% this year.</TE>

<HD>Gymboree Net Income Jumps as Sales Rise 8%</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children's apparel retailer Gymboree Corp. on Tuesday reported a jump
in third-quarter earnings, helped by a strong increase in sales and
lower interest expense, as the company paid down debt.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer posted earnings for the third quarter ended Nov. 2 of
$6.3 million, or 21 cents a share, up from $1.8 million, or 6 cents,
a year earlier. The latest results included a one-time expense of a
penny a share due to the early repayment of the company's remaining
debt.</LD>
<LD>   The company backed its earlier guidance for the fiscal fourth
quarter and said it now expects full-year earnings of 75 cents to 77
cents a share. Analysts had expected 76 cents a share on average,
according to Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Sales rose 8% to $144.1 million. Same-store sales, or sales at
stores open for at least a year, rose 7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Burlingame-based company also said it expects fiscal-year 2003
earnings in the range of 92 cents to $1 a share. Analysts were
expecting 94 cents a share on average.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales for November are expected to be flat, but the
company reaffirmed its guidance for same-store sales in the quarter
to rise in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Gymboree raised its third-quarter earnings forecast to
a range of 18 cents to 20 cents a share. Analysts then raised their
estimates to an average of 20 cents, according to research firm
Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Gymboree stock fell 25 cents to close at $19.26 on Nasdaq.
Earnings were released after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>Home Depot Earnings Up 21%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc., the world's largest home-improvement retailer,
Tuesday reported a 21% rise in quarterly profit as it cut costs, but
a weak outlook sent its shares down 13%.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is revamping its business as chief rival Lowe's
Cos. moves into its most lucrative markets, said it expects earnings
for the current quarter to miss Wall Street consensus estimates by 1
cent a share.</LD>
<LD>   Home Depot also said sales for the full year will fall short of
longer-term growth goals.</LD>
<TE>   For the third quarter, Home Depot had net income of $940 million,
or 40 cents a share, compared with $778 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier. Sales rose 9% to $14.5 billion, aided by new stores and
strength in appliances, paint and flooring.</TE>
<TE>   Although profit for the quarter ended Nov. 3 was in line with
analysts' average estimate compiled by Thomson First Call, sales at
stores open at least a year, a key measure of retail performance,
fell 2%. In August, Home Depot had forecast a rise of 2% to 4% in
comparable-store sales.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot will not meet its longer-term sales growth goal of 15%
to 18% this year, Chairman Robert Nardelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot's results contrasted sharply with Lowe's, which Monday
topped Wall Street estimates with a 35% increase in third-quarter
profit and said fourth-quarter earnings will beat analyst forecasts
as a strong housing market lifts sales.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot has centralized merchandising, consolidated regional
divisions, cut full-time payroll and is overhauling its technology
systems to improve profitability.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got one company which is continuing to execute the
business plan it's had for years in Lowe's, whereas Home Depot is in
a period of repositioning its business," Midwest Research analyst
Eric Bosshard said. "As a result, things at Home Depot are getting
worse before they get better."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Atlanta-based Home Depot fell $3.69 to $24.91 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>H&amp;R Block Will Give Coupons to Settle Suit Over Refund
Loans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>H&amp;R Block Inc. said Tuesday that it would give 700,000 customers
rebate coupons for tax preparation services to settle a class-action
lawsuit in Texas over loans given in advance of tax refunds.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which also covers the plaintiffs' legal fees,
removed uncertainty about the company's potential legal liabilities.
Its ailing shares jumped as much as 12%.</LD>
<LD>   The Kansas City, Mo.-based tax preparer, which has seen its shares
drop by as much as a third this month largely on its legal troubles,
said it would take a pretax charge of $41.7 million, or 14 cents a
share, against results for its second quarter ended Oct. 31 because
of the settlement.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice for them to have this out of the way," Morningstar
analyst Rachel Barnard said. "This has been weighing on the share
price pretty severely."</TE>
<TE>   Block said the settlement, for which court approval is pending,
would apply to all related suits in Texas stemming from its lack of
disclosure of licensing and marketing fees it received from Household
International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A banking subsidiary of Household issued high-interest loans to
Block customers who wanted to receive their expected tax refund money
immediately, rather than wait weeks for the government to process
their returns.</TE>
<TE>   Block said the settlement was separate from a $25-million
settlement in Illinois awaiting court approval that also involves the
loans.</TE>
<TE>   Block shares rose $2.35, or 7%, to $37.53 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Kodak Banking on Celluloid Having a Lot More Moments</HD>
<DH>The release of its Vision2 line comes amid rapid
encroachment of digital technology, but most cinematographers still
prefer to use film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As digital technology lures television and movie productions away
from celluloid, film giant Eastman Kodak Co. released Tuesday a new
type of film stock aimed squarely at movie makers in an aggressive
bid to protect its $1-billion entertainment business and keep its
most critical customers loyal.</LD>
<LD>   For Kodak, Hollywood is home, a land where film has long ruled the
day-to-day lives of generations of movie artists. The Rochester,
N.Y.-based company has spent nearly a decade wrestling with a digital
revolution, attempting to remake itself into a high-tech business
without completely undermining its traditional focus.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of Kodak's best businesses, with the highest market
share and it's most loyal customers," said Peter Ausnit, an equity
analyst with Deutsche Bank. "Clearly, digital imaging is having some
impact on Kodak now. Their long-term outlook is incredibly
challenging."</LD>
<TE>   Kodak's worldwide sales to customers in the entertainment industry
dropped 4% over the first nine months of 2002, compared with the same
period a year earlier, according to its financial statements. Company
executives blame the drop not just on changing technology, but also
on the stalled economy and the threat of Hollywood union strikes in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It is no secret Kodak is a company in transition," Daniel Carp,
Kodak's chairman and chief executive, told Wall Street investors and
analysts at a New York conference this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The new Vision2 line -- a high-speed camera negative film that is
particularly good for night shoots -- is designed to address
complaints that cinematographers had made in the last few years,
Kodak said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping influential cinematographers such as Allen Daviau happy is
crucial to Kodak's future success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that they meet our needs," said Daviau, a
five-time Oscar nominee whom Kodak tapped to test its new film line.
"Sure, we'd use the digital camera for certain things. But our
heart's with film."</TE>
<TE>   Simple economics is driving some productions to give up film,
particularly in the television world. This fall, the major networks
have 37 programs -- nearly 30% of their prime-time lineup -- shot
with high-definition digital cameras, with more on the way at
midseason. Last year only three shows were shot this way.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is price. Typical 35mm film stock costs around 50 cents
a foot, according to Ed Nassour, senior vice president of TV
post-production at 20th Century Fox Film Corp. For Kodak's Vision
color film, one of its most popular lines and the precursor to
Vision2, that translates into nearly $58 per minute of shooting.</TE>
<TE>   A big-budget action movie with lots of live-action stunts can
easily go through 300,000 feet of film, an expense of $175,000 or
more. Developing and processing add even more costs, Nassour said.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, digital cameras often record images on inexpensive
videotape. A typical 40-minute tape for a digital camera runs about
$27. That works out to about 68 cents a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Even advocates of film acknowledge that celluloid eats up a big
chunk of a movie's budget. On the last project that cinematographer
Remi Adefarasin shot, the feature movie "Johnny English," the crew
used nearly 655,000 feet of film.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "film has a magic that digital just doesn't have
right now," said Adefarasin, who plans to use the new Vision2 stock
on his next project.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, shooting digitally comes with its own set of problems. The
current high-definition cameras are bulkier and capture less detail
than 35mm film cameras. They also present a new set of creative and
technical challenges -- for example, they have trouble handling
sunlight streaming through windows -- and they tend to deliver a
harsher look than film, cinematographers say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know one cinematographer who would choose digital over
film," said cinematographer Conrad W. Hall, who has worked on such
films as "Panic Room" and "A Gentleman's Game." Cost-conscious
"producers choose digital over film."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to impress the cinematographer community -- and, in turn,
put more pressure on producers -- Kodak said it regularly polls
artists on their technology needs and asks them to test new film
stocks months before they hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who know what they want and need," said Eric
Rodli, president of Kodak's entertainment imaging division, which is
based in Los Angeles. "We've been testing this film [Vision2] quietly
with them for the past nine months."</TE>
<TE>   Though Kodak's traditional film business will remain its core, the
company has made an aggressive push into the digital realm.
Generally, it has focused on the display and printing side of the
process. It also has developed plans to begin selling its
digital-cinema projection system early next year for about $100,000
per screen.</TE>
<TE>   Yet its plans have stalled, just as they have for other equipment
manufacturers. Their hurdles include the exorbitant cost it would
take to retrofit tens of thousands of movie screens with the
high-tech projectors, and a reluctance among theater owners to invest
in equipment that has no industry standard and could easily become
outdated.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slip for Second Straight Session</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street ended mostly lower Tuesday for a second straight session,
despite Iraq's pledge to meet a Dec. 8 deadline to produce a full
account of its weapons program.</LD>
<LD>   Oil prices pulled back after Iraq's announcement, but the stock
market failed to extend an early rally.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average eased 11.79 points, or 0.1%, to
8,474.78. The Nasdaq composite lost 19.18 points, or 1.4%, to
1,374.51.</LD>
<TE>   Home Depot, one of the 30 Dow stocks, weighed on the market after
the retailer said full-year sales growth will fall short of its
targets. Home Depot slid $3.69 to $24.91.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we have been convinced about is the strength of the
consumer. When we have a marquee company like Home Depot giving
slightly downward guidance, it gives us the fear that the U.S.
consumer is running out of steam," said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The news from the retail sector wasn't all bad. Staples surged
$2.16 to $18.39 after the office-supplies retailer said third-quarter
earnings jumped 40%, and that it expects faster-than-expected growth
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Early Tuesday, stocks enjoyed some upward momentum after Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Council on Foreign Relations
that financial innovations have helped the United States and the
world to absorb the loss of $8 trillion of wealth in the U.S. stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow traded as high as 8,546 before falling back.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 19 to 14 on Nasdaq -- the same ratios as Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, near-term crude oil futures traded as high
as $27.08 a barrel, then slid following the Iraq news to close at
$26.42, down 29 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market Treasury yields were little changed.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retail shares were mostly lower, apparently hurt by Home Depot.
Lowe's, a key rival of Home Depot, slid $1.72 to $38.98. Other losers
included Wal-Mart Stores, down 76 cents to $52.92, and Target, which
eased 28 cents to $31.30.</TE>
<TE>   Also, BJ's Wholesale Club slumped $3.74 to $18.36. The East Coast
warehouse-club retailer said weaker consumer spending is hurting its
outlook. Brokerage A.G. Edwards downgraded the stock to "sell."</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks, which have mostly been in decline for the last
two months, staged a rally even though worries about war with Iraq
may have faded somewhat. Alliant Techsystems jumped $2.42 to $58.50,
Lockheed Martin gained $1.95 to $51.25 and L-3 Communications added
$1.30 to $43.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Some tech leaders were under pressure. Microsoft lost $1.02 to
$54.83, Intel was off 40 cents to $18.15 and Amazon.com tumbled $1.13
to $21.29. Brokerage Bear Stearns downgraded Amazon to "peer perform"
from "outperform," citing expectations of slowing growth.</TE>
<TE>   * In the energy sector Dynegy jumped 58 cents to $1.35 after Chief
Executive Bruce Williamson said the firm should generate enough cash
to meet almost $2 billion of debt obligations next year and avoid
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   * In the health-care sector, AmerisourceBergen dropped $4.40 to
$59, and Cardinal Health lost $3.20 to $64.70. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
analyst Christopher McFadden cut the two largest U.S. drug
wholesalers to "in-line" from "outperform," citing slowing growth in
drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   * In foreign trading Japan's Topix stock index, a broad index of
shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 0.8% to 817.09, its lowest
level since 1984, as investors continued to dump bank stocks. But the
blue-chip Nikkei index inched up 0.2% to 8,365.26.</TE>

<HD>Blackstone Group to Buy TRW Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearing a major hurdle in its proposed purchase of rival military
contractor TRW Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp. said Tuesday that it has
agreed to sell TRW's auto parts business to a New York-based private
equity firm for $4.73 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The sale to Blackstone Group, which manages the world's largest
buyout fund, is expected to make the $7.8-billion TRW acquisition
more palatable to Northrop shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on
the TRW purchase next month.</LD>
<LD>   Century City-based Northrop, which develops military aircraft,
electronics and computer software, mainly wants TRW's space and
defense electronics business and had been looking to sell or spin off
other TRW operations, including the debt-ridden auto parts unit.</LD>
<TE>   The auto parts sale is dependent upon the completion of Northrop's
acquisition of TRW, which is awaiting antitrust review by the Defense
and Justice departments.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop expects the deal to be approved by year's end. If
completed it would make Northrop the nation's second-largest defense
contractor, surpassing Boeing Co. and rivaling Lockheed Martin Corp.,
amid one of the largest defense buildups in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   TRW had recently sold its aircraft components unit for $1.5
billion. Northrop said it would use the proceeds from both sales to
pare down debt that would be incurred from the TRW purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "As we've maintained, Northrop Grumman's strategic interest is in
TRW's space, electronics and systems businesses," said Northrop
Chairman Kent Kresa, in a statement. "We believe that our agreement
with Blackstone is an attractive transaction for our shareholders and
will allow our management team to quickly focus its full attention on
integrating TRW's portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Although Northrop was hoping for an outright sale of the auto
parts business, it will still retain a 20% equity interest in the
auto parts business, which was intended to be picked up by another
private equity firm, Carlyle Group.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based firm recently pulled out of a joint bid with
Blackstone, leaving the portion to Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives still hope to sell the remaining interest once
the TRW acquisition is completed. Investors seemed pleased by the TRW
auto parts sale, which includes $3.76 billion in cash, $600 million
in debt securities and a $368-million equity interest in the unit.
Northrop shares Tuesday rose $2.95 to $90.41 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   With about $10 billion in revenue, TRW's auto parts business ranks
among the top 10 suppliers. Based in Livonia, Mich., the unit makes
steering systems, brakes, air bags and seat belts.</TE>

<HD>Quiksilver to Buy Out Overseas Licensees</HD>
<DH>The casual and sport apparel maker says it is seeking
worldwide control of its brand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sportswear maker Quiksilver Inc., expanding control over its brand
globally with its biggest acquisition to date, said Tuesday that it
will buy its Australian and Japanese licensees in a stock and cash
deal worth $93 million.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the fiscal implications, the acquisition of Ug
Manufacturing Co. in Australia and Quiksilver Japan has historical
and personal significance for the Huntington Beach-based Quiksilver
because the primary sellers are John Law and Alan Green, who
co-founded the Quiksilver brand in Australia in 1969. The pair own
most of Ug and about half of the Japanese licensee.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the announcement, Quiksilver boosted its 2003 earnings
projections to $1.75 to $1.79 a share from $1.71 a share and
increased its revenue forecast to $840 million to $860 million from
$770 million. Analysts were expecting to learn more about the
acquisition and its implications during a conference call today.</LD>
<TE>   "At first glance, it certainly sounds like a great move for these
guys, establishing tighter control over the global brand," said
Jeffrey Klinefelter, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
"From a financial perspective, it looks good."</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition -- Quiksilver's fifth since March 2000 -- is
important partly because it helps extend the company's global reach,
allowing it to consolidate operations and expand sales in Japan,
where Quiksilver brand beachwear and other casual apparel is
fledgling, Quiksilver President Bernard Mariette said. "From our
point of view, this deal really makes Quiksilver global," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver said it intends to expand its prominence in the Asia
Pacific region by replicating the growth strategy it used in Europe,
where sales have grown more than ninefold in 10 years. Quiksilver
expects the newly added Asia Pacific territories to grow 10% to 20%
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Green and Law will become advisors to the company. They also will
be among the company's largest shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver said about 75% of the purchase will be paid in
restricted stock. The remainder will be funded with cash on hand and
short-term borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver's stock rose 24 cents to $24.98 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The announcement was made after the markets closed.</TE>

<HD>BMG to Roll Out Royalty Plan</HD>
<DH>The move could help ease the controversy over the
industry's accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breaking ranks with industry rivals, Bertelsmann Music Group today
will launch what the company calls a "fairer, more transparent"
accounting system for royalty payments, a move that artist
representatives say could ease the controversy over whether
performers are being cheated by their labels.</LD>
<LD>   BMG, home to such acts as Carlos Santana, OutKast and Britney
Spears, is the first major music company to scrap contract deductions
that artists say obfuscate their earnings. The action comes as
lawmakers in California and New York have begun to scrutinize
complaints from pop stars about questionable accounting practices in
the industry.</LD>
<LD>   "One reason this industry has ended up with such a bad image is
because we could not look a guy in the eye and tell him, as a
partner, that the contract he was about to sign was fair," said BMG
Chairman Rolf Schmidt-Holtz. "This is the first step in a larger plan
by BMG to redefine our partnership with artists."</LD>
<TE>   In the years ahead, BMG plans to introduce a new contract model
under which the company would control an act's recording career for
fewer years but share in a series of new revenue streams, including
concert proceeds and sponsorship and film deals. BMG already is
designing a new agreement that is expected to reduce the number of
pages in a standard contract from 100 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, BMG's royalty revisions are not expected to result in
higher royalty payments to artists. But BMG executives say the new
plan will simplify royalty computations, making it easier for artists
to determine what they are owed.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four other music giants -- Universal Music Group, Sony
Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and EMI Group -- intends to
follow suit any time soon. Still, each is reviewing new approaches to
royalty accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The standard industry contract is riddled with deductions devised
during an era when vinyl recordings dominated the music business:</TE>
<TE>   * The "packaging" deduction, which costs artists about 25% of
their earnings, got its start in the early 1960s when companies began
replacing the plain brown sleeves protecting 45-rpm singles with
color-printed covers.</TE>
<TE>   * The "new technology" deduction is a two-decade-old clause that
allows labels to subtract an additional 20% from artist earnings to
help companies defray the cost of their investment in CD technology.</TE>
<TE>   * For more than 20 years, the "free goods" deduction has given
labels the right to take an additional 20% from artist earnings to
cover the cost of furnishing retailers with free CDs as an incentive
to showcase the product in busy areas of stores.</TE>
<TE>   "The current royalty system is incredibly opaque and difficult to
unravel and audit, and I think that clearly disadvantages artists,"
said BMG Chief Operating Officer Michael Smellie. "You wouldn't
accept a statement like this from your bank -- documentation that you
could neither make heads or tails of. We decided it was time for us
to simplify the royalty statements we send to our artists."</TE>
<TE>   Under its new accounting plan, BMG will stop computing royalties
based on the suggested retail price of a CD and begin paying artists
a percentage of the wholesale price received from retailers.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, an artist with a 12% royalty based on the suggested
retail price of $17.98 per CD typically earns about $1 -- after the
company extracts a bevy of deductions. Under BMG's plan, the same
artist will receive a 9% royalty based on the wholesale price of
$11.41 per CD, with no deduction, still receiving about $1.</TE>
<TE>   The standard contract contains a provision permitting a music
label to revise its accounting methods as long as the artist receives
no less in earnings.</TE>
<TE>   BMG expects some backlash from artists who may be reluctant to see
their royalty percentage, on paper, reduced. Artist representatives
say some acts like to brag about artificially inflated royalty rates.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened three decades ago at Motown Records,
according to attorney Donald S. Passman, author of "All You Need to
Know About the Music Business."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Motown sought to simplify its bookkeeping with
a similar wholesale-based royalty system but was forced to abandon
the plan after competitors used it to woo away acts, Passman said.
Artists seemed to prefer signing with labels that promised higher
royalties -- even though their contracts contained numerous
deductions that sometimes resulted in royalty earnings less than
Motown's.</TE>
<TE>   Passman applauded BMG's new royalty effort. "Everything in this
business would be so much simpler if all the companies got rid of
these deductions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Music industry accountant Phil Ames, who has performed thousands
of audits for numerous recording artists, agreed. "It's exactly what
artists are crying out for," he said. "In theory, if it became a
universal practice, there would be little reason for artists to ever
conduct audits."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what BMG hopes to achieve. Privately, BMG
executives say they plan to eventually install a secure Web site for
royalty accounts so each act can monitor what it is owed.</TE>
<TE>   "First we must simplify the royalty process, then the entire
contract," Schmidt-Holtz said. "This is one way we can show artists
that we are serious about improving our relationships with them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   New formula, same results</TE>
<TE>   Under its new accounting plan, BMG will simplify royalty
computations on CDs and make it easier for artists to determine what
they are owed.</TE>
<TE>   Example of current calculation:</TE>
<TE>   Royalty is based on 12% of suggested retail CD price of $17.98,
but with the following deductions:</TE>
<TE>   $17.98 minus $4.50 (25% packaging deduction)</TE>
<TE>   $13.48 becomes price for royalties</TE>
<TE>   12% (royalty rate) minus 2.4 pts. (Technology deduction) = 9.6%
(effective royalty rate)</TE>
<TE>   $13.48 x 9.6% = $1.29, minus $0.26 (20% free goods* deduction) =
$1.03 per-unit royalty</TE>
<TE>   Example of new calculation:</TE>
<TE>   $11.41 (wholesale unit price) x 9% = $1.03 per-unit royalty</TE>
<TE>   *Free CDs given to retailers</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Activision Inc., a Santa Monica-based publisher of video and computer
games, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an option to
raise $750 million in stock, $250 million of which would be used
solely for acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Company spokeswoman Maryanne Lataif said executives have not
decided when they will exercise the option, nor have they outlined
any plans to use the money raised. She also declined to comment on
any acquisition plans for Activision, which has bought five companies
in the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Activision now has $1.3 billion in available capital, which would
let the company make a viable bid for most video game companies, said
analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities.</LD>

<HD>U.S.-Singapore Trade Pact to Aid California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some California technology firms will enjoy lower tariffs and
streamlined customs processing under a wide-ranging free-trade
agreement announced Tuesday between the U.S. and Singapore.</LD>
<LD>   The pact, the first for the United States in Asia, is expected to
bolster U.S. efforts to create a free-trade zone across the southeast
part of the continent, already the third-largest market for U.S.
goods.</LD>
<LD>   Expanding U.S. commercial relations in Asia is particularly good
news for California, the leading gateway for Pacific trade.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to helping Silicon Valley firms such as Solectron
Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which use Singapore as a
regional base and production platform, the agreement expands access
to the Asian city-state for banks, insurance companies and law firms.
Singapore has been hit hard by the slump in the U.S. economy but its
citizens are still the wealthiest in Asia behind the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S.-Singapore trade agreement should improve ease of
transport, customs controls and potentially lower tariff rates for
Solectron," said Birgit Johnston, a spokeswoman for the Milpitas,
Calif., chip maker, which has five sites in Singapore, including its
Asia headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore, which conducted $33 billion in trade with the U.S. last
year, already attracts twice as much U.S. investment as China and
buys 2 1/2 times as many U.S. goods as its much larger Asian
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, speaking Tuesday in
Singapore, said, he hoped to get the deal to Congress before the end
of the year. Congress has 90 days to act.</TE>
<TE>   Though the United States has hundreds of bilateral agreements
involving relatively narrow matters of international commerce, this
is the first time it has negotiated a comprehensive free-trade
agreement with an Asian country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has preferred to focus instead on global trade
arrangements. It has signed free-trade pacts only with Israel and
Jordan and -- through the North American Free Trade Agreement -- with
Mexico and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Zoellick has been aggressively pursuing bilateral trade pacts
around the world. Also in the works are accords with Chile, Australia
and Central America and expansion of NAFTA throughout Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Though the details were not disclosed, Zoellick's office said the
Singapore deal requires increased transparency in the handling of
investment disputes and provides protection for labor and the
environment. The governments agreed to accept monetary fines in cases
in which there are violations of labor or environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   Given the lack of contentious issues in the U.S.-Singapore
economic relationship, trade experts said they expect the pact to be
approved.</TE>
<TE>   By sealing a deal with Singapore, the U.S. increases the pressure
on Indonesia and other neighboring countries anxious to keep access
to the U.S. market. Last month, the Bush administration launched the
Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative, which is viewed as a precursor to a
regional free-trade agreement in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, is the
regional political and economic group. In addition to Singapore,
ASEAN's members are Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand,
Vietnam, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Singapore trade agreement takes a step toward regional
integration, extending duty-free status to electronics components
produced in two nearby Indonesian islands, Batam and Bintan, that
have become low-cost production platforms for U.S. technology firms
such as Solectron and Seagate Technology Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "ASEAN will be the nexus for trade-opening in Asia," said Ernest
Bower, president of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, a Washington
group. "This was strategically smart for the U.S. and Singapore to
reach out to Indonesia in this way."</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore trade pact also bolsters the U.S. stake in Southeast
Asia at a time when China has become an increasingly active player.</TE>
<TE>   "China right now has a very forward-looking trade policy and it's
trying to negotiate an ASEAN-wide free-trade area of its own," said
Edward Gresser, a trade expert at the Progressive Policy Institute in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its bigger ambitions, the U.S. appears to have
scored a victory in its battle to open up the wealthy Asian
city-state to U.S. chewing gum manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Zoellick said his negotiators had gotten a "modest entry point"
for firms such as Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. but he would not elaborate.
Executives at the Chicago-based company would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore government banned the import and sale of gum in 1992
after several incidents in which wads of gum were stuck on subway
doors and disrupted service.</TE>

<HD>Syncor Finds More Payments</HD>
<DH>The probe discloses $500,000 in illegal transactions in
Taiwan. Cardinal may get $24 million if merger fails.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Syncor International Corp., which is investigating suspected bribes
by its overseas units, said Tuesday that its Taiwan operation made
$500,000 in apparently illegal payments to customers in the last five
years.</LD>
<LD>   Woodland Hills-based Syncor also said a committee of its outside
directors turned up "questionable payments and other transactions" in
at least six other countries, which it said may have violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. laws.</LD>
<LD>   In its third-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Syncor also said the directors' committee is scrutinizing
"certain limited aspects" of Syncor's U.S. operations, but declined
to elaborate on that probe. And it added that changes in payments for
Medicare and Medicaid services could negatively affect its revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the disclosures did little to calm the worries
surrounding Syncor, the leading provider of radioactive diagnostic
tools and medicines. The biggest uncertainty is whether the company
can complete its planned merger with Cardinal Health Inc., a deal
shareholders are supposed to vote on Dec. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal, an Ohio-based drug wholesaler, had agreed to buy Syncor
because of the strength of its U.S. operations. But it put the
acquisition on hold after Cardinal investigators turned up the
questionable foreign payments. Cardinal didn't return phone calls
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The latest news "seems to take the problems to a new level," said
Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, an independent New York
investor advisory firm that doesn't own stakes in the companies it
covers.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor disclosed the questionable payments two weeks ago, saying
it had alerted the SEC and the Department of Justice. In the latest
filing, it characterized the settlement discussion with the SEC and
federal prosecutors as "advanced," saying it has set aside $2.5
million to pay fines. But it said it could offer no assurances that
the $2.5 million would be enough.</TE>
<TE>   It also said it may have to pay as much as $24 million to Cardinal
if the merger, which is supposed to close Dec. 31, falls through.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, Syncor "still believes the conditions of the
merger will be satisfied," said Allan Mayer of Sitrick &amp; Co., a
public relations firm hired by Syncor that specializes in crisis
management.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing, Syncor also reported a third-quarter loss of $28.5
million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of $192.2 million, contrasted
with net income of $7.8 million, or 29 cents, on revenue of $149.8
million in the third quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor's stock fell 50% in the days after the investigation of the
overseas payments was made public, although it subsequently regained
some of the lost ground. On Tuesday, it fell 82 cents to $24.41 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's news came after the market closed. Syncor's stock fell
to $22 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Union Seeks CalPERS Review of Tenet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ronald d. white</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A labor union that has been locked in contentious organizing efforts
with hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp. succeeded Tuesday in
getting time to air its concerns about the company at the next
meeting of the California Public Employees' Retirement System in
December.</LD>
<LD>   The Service Employees International Union asked the giant
retirement system to review health-care practices and costs at the
nation's No. 2 hospital chain.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, as the nation's second-largest purchaser of health
insurance, wields considerable influence in the state's health-care
market. The pension fund recently outlined a strategy to try to cut
health-care costs by focusing on hospitals and physician groups.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, is the subject of a federal audit
of its huge revenue derived from a particular form of Medicare
reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   And last month, the FBI raided a Tenet hospital in Redding, where
two doctors are being investigated for allegedly performing
unnecessary heart operations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Tenet's current troubles may keep it from pursuing
its acquisition strategy. A hospital in Slidell, La., signed a deal
last month to be sold to Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet was sending representatives for a meeting today with the
board of directors of Slidell Memorial Hospital, whose members have
expressed concerns about recent news involving Tenet.</TE>

<HD>Groups Endorse Title Insurance Alternative</HD>
<DH>Consumer advocates ask a judge to overturn the state's ban
on cheaper lien protection policies offered by Radian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two consumer groups are seeking to end California's ban on a cheaper
alternative to title insurance, a move that could save a typical
homeowner hundreds of dollars when refinancing a mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based Community Financial Resource Center and the
National Community Reinvestment Coalition in Washington have asked an
administrative law judge in Sacramento to rule that it is legal to
sell so-called lien protection insurance in California.</LD>
<LD>   The one company that was selling lien protection policies on
mortgage refinance loans in California -- Radian Insurance of
Pennsylvania -- was slapped with a cease-and-desist order by the
California Department of Insurance this year. The ban prohibited
Radian from selling the policies in any state, not just California.</LD>
<TE>   Radian appealed the decision. The administrative law judge is
hearing arguments in the dispute and probably will decide next month
whether lien protection coverage violates state law.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer groups favor lien protection insurance because it is
much cheaper than traditional title insurance, which is required by
mortgage lenders because it protects them if problems develop over
the title to a property because of an undisclosed lien -- arising
from a tax debt, for example, or a local building permit dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The typical title insurance policy on a $150,000 refinance loan
costs $600 to $1,000, according to the reinvestment coalition's legal
filing. Radian's product would cost about $325.</TE>
<TE>   In the booming refinance business -- more than $1 trillion in
loans was refinanced in 2001, according to the Mortgage Bankers Assn.
-- that cost disparity amounts to more than $1 billion in additional
costs shouldered by consumers, said John Taylor, chief executive of
the reinvestment coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the country is looking to see what California does in
this instance," said Forescee Hogan-Rowles, president and chief
executive of the Los Angeles organization. "This ruling could impact
consumers in almost every state."</TE>
<TE>   "The insurance commissioner took a very strong position against
what we feel is a consumer-driven product," she said. "We want to see
the administrative law judge overturn that position."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of alternatives to title insurance when refinancing a
loan costs California consumers about $395 million a year, Taylor
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the dispute is a 1907 statute that bars title
insurers from providing any other type of insurance in the state,
said Scott Edelen, deputy insurance commissioner for the California
Department of Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of states have similar provisions, said Jim Maher,
executive vice president of the American Land Title Assn., a
Washington trade group for the title insurance industry. The ALTA is
fighting Radian's entry into territory typically reserved for title
insurers.</TE>
<TE>   The California Insurance Department ban on Radian's product is
based on the state's ruling that lien protection insurance is simply
title insurance in disguise. For Radian to offer it, Edelen said, the
firm must give up its mortgage insurance business or get the state
Legislature to change the law.</TE>
<TE>   Radian argues that lien protection is a new product that is more
like mortgage insurance than title coverage. But because it includes
a lien provision and can be purchased in lieu of title insurance,
California insurance regulators have banned it.</TE>
<TE>   Radian is the only company offering this type of insurance on
mortgage refinance loans. However, half a dozen insurers are offering
similar, title-like policies on home equity loans and second
mortgages, the ALTA's Maher said. If the Radian suit goes in the
title industry's favor, the ALTA will begin to pursue these companies
too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We object to all of it, but in terms of allocating our limited
resources, when Radian moved into the refinance arena, this caught
our attention more rapidly," he said. "When we finally resolve the
Radian situation, assuming it's favorable to our point of view, we
will go back and raise objections to the other products."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Is Target of Formal SEC Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal disclosed Tuesday that U.S. regulators were
ratcheting up their investigation of the company.</LD>
<LD>   The French media giant said the Securities and Exchange
Commission's preliminary inquiry had evolved into a formal
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The widely expected development gives the agency authority to
subpoena financial records and former Vivendi officers for testimony.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi said it would cooperate fully with the investigation,
which is being coordinated with a criminal probe by the U.S.
attorney's office in New York.</TE>
<TE>   French prosecutors also have launched an investigation of whether
the company published false information in the last two years to
conceal its cash crisis from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations center on the issue of whether Vivendi under
then-Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier misled investors about a
financial crisis in the company this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Messier was ousted after Vivendi spent $77 billion over three
years to transform a water utility into a giant media company with
assets that include Universal's movie studio, theme parks and leading
music labels.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues, authorities are investigating allegations that
Messier misled investors by issuing a statement June 26 denying that
Vivendi faced liquidity problems, sources familiar with the
investigations said.</TE>
<TE>   One week later, Messier was ousted and new CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou
declared that Vivendi was on the verge of defaulting on its bank
loans.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities also are expected to focus on a series of stock
transactions Messier reportedly made to bolster Vivendi's lagging
share price without consulting Vivendi's board of directors and
former Chief Financial Officer Guillaume Hannezo, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Williams-Sonoma Earnings Soar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Delbert Ellerton</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. said Tuesday that its third-quarter profit more
than tripled as the company introduced a credit card and sold more
furniture. Profit this year will be higher than the retailer
expected.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $15.1 million, or 13 cents a share, from $3.85
million, or 3 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue in the
three months ended Nov. 3 rose 14% to $527.9 million from $462.1
million.</LD>
<LD>   Williams-Sonoma introduced a credit card for shoppers at its
Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores and sold more lamps, beds,
comforters, pillows and nursery furniture. Chief Executive Dale
Hilpert has been shedding slow-selling merchandise and cutting costs
by working with suppliers to get some inventory delivered directly to
stores. That has improved availability of popular items.</LD>
<TE>   "They feed the stores with new merchandise on a monthly basis,"
said Kristine Koerber, an analyst at WR Hambrecht &amp; Co. who rates the
shares a "buy" and said she doesn't own them. "It keeps the
merchandise fresh." Consumers returned less merchandise, and the
company increased revenue from shipping fees, Hilpert said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma shares rose 35 cents to $23.70 in New York Stock
Exchange trading. They have risen 24% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Full-year profit will be $1.03 or $1.04 a share, higher than the
company's previous forecast of $1 to $1.02, Williams-Sonoma said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected the San Francisco-based company to earn 10 cents
a share in the third quarter and $1.02 for the year, the average
estimates in a Thomson First Call survey.</TE>
<TE>   The company had 477 stores as of Nov. 3, up from 412 in October
2001. Sales at stores open a year or more rose 2.8% in the quarter,
after declining 1.1% a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>SEC Member Pushes Biggs for New Board</HD>

<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Biggs, a former pension fund executive who was rejected by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to run the nation's new accounting
oversight board, still should be considered for the position, SEC
Commissioner Harvey J. Goldschmid said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC, in a contentious vote last month, chose former federal
judge William H. Webster to head the accounting panel, which was
created by Congress in the aftermath of this year's corporate
accounting scandals.</LD>
<LD>   But Webster resigned this month after a controversy over his role
as head of the audit committee of a small company that has been
accused of shareholder fraud.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy also led to the resignation of SEC Chairman Harvey
L. Pitt, who had championed Webster's nomination and opposed Biggs.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Goldschmid, who has long supported Biggs
for the accounting board, said he remained a "superb candidate."</TE>
<TE>   "Biggs should remain a leading contender," Goldschmid said. He
also said he would support Paul A. Volcker if the former Federal
Reserve chief were willing to take the job. Volcker has said he
doesn't want the job.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC must choose a new chairman of the accounting panel, but
the decision is expected to be made only after President Bush names a
new SEC chairman.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Seek Curbs on Corporate Auditors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, the SEC on Tuesday proposed new rules governing
corporate accounting, including a plan to bar auditors from providing
corporate clients with consulting services that may pose conflicts of
interest.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals implement prohibitions against auditors providing
information technology and eight other consulting services that were
detailed in a federal corporate governance law enacted in July.</LD>
<LD>   Companies' audit committees also would have to give advance
approval to tax services and other consulting by auditors not
specifically barred by the law.</LD>
<TE>   "Spectacular corporate au- dit failures have significantly harmed
many investors," said SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, a former lawyer
at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest accounting firm. "The
professionals fell down on the job."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the SEC proposals approved Tuesday go beyond the new law's
requirements. One would bar accounting firms from paying their senior
auditors for selling consulting services. Its goal is to prevent
auditors from also acting as salesmen, said Robert Burns, chief
counsel for the SEC's accounting unit.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC rule proposals, which go out for public comment for 30
days, must be approved in some form by Jan. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Some SEC officials expressed concern about a proposed rule that
would prohibit individuals who are the lead audit partners from
providing audit services to the same client for more than five
consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of these rules will be borne more heavily by small
[accounting] firms than large firms," said SEC Chief Economist
Lawrence Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposals also would prohibit an accounting firm from
auditing a company if a senior executive of that corporation worked
for the firm during the previous year and participated in an audit of
the company. Auditors also would be barred from acting as legal
advocates, or in other advocacy capacities, for their clients.</TE>

<HD>Xerox to Take Charge to Cover 2,400 Layoffs</HD>
<DH>In bid to reduce costs and boost efficiency, company also
will close some call centers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. said Tuesday that it will eliminate 2,400 more jobs and
close customer-service centers and other facilities in North America
at a cost of as much as $400 million in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox plans to cut more jobs in Europe after talks with labor and
government officials, the company said. The smaller payroll will help
Xerox meet a goal of saving an additional $1 billion. The staff cuts
will cost at least $350 million.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy is trying to raise cash to meet debt
obligations she inherited after taking over 15 months ago, including
about $9 billion coming due in the next three years. Xerox is
shrinking to ensure profit because sales have dropped, investors
said.</LD>
<TE>   "The more costs go down, the more of a cushion the company will
have to produce profits," said Brian Eisenbarth, who has about
900,000 Xerox shares among the $1 billion he helps manage at Davidson
Investment Advisors. "If they can get sales up, with this lower cost
base, that money will flow right to the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Xerox shares rose 2 cents to $8.05 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. They have fallen 23% this year. Spokeswoman Christa Carone
wouldn't comment on how much the job cuts would reduce expenses and
said the savings probably would come in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Stamford, Conn.-based company is closing a call center, which
handles customers' calls, in St. Petersburg, Fla., and moving that
work to Lewisville, Texas. It is closing another in Irving, Texas,
and moving the work to Halifax, Nova Scotia.</TE>
<TE>   Job cuts worldwide could reach 5,000, said Caroline Sabbagha, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox rebounded to a profit in the third quarter, using job cuts
to help make up for a 10th straight quarter of falling sales. Mulcahy
has slashed expenses by about $1.1 billion since last year by
eliminating more than 13,600 jobs and closing plants. The copier
maker reduced employment by 1,600 jobs to about 69,900 last quarter.
It had about 94,600 workers in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors such as Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have taken
sales from Xerox with lower-cost products, prompting Xerox to
introduce cheaper copiers.</TE>
<TE>   Mulcahy said the company will meet the fourth-quarter earnings
forecast of 9 cents a share, excluding certain costs, from Thomson
First Call.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>No Question, the Climate Is Heating Up</HD>
<DH>Bush and the greens have a torrid hate affair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"They hate us." A friend called to rant about the Bush
administration. "I mean it," he said, sounding a tone of someone who
means it. "They hate us. Not just our ideas. But us."</LD>
<LD>   His subject: environmentalists. And I'm afraid he's right.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-conservation has become a gangland vendetta by George W. Bush
and those he entrusts to govern. I cannot see another way to explain
the endless string of one-sided decisions and the dripping
condescension with which they are delivered. Not much of anything --
not reason, not science, not public opinion, not the future, not
process and certainly not fellowship -- stands in the way.</LD>
<TE>   I will concede, as I have before, that environmentalists have done
plenty to bring on their woes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's no excuse for this. Not for the inflammatory,
rub-their-noses-in-it statement offered recently in a court case
brought by the Center for Biological Diversity. In a feather-brained
brief, the administration argued that conservationists should
consider the upside of bird deaths at a remote Navy live-fire range.
"Bird-watchers get more enjoyment spotting a rare bird than they do
spotting a common one." Besides, the government added, Navy
bombardment keeps away people who might otherwise disturb the birds.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, conservation should be a consensus issue. It belongs
in the center of our politics, high on our priorities list and very
close to our hearts. The reason is self-evident. It is a test of
values where the ideologies of liberals and conservatives converge,
or ought to. The root word of "conservative" is "conserve," after
all.</TE>
<TE>   Instead? Conservation has become an extreme example of the
polarizing, uncompromising, knee-jerk politics of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has dismissed science on public-lands forestry,
on wildlife and petroleum development and on water flows in salmon
rivers. It has disregarded public outcries in defense of roadless
areas and park protections and mining policy and, in California
(though not Florida, for obvious brotherly reasons), on offshore oil
drilling. It has ignored its own resource managers on snowmobiles in
national parks and illegal hunting practices in the Rockies. It has
turned its back on global warming, shortchanged research and
trivialized energy conservation. It has slammed and locked the door
on those who represent an honorable and bipartisan movement in
American society. Virtually every important conservation law that has
guided 30 years of economic and environmental progress is now under
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, these are people who know better. The president and plenty
of those surrounding him are firmly rooted in the land; it's no pose.
They understand the human-nature connection. They draw strength and
shelter and diversion and renewal from the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   So there is no logic to their policies except the logic of
cultural warfare. To say that this administration is simply
pro-business overlooks the fact that a large segment of American
industry has invested heavily and for years in going green. No, this
is wedge politics at its most destructive, dividing and weakening the
nation. It bubbles up from the well of grudge, payback -- the same
shameful impulse that has been exploited to separate us by race, by
gender, by heritage, by class.</TE>
<TE>   That's it. Conservationists got too uppity. Slap 'em down. It's
the old bugaboo that every social gain means someone's loss.
"Environmentalist" has become a sneering epithet that encompasses
urban effetes, hand-to-mouth backcountry activists and ordinary
workaday folks who object to 8-mile-a-gallon SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   In short, they aren't another voice in our noisy democracy but an
actual enemy. Who attacked the U.S. on 9/11? "Strong possibility"
that it was the greens. So speculated Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), a
Bush ally and vice chairman of the House Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Administration supporters will counter that ill will is not a
one-way path. And that is true. Rancor begets the same. So
environmentalists burn with fury. But no one elected the Sierra Club
to govern. That is Bush's job. The Wilderness Society doesn't purport
to bring us together. That was the president's promise.</TE>
<TE>   Hate is a strong word. And we should hate that, in this case, it's
the correct one.</TE>

<HD>Expansion Poses Risk to NATO's Cohesion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John R. Deni</AU>
<BD>John R. Deni is an analyst for the U.S. Army in Europe.
The opinions expressed here are his own.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is likely to issue
membership invitations to seven nations. Stretching from Estonia in
the north to Bulgaria in the south, the new members may bring many
benefits to the alliance, but one thing they will not bring is added
security. Ethnic discord, government corruption and limited military
capabilities are but a few of the less-than-desirable characteristics
of some of the likely new members.</LD>
<LD>   So then why expand? There seems to be a consensus among Western
governments that expansion over the long run is the surest way to
guarantee widespread security in Europe, even if that means further
diluting NATO's already-limited collective military capabilities.
What is noteworthy is not that the consensus exists but rather what
it -- and the Bush administration's efforts to promote it -- tells us
about the likely future of U.S. and allied military action.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the alliance is made up of at least two tiers of military
capability -- one dominated by the U.S. and the other made up of the
majority of the other members. With the addition of countries such as
Romania and Slovakia, it will add at least one more tier,
characterized by an even lower level of military capability. As that
happens, the alliance's ability to undertake multinational operations
will decrease. Does that matter? It does if the alliance wants to
avoid loosening one of the most important ties that bind its members:
the ability to conduct combat operations together.</TE>
<TE>   The last time NATO fought as an alliance -- in Kosovo -- American
leaders brought home several lessons. Especially instructive were
those that showed the political and operational difficulties of
employing multinational forces in combat. Putting aside contentious
debates within the U.S. political-military establishment on how to
conduct the war against Serbia, American commanders faced some of
their greatest challenges in conducting multinational combat
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, gaining approval for military operations from many
capitals proved prohibitively difficult. And operationally, saddling
American forces with ragtag multinational forces that didn't, and
still don't, work together as well as they should reduced overall
effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   What then was one of the most important lessons learned in Kosovo?
Military self-reliance.</TE>
<TE>   If military self-reliance was one of the major lessons learned,
and if NATO-led offensive combat operations are a thing of the past,
then from the American perspective it matters not which nation NATO
invites to become a member. Even extending an invitation to tiny
Slovenia -- a country roughly 2,000 square miles smaller than
Maryland -- is perfectly plausible if one assumes that U.S. and
Slovenian forces will never need to conduct major offensive combat
operations together. The Bush administration's drive to invite the
seven nations into NATO seems to recognize this and therefore
presages several likely characteristics of the future of U.S. and
allied military strategy.</TE>
<TE>   First, American forces will bear the brunt of major combat
operations and will do so outside the NATO military command
structure, free of political interference from allied capitals and
free from the diluting effect of militarily less-capable allies --
similar in many ways to what has taken place in Afghanistan over the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Second, if the U.S. conducts major combat operations in a
multilateral setting, it will do so only with the most capable of its
allies and primarily to avoid the "unilateralist" epithet.</TE>
<TE>   Third, European forces will fill in where possible in
post-conflict operations or peacekeeping operations. This will permit
our European allies to continue to avoid increases in defense
spending. None of this is to argue necessarily that the alliance
should not continue to cultivate new members. However, policymakers
in Washington and allied capitals need to ensure that in their haste
to expand NATO they don't destroy the glue that holds the alliance
together: the commitment to collective defense embodied in the
ability and willingness to conduct combined military operations.</TE>

<AU>Frank J. Gaffney Jr.</AU>
<BD>Frank J. Gaffney Jr., an official in the Reagan
administration's Defense Department, is the president of the Center
for Security Policy in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reports that Saddam Hussein has ordered 1.25 million doses of the
chemical-weapons antidote atropine, as well as colloidal silicon
dioxide, which can be used to make "dusty" chemical arms capable of
penetrating U.S. protective gear, came as a shock to many Americans,
but probably for the wrong reason.</LD>
<LD>   These are, after all, just the latest in a series of indicators
that the Iraqi despot might use chemical or biological weapons if the
United States has to disarm his regime by force. As such, it
reinforces the need for the careful military planning now underway
aimed at minimizing the chances that such attacks will occur or be
effective.</LD>
<LD>   What should really get our attention about such indicators,
however, is the insight they offer into the utter bankruptcy of what
passed for serious national security policymaking since the late
1980s.</LD>
<TE>   Specifically, Hussein's evident capacity to use chemical and
biological weapons illuminates the folly of arms control agreements
that were supposed to "rid the world" of such deadly means of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. signed on to two accords banning biological and chemical
weapons and, pursuant to those treaties, has eliminated all offensive
viruses and toxins and is in the process of destroying its stocks of
chemical munitions.</TE>
<TE>   Successive U.S. administrations assumed that these arms control
agreements would create "international norms" that would govern the
behavior of all. That hope was certainly fostered by the appearance
of nearly universal adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention;
Iraq signed on in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, under Hussein's regime, Iraq -- along with the
Soviet Union/Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Syria and Cuba -- has
systematically violated the convention's provisions. Hussein did not
even bother to sign the 1989 chemical weapons ban.</TE>
<TE>   The growing evidence that the U.S. disarmed, while nations that
might use chemical or biological weapons against us did not, was only
one of the dangerous absurdities of the arms control delusion. The
expectation that such weapons had been dealt with effectively through
these bans contributed to the belief that we need not worry about
protecting against such scourges. Our vulnerability to incalculably
destructive smallpox attacks is a manifestation of the sorry state of
American preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, the biological and chemical weapons conventions obliged
signatories with advanced biotech and chemical manufacturing
industries to share the technology with others who did not have such
capabilities. To put it bluntly, the idea was to bribe the have-nots
to forgo biological and chemical arms by making available access to
sophisticated means of producing pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and
pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that anyone who can produce modern drugs, vaccines
and chemicals for agricultural and industrial use also can produce
deadly viruses, toxins and nerve agents.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, the trade in such technologies, legitimated and
encouraged by the bans, has provided a perfect cover for the
proliferation of mass-destruction capabilities around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   This underscores the futility of trying to disarm Iraq without
removing Hussein and his ruling clique from power.</TE>
<TE>   Even if one makes the heroic assumption that inspections actually
result in the elimination of all Iraqi chemical and biological
weapons, Hussein will be back in that business in no time if he is
allowed to retain or rebuild his nominally civilian chemical and
biotech industries.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's attempt to purchase vast quantities of atropine and
colloidal silicon dioxide should sound an alarm for all of us. Our
troops certainly need to be prepared to deal with his battlefield use
of chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we at home also must take urgent action to reduce our
vulnerability to a threat that has only been compounded by the
delusion that ill-conceived and unverifiable arms control agreements
offer us protection.</TE>

<AU>Michael Nash</AU>
<BD>Michael Nash is presiding judge of the Los Angeles
Juvenile Court. Web site: www.national adoptionday.org</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today in the United States there are more than 500,000 children in
foster care, approximately 100,000 of them in California. More than
131,000 will never be able to return to their biological families. By
finding loving, permanent families for these children, we can create
a better future for them and for our nation.</LD>
<LD>   With an estimated 32,000 children in foster care and thousands
more entering the system each year, Los Angeles County has the
nation's largest foster-care system. About 3,000 are waiting to be
adopted. Having served in the Juvenile Court since 1990, I see the
challenges faced by these children. With the support of a loving
family, any one of them can be given the keys to long-term health and
success.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, my colleagues and I will join with judges across the
country who have volunteered their time to open the courthouse doors
to finalize the adoptions of hundreds of children in foster care.</LD>
<TE>   Through a coalition of volunteer lawyers, foster-care
professionals, child advocates and national partners -- the Alliance
for Children's Rights, Casey Family Services, Children's Action
Network, Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, Dave Thomas
Foundation for Adoption, Freddie Mac Foundation and Target Corp. --
we will expedite the process for many families.</TE>
<TE>   Four in 10 Americans have considered adoption, according to a
survey funded by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. If only one
out of 500 Americans adopted a child from foster care, the 131,000
children in foster care nationwide waiting for adoption would have
permanent families.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to changes in state and federal laws, adoption from foster
care is easier than ever, regardless of age, gender, race or marital
status.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting children from foster care is virtually free. Programs
provided by state and federal governments have made it possible for
many families and single people with low or moderate incomes to adopt
children from foster care. These programs provide cash benefits,
payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses, medical assistance and
social services.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of employers offer adoption assistance as part of
their benefits packages, including time off for maternity/paternity
leave, financial incentives and other benefits. Congress has made
federal tax credits available. A revised adoption tax credit,
effective in January, increases to $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   All foster children are in the system because of abuse or neglect
by their parents -- not because the children did anything wrong.
Giving them a chance to grow up in loving and supportive homes
benefits us all.</TE>

<HD>Overkill Trips Up Cyberspace Security Plan</HD>
<DH>Deal with real issues, not every potential worry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter S. Tippett</AU>
<BD>Peter S. Tippett, an international information
security expert, has advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
cyber-warfare.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steeped in civic idealism and putting forth the ever-optimistic "call
to action," the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace provides a
solid start for the way that government, corporations and individuals
need to view Internet security.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy, an effort by the Office of Homeland Security, was
outlined in September to allow 60 days for public comment. The plan
now moves to the purview of the soon-to-be Department of Homeland
Security.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Clarke, the primary architect of the strategy, clearly and
correctly communicates that good security demands a proactive
campaign and not a reactive effort. This is a worthwhile mantra that
is finally gaining momentum after last year's costly virus disasters
and new speculation about potential cyber-terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The plan also highlights the need for better ways of sharing
intelligence. New procedures are recommended, including the expansion
of information sharing and analysis centers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the spirit of the plan is on target, one component of
its philosophical foundation may undermine the effort before it gets
started.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the focus of most security efforts has been on
identifying and then fixing vulnerabilities in technology. The belief
is that if a hole is found in the technological armor of an
organization it should be fixed immediately, before it can be
exploited by some cyber-deviant.</TE>
<TE>   While this sounds logical, it is actually the beginning of a
vicious cycle that occupies vast amounts of time and wastes millions
upon millions of corporate, government and consumer dollars every
year.</TE>
<TE>   Today's approach to information security is the equivalent of
recommending that everyone in the U.S. be inoculated for every known
disease at the earliest possible moment, without respect to whether
we are likely to be exposed or to the health cost of exposure. Under
such a notion, we would be inoculated for the most minor of
illnesses, costing consumers, doctors and insurance companies
billions of dollars annually.</TE>
<TE>   Would such an approach for health make sense? No, and it doesn't
for information security either.</TE>
<TE>   The philosophical focus of the government plan needs to be
centered on identifying and addressing security risk, not tracking
and eliminating every single vulnerability. Too many companies,
consumers and government organizations spend time discovering,
patching and fixing vulnerabilities that carry no risk or at least no
near-term security threat.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,437 vulnerabilities published in 2001, only about 20 were
involved in real attacks against corporations, and fewer than 4% of
published Microsoft vulnerabilities have resulted in breaches. This
means that 96% of alerts and incidents of publicity carried no
near-term security risk. Yet companies spent time, money and
resources addressing problems that were of little or no significance
or that misdirected their attention from something that could cost
them dearly.</TE>
<TE>   The government plan should support strategies to measure, predict
and prioritize risk and encourage classification of vulnerabilities
so that users can respond to only the most important ones.</TE>
<TE>   Much as community health prevents cholera by assuring that
drinking water and waste do not mix, there are numerous simple,
proactive, essential practices that users, corporations,
infrastructure and software providers can do to significantly
eliminate the need to chase vulnerabilities and patch systems.
Following that course would force security and technology
professionals to take a truly proactive stance on security and
address only vulnerabilities that posed the greatest security risk.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Listen, I know you studio execs are busy, so here's my pitch -- a
reality TV show about 911 operators. It's got everything a hit drama
needs: violence, suspense, happy endings.</LD>
<LD>   Sort of like "ER," only it's the real deal: no stars, no big
salaries, just veteran operators answering emergency phone calls and
making snap life-and-death decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Did I bring a treatment? I brought something better -- an unedited
911 tape:</LD>
<TE>   RRRRING.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911. Do you have an emergency?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yeah. We're at the corner of Hollywood and Vine, and we
can't find Jack Nicholson's star.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: I'm sorry, sir. This is for emergencies only.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Oh, for heaven's sake. You don't know where Jack
Nicholson's star is?</TE>
<TE>   RRRRING.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911 emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: What?</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911. What are you reporting?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Who is this?</TE>
<TE>   Operator: You called 911. Is this an emergency?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: What the -- ? Ella, were you playing with Mommy's cell
again?</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Please keep your phone away from your child, ma'am.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Ella's my cat.</TE>
<TE>   RRRRING.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911.</TE>
<TE>   Caller:</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911. Do you have an emergency? Hello?</TE>
<TE>   Caller:</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Hello? Hello?</TE>
<TE>   OK, let me fast-forward through this part. Trust me, there's some
serious stuff here. Heart attacks. Kids getting hit by cars.
Gunfights. It's just that half the folks who call 911 think a
hangnail's an emergency. Jams up the whole system. Or they
accidentally hit that one-button auto dial on their cell phones--they
oughta disable those things, don'tcha think?</TE>
<TE>   You're not going to pass on this, are you? Just give it a minute.
Hey, you're looking awfully pale. It's -- you OK? Whoa, sit back
down. Look, I'm going to get help. I'll call 911.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's West Bank Folly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ambush killings of a dozen Israeli security troops charged with
protecting settlers on what Palestinians consider stolen land give
prominence to the issue of Israeli settlements on West Bank
territory. The settlements are an obstacle to peace and a drain on
Israel, yet Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government is considering
expanding the enclave on the edge of the West Bank city of Hebron,
where the killings occurred Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jews and Muslims revere Hebron as the burial place of the biblical
patriarch Abraham / Ibrahim and consider it sacred. Israeli security
forces consider the city a daunting challenge because 450 Israeli
settlers live inside it surrounded by 120,000 Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   On the edge of Hebron, in Kiryat Arba, near the southern end of
the West Bank, live several thousand Israelis on land occupied after
the 1967 war. To get to the Tomb of the Patriarchs to pray, Kiryat
Arba settlers use a road through densely populated Arab
neighborhoods. The road was the site of the three-hour gun battle in
which nine Israeli soldiers and border patrolmen and three armed
guards from Kiryat Arba were killed, along with three Palestinian
attackers. Soon after the killings, settlers began building an
outpost on the site.</LD>
<TE>   Violence continued in the West Bank Tuesday as Israeli soldiers
killed five Palestinians, including one allegedly involved in a
January attack that killed six Israelis. In Gaza, two alleged gunmen
were slain by Israeli soldiers outside a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The United States rightly condemned Islamic Jihad, the terrorist
group that took responsibility for Friday's ambush, and called on its
Syrian patrons to shut it down. Such terrorism accomplishes nothing
for its perpetrators; it merely reminds the world that groups like
Islamic Jihad continue to deny Israel's right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements are unpopular with many Israelis, and in June
President Bush followed the lead of previous U.S. administrations,
saying, "Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must
stop."</TE>
<TE>   In January 1997, in a U.S.-brokered agreement, Israel turned over
80% of Hebron to Palestinian control but kept the Jewish enclave.
Since then the city has witnessed frequent clashes, pulling
Palestinians and Israelis further apart. If Palestinian land is taken
to build a secure corridor between Kiryat Arba and the tomb, tension
will increase in a city that is always on edge.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Hebron agreement once seemed a promising, if fragile,
extension of the process that would bring permanent peace between
Israel and the Palestinians. That continuum was interrupted nearly
two years ago by a failure to agree on how to exchange land for
peace, and it was shredded by the renewed Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   However, the chances of peace could get even worse. How? Through
the demolition of Arab houses, the forced evacuation of residents in
linking Kiryat Arba and the Tomb of Patriarchs, and allowing
machine-gun- toting settlers to guard the route.</TE>

<HD>NATO as Anti-Terror Tool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been 11 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization continues to fumble toward a
mission beyond protecting Europe from Soviet invasion. The new
threat, terrorism, is obvious. The trick is in moving from a line of
armored defense to a few thousand fast-response troops -- even as
NATO expansions threaten to overwhelm nimbleness.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the 19 NATO nations meet in Prague, Czech Republic, on
Thursday and Friday. The old alliance was transformed three years ago
when it admitted three former Communist countries: Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic. Now it is considering seven additional
nations, including three Baltic states that were once part of the
Soviet Union: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</LD>
<LD>   For most of its history, NATO has been a shared forum of
democracies as well as a bulwark of defense. The beneficial price of
membership has been reforms such as civilian control over the
military and peaceful settlement of border issues. However, the
expansions threaten to make the coalition more a political debating
society than a military alliance.</LD>
<TE>   To guard against that, the coalition should press ahead with a
rapid-response force ready to go quickly outside Europe's borders to
be a full partner in Afghanistan-like campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been publicly quiet about the NATO expansion up to its
borders and inside former Soviet territory. In part that reflects
weakness, and in part the muting of Western protests against Russia's
crackdown on rebels in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush plans to visit Russia after the Prague summit and
can reassure President Vladimir V. Putin that enlarging the coalition
and inventing a new military role do not threaten Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will discuss with other NATO leaders possible military action
against Iraq, but Germany's strong opposition guarantees there will
be no consensus. That does not preclude future joint actions. NATO
nations assisted U.S. forces in the fight against the Taliban and Al
Qaeda in Afghanistan and flew security patrols over U.S. airspace
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   NATO's secretary-general, Britain's George Robertson, has since
pushed member nations to increase their own defense spending or risk
being an afterthought in U.S.-led military campaigns. Bush should
make the case for future campaigns where early intervention could
save lives. For instance, NATO dithered over Kosovo, and it should
not repeat such a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of NATO nations have broken up Al Qaeda cells at home and
scoured terrorists' bank accounts; they recognize that terrorism
threatens them.</TE>
<TE>   The leap from that understanding to a rapid-strike force that
would operate far outside Europe is a big one. Picking the best
military elements from each nation and integrating them into a
cohesive force will require diplomacy as well as tactical training.
But creating a new mobile brigade may be necessary to keep NATO a
partner with Washington -- and to keep the alliance relevant in
Europe and beyond.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Press for Military Backing in Event of War</HD>
<DH>'Everybody can contribute something,' he says on way to
NATO summit. Campaign to garner support has been going on for months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush arrived in the Czech Republic on Tuesday aggressively
seeking commitments of military support from European leaders for a
possible war against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody can contribute something," Bush told Czech TV late
Monday before leaving Washington for the two-day NATO summit in
Prague, the Czech capital. A coalition against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein could be formed in "all kinds of ways," he said in an
interview broadcast Tuesday on Radio Free Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's statements were the highest-level acknowledgment of the
campaign to secure military support that lower-level officials have
been quietly pursuing for months. The administration has been
offering inducements ranging from financial payments to diplomatic
assistance in a bid to secure backing if the United Nations effort to
disarm Hussein fails.</LD>
<TE>   The recent unanimous vote by the U.N. Security Council in favor of
tough new arms inspections has dramatically intensified the
coalition-building effort.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the U.N. resolution changed the issue of military
commitments overnight "from something that was hypothetical to
something that's real. It really strengthens their hand," said a
senior congressional aide.</TE>
<TE>   The aide predicted that the Eastern European countries that want
to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be only too happy
to publicly back any Iraq campaign as a way of showing they would be
worthy allies.</TE>
<TE>   And even if their contributions were small, their assistance would
be valuable to the United States for publicity reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We could say we've got a 70-country coalition, even if only five
or six are contributing anything big," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials already have approached about 50 countries, both to
plan a possible campaign and to send Hussein a signal that U.N.
members are determined to move against him if he obstructs weapons
inspectors, who arrived in Baghdad on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a way to make sure that Saddam Hussein knows we're
serious," said a senior State Department official. "Our experience
shows that diplomacy works best when it is backed up by the possible
use of force."</TE>
<TE>   The administration expects no trouble finding partners if the
Security Council finds that Hussein has broken his pledge to allow
the inspectors to conduct their work without hindrance. But U.S.
officials would like to line up allies willing to go into Iraq even
without U.N. support.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are pressing their case with Middle Eastern
countries that would be vital in any Iraq campaign, such as Turkey
and the Persian Gulf states. And they are broadening their campaign
to include close allies that usually have been important military
partners, such as Canada and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien acknowledged Tuesday that
the U.S. had approached Canada and allies seeking a commitment, just
as it did before the Afghan war and the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see what we've got; we'll see what they need," Chretien
told reporters in Ottawa. "We already have ships, planes, troops" in
the region. He said the request remained "very hypothetical, because
I hope Saddam will comply and there will be no war."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official declined to characterize what the overall response
has been but said countries are considering the issue and have no
deadline for a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have been working hard to firm up support from Turkey,
which has long been an important base for U.S. aircraft and would be
key to staging any attack through northern Iraq. They have opened
talks with Turkey on a compensation package aimed at offsetting any
losses the country might suffer in a war. The package could be worth
billions and could include debt forgiveness, direct aid and U.S.
weapons at discounted prices.</TE>
<TE>   Bush this week helped Turkey on one of its top concerns by urging
the European Union to begin negotiations over the country's accession
to the alliance. Bush called the current EU president, Danish Prime
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to urge that the alliance take the
next step toward accepting Turkey when EU leaders meet in Denmark
next month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials may well not be able to meet the price the Turks
set for their help, which could run into the billions of dollars. But
to try to make sure that a large aid package wins congressional
support, the officials have helped arrange a trip for senior U.S.
lawmakers, including House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, to Ankara, the
Turkish capital, this week.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also have discussed a special aid package for
Jordan, a country that relies on Iraqi oil and trade and whose large
Palestinian population would oppose any attack on Iraq. The U.S. is
looking for intelligence cooperation and overflight rights from the
kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe they have commitments for basing and overflight
rights from a number of countries in the Persian Gulf region and
Central Asia. Kuwait and Qatar, which is home to the large Al Udeid
Air Base, are among the most committed. Agreements with some nations
still need to formalized.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are continuing talks with Israel to try to ensure
that the Israelis will not respond to any strike by Iraq with an
attack, which could bring other Arab countries into an all-out war.
Officials have promised to move early in any war to take out mobile
missile launchers in western Iraq that could be used for strikes on
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they have approached Iran through third parties
in hopes of using Tehran's influence with the Shiite Muslims in Iraq,
who make up about 60% of the population and could have an important
influence if Hussein's regime is crushed. Officials hope Tehran would
urge the Shiites not to try to form a separate country in southern
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The role of Saudi Arabia, which was an important staging area in
the Persian Gulf War, remains unclear. A massive state-of-the-art,
U.S.-financed base there may remain unused during any war on Iraq.
But many U.S. officials believe -- though they may not publicly
acknowledge it -- that the Saudis ultimately will permit some
aircraft basing and refueling from Prince Sultan Air Base as well as
overflight rights.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also speculate that, despite the highly unusual
public friction between Bush and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
Germany may eventually take part in a postwar rebuilding of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that the French, too, despite their resistance to
U.S. pressure during the recent U.N. talks, will help militarily.</TE>

<LD>Danish authorities brought war crimes charges against a former Iraqi
army commander who says he plans to lead an insurrection against
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Nizar Khazraji, who fled Iraq in 1996, was ordered to court just
days before he planned to leave Denmark. In an interview, he said he
wanted to reach northern Iraq and hook up with dissidents to launch
the coup.</LD>
<LD>   Danish prosecutors have been pursuing allegations that Khazraji
helped spearhead Hussein's brutal campaign against Kurdish civilians
in the late 1980s. He is accused of murder, pillage and destruction
of property. He says he is innocent.</LD>

<HD>Iraqi Officials Pledge to Meet U.N. Demands</HD>
<DH>Baghdad emphasizes that it will comply with deadline to
enumerate its arsenal and will allow access to all suspected weapons
sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraqi officials promised Tuesday to declare any weapons of mass
destruction by a Dec. 8 deadline and reaffirmed that U.N. arms
inspectors would have full access to all sites across their country.</LD>
<LD>   After a meeting between chief weapons inspectors and senior Iraqi
officials, Gen. Amir Saadi said Iraq would cooperate with Resolution
1441, which was passed unanimously by the Security Council on Nov. 8
and gives Baghdad a "final chance" to disarm.</LD>
<LD>   "Within 30 days, as the resolution says, a report from Iraq will
be submitted on all the files -- nuclear, chemical, biological and
missile files," Saadi said. He added that in two meetings that
included chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix and Mohammed Baradei from the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the participants discussed the
forthcoming inspections "in order to avoid problems or
misunderstandings."</LD>
<TE>   "We are hopeful," Saadi said. "We are in fact quite sure that
things will work much better than before."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq maintains that it has no weapons of mass destruction, so the
potential contents of the Dec. 8 declaration are a matter of great
curiosity to Security Council members, especially the U.S. and
Britain, whose intelligence services have compiled their own lists of
what they believe Iraq possesses.</TE>
<TE>   When U.N. inspectors left Iraq four years ago after facing
continued resistance and obstacles, they had a long list of items
that were unaccounted for, including deadly VX nerve gas, 7,100
liters of anthrax and a number of Scud missiles.</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq's accounting of its arsenal does not match the inspectors'
or if a member state believes there are intentional omissions, the
Security Council will consider subsequent steps. The options range
from seeking clarification to authorizing an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We told them that this declaration should be comprehensive,
concise and clear, as the Security Council mentions," said Baradei,
"and it should include all factors that the Security Council
demanded."</TE>
<TE>   On the inspectors' second day in the country, they began technical
preparations for formal inspections to begin next Wednesday. At the
former Canal Hotel in Baghdad, they reopened their old command center
-- which has been occupied by only pigeons and insects -- sweeping
out the dust and installing new computers.</TE>
<TE>   They will also set up secure phone lines, arrange for jeeps and
helicopters and install a laboratory for testing. The resolution
calls for surprise inspections, anywhere, any time, and there are
hundreds of sites on the inspectors' lists.</TE>
<TE>   The preparations began amid a row over clashes in the "no-fly"
zones in northern and southern Iraq. U.S. officials declared over the
weekend that targeting U.S.-British coalition aircraft patrolling
those areas would be a "material breach" of the resolution but that
the U.S. would not push the issue in the Security Council just yet.</TE>
<TE>   However, none of the other 14 members of the council agree with
the U.S., and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan weighed in Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me say that I don't think that the council will say this is
in contravention of the resolution of the Security Council," he said
while traveling in Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition aircraft carried out two strikes Monday, in the north
and south, after being fired on by Iraqi forces. The U.S. and Britain
declared the zones after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect ethnic
Kurds in Iraq's north and Shiite Muslims in the south from President
Saddam Hussein's forces, but they are not explicitly mandated by any
Security Council resolutions. Iraq regards them as an infringement of
its sovereignty and has routinely fired at the planes for a decade.
Baghdad said four people were injured in the Monday strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at U.N. headquarters, attention turned to the
humanitarian situation in Iraq. The chief of the U.N. "oil for food"
program, Benon Sevan, reported that newly instituted "smart
sanctions" appear to be working and that nearly all the contracts
that were put on hold by Security Council members have been cleared.
But a prolonged drop in Iraqi oil sales means that there is not
enough money in Iraq's U.N. escrow account to pay for $3 billion of
approved contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "While understandably the current discussions are focused on the
resumption of the weapons inspections regime, all concerned [should]
also focus attention on the humanitarian dimension and spare no
effort in meeting the dire humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people,"
Sevan told the council.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to provide humanitarian relief from sanctions
implemented after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N. has
administered Iraq's trade since 1995, to allow Iraq to sell oil to
buy basic goods and to prevent imports that could be used for
military purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions were to be dropped when Iraq disarmed. No one
expected the program to last as long as it has.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. revamped the program this summer after years of
complaints that it was run inefficiently and was delaying the
delivery of basic humanitarian goods. A new procedure implemented in
July -- nicknamed "smart sanctions" -- created a "goods review list"
of banned items and allowed everything else to go through. The
result, said Sevan, has been noticeable improvements in health,
nutrition, education and other standard of living measures. But the
shortfall in oil sales puts such gains in peril, Sevan said, and he
called for donations.</TE>

<HD>Ex-General to Lead Labor Party</HD>
<DH>Mayor of Haifa says he's committed to peace talks with
Palestinians if he wins Israeli election and would pull troops and
settlers out of Gaza.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Former army Gen. Amram Mitzna took up a quixotic task Tuesday,
leading his left-leaning Labor Party into battle against the
overwhelmingly favored right-wing Likud in advance of Israel's
general elections in January.</LD>
<LD>   Mitzna, the bearded, bespectacled mayor of the coastal city of
Haifa, crushed his opponents in a three-way race for his party's
leadership and early today declared his commitment to restarting
peace talks with the Palestinians if he wins in January.</LD>
<LD>   The 57-year-old Mitzna told a post-midnight victory rally at party
headquarters in Tel Aviv that his goal is "not only to replace the
government but to create a different reality, a different society in
Israel."</LD>
<TE>   The new Labor leader said he would pull Israeli troops and Jewish
settlers out of the Gaza Strip, whether or not the Palestinians
offered any concessions in return.</TE>
<TE>   To many observers, Mitzna's decisive victory over less liberal
rivals -- former Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and veteran
lawmaker Haim Ramon -- was a strong signal that the party faithful
want to see Labor return to its roots and resume its traditional role
as the principal political opposition to Likud.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, Labor championed efforts to make peace
with the Palestinians, culminating in 1993 with the signing of the
landmark Oslo interim peace accords and then-Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's historic handshake with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
the White House lawn.</TE>
<TE>   But following Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's election in February
2001, Labor entered into a partnership with Likud. That collapsed
three weeks ago when Ben-Eliezer led a walkout from the governing
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup coincided with a fight over funding for Jewish
settlements, but many commentators suspected that Ben-Eliezer
precipitated the split to better position himself for the Labor
leadership race by putting distance between himself and Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   If that was indeed his strategy, it was one of the more memorable
miscalculations in recent Israeli political history. Mitzna routed
the former defense minister, garnering 54% of the vote to
Ben-Eliezer's 38%, according to final tallies. Ramon was a distant
third with 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Although polls had predicted a comfortable win for Mitzna heading
into the contest, victory was by no means certain.</TE>
<TE>   Old-style machine politics are still a powerful force in Israel,
and Ben-Eliezer had plenty of chits to cash in. And he clearly had
the loyalty of a core of shock troops among the 120,000 registered
Labor members who were eligible to vote in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   At one polling place, in the leafy, genteel Jerusalem neighborhood
of Rehavia, Ben-Eliezer partisans in bright orange T-shirts shouted
down the soft-spoken Mitzna when he tried to talk to supporters and
TV cameras Tuesday morning. They drowned him out with yells of
"Fu-ad! Fu-ad!" -- Ben-Eliezer's nickname.</TE>
<TE>   As results rolled in Tuesday evening, quickly pointing to a
lopsided win for Mitzna, he called on Ben-Eliezer to present a united
front.</TE>
<TE>   But his rival refused to accept the early results, conceding only
after midnight, when no doubt was left. Ben-Eliezer promised to work
for the party's success, though he devoted most of his concession
speech to thanking his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media reports spoke of disbelief and fury in the
Ben-Eliezer camp as the tally mounted, saying he and his backers
believed until almost the last moment that he would somehow prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna has been mayor of Haifa, Israel's third-largest city, for
nearly a decade but is a newcomer to national politics. By fielding
him as a candidate, Labor stakes out positions diametrically opposed
to those of the Sharon government, which has cut off all dealings
with Arafat and unleashed massive military force in 25 months of
bitter conflict with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon himself faces a leadership challenge next Thursday from
Benjamin Netanyahu, the foreign minister in his caretaker government.
Polls suggest the prime minister, who called early elections after
his coalition with Labor fell apart, is likely to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, commenting on the Labor results, sought to portray both
Sharon and Mitzna as too willing to make concessions to the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "There are three candidates for prime minister at the moment, and
two of them support a Palestinian state," he told Israeli TV.</TE>
<TE>   "One," he said, referring to himself, "does not."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the results pointed up a potentially divisive factor
in the general election: ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi-born Ben-Eliezer has always had a strong appeal to Jews
of Middle Eastern origin, the Sephardim, while Mitzna, with his
German-Polish roots, tends to draw support from Ashkenazim, or
European-descended Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Labor could be even more handicapped at the polls in January if it
cannot motivate Sephardic voters, who wield enormous electoral clout.</TE>
<TE>   In Israeli politics, candidates who openly call for territorial
concessions in exchange for peace must possess impeccable military
credentials, so voters trust that they are not jeopardizing Israel's
security.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who could
point to a record as Israel's most decorated soldier when he was
elected on a peace platform in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna, who was twice wounded in battle, commanded the Syrian
front during the war in Lebanon, during which he threatened to quit
over deep disagreements with Sharon, then the defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leaders generally avoid publicly praising an Israeli
leftist candidate for fear of hurting his chances, but Palestinian
parliament speaker Ahmed Korei said he was heartened by Mitzna's
stated intention to restart negotiations and get troops and settlers
out of Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the Israeli people choose a leader willing and able to
achieve a stable, comprehensive peace," he said.</TE>

<HD>Will Bush, Schroeder Be Nice at NATO?</HD>
<DH>The German leader's opposition to a war in Iraq led to
snubs by the president. Their continuing rift could be an issue at
the summit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>The chief object of suspense as NATO countries gather to formally
accept seven new members is whether President Bush and German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder can make nice.</LD>
<LD>   Looming over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit is a
possible showdown with Baghdad -- an issue that is not expected to
take center stage but nevertheless will assume a prominent role in
private discussions. Whether to take military action against Iraq is
just the latest weight to burden the U.S. relationship with Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their recent falling-out, Bush, who arrived here Tuesday,
has no plans to sit down with Schroeder to try to heal the rift --
even though both men have tete-a-tetes scheduled with other foreign
leaders while in the Czech Republic.</LD>
<TE>   But many observers expect there will be opportunities to right
U.S.-German relations, which are central to NATO's well-being at a
time when the alliance must ponder a new role for itself in a
radically changed world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they'll see each other at NATO," Condoleezza Rice, the
president's national security advisor, said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Bush knows that the summit "isn't going to be a success if the
centerpiece of the meeting is a continued frosty, non-communicative
relationship between the United States and Germany," said James B.
Steinberg, deputy national security advisor in the Clinton White
House.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-Schroeder breach stems from the chancellor's reelection
campaign, when he ran strongly opposed to war in Iraq. The president
was further angered when one of Schroeder's ministers was quoted as
comparing Bush's tactics to those of Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   After Schroeder eked out a victory, Bush snubbed him by not
placing the traditional congratulatory call. He also ignored a letter
from Schroeder. The leaders finally had a short telephone
conversation Nov. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's top priorities on his 11th trip abroad as president are
ushering in seven new members to NATO, combating terrorism, fostering
the alliance's transformation in a post-Sept. 11 world and continuing
to forge "a new relationship" with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all got to be done within the strategy of the true threats
we face in the 21st century, which is global terrorism," Bush told
Czech television. "That's the biggest threat to freedom right now."</TE>
<TE>   The nations to be invited into NATO are Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them are behaving like shy debutantes, reluctant to talk
about their impending membership for fear of jinxing the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is done until it's done, until it's announced," Sorin
Ducaru, the Romanian ambassador to the U.S., said, before allowing:
"The decision process is very, very advanced. We hope there's no
surprise in Prague."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is scheduled to hold five bilateral meetings today -- with
Czech President Vaclav Havel, Czech Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla,
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, French President Jacques Chirac
and NATO Secretary-General George Robertson. Later, Bush is to
deliver a speech laying out his vision for a Europe "whole, free and
at peace."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he will take part in the NATO proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush is to fly to St. Petersburg to meet with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin. The two were to have met over lunch
during last month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathering
in Mexico, but Putin canceled his trip because of a hostage-taking
siege at a Moscow theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to Russia to make it clear to the Russians and to
Vladimir Putin they have nothing to fear from NATO expansion, that
the Baltics in NATO are positive for Russia," Bush told European
reporters during a pre-trip interview.</TE>
<TE>   Before returning home Saturday night, he is to visit Vilnius,
Lithuania, and Bucharest, Romania. In Vilnius, he will meet with the
presidents of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.</TE>
<TE>   Although considerable attention in Washington has been focused on
a likely Bush-Schroeder encounter, the chill between them has hardly
captivated the Germans, who seem far more concerned about their
struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts see hopeful signs, including that Germany will
assume command of the peacekeeping force in Kabul, Afghanistan, next
month. Moreover, Germany has left open the possibility of its
participation in a postwar Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the [Bush] administration, I would start that
discussion with the Germans in order to find a way to get them back
into the game," said Ivo H. Daalder, a foreign policy senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, another sign emerged to suggest that Bush's
anger with Schroeder could yield a payoff.</TE>
<TE>   When Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister, was asked whether
Berlin would send troops to the Persian Gulf if Saddam Hussein
violates a recently approved U.N. Security Council disarmament
resolution, he replied:</TE>
<TE>   "That decision will be taken if the situation arises .... And we
will then have to talk about who does what."</TE>
<TE>   Schily's reply was a significant departure from Schroeder's
often-stated line that German soldiers will not take part in any
military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the White House seems to be taking the long view.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship with Germany is an important one, and we'll
continue to work together on our shared goals," said Scott McClellan,
deputy White House press secretary.</TE>

<HD>Ready and Willing, but Are They Able?</HD>
<DH>Iraq's Kurds want to help oust Hussein. But the U.S. has
worries -- such as the fact that the rebels rarely train using
bullets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SULAYMANIYAH, Iraq</DL>
<LD>At an abandoned Iraqi army base beneath the voluptuous brown
mountains of Kurdistan, the rhythmic sounds of thudding boots and
military chants echo through the morning air. The only armed force in
Iraq not under Saddam Hussein's control is running daily drills.</LD>
<LD>   "Hut-hut! Long live Kurdistan! Hut-hut! Long live the martyrdom of
the peshmerga!" shout the troops as they jog in tight formation.
Other squads nearby train as snipers, on rocket launchers and, at a
feverish pace, on obstacle courses.</LD>
<LD>   After decades of fighting, the legendary peshmerga, or "those who
face death," are gearing up for what many here hope will be their
last big battle: ousting a regime that has victimized the Kurdish
people perhaps more than any other group in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Many eagerly await American troops in hopes that, together, the
world's most powerful military and Iraq's most experienced opposition
force can finish the job the guerrillas started in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be my utmost joy if the Americans come. I'm ready to help
them. We all are," said Wahab Mustafa Ismail, a 30-year-old former
mechanic who now serves in an elite unit.</TE>
<TE>   But the big question here is what role the peshmerga will play --
and whether the rugged Kurdish force will get to participate at all.</TE>
<TE>   Kurdistan, the northern Iraqi enclave that borders Turkey, is only
one of the routes the U.S. military might use if it ends up launching
a land invasion against Hussein's regime. Many of the roughly 50,000
Kurdish fighters, with another 50,000 part-time volunteers, yearn to
play the same role in Iraq that the Northern Alliance played
alongside U.S. troops in ending the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are more effective, more organized and better trained than the
Northern Alliance and we're familiar with the Iraqi army. Many of our
members are defectors," said Mustafa Said Khadir, a top peshmerga
commander for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of two political
parties that administer the north.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans can't do it without us," he added. "Or at least
it'd be easier [with us]. The U.S. needs the peshmerga as a force
familiar with the terrain that can help liberate [the cities of]
Kirkuk, Mosul and then Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   The ethnic Kurds deride Pentagon plans to train an Iraqi
opposition force of as many as 10,000 fighters, most of them exiles.
The move is late in the game, they say, and the peshmerga already
have the required experience.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States helps the real opposition with its air force
and some special forces, it won't need to send a large army. It
doesn't need to send so many of its sons to die in Iraq," Jalal
Talabani, the affable leader of the PUK said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   However, both U.S. and Kurdish officials concede the situation
isn't quite as straightforward as it might seem. From explosive
regional political issues to the practical realities of military
cooperation, using the Kurdish fighters is fraught with problems.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kurds have been gradually retraining their guerrilla
force to form a conventional army, they still don't have enough
bullets for the sniper team to practice.</TE>
<TE>   The squads learn the principles of operating their dated Russian
rifles outfitted with scopes. They practice subterfuge, hiding for
hours wrapped head-to-toe in camouflage in the mountain flora. And
they take aim.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not like the United States. Bullets are precious. We don't
make them here, so these men only get to shoot occasionally," said
Maj. Simko Nazim, commander of the peshmerga expeditionary battalion.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds have limited firepower and no air force. Most of their
vintage equipment has been captured in encounters with Iraqi troops,
bought on the black market or even cajoled for a price off poor,
bored or sympathetic Iraqi sentries at the demarcation posts between
Kurdistan and the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Russian rifles and machine guns were bought years ago from Iran
and a few artillery pieces smuggled through Turkey, Kurdish
commanders say.</TE>
<TE>   So the PUK and Kurdistan Democratic Party, the other major Kurdish
group in the north, have what it takes to fight a guerrilla war on
their own turf -- as they did with some impact against Iraq's army in
1995 -- or against each other in 1996 in clashes that rent Kurdistan
into rival sectors for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The peshmerga do have a competent and credible infantry force and
they can defend in the right terrain. But to ask them to operate in
areas outside Kurdistan is well beyond their capabilities," said a
senior Bush administration official.</TE>
<TE>   Added a Western diplomat in Turkey: "These guys are not an army.
We're thinking of using them as Apache scouts" to help U.S. and
allied forces navigate the terrain and spot Iraqi forces.</TE>
<TE>   But on their own, the guerrillas are no match against the
500,000-member Iraqi army, the Arab world's most powerful and
best-equipped force, if the goal is to sweep into Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "With the equipment we have, we can't fight the Iraqi army. We
could stop them from [entering] Sulaymaniyah for no more than 48
hours," Khadir conceded. "Our main advantage is bravery and morale,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Kurdish fighters have a story to tell about signing
up. Shorsh Mustafa Mohammed, a sweet-faced youth who joined at 14,
lost most of his relatives in the village of Goptapa during Hussein's
Anfal operation in 1988, when more than 4,500 Kurdish villages were
razed and tens of thousands of Kurds were rounded up and either
disappeared or were executed. "They even took the women," Mohammed
said bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Aziz Biez was among more than 1 million Kurds who fled for
the mountain borders with Iran and Turkey in 1991 after an uprising,
urged by then-President George Bush, was brutally quashed by
Hussein's forces. Biez returned only after the U.S. and Britain
imposed a "no-fly" zone over the north, backed by air patrols. Then
he joined the peshmerga.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the fighters lost relatives or friends when Iraqi forces
used chemical weapons against the Kurds in the 1980s, most infamously
at the town of Halabja, where about 5,000 men, women and children
died gruesome deaths.</TE>
<TE>   To upgrade the Kurds' capabilities, they would need, at least,
ammunition, communications equipment and logistical supplies, said
Gen. Simko Dizayee, head of the peshmerga general staff, who still
wears the Kurds' traditional baggy pants as part of his uniform.</TE>
<TE>   The wish list, however, is much longer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet providing Kurdish troops with anything more than the aged
artillery, rockets and mortars they have could unleash a regional
backlash -- and potentially even intervention from other countries.
Turkey, which may prove to be the most pivotal partner for any
U.S.-led attack on Iraq, deeply fears the postwar existence of a
well-equipped Kurdish force and the potential spill over to its own
restive Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   Kurds, a non-Arab people estimated to number between 25 million
and 30 million, are the world's largest ethnic group without a state.
They span Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria, and the dream of many Kurds
is creation of a formal homeland -- as they were promised after the
Ottoman Empire collapsed eight decades ago. In the meantime, they
hope to begin by liberating Kirkuk, the oil-rich center of Kurdish
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is sufficiently alarmed at the prospect of both a
well-armed Kurdish army and the Kurds' capture of Kirkuk, home also
to thousands of ethnic Turkomans, that it has hinted that it might
intervene to block both developments. The danger of a military
operation in Iraq becoming a regional war has led the Pentagon to
make plans for U.S. troops to take and hold Kirkuk early in any
campaign. Then the Kurds would simply defend the turf they now hold.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds still have much to offer any U.S. offensive -- including
more than 100 defectors from the Iraqi army now in their force.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Weria Hassan fought U.S. troops near the port city of Basra
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. "Before, I lived in Baghdad, and
like many Iraqi troops I had no choice. My family was there and it
was my livelihood. I was forced to fight the Americans," he recalled.
But as a Kurd, Hassan said, he never liked fighting for Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   So in 1998, Hassan sent his family here to Sulaymaniyah, his
wife's northern hometown. She carried a message to the peshmerga that
her husband wanted to defect.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Hassan walked almost 10 hours through the no man's
land used by smugglers from Iraqi territory to a Kurdish-held area.</TE>
<TE>   Now Hassan is one of the top officers running the Kurds' formal
army. He wants to fight alongside the Americans -- "or anyone else
who will come to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein and free Kurdistan."</TE>
<TE>   As pressure mounts on Hussein, several Kurdish commanders said
they are hearing from an increasing number of Iraqi officers, all the
way to the top, who want to defect. "They're still coming across,"
Hassan said. "The morale of the Iraqi army right now is very low."</TE>
<TE>   But the peshmerga said they are urging many Iraqi officers to
remain in place -- for now. In the event of a U.S.-led attack, some
may be of more use preventing their troops from fighting or leading
mass defections. They think even Hussein's Republican Guard will be
fairly easy to crack.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq isn't the almighty army that the U.S. believes it is,"
Dizayee said. "It's a highly institutionalized army, which makes it
vulnerable. Once its command and control centers and the
communications network have been hit, the officers won't know what to
do next. They're not allowed to operate themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The troops will collapse and surrender," he said. "That's again
when the United States will need us."</TE>

<DL>DONGDUCHEON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>A U.S. military jury acquitted an American soldier of negligent
homicide charges today in the deaths of two South Korean girls hit by
his mine-clearing vehicle June 13 near the North Korean border.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Fernando Nino, the vehicle commander, hugged his wife after
he was found not guilty in a three-day court martial. He would have
faced up to six years in a U.S. prison if convicted in the deaths of
the 14-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   Nino's driver, Sgt. Mark Walker, will be tried on the same charges
beginning Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   South Korean activists had demonstrated to demand that the two men
be tried in a South Korean court. After the verdict, Lee So Hee,
spokeswoman for the group National Campaign for Eradication of Crime
by U.S. Troops in Korea, said, "The trial was a superficial stunt
designed to defuse rising anger."</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle was going uphill and around a bend in a rural area
when it hit the girls.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers in mine-clearing vehicles communicate through helmet
microphones because the engine noise is so great.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had argued that Nino wasn't paying attention and "did
not use all means necessary" to avoid the deaths of Shim Mi Son and
Shin Hyo Sun. Defense lawyers said Nino had tried to warn Walker on a
defective communication system.</TE>

<HD>The Land Cigarettes Call Home</HD>
<DH>In Japan, half of all men smoke, and lung cancer is a
leading killer. But then, the government owns 67% of the big tobacco
seller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHIMOTSUMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Teruo Araki wheezes as he glances down at the oxygen tanks that
accompany him everywhere. "This is what smoking did to me," he says.
"And I hold the Japanese government responsible."</LD>
<LD>   The fist-sized tumor removed from his lung is hardly uncommon in a
nation where half the male population smokes. What is rare is the
75-year-old Araki's willingness to speak out -- and file the first
smokers' lawsuit against Japan's major tobacco interests.</LD>
<LD>   Japan's slow-moving wheels of justice are expected to deliver a
verdict early next year, five years after the case was filed, in a
nation where courts rarely rule against the government. In the
interim, three of the seven plaintiffs have died.</LD>
<TE>   In other countries, governments are leading the anti-smoking fight
with aggressive health warnings, advertising bans and
multibillion-dollar lawsuits. Here, the government is tobacco's
biggest supporter -- and biggest investor.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese government cares more about money than people's
health," said Yoko Komiyama, an opposition lawmaker and leader of a
newly formed anti-smoking group in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Mix in special interests, powerful farm lobbies and a cultural
reluctance among Japanese to question authority, and you have the
makings of a deeply entrenched killing machine.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rate of tobacco usage is gradually declining, 49% of
Japanese men smoke, the highest level in the industrialized world, as
do 14% of women. The greatest use by gender is among women in their
20s and men in their 30s, suggesting that the industry's aggressive
courting of young people could reverse the decline.</TE>
<TE>   These days, more voices are criticizing the haze. Bullet trains
have reduced their number of smoking cars. A new law gives nonsmokers
more rights, and some local governments are imposing smoking
restrictions. Tokyo's Chiyoda district early this month initiated a
$16 fine for lighting up on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in a nation known as a smokers' paradise, there are few
limits on puffing away in restaurants, offices, even hospitals. And
the issue of secondhand smoke remains largely off the radar.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry has the government's ear because they're
arguably one and the same. The Finance Ministry owns 67% of Japan
Tobacco, or JT, which until 1985 was a government monopoly. In an era
of tight budgets, tobacco contributes $19 billion a year to
government coffers in taxes and dividends, making it among the
largest revenue sources. The ministry, not health authorities,
controls tobacco policy, and promotion of the industry is an explicit
national goal.</TE>
<TE>   Add it up and, critics charge, you have a huge conflict of
interest at best, with Japanese like Araki the big losers.</TE>
<TE>   Close ties between the state and tobacco interests exist in many
countries, but few affluent nations can touch Japan. Increasingly,
tobacco policy in the world's second-largest economy is out of step
even with Third World countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan is 30 years behind Europe and the U.S.," said Yoshio
Isayama, president of the Lawyers Organization for Nonsmokers'
Rights, representing Araki. "Why hasn't Japan learned from their
experience? Citizens just aren't given the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Warning labels on U.S. cigarette packs include: "Smoking Causes
Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, and May Complicate Pregnancy."
In Australia, one label screams: "Smoking Kills!" And in Canada there
is: "Smoking Makes You Impotent" beside a picture of a drooping
cigarette ash.</TE>
<TE>   With the tobacco industry in the driver's seat here, however,
Japan's warning label is among the world's weakest: "Please remember
to follow good smoking manners. As smoking might injure your health,
please be careful not to overdo it."</TE>
<TE>   "People from overseas laugh when they hear these," said Bungaku
Watanabe, director of the Tobacco Problems Information Center, a
civic group. "They're not warnings. They're a joke."</TE>
<TE>   The Finance Ministry, in response to written questions, said it
believes Japanese are adequately informed about tobacco-related
health issues, with smoking an individual decision. There should be
no requirement that Japan ban or reduce consumption, it added, given
that tobacco is a legal product.</TE>
<TE>   JT has argued in and out of court that the health risks are not
scientifically proved. Atsuro Ito, a JT spokesman, said warning
labels and health policy are determined by the government. The
company, Japan's only domestic producer, is intent on finding new
tobacco products with greater appeal for consumers, including women,
he added. "We leave it to their judgment whether to buy them or not."</TE>
<TE>   Although JT produces Marlboro cigarettes for the Japanese market
under license from Philip Morris Cos., which has admitted that its
cigarettes cause cancer, JT continues to deny any causal link. Yet
the Japanese company, which has diversified into pharmaceuticals and
food, also has invested millions researching drugs to combat lung
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, JT gave away 1.2 million cigarettes to 5,000 nursing
homes last year during the annual Respect for the Aged holiday, and
each year it distributes thousands of special crest-emblazoned smokes
to volunteers who help maintain the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Only in 1998 did Japan ban tobacco television ads -- 27 years
after they were pulled in the United States and 33 years after
Britain. The "ban," however, is voluntary and includes loopholes.
There are no restrictions on programming: Since 1998, the number of
characters lighting up in TV dramas has nearly doubled, according to
the Tobacco Problems Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   JT also sponsors hundreds of "manner ads" a week. The 10-second
television spots advise viewers not to fling their butts or otherwise
disturb nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is, it's all right to smoke as long as you don't
litter," said Watanabe, the center director. "It's also a type of
insurance. By sponsoring these ads, they're pretty sure the networks
won't do any negative programs on tobacco health issues."</TE>
<TE>   JT counters that the ads help ensure equal rights for smokers and
nonsmokers and says cigarette giveaways are done at the behest of the
government. "I believe those who receive free tobacco appreciate it,"
Ito said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are Japan's ubiquitous cigarette vending machines:
about 630,000 nationwide, including eight inside the Health Ministry,
in a country smaller than California.</TE>
<TE>   Their obvious if unstated aim, say critics, is to fuel the
lucrative youth market, with its promise of lifelong loyalty. Surveys
show that as many as 76% of high school smokers buy their cigarettes
from machines.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate it when preachy adults lecture us about cigarettes," said
Maki Tanaka, an 18-year-old high school student and a vending machine
user hanging out in Tokyo's Harajuku area. "When I get irritated, a
smoke really helps calm my nerves."</TE>
<TE>   The Youth Smoking Prohibition Law includes penalties for selling
tobacco to minors, but it's rarely enforced. A single indictment has
been handed down over the last decade, and no one has been punished.
JT and the government resist surveys of youth smoking trends on the
grounds that it's illegal for people under 20 to smoke. JT also says
vending machine restrictions are adequate.</TE>
<TE>   Culture also has played a role in Japanese society's widespread
acceptance of tobacco, reflecting long-standing views toward
government, personal responsibility and conformity in the interest of
group harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taught to trust government," said Yumiko
Mochizuki-Kobayashi, a former Health Ministry official. "And blaming
others for your own actions isn't seen as a virtue. This is the
culture of hara-kiri, where you take responsibility for your own
death."</TE>
<TE>   Those who speak out aggressively face criticism, even harassment.
Former friends have accused plaintiff Araki of mental instability.
People trying to quit report that colleagues blow smoke in their
faces, drop cigarettes in their pockets and urge them repeatedly to
give tobacco another try.</TE>
<TE>   Even so-called reformist politicians rarely rock the boat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to smoke, that's fine. Just try not to bother
others," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an ex-smoker, said during
last year's global No Tobacco Day.</TE>
<TE>   With Japan's lucrative adult male market saturated, JT and foreign
companies such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco are targeting the
female market with alluring ads of young, healthy-looking women
laughing at champagne parties as they eat birthday cake and wear
tiaras. In a legacy of male chauvinism, Japanese women traditionally
have not smoked in great numbers, so they offer a temptingly huge
marketing opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many ads aimed at women now," said Nobuko Nakano,
head of a one-person group called Women's Action on Smoking. "They
now have equal rights to die."</TE>
<TE>   JT also is pushing aggressively into the international arena. In
1999, it purchased RJR Nabisco Holding Corp.'s international
operations for $7.8 billion, a move that made JT the world's
third-largest producer after Philip Morris and British American
Tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, meanwhile, say tar and nicotine levels listed on
cigarette packs here rely on outdated methods that understate what
smokers inhale. If techniques recommended by the World Health
Organization were employed for Japan's Frontier Light brand, for
instance, critics say, the tar figures on the package would be 6.7
times higher.</TE>
<TE>   While more countries are sharply boosting tobacco taxes -- and the
World Health Organization says a 10% price hike results in a 4% drop
in consumption -- Japan has kept prices low.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarettes in Japan run about $2 a pack, roughly half the average
in the U.S., with taxes here having risen only 13 cents a pack since
1986. The cost is among the lowest in the industrialized world
indexed to wages: A cigarette in Tokyo is worth about 8 minutes on
the job for the average worker, compared with 20 minutes in Los
Angeles and 40 in London.</TE>
<TE>   JT argues that its methods of measuring tar comply with Japanese
law and adds that cigarette buyers already shoulder enough of the
overall tax burden.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't want to impose any further burden on consumers," Ito
said.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest source of industry clout is the Tobacco Business Law,
one of a string of related measures dating to 1904. The law says the
government must own at least 50% of JT in perpetuity and, as a matter
of national policy, "promote the healthy development of the tobacco
industry and ensure stable revenue in the interest of a sound
national economy."</TE>
<TE>   "This law is the heart of evil," said attorney Isayama. "This is
the real axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Finance Ministry's large tobacco section, the
Health Ministry doesn't have a single full-time official working on
smoking issues -- even though smoking accounts for the nation's
highest level of premature deaths, triple the number of suicides and
nine times that of traffic fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   The national health budget this year for anti-smoking awareness is
$180,000, for a practice that kills 95,000 Japanese a year. By
comparison, the budget for the prevention of AIDS, which kills
approximately 45 people a year, is $94 million.</TE>
<TE>   "So many decision-makers in Japan smoke," said Takafumi Hirama,
director of the Hirama Hospital here in Shimotsuma, about 35 miles
north of Tokyo. "Their brains have become paralyzed by the drug."</TE>
<TE>   The Health Ministry has displayed rare moments of bravery, despite
having its annual budget approved by the powerful Finance Ministry.
In 1997, it issued a white paper saying smoking is the direct cause
of a range of health problems. Although this is pretty tame by
overseas standards -- U.S. government reports with such warnings date
to 1964 -- it represented Japan's first such official acknowledgment.
Parallel efforts to list secondhand smoke as a risk were squelched by
pro-tobacco forces.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, mavericks within the Health Ministry challenged the
nation to halve its smoking rate by 2010. The furor from bureaucrats,
politicians and the nation's 12,000 tobacco farmers and 306,000
retailers -- known collectively as the Tobacco Tribe -- was so great
that the goal was scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   "I sacrificed my career," said Mochizuki-Kobayashi, the former
Health Ministry official who was involved in that fight and was later
relegated to a ministry-affiliated research institute. "Still, it was
worth it. Some future lawsuit or journalist may be able to learn from
our failure."</TE>
<TE>   More often, battles are decided far from the public eye. The
Tobacco Business Deliberation Council, a key committee that advises
on policy, is packed with pro-tobacco members; there isn't a single
consumer or anti-smoking group represented.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan's policy is not only a mistake, it's criminal," said
attorney Isayama. "Smokers are totally deceived by the government
into thinking it's just an ordinary product and a matter of
individual choice rather than an addiction."</TE>
<TE>   Tokuaki Shobayashi, assistant director with the Lifestyle Diseases
Control section, disputes the view that tax revenue is the
government's main concern, "although it's of course a factor."
Tobacco health policy here may lag other countries' because it takes
time to collect scientific information, he said, adding that he's
confident usage will decline and social attitudes change over time.</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofit organizations, which serve as pressure groups in other
societies, have little impact here, given restrictive tax policies
and a weak tradition of social activism. Compared with the American
Cancer Society, the American Lung Assn. and others in the U.S.,
Japan's 23 most active anti-smoking civic groups rely almost
exclusively on volunteers. Their combined budget is $16,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite so many smokers and so little pressure to quit, Japan has
a per capita rate of lung cancer lower than that of the United
States, where about 23% of adults smoke. The disease claims 55,000
lives a year here, or 1 out of every 2,300 Japanese; the U.S. toll of
157,000 is roughly 1 out of 1,750 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, lung cancer overtook stomach cancer in the 1990s to
become Japan's leading cancer killer. And the numbers keep rising.</TE>
<TE>   A few scientists over the years have issued clarion calls against
the industry and voiced frustration at Japan's reluctance to accept
overseas studies, as if Japanese were physiologically different. A
JT-funded institute fills scientific journals with papers suggesting
that cancer is caused by anything but tobacco, clouding any nascent
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's collusion between JT and so-called scientific experts,"
said lawyer Isayama. "We call them lap dogs."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the courts in Japan have balked at upending the tobacco
status quo, although Araki and his fellow plaintiffs hope to change
that. Their lawsuit seeks $80,000 in damages for each, a ban on
vending machine sales, tougher warning labels and an end to what they
see as deliberate misinformation practices by JT and the government.</TE>
<TE>   Araki, a former dentist living in a nursing home in Shimotsuma,
remains hopeful that Japan will reverse what he sees as a deeply
flawed policy. Araki saw his addicted father stoop to smoking dried
grass during the war years.</TE>
<TE>   He says he started smoking when JT, then fully government-owned,
handed out free tobacco after World War II, when the country was
devastated and food was scarce. The implicit message was clear, he
says: Smoking is good for patriotism, for nation-building, for
morale.</TE>
<TE>   Araki's 50-cigarette-a-day habit caught up with him in 1981 when
he climbed the stairs to his fourth-floor office and couldn't stop
coughing. A hospital visit revealed the tumor. He scheduled an
immediate operation and gathered his terrified family around him to
deliver a message: I'm not going to die.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors gave him a year. Drawing on the inspiration of his samurai
grandfather, he fought his fate by moving from Tokyo to a tiny island
with clean air. Gasping for breath, he contracted with an oxygen
company against the advice of doctors, long before that was accepted
therapy in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become my best friend," he said, patting one of the
green cylinders to which he's attached 20 hours a day through
breathing tubes. "It's kept me alive."</TE>
<TE>   Even if he and his fellow plaintiffs win their suit, Araki said,
the settlement will cover only their expenses. Still, he said, he
hopes to teach JT and the Finance Ministry a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd really like to give them a piece of my mind," he said. "It's
my way of getting back at JT and the government for all they've done
to me."</TE>

<HD>Tanker Splits, Sinks Off Western Spain</HD>
<DH>Ship goes down near seamount known for its abundant
wildlife. The spill could become twice as big as the one from the
Exxon Valdez.</DH>

<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>A damaged oil tanker broke in two off the craggy northwest coast of
Spain and sank Tuesday, threatening an environmental disaster from a
spill twice as large as the one from the Exxon Valdez in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The single-hull Prestige was carrying intermediate-grade fuel oil,
which is less toxic than crude oil but so thick that it can smother
birds and marine mammals with a tar-like goop.</LD>
<LD>   The ship ruptured last Wednesday during a storm, sustaining a
40-foot-long crack in the hull below the waterline. In a desperate
attempt to limit the environmental damage, the Spanish government
ordered it towed out to sea.</LD>
<TE>   But the effort failed. The ship spilled about 5,000 tons of oil as
it broke up, adding to the 5,000 tons leaked earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish beaches were already mired in oil, with birds and
shellfish dying in the sludge. At least 1,000 Spanish fishermen have
been thrown out of work along the Galician coast, which boasts one of
Europe's richest fisheries. The northern part of the area has already
been dubbed "the Coast of Death."</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige was carrying 77,000 tons of fuel oil loaded in Latvia
and bound for Singapore. If it loses its entire cargo, the incident
would rank 14th among tanker spills.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest spill was that of the Atlantic Empress off Trinidad
and Tobago in 1979, at 287,000 tons. The Exxon Valdez leaked 34,000
tons of crude oil.</TE>
<TE>   Several European countries and the European Union quickly attacked
one another over the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I am horrified by the inability of those in charge, politically,
nationally and particularly at the European level, to take action to
stem the laxity which permits these ships fit only for the dustbin to
carry on," French President Jacques Chirac told reporters on a visit
near Paris. "Now we must urgently take draconian measures, both
severe and serious, even if they harm the interests of certain
companies whose interests are not worth defending."</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old Japanese-built Prestige was owned by a
Liberian-registered firm; it is registered in the Bahamas, managed in
Greece, chartered by the Swiss-based Russian oil trader Crown
Resources and classed as seaworthy by the American Bureau of
Shipping, authorities said. This adds to the difficulty of
pinpointing where greatest responsibility for the disaster might lie.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a total lack of control of maritime traffic," said Jose
Luis Garcia Varas, a World Wildlife Fund marine expert in Spain.
"Authorities don't care much about what happens in the sea. Take the
Spanish government -- dragging the ship away from the Galician coast
doesn't solve the problem. The spill is still in the sea. And, in the
end, the sea returns what you throw in it."</TE>
<TE>   The government defended its actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Spanish administration's decision to keep the ship far away
from the coast is based on trying to keep away the source of
contamination from the Spanish coast," Spanish Deputy Prime Minister
Mariano Rajoy said Tuesday while visiting the area.</TE>
<TE>   "This was especially important if new cracks appeared in the tanks
or even if the ship broke. Having the source of pollution farther
away from the coast would give us much more time to fight it in the
sea, more time to monitor it and more time to have fighting measures
available."</TE>
<TE>   The ship sank in two-mile-deep ocean 133 miles off the coast and a
dozen miles from the Galician Bank, a relatively shallow seamount
known for its rich and abundant diversity of coral, sponges, fish and
other sea life.</TE>
<TE>   European conservationists have been lobbying for the Galician Bank
to be added to the world's list of designated "particularly sensitive
sea areas." That designation by the U.N. International Maritime
Organization can restrict shipping traffic to protect fisheries and
marine life habitat. The Florida Keys and Australia's Great Barrier
Reef are among a handful of oceanic areas with such a designation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly a disaster," Garcia said. The area is home to 11
species of sharks, 86 other species of fish, including some found
nowhere else, and one of the most important cold-water coral
formations off the European coast, the World Wildlife Fund said in a
news release Tuesday. "It was a pristine area, one of the few left in
Europe," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   It will probably be at least six months before local fishermen can
again catch the octopus, sole, conger and sea bream that they ship to
Spanish cities, while local shellfish harvesters will lose two or
three years of production, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of conservationists from Spain and other countries were
trying to save 18 types of oil-covered seabirds, including gannets,
puffins, razorbills and the European shag. Besides cleaning the
birds' feathers, volunteers swabbed nostrils and suctioned their
stomach contents through tubes.</TE>
<TE>   "The area where the vessel sank is really biologically important,"
said Scott Burns, the U.S.-based director of the World Wildlife
Fund's marine conservation program. "Some of the seabird species
don't exist anywhere else in the world. If you compare this to the
Exxon Valdez spill, this has the potential to be twice as big. The
Exxon spill killed a quarter of a million birds. We are hoping that
doesn't happen here."</TE>
<TE>   Spanish soldiers and volunteers Tuesday used buckets and shovels
to remove oil along 40 miles of coastline. Detergents sometimes used
after oil spills are ineffective against fuel oil, whose density
makes it particularly difficult to clean up, said David Kennedy,
director of the U.S. Office of Response and Restoration within the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel oil is the viscous goo left at the bottom of the barrel after
refineries take gasoline and lighter components off the top. It is
less toxic than crude oil because the volatile compounds have been
removed, so it is less likely to poison fish and wildlife. It is
generally used to power large engines.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional means such as skimming it from the surface often don't
work, Kennedy said. The oil, which needs to be warmed before it can
be pumped, clogs up skimming equipment or bobs just below the surface
and out of reach of skimmers or chemical dispersants.</TE>
<TE>   After the Prestige's hull cracked, no port was willing to take in
the stricken vessel to allow repairs or transfer of the oil to
another ship. The crew was airlifted to safety last week. The
tanker's Greek captain, Apostolus Maguras, was jailed on charges of
failing to cooperate with emergency rescue vessels and harming the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Experts gave varying accounts of what could happen to the oil on
board. Some said that the containers holding oil may have already
imploded from the pressure as the ship sank, that they might crack
upon hitting the ocean floor or that they could become a kind of time
bomb, eventually rusting through and releasing the oil.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts predicted that the ocean bottom chill will solidify
the oil and keep it in place, limiting the environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige passed its annual inspection in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, in May and more extensive scrutiny in 2001, when it was
hauled out of the water in Guangzhou, China, for its 25th
anniversary, according to inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Spain and Portugal disputed which country had responsibility for
the area where the ship sank and argued over responsibility for
cleanup efforts. Spain's Interior Ministry said the Prestige went
down in an area where Portugal had responsibility for maritime
rescues.</TE>
<TE>   Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Durao Barroso said it was
"absolutely sure and confirmed" by his country's navy that the tanker
sank in Spanish waters.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish authorities have charged that port inspectors in Gibraltar
should have spotted problems with the ship during its stops in the
British colony.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in complete compliance with our standards," said Stewart
Wade, vice president of the nonprofit American Bureau of Shipping in
Houston. "What went wrong? We literally do not know."</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige was operated by Greece-based Universe Maritime Ltd.
That firm said the stricken vessel had been exposed to storms by the
Spanish government's order that it be towed away from shore.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union adopted tougher measures on ship inspections
after the tanker Erika broke apart and sank in 1999, spilling 3
million gallons of fuel oil and damaging 250 miles of French
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   The rules require ports to inspect at least 25% of all ships
coming in, with an emphasis on older, single-hulled vessels.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen</DL>
<LD>This country's security forces are looking for a suspected Al Qaeda
member who narrowly escaped a missile attack by an unmanned CIA plane
that killed six people this month, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the first apparent admission that Yemen consented to the
strike, Interior Minister Rashid Alimi said, "This operation was
carried out ... as part of security coordination and cooperation
between Yemen and the United States."</LD>
<LD>   Alimi also said in a statement carried by the state news agency
Saba that a seventh Al Qaeda member left the car moments before it
was hit by a missile in the province of Marib on Nov. 3. He did not
identify the fugitive.</LD>
<TE>   Yemeni opposition groups have criticized the attack and the
government's previous silence about it.</TE>
<TE>   The main target of the attack, Qaed Sinan Harithi, was a key
suspect in the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in a Yemeni port in
2000, an attack that killed 17 American sailors. U.S. officials
believe Harithi was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen's statement Tuesday identified four other men in the car.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth man was earlier identified as Kamal Derwish, also known
as Ahmed Hijazi, a U.S. citizen. U.S. officials have alleged that
Derwish headed an Al Qaeda-linked group in Lackawanna, N.Y.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Reckoning for Harm to Jews," Commentary, Nov. 18: I believe
that Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's anti-Catholic statements regarding
alleged transgressions against Jews are false and damaging to Jewish
relations with all Christians. I was educated in Catholic schools for
12 years and was never indoctrinated with any anti-Jewish teachings,
nor was I taught that Jews killed Jesus.</LD>
<LD>   Most of us have heard that 6 million Jews perished in the
Holocaust, but unfortunately little is heard about the millions of
others who were murdered as well. Why don't we hear about the other
half of the awful tragedy? Is it because they were less important:
homosexuals, Gypsies and, yes, Christians and not "God's chosen
people"? Isn't it time for all to heal these old wounds and for all
people to be treated with the same level of respect and dignity?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen says "The [Roman Catholic] church must stop being a
political institution embodied in the Vatican state because that is
antithetical to being a moral institution." As a Protestant who
agrees with that, I wonder when Israel is going to become a moral
institution.</TE>

<LD>In "There Shouldn't Be a Remote Control on How We Watch DVDs"
(Commentary, Nov. 11), Ernest Miller writes, "Technology has given
consumers the ability to control how they watch movies in their
homes, and the [Directors Guild of America] wants to take that
control away by banning the technology."</LD>
<LD>   Nonsense. Consumers have the absolute ability to control how they
watch movies in their own homes. Our lawsuit isn't about companies
selling tools to create alternate versions. It's about companies
selling their own versions of someone else's film. What a company
such as MovieMask does is neither the legal nor the ethical
equivalent of using a remote control. MovieMask creates "fixed"
alternative versions of films. It sells software that presents its
own preprogrammed, derivative versions of the films. MovieMask boasts
that soon-to-be-released future versions of its "masks" will not just
have the ability to remove but also to add things (such as product
placements) and to change images (such as swords into light sabers in
"The Princess Bride" or an actress' wardrobe) and words.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers can use their remotes to fast-forward through scenes,
press "mute" to eliminate language they find offensive, watch the
same scene over and over again or do anything else they want. A
consumer can even edit a videotape he or she has purchased. But this
is not the issue involved here. MovieMask, CleanFlicks and the other
companies want to make a business out of selling their own versions
of someone else's work -- and that's just wrong.</TE>

<LD>Re "Jury Orders Gun Seller to Pay," Nov. 15: When will this
foolishness end? An angry student, Nathaniel Brazill, walks into a
classroom and kills his teacher with a legally produced and sold
handgun. However, because the gun doesn't have a "safety feature,"
the manufacturer is found partially liable.</LD>
<LD>   This shooting was no "accident." Are we to believe that Brazill
wouldn't have disengaged the safety device before firing? Former
tobacco industry prosecutor -- now turned handgun industry prosecutor
-- Bob Montgomery asserts that Brazill (among others) wouldn't have
been "visited" by this "tragedy" had it not been for the gun
manufacturer. Mischaracterizations continue to line trial attorneys'
pockets in gold while simultaneously destroying our justice system.</LD>

to hear Alan Lloyd declare that diesel-powered vehicles will become
part of the solution in California's effort to clean the air. I've
just been diagnosed with smog-induced asthma severe enough to mimic a
heart attack (emergency room visit, 40% of my lung capacity gone). I
sure hope those diesels come soon to clean the air so I don't have to
leave the state in order to breathe. You can tell I'm sarcastic,

<LD>The issue of long lines and wait times at Department of Motor
Vehicles offices has our complete attention ("Going to DMV? Bring a
Book," Nov. 12). Budgetary constraints, population growth and now
procedures to combat identity theft and fraud have combined to add to
the overall time needed to complete transactions. Even so,
implementation of the DMV-Q system to manage staff workload has also
produced some decrease in wait times statewide (even in Los Angeles).</LD>
<LD>   In the 10 busiest offices in Southern California, registration
wait times dropped about nine minutes, and driver's license wait
times dropped about five minutes in the last fiscal year. In the next
year, we will bring 33 more of our larger offices online.</LD>
<LD>   And in the past year we have urged customers to make appointments,
either by phone or over the Internet. Customers who do so have wait
times far below the statewide average of 24 minutes for a
registration or licensing transaction. Somewhere around Thanksgiving,
a million Californians will have registered their vehicles over the
Internet, with their own computers, from their homes and offices.
Those customers didn't have to make a visit to a DMV office.</LD>
<TE>   We will continue to work as hard as we can to serve our more than
20 million customers each year at the DMV.</TE>
<TE>   We think we're on the right track, and we will continue to
implement our vision of friendly, courteous and professional customer
service.</TE>

<TE>   After reading your article, I was prepared for a long wait. I
arrived at the Thousand Oaks DMV 20 minutes before my appointment,
was treated in an efficient and courteous manner and was on my way

not have been more pleasant. Kudos to the Thousand Oaks DMV for a job
well done.</TE>

<LD>Re "Australia Hunts for Terror Cells," Nov. 17: So, Australian
intelligence officers have raided the homes of Indonesian immigrants
in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. They sometimes (gasp!) break down the
doors in their search for evidence of terrorists. Australian Islamic
leaders contend that the police tactics were an overreaction by a
conservative government hostile to Muslim immigrants. This following
the deaths of Australian tourists in the Bali blast of Oct. 12.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no reason to come with weapons and make everyone
scared," whined one of the suspects, a recently naturalized
Australian citizen with terrorist connections. Way to go, Aussies!

<LD>"Studies See Big Quake as More Likely" (Nov. 17) had a subhead
reading, "Magnitude 7 or higher temblor on San Andreas fault in
Inland Empire, Palm Springs may occur sooner than thought." Really!
The 74 paleoseismologists presumably responsible for that finding
should have saved time and listened to a mere biologist from UCLA who
years ago set the science for earthquake prognostication. He
observed: "The longer it's been since the last, the nearer it is to
the next."</LD>

<LD>Re "Antonovich Backs Moving Old Oak," Nov. 19: Huzzah to tree sitter
John Quigley! L.A. County Supervisor Michael Antonovich saw the
handwriting on the wall, counted the votes and has agreed to move the
oak tree to a safe location. Quigley sent a message as to the power
of the "plain folks" and the little guy to the big-time developers
and politicians. The bottom-liners may just get the message: You
can't do whatever you want, you can't lay waste to things that are
irreplaceable.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The developer will win this one. What appears to be a fair
compromise, attempting to relocate the magnificent oak tree in Santa
Clarita, will surely fail. A 400-year-old oak cannot be successfully
transplanted because the root ball is equal in size to the tree's
canopy. So much root volume would be lost during the transplant that
the tree would die. Spare the tree. Move the road.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading your Nov. 18 story, I decided to see the
400-year-old oak tree. There is plenty of right-of-way to construct
two lanes of the county road to the north of the tree, and the same
for two lanes to the south. This magnificent tree is much older than
our nation. It may cost a few more dollars to accomplish, but the
developer would have a historical tree as his gateway to the housing
tract. Ironically, the names of streets in the John Laing Homes
subdivision are Whispering Oaks, Royal Oaks, Southern Oaks and Arbor
Lane. You'd think that saving one of the oldest trees in the area
would be in the developer's interest.</TE>
<TE>   Jack McGrath</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's refusal to give up his fight to prevent the destruction
or relocation of the tree can only be called principled -- even
courageous. Unfortunately, authorities do have to do something about
the increasing traffic problems in the area. The congestion is
getting worse every year. I have to believe the tree will understand.</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Gives Boost to Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH>Five projects that will provide 224 units for lower-income
families are in the pipeline. A $34-million bond sale will help pay
for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bolstered by a $34-million bond sale, Simi Valley officials are
trying to offset skyrocketing housing prices by underwriting the
construction of 224 affordable housing units in five projects by
2005.</LD>
<LD>   As other Ventura County cities scramble to house their working
poor, young families and entry-level professionals, Simi Valley is
tackling the issue head on, officials and housing experts said.</LD>
<LD>   "The city has been on the record about the need to house all its
working families and to provide rental and ownership opportunities
for people with lower incomes," said Bernardo Perez, a project
manager with Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., builder of two Simi
Valley projects that will include affordable units.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday night, the Simi Valley City Council endorsed two
proposals that would provide 93 apartments for moderate-income
residents who earn up to $54,400 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the population has come to realize that when you're
talking about affordable housing, you're talking about your
policeman, your fireman, your schoolteacher," Mayor Bill Davis said.
"People are looking at affordable housing a little bit differently
than they did years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-one affordable units will be available in the 324-unit
Parker Ranch apartment complex next to the Metrolink station in
central Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The council agreed Monday to issue $34 million in bonds to help
finance the $49-million project developed by Essex Property Trust of
Palo Alto. The city also is contributing a $3.2-million low-interest
loan.</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled to be completed in late 2004, monthly rents on the one-
to three-bedroom apartments would range from $708 to $871. The market
rate for rental apartments in Simi Valley is $1,049 for a one-bedroom
to $1,439 for a three-bedroom. The difference is offset by city
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very aggressive about it," Dulce Conde-Sierra, a city
housing official, said of the program. "Almost anyone who comes to us
... we try to find a way to find an affordable component. We have a
lot of things going right now."</TE>
<TE>   The other project endorsed this week is the 12-unit Peppertree
apartment complex, an existing property that will be purchased for $1
million by the nonprofit Area Housing Authority of Ventura County and
offered to lower-income families.</TE>
<TE>   The complex on east Los Angeles Avenue is the perfect first
purchase for the authority in Simi Valley, because it's in good
condition and will require little renovation, said Douglas Tapking,
authority executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "The needs are crying out more and more, the timing is right, it's
a good piece of property and the price was right," Tapking said.</TE>
<TE>   The city was not asked to contribute but may be approached to help
with minor renovations, Tapking said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on tap for Simi Valley are 11 single-family homes dedicated
to lower-income households in a 26-unit development south of
California 118.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuehner Homes development won city approval in October.
Construction on the three- and four-bedroom houses should begin early
next year, said Perez of the Cabrillo group.</TE>
<TE>   A second project by Cabrillo will provide 34 affordable three- and
four-bedroom apartments in a 70-unit complex called Plaza del Sol.</TE>
<TE>   One block east of the Civic Center, the development will offer
townhouse-style apartments, a community center and a swimming pool,
Perez said. The city is providing a $1.4-million low-interest loan,
so nearly half of the Plaza del Sol homes are reserved for
lower-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   "To their credit, they stepped up," Perez said of the city.
"Typically, cities don't want more than 25% affordable [in a
project]. But they saw the benefit."</TE>
<TE>   A final project in the pipeline is a 176-unit senior center that
will be considered by the City Council next month. Called Vintage
Paseo, the development would be built across Tapo Canyon Road from
the Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   The city will regulate rents on 86 units but virtually all of them
will be "affordable," Conde-Sierra said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a period of two months, we will have four complexes approved,"
Conde Sierra said. "We have been negotiating or discussing these
projects for a very long time. Coincidentally, they've all come to
fruition at the same time."</TE>

<LD>Police say the suspects had razor blades and 50 gallons of gasoline
to make bombs with, SS uniforms and replica cans of the gas the Nazis
used in their death camps.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests this week of the two suspects -- plus another man --
with links to white supremacy groups reflects authorities' heightened
concerns about such organizations, though experts say most of their
activities are geared less toward violence than pushing their message
of hate.</LD>
<LD>   Although violent hate crimes committed by members of groups such
as Aryan Nations are relatively infrequent, the organizations are
aggressively courting supporters.</LD>
<TE>   The Costa Mesa-based Aryan Baby Drive provides food, clothing and
other supplies to poor white racist families.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Aryan Nations Web site features audio
links to "Music for White Kids." A Ku Klux Klan group held a concert
last weekend in Lake Elsinore, and the Aryan Nations tried -- but
failed -- to throw a party in La Habra earlier this year for Hitler's
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement and hate-crime experts said the groups are small,
with interlocking memberships. But there are probably hundreds of
sympathizers who participate in their activities.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very tiny groups that are given attention way out of
proportion to their numbers because their message is so odious," said
Rusty Kennedy, chairman of Orange County's Human Relations
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The three extremists arrested Monday -- one Long Beach man, an
Anaheim woman and her boyfriend -- face various charges including
perjury and owning bomb-making materials.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said the crackdown was meant in part to
discourage others from joining the groups. "I hope this would have a
chilling effect on those who might have some misperception about the
legitimacy of these extremist groups, to chill their sense of wanting
to act on their ill-placed hatred," said Nicholas S. Thompson, the
Orange County deputy district attorney in charge of tracking
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   He said his office stepped up surveillance of white supremacists
after the Sept. 11 attacks. More recently, he said, surveillance was
intensified because of worry that Palestinian-Israeli violence might
encourage racists to attack Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have no evidence of plots by local extremists. But a
letter discovered in the Long Beach apartment of one suspect, John
Frederick Steele II, talks of teaming up with Palestinians against
the U.S. and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Greenspan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said Steele was trying to recruit people at an event on the Queen
Mary in Long Beach this summer not by proposing violence but by
appealing to racism.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said racist and anti-Semitic leaflets have cropped up in
recent months at a movie theater parking lot in Fullerton and in
Tustin. E-mail invitations to the Church of Israel in Stanton were
sent out saying: "We're all separatists so no blacks, jews, or
hippies allowed."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said the clear aim of these and other campaigns is to
recruit younger members. "I am just concerned about this kind of
information feeding individuals who are looking for excuses and
places to blame," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Levin, director of Cal State San Bernardino's Center for the
Study of Hate and Extremism, said that only 5% to 10% of hate crimes
are committed by members of white supremacist groups but that they
commit the most violent assaults.</TE>
<TE>   Although recruiting appears to be the primary focus today,
authorities said they fear that extremists might become frustrated
and resort to violence in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Lt. Adam Bercovici, who tracks racist groups,
cited the example of Buford O. Furrow, a neo-Nazi who wounded five
people, at a San Fernando Valley Jewish center and killed a
Philippine American postman.</TE>
<TE>   Bercovici said an intelligence source told police that Steele was
frustrated and might be getting ready to take violent action. And
Thompson, the Orange County prosecutor, said Steele appeared to be
casing L.A.'s Museum of Tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, authorities this week charged Christine
Greenwood and her boyfriend, John Patrick McCabe, with having
bomb-making materials in their Anaheim apartment. They also had BBs,
razor blades and 16-penny nails that could be used as shrapnel,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   The material was discovered during a search of the apartment in
1999. McCabe was on probation for a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until after the Sept. 11 attacks that authorities
turned their emphasis to terrorism, and the Orange County Probation
Department took the information about the bomb-making materials to
the district attorney's office, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Steele was charged with perjury and falsifying documents related
to financial statements he was required to give his probation
officer. He was on probation for assault with a deadly weapon that
was not classified as a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court. His
bail was set at $50,000. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Nov.
27.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   The three were involved in a variety of racist groups. Greenwood
was a member of Women for Aryan Unity and founder of the Aryan Baby
Drive. She and McCabe were active with Blood and Honour, which
promotes racist rock music.</TE>
<TE>   Steele was higher in the white supremacist leadership. He was head
of the state chapter of Aryan Nations and was involved with the KKK
and the National Alliance, Bercovici said.</TE>
<TE>   Steele refused to tell his probation officer the whereabouts of
four guns of which he is the registered owner, Thompson said. Steele
said only that he gave the guns to his friends and that they would be
found when the Aryan Nations "goes to war" against the American
government and the Jews, the prosecutor added.</TE>

<HD>Backers Seek to Save Autism Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Parents and scientists appealed to the Legislature on Tuesday to
protect from state budget cuts a pioneering California program aimed
at reversing a statewide epidemic of autism among children.</LD>
<LD>   They testified at a hearing of the Assembly Health Committee about
the newly verified disclosure that California saw a 273% increase in
autism cases -- an average of nine diagnoses each day -- from 1988 to
1998.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists do not know what caused the dramatic surge in the
neurological disorder, which typically afflicts children before age
3. But a study released last month by scientists at UC Davis
discounted such potential causes as migration to the state, a
relaxation in criteria used to diagnose autism or improved diagnoses.</LD>
<TE>   Autism affects more boys than girls, and sufferers typically
shrink into their own worlds of isolation, do not communicate with
parents or family and do not develop social skills. No cure has been
found.</TE>
<TE>   However, using a combination of private and public funds,
California has launched a campaign to discover the cause of autism
and to provide special therapy and education programs for autistic
people.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at the hearing Tuesday acknowledged that California
faces a $21.1-billion budget shortfall for 2003-04 and that severe
cuts in services may be required. But they appealed for protection of
regional diagnostic and service centers run by the state Department
of Developmental Services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are adding an average of nine children a day, seven days a
week [to the rolls of autism]," warned Rick Rollens, the father of an
autistic son and co-founder of a public-private research center known
as the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Institute at UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a public health crisis," he said. "We cannot, as a
state, afford to lose a generation." He said the regional centers
were "overwhelmed by these new cases."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Davis administration added $17 million to the
budget to help cope with the epidemic of autism. California law
requires that services must be provided to those with autism or
mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), chairman of the health
panel, said he plans to seek additional funds for research, but
probably not from the state general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly going to be an advocate for more money, but in this
budget year, our focus is going to have to be on Washington and
private sources for more funds," he said.</TE>

<HD>Parents Charged With Murder in Girl's Death</HD>
<DH>The 2-year-old was unconscious overnight before they sought
help, authorities say. The pair also face torture and child-abuse
counts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a 2-year-old girl who was kicked and punched until she
was immobile and eventually died were charged Tuesday in Long Beach
with murder, torture and child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Rich Goul said Maria Mendoza was declared dead
Thursday at a Huntington Beach hospital, where paramedics had taken
the unconscious girl after her Tijuana-bound parents noticed that she
wasn't breathing and pulled over to call 911.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary autopsy results indicate that Maria suffered a split
small intestine, and that the weapon was a fist and shod feet,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Raul Mendoza, 26, and Martha Lopez, 23, who also have a 3-year-old
son and a baby due any day, were charged Tuesday in a criminal
complaint that outlines the case and three counts against them.</TE>
<TE>   Both were charged with one count of premeditated murder, one count
of assault on a child causing death and one count of torture. They
face maximum sentences of 32 years to life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   However, prosecutors are examining the possibility of adding an
as-yet unspecified special circumstance to the murder charge, which
would make it a capital case with a maximum penalty of life in prison
without possibility of parole, or death.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot depends on the medical reports and further investigation,"
said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza and Lopez appeared separately in Long Beach Superior Court
on Tuesday, where Judge Patrick T. Madden ordered that they be held
without bail pending arraignment Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the hearings, Mendoza closed his eyes in a pained
expression and shook his head. Lopez, who was described by her public
defender as "overdue," stared at the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Goul said Mendoza is an oil driller, and the family moved to Long
Beach four months ago from El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   According to Goul, an Orange County coroner's autopsy revealed
numerous injuries in various states of healing, indicating a pattern
over time of child abuse. Mendoza is suspected of most of the kicking
and blows, but "the mother is also responsible for some of the
injuries," Goul said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were signs of multiple, long-standing scars and signs of
physical trauma ... brutal assaults," said Goul, who will prosecute
the case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday evening, Maria was hurt severely enough to be
rendered "immobile from about 10 o'clock thereon into the morning of
the 14th," Goul said. "I can say blows were inflicted in Long Beach
over a period starting Nov. 13 into the morning of Nov. 14th."</TE>
<TE>   The parents were driving to Tijuana on Thursday when, they said,
they saw that Maria was not breathing. They were in Huntington Beach
when they stopped to call paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's 3-year-old son did not show signs of injury, Goul
said.</TE>
<TE>   He is in the protective custody of the county Department of
Children's Services and eventually will be placed in foster care, as
will their expected child.</TE>

<HD>Trouble Started Early in Life for Rape Suspect</HD>
<DH>Son of a soldier killed in Vietnam, the man held in Belmont
Shore case was arrested several times as a teen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride and Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The woman still lives in the same Belmont Shore house. She got a dog
and an alarm system and has healed since that balmy summer night.
Thirteen years ago, as her three children slumbered, a man pounced on
her in her darkened bedroom. He wore only gray underwear.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked him out of it, before he tried anything," the woman
recalled last week. "I told him my kids could wake up, that my
husband would be home soon."</LD>
<LD>   "Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me, I have three little
kids," she remembers telling him.</LD>
<TE>   "He said, 'I won't hurt you. I'm just hungry.' "</TE>
<TE>   Padding into her kitchen, the near-naked intruder held her wrists
high behind her. She offered to cook something.</TE>
<TE>   The man stared into the freezer, and a few minutes later,
clutching frozen tortillas, sliced turkey and blue ice pops, walked
out the back of her house.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wayne Rathbun, then 19, was arrested about an hour later,
just down the street. A month later, he pleaded guilty to burglary
and false imprisonment by violence. After 10 months, he was out of
jail.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Rathbun, 32, will be arraigned on 64 counts of burglary,
forcible rape, rape with a foreign object, oral copulation and
sodomy. The charges cover just some of the 31 attacks police
attribute to a single man, widely referred to as the Belmont Shore
rapist, because many of the attacks occurred in that area of Long
Beach. Rathbun is being held in lieu of $11-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   The crime against the Belmont Shore woman, who asked not to be
identified because of her children, was possibly Act One. Although no
sex crime occurred, the incident chillingly resembled the later
attacks, in all of which the man was nude or in briefs.</TE>
<TE>   The case indicates that Rathbun -- the son of a soldier killed in
Vietnam and a deeply religious mother who supported them as a
waitress in the Philippines and cafeteria cook in Long Beach -- was
troubled early on.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, he was arrested on suspicion of being a peeping Tom.
Shortly after turning 18, he pleaded guilty to two charges of
misdemeanor trespassing.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, he was arrested after he sneaked into a Belmont
Shore house and took a beer. He pleaded guilty again to misdemeanor
trespassing and spent a month in County Jail and a year on probation.</TE>
<TE>   He was 19 when he leaped onto the Belmont Shore woman as she
slept.</TE>
<TE>   This from a man who, as a boy, had encouraged his mother to
evangelize with a Catholic group called the Legion of Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun's tale begins around 1967, when his mother, Alice Rathbun,
now 75, met Joshua Godined while he was stationed at a naval base in
the Philippines. She was a waitress at the base. They dated for a
year or so, but never married, and in 1969 Godined was killed in an
ambush at the Mekong River.</TE>
<TE>   Mark was born Jan. 20, 1970. He was 5 when Alice told him about
his father, about how he died. Mark's longing for a dad, she said,
was a lifelong ache.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to have a father," Alice Rathbun said, "and after that
he always blamed me that he didn't have a father."</TE>
<TE>   An Average Student</TE>
<TE>   Alice raised Mark alone in the city of Olongapo. Mark learned
English from American neighbor children, and a teacher thought Mark
had leadership potential because of his English. But Mark was
comfortable, she said, being an average student.</TE>
<TE>   He would ditch school to surf in his teens, but even in grade
school, Mark had cut classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when I'd say, 'How come you didn't go to school?' "
Alice Rathbun said, "he says, 'If I had a father, he would spank me.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Alice had two sisters in Long Beach. When Mark was 14, she decided
to move there. As a ninth-grader, Mark attended Rogers Middle School.
In August 1985, a month before he started at Long Beach Polytechnic
High School, police arrested him for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   To boyhood friends, he was known as a peaceful guy with a big
grin, a clean-cut guy who never expressed anger.</TE>
<TE>   When the others partied using heavy drugs, Mark was the one who
stayed clean. "We partied and we were up to no good," said Chris Van
Mulligen, a boyhood friend. "Mark wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   His junior yearbook photo is of a grinning Mark, age 17, in the
white uniform of the junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. But
before his senior year he dropped out. He eventually earned a diploma
through adult school. He jumped from job to job -- bagging groceries,
grooming dogs, delivering Christmas trees, working as a helper to a
handyman and a plumber.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, he moved to Seattle. Alice Rathbun remembers
that a flier advertising get-rich commercial fishing jobs in Alaska
prompted his move.</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of traffic citations places Rathbun there by Oct. 1,
1995. Police cited him repeatedly for driving without a license,
without insurance, with an open container of alcohol -- so many
tickets and failures to appear that bench warrants were issued for
his arrest. On various traffic stops he was arrested and jailed a
day. Then he would plead guilty, get credit for the night spent in
jail and be released.</TE>
<TE>   The first two of the sexual assaults that eventually would be
linked to the Belmont Shore rapist occurred in Seattle while Rathbun
was there, on May 13 and Aug. 1, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   After one victim helped a police artist produce a composite, Long
Beach Police Cmdr. Linda Beardslee said, the rapist always covered
his face, the victim's face or both, and shielded his hands with
things like gloves or socks.</TE>
<TE>   The last court record placing Rathbun in Seattle was in October
1996, when he was arrested and jailed on more traffic warrants.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Long Beach late that year. On Jan. 17, 1997, the
first Southern California attack occurred. A woman was assaulted in
Long Beach near Vista and Temple streets -- not far from the house
Rathbun had broken into in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Four more women were attacked that year, but the frequency of the
assaults increased in 1998, when three women were attacked in May,
three in July, one in September and another in November. The predator
continued his pattern of entering through unlocked doors and windows.</TE>
<TE>   Police only late last week revealed that three of the women were
attacked a second time by the same man -- a frail 77-year-old Long
Beach woman was sexually assaulted twice in 17 days and knew by voice
and appearance that it was the same man.</TE>
<TE>   By that summer, anxiety gripped the neighborhoods of east Long
Beach. Pepper spray often sold out at Billings Hardware in the heart
of Belmont Shore. The Belmont Shore Business Assn. offered a $10,000
reward. A flier with a composite drawing of a man wearing a knit ski
cap snowed the large communities of the east side.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 18, 1998, the assault of a 54-year-old woman in Belmont
Shore led to the much-heralded arrest of Jeff Grant, a city employee
who ran the adult softball leagues. Bloodhounds had led police from
the victim's home to his apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, then engaged, denied attacking anyone, and his fiance and
family stood by him. He was jailed for three months before DNA
testing exonerated him.</TE>
<TE>   Wrongly Accused</TE>
<TE>   A federal jury would later find the city of Long Beach liable for
$1.7 million for wrongfully arresting and detaining Grant. The city
has appealed the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   While Grant was in jail, another assault occurred, but police did
not link the incident to the serial rapist because the previous
attacks had been of older woman and closer to Belmont Shore. In
addition, police thought they had their suspect. But the DNA evidence
tied four rapes together. Four years later, it would tie the cases to
Rathbun.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, the number of attacks continued to grow, and the
rapist's strike zone widened across the Orange County line, to a
trailer park in Los Alamitos where two senior citizens were attacked
a half-hour apart.</TE>
<TE>   One victim, 74, lives in Huntington Beach. She was watching the
12th inning of an Angel game this August and crocheting doilies when
she heard a strange noise. "I thought it was the possums," she said
in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she checked the sliding door she kept slightly open to let
in fresh air. There was nothing unusual so she went to bed. Within
minutes, she heard a suspicious thump.</TE>
<TE>   When she dialed 911, a man grabbed her waist from behind, she
recalled. He threw her to the ground, tried to cover her face with
his gloved hand and tried to pull off her underwear.</TE>
<TE>   She kicked and screamed, trying to pull the rough white shop towel
wrapped around his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I was too mad at him to be afraid for my life," she said. "I was
furious."</TE>
<TE>   The man "came in ready to rape me," wearing only a mesh thong, she
said. She tried to poke his eyes, but he was too tall. She then
grabbed his genitals, and he fled through the sliding door.</TE>
<TE>   Police, as they had for years, warned the public. They also noted
that many women had fought off their attacker, scratching and leaving
visible injuries. A bite, in fact, would help break the case, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, a 30-year-old Long Beach woman fought off a man who
attacked her in her house, biting his finger in the process. An
armada of patrol units sealed off the neighborhood. A neighbor
pointed officers toward a man on a bike. He said he thought he had
seen the man run across his yard.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Rathbun, who had an injured finger. Rathbun, who
two days earlier had volunteered as a poll worker on election day,
was arrested on suspicion of possessing a crack pipe, and voluntarily
submitted to a saliva swab to provide a DNA sample.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives followed him until test results matched Rathbun's DNA
to a dozen other cases, police said. Rathbun called his mother that
night and said to expect police at their apartment. Then he hung up.</TE>

<TE>   A string of attacks</TE>
<TE>   A Long Beach man, Mark Wayne Rathbun, 32, faces numerous charges
in a series of rapes over a six-year period. A timeline shows when
the attacks occurred, by date, time and age of victim. The crimes

<HD>B. Plucknett, 48; Discus Thrower Set Two World Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Plucknett, a great American discus thrower who twice set the
world record in 1981, has died. He was 48.</LD>
<LD>   Plucknett died Sunday at his home in Essex, Mo. The cause of death
was a brain aneurysm.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors to his home found him soon after his collapse Sunday
morning and summoned emergency help, but he was pronounced dead at
the scene, officials of the funeral home handling the arrangements
told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Plucknett set the world discus record of 237 feet, 4 inches on
July 7, 1981, in Stockholm, according to USA Track &amp; Field, governing
body for the sport in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   His showing in Stockholm broke his first world record, a throw of
233 feet, 7 inches set in Modesto on May 16, 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Plucknett's world record was broken by a 243-foot throw in 1986 by
Jurgen Schult of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Plucknett's mark of 237-4, however, still stands as the top discus
performance by a U.S. athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "A testament to his greatness is how long the U.S. record has been
in place. It's very, very impressive. He is one of the greatest
throwers this country has produced," USA Track &amp; Field spokesman Tom
Surber said Tuesday in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Plucknett was born in Beatrice, Neb. He lettered in track and
field at the University of Missouri from 1973 to 1976.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, he was inducted into the school's athletic hall of fame.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 Plucknett, who weighed 300 pounds when competing,
qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, but did not participate
because of the U.S. boycott of the Moscow games.</TE>
<TE>   He finished fourth in the 1988 Olympic trials, just short of
qualifying for the U.S. team in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Plucknett's career was marred by allegations of steroid use.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he was banned for life by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation. That ban was later cut to 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Plucknett is survived by his mother, a brother and a sister.</TE>

<HD>Bill Berry, 72; Band Leader, Duke Ellington's Trumpeter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Berry, a renowned jazz cornetist and trumpet player who played
with the Duke Ellington Orchestra in the 1960s and later formed Bill
Berry and the L.A. Band, one of the West Coast's leading big band
ensembles, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Berry, who played in "The Merv Griffin Show" band for 15 years,
died of lung cancer Nov. 13 at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Berry played trumpet with the Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson
bands before joining Ellington in 1961 as one of the orchestra's
first white members. He toured and recorded with Ellington until
1964, then began a long association with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis
Orchestra in New York City.</LD>
<TE>   In 1965, he began his 15-year association with the "Merv Griffin
Show" band. He formed his own big band, the New York Band, in 1970.
After the Griffin show moved to the West Coast a year later, Berry
re-formed his ensemble as Bill Berry and the L.A. Band, which he
continued to lead on a part-time basis for the next 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved Bill Berry," said trumpet player Jack Sheldon, who worked
with Berry on the Griffin show and played in Berry's L.A. Band. "He
was always a great trumpet player; he had really good time. And he
was the best band leader. He handled the band really well."</TE>
<TE>   "He knew how to get what he wanted out of the band in a very
relaxed way -- nice and easy, no shouting," said Jack Nimitz, a
baritone saxophonist who was a charter member of Berry's L.A. Band
and also played with Berry on "The Merv Griffin Show."</TE>
<TE>   " 'It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing' -- that was
Bill Berry all the way," Nimitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Berry was born into the business. The son of a bass player in a
touring dance band, Berry was born in 1930. His birthplace was Benton
Harbor, Mich., but only because that's where the band was playing at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on the road when he was only a few months old," Berry's
wife, Betty, said Monday. "He slept in the bass case under the
bandstand."</TE>
<TE>   At age 5, Berry began taking piano lessons in South Bend, Ind.,
his parents' home base. He started playing trumpet in high school in
Cincinnati, where his parents had moved.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1947, he went out on the road for three years,
playing one-nighters throughout the Midwest in a band led by Don
Strickland.</TE>
<TE>   "All the bands had sleeper buses because they didn't pay enough to
afford hotels," Berry recalled. "We used to check in once a week on
Mondays, just to take a bath."</TE>
<TE>   After playing in Air Force bands for four years while stationed in
Texas and Iceland in the early '50s, Berry studied at the Cincinnati
College of Music, then attended Berklee College of Music in Boston
before landing a job playing with Woody Herman.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, he joined Maynard Ferguson's band. While playing with
Ferguson's band at Birdland in New York City in 1961, Berry recalled
in a 1997 interview with The Times, "this guy came into the club
almost every night where we were playing and kept asking me, 'Don't
you think you should meet Ellington?' And I'd say, 'Everybody should
meet Ellington.' "</TE>
<TE>   Berry finally accompanied the man to the Apollo Theater, where he
met Ellington.</TE>
<TE>   As Berry climbed down a narrow, winding wrought-iron stairway from
the dressing room, he recalled, "This guy stops me and asks me if I
can go out with the band later that week. It turned out to be the
band manager, and the guy I was with turned out to be Duke's press
agent."</TE>
<TE>   As Berry recalled, "I went through all the civil-rights era with
Ellington. None of the bands were integrated except Maynard's. Not
Basie's. Not Ellington's, really....</TE>
<TE>   "I stayed with them in the black hotels in the South and it was
fine. They took everything in stride. Ellington saw it as somebody
else's problem."</TE>
<TE>   Berry, whose L.A. big band featured other former Ellington sidemen
over the years, has been described as one of "the definitive
interpreters of Duke Ellington's music."</TE>
<TE>   Berry once described his old boss as "the only guy I ever met that
I knew right off the bat was a genius."</TE>
<TE>   "Duke Ellington changed my whole life," Berry told The Times last
year. "He changed my outlook about everything, and not just music."</TE>
<TE>   Heart bypass surgery in 1995 did not slow Berry down. He continued
to travel as a soloist several times a year to Britain, Europe and
Japan, as well as playing locally and doing studio work.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 2000, he served as musical director and his wife
produced the annual International Jazz Party, which brought Japanese
and American musicians together for a one-night performance in
Monterey and three in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Berry began a seven-year stint as musical director of the
Monterey Jazz Festival. At the same time, he began directing the
Monterey Jazz Festival High School All Star Band.</TE>
<TE>   His yearlong battle with cancer didn't prevent him from taking the
latest student all-stars on a tour of Japan in August or from
conducting them in September at the Monterey Jazz Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved to teach," said Betty Berry, his wife of 42 years. The
former teacher recalled that her husband "used to say to me when I
was teaching, 'I don't see how you stand those kids.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then I saw him working with them," she said. "He turned around
and I could see there were tears rolling down his face. I thought,
'You've got the bug.' He loved to teach."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Berry is survived by his son, William
Berry of Englewood, Colo., and daughter, Lisa McLaughlin, of
Tallmadge, Ohio; one grandchild; and a brother, Jim, of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services are being planned.</TE>

<LD>The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to postpone a decision on cuts
to the county health-care system until January "pending further
discussions" with state and federal officials.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal authorities have discouraged hopes for a
bailout, but county officials believe bids for aid will be helped by
the passage earlier this month of Measure B, a tax to fund trauma and
emergency centers.</LD>

<HD>Prayer Finds an Opening in L.A. School</HD>
<DH>A Christian group's legal victory allows it free access to
L.A. Unified campuses</DH>

<LD>The gathering opened with a prayer and a song: "Good news, good news,
Christ died for me."</LD>
<LD>   Next, the cheerful group leader, Nancy Thomason, director of the
San Fernando Valley chapter of the Child Evangelism Fellowship,
displayed a multicolored Dr. Seuss-style floppy top hat. In a
soothing tone, she explained to the group of 25 children that each
colored stripe on the hat had religious meaning. Black represents
sin. Red is Jesus' blood. White means clean from sin. Green
represents new life from God. Gold is heaven.</LD>
<LD>   They went on to recite verses of the Bible and pray some more.</LD>
<TE>   This was not Sunday school or a church service but a public
school. The young worshipers, who gathered on a recent afternoon at
the Los Angeles Unified School District's Chase Street Elementary
School in Panorama City, are members of the Good News Club, a
Christian group for kids that has been winning free-speech battles
against school districts across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "How come we have a Good News Club at this school?" Thomason asked
the students.</TE>
<TE>   "To talk about God," one child answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I have any group I want on a school campus?" Thomason asked.</TE>
<TE>   The children nodded.</TE>
<TE>   The organization, which has members nationwide, recently won a
federal lawsuit against the Los Angeles district, allowing its
members free use of campus facilities for after-school meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The district allows student-run clubs and Boy and Girl Scouts to
meet on campus after school without paying fees. It requires other
groups, such as churches and community or corporate organizations, to
pay fees to cover the costs of school maintenance during the
meetings, according to a district lawyer, Adrienne Konigar.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow in Los Angeles ruled in
August that such fees discriminate against the religious organization
and violate the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Similar debates over the group's rights have erupted across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that schools may not bar
the Good News Club and other religious groups from meeting on public
school campuses. The decision, which emphasized free speech,
overturned a prohibition by schools in Milford, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had mixed feelings across the nation," said Myron
Tschetter, vice president of USA Ministries for the Child Evangelism
Fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part we've had all kinds of principals say this is
great because it has changed the attitudes of children in schools,"
he added. "Some of those who are against the club just don't want
anything religious in their schools, and that's a personal preference
of the principal or superintendent."</TE>
<TE>   Mathew Staver, lawyer for the club, said many school districts
mistakenly believe that allowing a religious group to meet on school
grounds is unconstitutional. But public schools, he said, cannot
choose which groups they allow access.</TE>
<TE>   He said that imposing uneven fee requirements, or "anything that
sets up barriers, is also a form of discrimination, although it is
not as blatant as a total ban on activities."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified has filed an appeal. The district, Konigar said,
believes its fee did not violate the Constitution. "The district
wants to make sure we treat all clubs fairly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are 40 after-school Good News Clubs on campuses in
California, and 286 across the country. The group at Chase
Elementary, which began this fall with about 50 members, is the first
in L.A. Unified. It meets Tuesdays for about 90 minutes after school.
A second club recently began at Chatsworth Park Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Staver said the group prefers to convene on school campuses
because they are safe, accessible to children and easier for parents
who don't have to deal with extra transportation problems.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Villafana, principal of Chase, said she welcomes the club on
her campus because students have a good time in a loving environment.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as parents are giving their consent, to me that's
critical," she said. "The school and school district are not
promoting this as a part of them; it's separate."</TE>
<TE>   Ciera Shelton, 10, said she likes the Good News Club. "Some people
prayed so the Good News Club could go on, so they wouldn't have to
pay. That's good because kids need to learn about God," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fatima Garcia of Panorama City has enrolled her daughter Michelle,
10, and her son Michael, 7, in the club at Chase and both enjoy it.
"I love it too that they are learning about the Bible and about God,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Stevens, parent of an eighth-grader named Sara who attends
the Good News Club at Emerald Middle School in El Cajon, said her
daughter "has gotten a lot out of the program because she has learned
about the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   Sara said the club is a place where "we can be kids."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids are doing drugs and doing a lot of bad stuff," she
said. "It is another chance so we can stay out of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some critics say the club uses aggressive recruitment
tactics and should not be allowed on public school campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "In some locations, you have to wonder whether they're really
holding church services," said Julie Underwood, general counsel for
the National School Boards Assn. who worked on the Supreme Court
case. "You have to realize they aren't quite like the Girl Scouts."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Boston, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, said the club teaches sophisticated theological
concepts to youngsters, and parents often mistakenly see it as just a
carefree place for after school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a nonsecular group featuring juice and cookies and
puppets," Boston said.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomason said children of all faiths are welcome, and every
participant must submit a permission slip from parents.</TE>
<TE>   She said the group has been unfairly targeted.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they like us? I don't know. Maybe they don't like
Christ. Maybe they are thinking 'What are you doing to the minds of
children?' " Thomason said. "We are just letting [children] know
there is someone there who constantly loves them and is constantly
there for them."</TE>
<TE>   At Chase on a recent afternoon, a Good News leader, Colleen
Ishimaru, used colorful cartoon figures to help tell Bible stories to
nearly 25 students.</TE>
<TE>   She went on to say, in a motherly tone, that Christian beliefs can
have their costs: "Sometimes, when you are at school, the park or the
playground, people know you go to church, or they know you go to the
Good News Club ... and you know what? They make fun of you.</TE>
<TE>   "There are even people in my own family who don't want to talk to
me or have anything to do with me because I follow God."</TE>

<HD>Man Convicted of Murder in Death of O.C. Deputy</HD>
<DH>The 34-year-old victim, called a hero for sparing others,
was gunned down with an assault rifle in 1999. Jury will consider
death penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury on Tuesday convicted a Lake Forest man of first-degree murder
for firing a stream of bullets into an Orange County sheriff's deputy
who had pulled into a convenience store parking lot in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated less than three hours before convicting Maurice
Steskal in the shooting death of Brad Riches, the first Orange County
sheriff's deputy murdered while on duty in more than four decades.</LD>
<LD>   The deputy's mother trembled and covered her mouth as a court
clerk read the verdict in a crowded Santa Ana courtroom. Later, she
thanked investigators who worked on the case, saying, "It's such a
relief."</LD>
<TE>   The jury returns to court Thursday to determine whether Steskal
deserves the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent argued that Steskal killed the
deputy because he despised law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   Steskal, 43, took an assault rifle into a Lake Forest 7-Eleven
store June 12, 1999, and opened fire when Riches arrived in his
patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did the defendant kill Brad Riches? Because he was a cop.
Pure and simple, because he was a cop," Brent said during his closing
argument. "He hated cops and that's why he killed Brad Riches."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contended that long-standing paranoia drove
Steskal to fear law-enforcement officers and to believe that he
needed to carry the rifle for protection.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Arlene Speiser asked the jury of 10 men and
two women to convict her client of second-degree murder, which would
not have carried a possible death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Steskal entered the convenience store about midnight. He told a
sales clerk not to worry, that he was not going to rob the store but
intended to use the weapon on "pigs."</TE>
<TE>   He bought a pack of cigarettes, and walked out of the store just
as Riches was pulling into the parking lot. Steskal fired 30 shots,
emptying his gun's magazine into the deputy as Riches sat in his car.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy managed to make one radio call, "Clear channel.
Emergency traffic about ready to come," before he was struck
repeatedly by gunfire. Steskal's assault rifle fired with such force
that several bullets tore through Riches' bulletproof vest, sheriff's
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Brent suggested that the deputy activated
the lights on his patrol car to attract Steskal's attention, hoping
to spare another possible target.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a hero cop," the prosecutor said. "He draws the defendant
out at risk to his own life." Riches, 34, was the first deputy killed
while on duty since 1958. He was a decorated deputy who was respected
by his colleagues and those he encountered on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Among a throng of sheriff's employees Tuesday was Sheriff Mike
Carona, who stopped to hug the deputy's mother, Meriel Riches, before
leaving the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   At the penalty hearing, jurors will be asked to decide whether
Steskal deserves death or life in prison without parole. Steskal's
mental illness -- he was diagnosed with severe paranoia -- is
expected to become a focus of the penalty phase.</TE>

<HD>Dairy Farms Accept Curbs on Pollution</HD>
<DH>Five Chino-area producers will focus on keeping waste
'lagoons' from harming air, water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five large dairies in the Chino area have entered legal agreements to
modernize operations and reduce pollution, particularly from giant
waste "lagoons," to stave off litigation by environmentalists.</LD>
<LD>   The agreements approved Monday by a federal judge in Los Angeles
and announced Tuesday are designed to curb contamination that spreads
through the air and water, both on the surface and underground.</LD>
<LD>   Though they did not admit any liability, the dairy farms agreed to
work with an independent engineer to develop an environmental
management plan for the earthen lagoons and other pollution sources.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement is fairly open-ended, and neither side is sure what
the exact restrictions will be or how much they will cost the
dairies.</TE>
<TE>   Within six months, the farms are expected to strengthen waste
management training programs and to build berms to prevent waste
water from spilling off farms and into area creeks and other
waterways. Among the previously polluted waters was the Santa Ana
River, a source of drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people
downstream in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The waste lagoons probably will be retrofitted with liners to
prevent nitrates and other pollutants from seeping into ground-water
aquifers, as well as covers to reduce air emissions and odor.</TE>
<TE>   One activist called the agreements a "big deal." Environmental
groups said they hoped that the rules would catch on beyond the
Inland Empire, one of the hubs of the state dairy industry, to farm
communities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Got Milk' should not mean 'Got Pollution Too,' " said David
Beckman, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"We are not seeking the shutdown of the dairy industry, or of these
farms. But they need to be run in modern ways."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the dairy industry welcome the attention and the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Bill VerBoort, general manager of the Clovis-based California
Dairy Herd Improvement Assn., said such rules are particularly
important in such concentrated dairy lands as the Chino-Corona area.</TE>
<TE>   "A thousand cows stink ... a lot more than 200 cows," said
VerBoort, whose organization provides program management and advice
to dairy associations across the West. "This may not be totally
popular politically in my circle, but any time you concentrate
agriculture, you start posing challenges to the environment. And the
industry needs to address that. Not everybody in the industry is on
that page right now."</TE>
<TE>   'We Are Not Making It'</TE>
<TE>   John Vander Poel -- a Riverside County resident who owns the land
under the Desperado Dairy near Corona, one of the farms that entered
into the legal agreements -- purchased the farm in 1986 and operated
it until he sold the cows to his son two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Costly improvements will not pencil out for an operation already
operating in the red, Vander Poel said. The farm receives $9 today
for a "hundred weight" -- every 100 pounds of milk. Trouble is, it
costs more than $11 to produce that much milk. More expenses could
mean the end of Desperado, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Modernization?" he said incredulously. "We can't afford to pay
our bills. We are not making it. Period."</TE>
<TE>   Vander Poel said he has seen misguided environmental actions
before. Once, he said, he was accused by San Bernardino County
officials of allowing manure-laden water to infiltrate nearby
Cucamonga Creek. But that water, he said, was running straight off
his roof and contained no contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the victims of a bunch of radicals," he said. "And then I
have to defend myself. It's all a bunch of lies."</TE>
<TE>   But the environmentalists said their concerns are validated by
extensive research. Water officials blamed a 1998 fish kill at a
percolation pond connected to the Santa Ana River water project on a
farm that could not withstand floodwaters, allowing waste water to
breach several berms.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just a problem for the areas immediately surrounding the
farms, said Virginia Grebbien, general manager of the Fountain
Valley-based Orange County Water District.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a bad actor in the upper watershed, it's affecting us
as well," she said. "We're at the tail end. And improperly operated
dairies are a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental organizations said that their own investigations
began this spring and that in waterways downstream from Chino they
discovered nitrate levels 10 times higher than the California safety
threshold for drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   At high levels in drinking water, nitrates can reduce the oxygen
that reaches a person's brain and other organs.</TE>
<TE>   Urbanization Blamed</TE>
<TE>   The five dairies that signed the legal agreements, known as
consent decrees, are among about 250 in the Chino area. The farms are
Desperado, Ben Vander Laan, L&amp;M, Gorzeman Family and Gorzeman No. 2
dairies.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental organizations had threatened to sue them under the
federal Clean Water Act if they didn't sign. David Albers, a
Bakersfield attorney who represents dairy farms, said they did not
contest the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Albers, however, like many of the farmers he represents, believes
that they have been victims of the brisk pace of development in the
Inland Empire. Forty years ago, there weren't many neighbors around
to care about smelly, dirty operations.</TE>
<TE>   Now, vacant land in the Chino and Corona areas, like that in much
of the Inland Empire, has been paved over to make room for streets
and master-planned communities. The pavement increases storm-water
runoff, which floods farms and carries waste and pollution into
streams and ground-water basins, farmers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough for them to try to keep water off their property,"
Albers said. "They are absolutely a victim of urbanization."</TE>
<TE>   Many Inland Empire dairy operations have moved to the Central
Valley. Some farmers have seen that region, although fast growing, as
friendlier to their operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Valley is far from immune to the debates about the
dairy operations, however.</TE>
<TE>   Several nonprofits have challenged the accuracy of environmental
impact statements that have preceded new milk farms there.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really slowing development of the dairies up there now,"
VerBoort said. "It hasn't shut it off. But it's posing a challenge."</TE>

<HD>Universities Settle Suit Brought by Hearing-Impaired
Students</HD>
<DH>Five plaintiffs will get $10,000 each; UC Davis and UC
Berkeley will improve services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica M. Scully</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Megan Conway, who has a severe hearing disability, remembers crying
because of her inability to actively participate in graduate classes
at UC Berkeley. An amplification device helped her hear the
professors' lectures, but anything else said in the room was lost to
her. She felt the university did not provide adequate assistance.</LD>
<LD>   "It put me into tears many times," said Conway, now an assistant
professor at the University of Hawaii's Center on Disability Studies.
"It's very frustrating because you know it could be better, you know
it could be different. It's like being in a glass box. You're
watching all these other students participating, and you're an
observer."</LD>
<LD>   Conway, then known by her maiden name of Jones, is one of five
current and former hearing disabled UC Berkeley and UC Davis students
who filed a 1999 class-action lawsuit against the two universities.
The students contended that the campuses had violated their rights
under the Americans With Disabilities Act by not providing reasonable
help to deaf and hearing-impaired students.</LD>
<TE>   Without admitting fault, the universities agreed in a recent court
settlement to improve services for hearing-impaired and deaf
students, to pay each of the five students in the suit $10,000, and
to pay $1.1 million in lawyers' fees.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the settlement and the services described in the
policies are really going to be a model for other universities to
follow in the provision of communication services for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community," said Guy Wallace, an attorney for the
students.</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, the universities will provide additional
listening devices for students' use and make sure all videos, films
and DVDs used in classes with a deaf or hearing-impaired student have
captions. They will also streamline how students get services, such
as note taking, sign language interpreting and real time captioning
for classes and other activities. About 10 hearing-impaired students
are enrolled at the two campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also deals with safety, increasing the number of
public and emergency telephones on campus that deaf and
hearing-impaired students will be able to use, and adding signs
directing students to them.</TE>
<TE>   An independent panel will evaluate the changes made and determine
whether more should be required.</TE>
<TE>   According to UC attorney Jeff Blair, the university was complying
with the law before the lawsuit and has made several improvements
over the past year unrelated to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Blair said, UC Berkeley hired a full-time captioner.
A captioner's job, like that of a court reporter, is to type the
contents of lectures while they are being delivered; with a few
seconds delay, students can read the lecture on a computer screen.
The campus also added a staff member in the disabled students program
to help deaf and hearing-impaired students.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case where I feel very confident that the university
was providing very good accommodations before the suit, during the
suit and after the suit," Blair said. "In my view, the settlement
makes the policies and procedures more user-friendly."</TE>
<TE>   The case was settled, according to court documents, to avoid extra
legal costs.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley senior Lexin Ka, who is hearing-impaired, wasn't a
part of the lawsuit, but will be on campus to experience some of the
results.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it will help; the policy needed to be changed," said Ka,
who sometimes communicates using sign language.</TE>
<TE>   But there are still problems that the settlement won't fix.</TE>
<TE>   Ka, a cognitive science major from San Francisco, said he
sometimes has difficulties with garbled words in real-time
captioning. In a psychology class last semester, the term
"photoreception" kept coming to him mistakenly as "photoperception."
As a result, he said, he got an answer wrong on a test.</TE>
<TE>   Ka said he and other hearing-impaired students worry that such
problems will make it harder for them to get into graduate school
because their grades won't be high enough.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem, according to university attorney Blair, is
that the Bay Area has a shortage of captioners. "It's very hard to
improve given the shortage we have," he said.</TE>

<HD>EIDC Chief Vows to Remain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Rohrlich and Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of Los Angeles' film permitting agency has rebuffed calls
from some board members that he step aside during an ongoing criminal
probe into possible misuse of agency funds.</LD>
<LD>   Cody Cluff, president of the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp., told the board in a letter that he has done nothing wrong and
that leaving now would be "destabilizing, unfounded and rash."</LD>
<LD>   Cluff, the subject of a probe by the district attorney's office,
said he intends to remain in his post throughout a management review
and audit ordered by the EIDC's executive committee.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Cluff signaled that he does not plan to spend
the rest of his career at the agency, which he has led since its
inception seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an entrepreneur at heart and I hope to have many successful
ventures in my future," Cluff wrote in the letter, dated Friday.
"However, I would be negligent in abandoning EIDC at this time."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is probing whether Cluff misused
funds through lavish expenditures and political donations to elected
officials, including some on the EIDC's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   An issue at the heart of the probe is the district attorney's view
that the EIDC, which collects fees from film companies to help them
obtain government permits, is in fact a public agency. Cluff, in his
letter, calls this a "fundamental misconception," arguing that the
agency is, as its incorporation papers state, a private nonprofit
entity.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, three elected officials on the EIDC's board and
executive committee called for Cluff to take a leave of absence
during the probe. They were County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Yaroslavsky nor Greuel has received EIDC campaign
contributions, although individual agency staff members gave $5,400
to Greuel's campaign. Hahn received $1,000 during his mayoral
campaign. The mayor, in addition to all council members and county
supervisors, automatically serves as a member of the EIDC board.</TE>
<TE>   Other board members, including Supervisor Mike Antonovich, have
defended Cluff, warning against a rush to judgment when no criminal
charges have been filed. Antonovich has received a $1,000 campaign
contribution from the EIDC and $1,350 from agency staff.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said in his letter that agency bylaws prevent the executive
committee, scheduled to meet Friday, from discharging him. He cited
provisions that he said require the full EIDC board of directors to
meet twice before the president can be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   The full board has generally met only once a year. The next annual
meeting is being set for January, Cluff said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hot, whipping Santa Ana winds have sucked moisture from the air and
dried out brush, prompting officials Tuesday to mobilize against fire
danger in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The National Weather Service has issued a "red flag" warning until
2 p.m. today, when the winds are expected to abate.</LD>
<LD>   "If you have a fire that starts in these conditions, it's going to
spread very quickly," said Tom Rolinski of the weather service.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, winds of more than 25 mph blew through the region, and
humidity in most places was less than 15%, Rolinski said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angeles National Forest, officials posted extra patrols to
watch for fires. The forest was closed to the public for much of the
fall because of extreme fire danger. It reopened a few weeks ago
after 3 to 4 inches of rain drenched the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The Santa Ana winds have put us back into a dangerous fire
situation," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady. "All
that dead and down fuel has dried back out to tinder conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The forest will remain open, Brady said, but officials are asking
the public to follow rules such as not lighting campfires.</TE>

<LD>Community organizers have scheduled a meeting Thursday to discuss
proposals to expand the 101 Freeway and the impact the plans could
have on neighborhoods in the Cahuenga Pass and Hollywood Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Forty miles of the freeway corridor, from downtown Los Angeles to
Thousand Oaks, are the subject of a study sponsored by the state
Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. The study is considering freeway widening and
double-decking as options for easing congestion.</LD>

<HD>Hahn's China Visit Yields Golden Monkeys for L.A. Zoo</HD>
<DH>The city would be the first in the U.S. to exhibit the
endangered species. The mayor also continues to pursue panda
agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles will become the first city in the United States to
exhibit a pair of endangered golden monkeys from China, if not the
hoped-for giant pandas, under an agreement reached today between
Mayor James K. Hahn and Chinese officials.</LD>
<LD>   Chen Runsheng, secretary general of the China Wildlife
Conservation Assn., said he hoped that the monkeys would breed at the
Los Angeles Zoo, and a smiling Hahn said he also hoped for "a
successful and romantic stay."</LD>
<LD>   The mayor, touring Asia to promote business and tourism at home,
hopes to secure an agreement allowing a pair of giant pandas to come
to the Los Angeles Zoo. But officials familiar with the process said
broaching that subject early in the visit is frowned upon by Chinese
officials, who prefer to first develop relationships and trust.</LD>
<TE>   At a ceremony today, Hahn sidestepped the question.</TE>
<TE>   "Our efforts are not to secure the pandas in the Los Angeles Zoo,"
he said, "but to secure their place in their natural habitat. Our
goal is to begin the process ... with the ultimate goal of helping
the pandas survive."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn signed an agreement to open discussions with the Chinese
government on potential projects involving research, personnel
training and funding support for conservation of endangered wildlife
in China. He also said the Los Angeles Zoo would create a cultural
exhibit to educate visitors about China.</TE>
<TE>   Runsheng avoided any promises about pandas.</TE>
<TE>   "The panda is a shared emotion in the international community," he
said. "It may not be very realistic or within the ability of the
China Wildlife Conservation Assn. to provide a panda to you."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's two-day stop in Beijing is his second on a 10-day trip
to Asia. He is traveling with other city officials and a delegation
of Los Angeles business executives to boost tourism, negotiate
agreements with airline and shipping line executives, and open doors
for local companies in Asia. It is the mayor's first major overseas
trade mission.</TE>
<TE>   Though the trip consists mostly of meetings with Asian business
officials and some government leaders, the mayor is trying to find a
little time to be a tourist. He is expected to visit local sites
today.</TE>
<TE>   He is being treated, however, like visiting royalty, whisked about
in black cars with tinted windows as his delegation follows in
shuttle buses.</TE>
<TE>   He will meet late today with other Beijing officials to discuss
construction projects and business opportunities for Los Angeles
companies. With him are executives from some of the city's largest
engineering and architectural firms.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor may well be more successful in those areas than he is in
obtaining pandas, several people said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a long, political process that may end up with Los Angeles
receiving only the golden monkeys, which have striking blue faces and
golden hair. About 15,000 golden monkeys remain in the wild of China.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who brought two zoo officials to Beijing, has said he
thinks that Los Angeles would be a natural place for giant pandas,
because it has a large Chinese community and is a gateway city for
Asian tourists. Each year, more than 1.4 million people visit the
Griffith Park zoo, which has more than 1,200 animals from around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor has a long way to go before he will learn if he will
succeed. Others, including the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas and
the Memphis Zoo, are ahead of him on planning and political lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   It would cost Los Angeles tens of millions of dollars to borrow
pandas from the Chinese government. The zoo would need a
multimillion-dollar panda exhibit, and the city would need to pledge
millions more to conservation efforts in China.</TE>
<TE>   The city also would need to meet complex criteria established by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is responsible for issuing
the import and export permits. The city also must have a research
project that would benefit the wild panda population in China, which
numbers about 1,000. Several hundred more live in captivity. Just
three zoos in the United States have pandas: the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.; the San Diego Zoo; and Zoo Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Because the animals are so rare, the Chinese and U.S. governments
have agreed to the loan program, with the understanding that any
offspring are to be returned to China by their third birthday.</TE>
<TE>   In other areas, the mayor said he signed agreements with Korean
tourism officials last weekend to encourage more Koreans to visit Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Jimmy Hendrix, 77; Medal of Honor Winner in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was awarded the Medal of Honor without qualifying for a Purple
Heart, yet never considered himself a hero.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a job to do and that's what I did," he said in 1999 when he
was honored at the Medal of Honor Memorial in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Jimmy Hendrix, awarded the medal for single-handedly capturing 14
German cannoneers with his M-1 rifle and rescuing three American
soldiers under enemy fire in the Battle of the Bulge, died Thursday.
He was 77.</LD>
<TE>   Hendrix died of throat cancer at his home in Davenport, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   One of 11 children of a poor sharecropper from Lepanto, Ark.,
Hendrix was drafted into the Army in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after Christmas in 1944, the skinny, red-haired
19-year-old was in the vanguard of Gen. George S. Patton's 4th
Armored Division, which had smashed through German defenses to rescue
American troops holding the road to Bastogne, Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   In Hitler's last-gasp counterattack in Europe, 250,000 German
soldiers had launched an assault 10 days earlier from the Ardennes
Forest, causing a 60-mile deep bulge in the Allied lines and giving
the battle its historic name.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix, figuring he was doomed anyway, leaped out of his
halftrack just before a shell hit the windshield, killing the rest of
his squad.</TE>
<TE>   Facing two 88-millimeter, 80-foot-long cannons, each with a
seven-man German crew, he fired his rifle furiously and uttered the
only German phrase he had learned.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his Southern accent, 13 of the men climbed out without
weapons and with hands up. He killed the 14th who pointed a rifle at
him.</TE>
<TE>   As American troops approached, Hendrix herded his prisoners to the
rear and climbed onto another halftrack.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, he jumped off again to pull a driver from
another American halftrack that had been hit by a German grenade and
was in flames, and a third time to silence two machine guns and save
two more wounded Americans.</TE>
<TE>   President Harry S. Truman placed the medal around Hendrix's neck
in a ceremony at the White House on Aug. 23, 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Hendrix, his awards did not include the Purple
Heart because he was one of only a handful of Medal of Honor
recipients who escaped wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you this much," the affable Southerner said last year
when he was invited to Washington for another Medal of Honor
presentation ceremony. "I knocked out two 88-millimeter artillery
guns and the gun crew surrendered to me. I was scared out of my wits.
I was a 19-year-old who didn't know what to do with my prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "Standing in front of President Truman, I was just as scared."</TE>
<TE>   Invited to presidential inaugurals and various Medal of Honor
ceremonies, Hendrix subsequently met Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy,
Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Staff Sgt. Hendrix returned to the farm in

<LD>A bright-eyed 6-year-old, Randy didn't hesitate when asked what would
happen if he didn't have his midafternoon snack at the after-school
enrichment program at Monroe Elementary School in Monrovia.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd die!" he yelped before bolting into line, along with four
dozen or more other kids in the school's multipurpose room. Boys,
girls -- kindergartners through fifth-graders -- all were getting
armloads of goodies: cookies, orange wedges and cartons of chocolate
milk.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, said Sandra Roanhorse, the school's site coordinator,
Randy and his energetic chums would be hard to handle without a
nutritional boost during a busy afternoon of physical fitness,
homework assistance and nutritional education.</LD>
<TE>   "We might talk about Johnny Appleseed when we give them apples,"
Roanhorse said with a smile, as Randy and his buddy Ivan flashed
bright, orange-wedge grins.</TE>
<TE>   The Monrovia Village Centers, as the city school district calls
the after-school programs, are established at four elementary and two
middle schools in neighborhoods of modest homes where more than half
the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. More
than 450 students of all income levels are enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   "The fresh fruit is a big part of well-rounded nutrition," said
Loretta Whitson, director of student support services for the
Monrovia school district.</TE>
<TE>   Whitson said the school district launched the afternoon program
when a 1998 citywide Youth Summit yielded a plea from young people
for more after-school activities. State Education Department grants
were secured and the Village Centers were underway in the 1999-2000
school year.</TE>
<TE>   But it quickly became clear that the budget didn't provide enough
food, she said. So the district appealed to Foothill Unity Center, a
Monrovia nonprofit organization that, among its many services,
provides sustenance to thousands of needy families.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's executive director, Joan E. Whitenack, said
Foothill Unity Center operates with an annual budget of less than
$500,000, about 80% of it from private and corporate donations. The
group received a $15,000 grant from last year's Los Angeles Times
Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This has been a year of sharply increased demand, she said: "I'm
having a hard time keeping up with the need for food."</TE>
<TE>   Betty McWilliams, Foothill Unity Center's assistant director, has
a bulletin board covered with notes of gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Unity Center: Thank you for the nice snacks that you give to
us," reads a card decorated with hearts and ribbons. It is signed,
"Ashley."</TE>

<HD>Imperial Valley Farmers Urged to Conserve Water</HD>
<DH>The unusual request to voluntarily reduce use comes in a
district that enjoys special privileges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign that California is mired in drought, farmers from the
water-rich Imperial Valley have been asked by local officials to use
less water on their fields.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, farmers in the southeast corner of the state have
helped themselves to a virtually unlimited supply of cheap water,
which they have used to create a $1-billion a-year agricultural
economy from a wasteland.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, farmers received an unprecedented letter from the
Imperial Irrigation District asking for a voluntary reduction in
water use. It warned that the Colorado River is dangerously low and
that reservoirs are being rapidly depleted.</LD>
<TE>   "I ask each and every one of you to look at your operations and
take any additional extraordinary measures you can to conserve
water," Mike King, manager of the district's water department, wrote
to 2,300 farmers and other landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and ranchers throughout the western U.S. have been hard
hit by the drought and many have been forced to watch their fields
wither. Tulare County supervisors, for example, have declared an
economic emergency and appealed to the federal government for a
bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers in the Imperial Valley have been spared because of what
are called "senior priority rights" that entitle the Imperial
district and two smaller desert water districts to 75% of
California's share of the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Colorado River watershed now in its third year of
subpar rainfall and snowpack, operators of 500,000 farm acres are
being asked to do with less.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of conservation in the past has irritated other
drought-beset states. The Imperial district -- at more than 3 million
acre-feet a year -- is the biggest user of Colorado River water among
the seven states that depend on the winding river.</TE>
<TE>   But as farmers elsewhere have had to survive on reduced water
allowances, Imperial Valley farmers have increased the amount they
are taking from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, at the current rate of usage, the Imperial district will
have used 110,000 acre-feet above its annual allocation, an amount
that, in urban terms, is sufficient for the yearly needs of 800,000
people. The additional water use has been attributed to the valley's
lack of rainfall and unusually hot weather.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, King noted that "because we are such a large water
user and are such good water stewards ... the eyes of the West are on
us during the epic drought now upon us."</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, however, there is little that the Imperial
Irrigation District can do to force farmers to use less water.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has repeatedly threatened to reduce the
Imperial Valley's allocation of Colorado River water, but any such
attempt would undoubtedly lead to litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The district is pondering a proposed sale of water to arid San
Diego County, but that sale -- which could require farmers to take
some fields out of production -- has met with angry and widespread
local opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Al Kalin, whose family farms 2,500 acres, said farmers could
probably reduce water use significantly by placing water orders with
the irrigation district three days in advance. By long-standing
custom, farmers merely call the night before they need water, a
luxury that is the envy of farmers in other regions.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Imperial district must place overall orders three days
in advance with the federal government, there are days that the
district has requested more water than farmers need, which can lead
to waste.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes change," Kalin said of his idea. "You'll hearing
grumbling. But with what we're facing, that's one alternative."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Prostitution Proposal Targets Solicitors' Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police would be empowered to seize the cars of people who solicit
prostitutes under an ordinance proposed by Los Angeles City
Councilman Tom LaBonge.</LD>
<LD>   Saying his 4th District constituents are fed up with crime on
their doorsteps, LaBonge called for the new tool for police in their
fight against street prostitution that plagues Sunset Boulevard and
other areas.</LD>
<LD>   "If a person solicits a prostitute, their car can be impounded for
30 days" under the proposal, LaBonge said. "If they are caught
soliciting again, their car can be forfeited."</LD>
<TE>   LaBonge sought support Tuesday from the Los Angeles Police
Commission, which delayed action pending a final version of the law
from the Los Angeles city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitation normally is prosecuted as a misdemeanor, but LaBonge
proposed that the city attorney would use civil courts to seize
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge told commissioners that the California Supreme Court in
1999 upheld a similar ordinance. Cities including Stockton and
Oakland have already enacted such laws.</TE>
<TE>   Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, said the organization opposes the
proposal because the vehicles would be taken without giving the
owners their due process rights.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Michael Downing of the Hollywood Division said there
has been a rise in prostitution in his area. Citywide last year,
3,362 adults and 313 juveniles were arrested for prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Downing said a recent patrol using undercover female officers
netted 19 to 20 solicitors. "If this law passes, I'd run a trick task
force every day to get the message out: If you come to solicit a
prostitution in Hollywood, you'll lose your car."</TE>
<TE>   Some commissioners expressed skepticism. Commissioner Bert
Boeckmann, owner of Galpin Motors Inc., asked how the law would deal
with leased or borrowed vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Silvia Saucedo, an attorney, asked whether people who
are not convicted of a crime would be subject to the forfeiture
provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters assured Saucedo that the ordinance would apply only to
those of solicitation.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge said he does not expect to stop prostitution, but argued
that his idea could help clear Sunset Boulevard of trash, such as
used condoms.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief William J. Bratton has said that the department needs
to do more to tackle prostitution. A centerpiece of his strategy is
that by attacking such quality-of-life crimes, the department can
reduce more serious crimes.</TE>

<HD>William B. Langsdorf, 93; First President of Cal State
Fullerton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William B. Langsdorf, founding president of Cal State Fullerton who
saw the university grow from a modest collection of buildings on a
former orange grove to one of the largest campuses in the state
university system, has died of cancer. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Langsdorf suffered from melanoma and was admitted to Mesa Verde
Convalescent Hospital in Costa Mesa about two months ago, said Mary
Langsdorf, 44, his daughter-in-law. The longtime Corona del Mar
resident died Monday at the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Langsdorf was president of Pasadena City College when he was
tapped in 1959 to head what was then known as Orange County State
College, which was still under construction.</LD>
<TE>   It was renamed California State University, Fullerton, in 1972,
two years after Langsdorf left to assume the post of vice chancellor
of academic affairs for the state university system.</TE>
<TE>   During his 11-year tenure, Langsdorf guided the university through
its initial boom years and set the course for what would become the
state system's third-largest campus.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when state colleges mostly trained teachers, Langsdorf
built the Fullerton campus around a solid liberal arts curriculum,
said Lawrence de Graaf, one of the university's first six professors.</TE>
<TE>   "He broke the mold and paved the way for many more academic majors
right in the early years," De Graaf said.</TE>
<TE>   De Graaf, an emeritus professor of history who still teaches at
the university, interviewed Langsdorf in the early 1980s for a
research project on the history of California state universities.</TE>
<TE>   Langsdorf was also a pioneer in the way he governed, De Graaf and
others said. He created a faculty council, now known as the faculty
senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Universities tended to be very hierarchical," said Ernest Toy,
77, the university's original librarian, now retired. "He believed in
democratic governance, and he practiced it."</TE>
<TE>   The university was launched on temporary facilities at Sunny Hills
and Fullerton Union high schools. A year later, it moved to a
permanent home on what had once been orange groves. The first campus
building named after a person was Langsdorf Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The university, with 32,143 students this fall, is one of 23 state
university campuses.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Cal State Fullerton in 1970, Langsdorf served as
vice chancellor for about two years before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Langsdorf is survived by his wife of 64 years, Eileen Langsdorf;
daughter Sherry Haiman; son Bill Langsdorf Jr.; and four
grandchildren. Before his death, Langsdorf requested that no funeral
or memorial services be held, university officials said. Instead of
flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to a memorial
scholarship for students in his name that is being established at the
University Advancement Foundation.</TE>

<HD>LAPD May Seek New Quarters</HD>
<DH>Parker Center is crowded, unsafe and should be razed, says
leader of police panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission is looking into the possibility of
leasing enough downtown office space to vacate Parker Center, the
Police Department's leaky, earthquake-damaged headquarters, which
could then be torn down and rebuilt, Commission President Rick Caruso
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing could be more unsafe right now than Parker Center," said
Caruso, a real estate developer who was appointed to the commission
last year by Mayor James K. Hahn. "You can walk through that building
and see the sky. I can't believe anybody has allowed it to go on this
long."</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Caruso said he had commissioned a study of
available downtown office space that real estate brokers would
present to the five-member Police Commission next week. He said he
hopes the city can make a deal within 60 days for as much as 500,000
square feet of rental space, allowing the LAPD to empty Parker
Center.</LD>
<TE>   Any such deal, however, would depend on City Council approval and
would raise questions about whether, and how, the city should replace
Parker Center. A new police headquarters would probably cost $150
million to $200 million or more, Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton
said. Voters turned down a bond issue in 1999 that would have raised
$744 million for a variety of public safety construction projects,
including a new police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The city's new police chief, William J. Bratton, said the
initiative to replace Parker Center came from Caruso, not from him.
He agreed, however, with the need for change.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a general consensus that the building is inadequate in
terms of the current and future needs of the department," Bratton
said. "We are actually looking at a number of options."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he has raised his concerns about Parker Center with
Hahn and the mayor's chief of staff. "We've never gotten into
specifics," Caruso said, "but I think in concept they agree."</TE>
<TE>   Too small for a burgeoning department since the day it opened
nearly 50 years ago, Parker Center has grown to become one of the
city's most emblematic buildings, nearly as much a symbol of the LAPD
as the familiar motto "To Protect and to Serve."</TE>
<TE>   It is, among other things, one of the city's most frequently
filmed buildings. But in the 40 or so years since "Dragnet" put it on
the map, Parker Center has changed little, except to deteriorate.
Police officers complain that pipes leak, cables dangle, floors sag
and walls are paper thin. Even the camera at the front desk is
broken.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the building was yellow-tagged after the 1994
Northridge earthquake, a decision he finds timid and politically
expedient. It should have been condemned with a red tag, he said, and
is vulnerable to another quake. The city-issued yellow tags mean the
structure has been damaged and may be unsafe to occupy; a red tag
means it must be vacated.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are supposed to protect this city in the event of
an earthquake," Caruso said, "are in a building that's likely to
collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Caruso said, the Police Department keeps losing
civilian employees, who quit or transfer to other city departments
because they want better working conditions. Even the secretary to
the Police Commission, he said, has requested a transfer to the
Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The city is losing money on high employee turnover, he said, and
on the inefficiency of having Police Department personnel spread
among other office buildings downtown. Police operations use about 1
million square feet altogether and have as many as 30 leases in
private nearby buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he was shocked when he toured Parker Center after
being appointed to the Police Commission in August 2001. He is
pushing for its replacement, he said, because "this is the first time
I've been able to see a little daylight." Between security worries
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the replacement of former
Chief Bernard C. Parks, he said, "there have been other things I
needed to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the council's Public
Safety Committee, said the city will need to replace or renovate
Parker Center "in the reasonable near-term." But it is not clear how
the city would pay for a new police headquarters, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner Rose Ochi said she would support any proposal
that will provide officers with a decent place to work. "There are
wholesale health and safety violations throughout the building," she
said. "Everybody who's worked in this building knows how awful it is
to be here."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "Our police officers deserve the best. We've been
treating those in this building like second-class citizens. This is a
world-class department. We need a world-class building."</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke, Ochi conducted an informal tour of the commission's
offices on the first floor of Parker Center. Employees work shoulder
to shoulder. Some work in windowless rooms barely bigger than
closets. Cracks are visible in office walls. The electrical system is
so old in places that it can be overloaded by plugging in any major
appliance.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to see my office?" Ochi asked. She opened a wardrobe
with five file drawers, each marked with the name of a civilian
police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when Parker Center was considered
state-of-the-art.</TE>
<TE>   The building opened to great fanfare in 1955 as the Police
Administration Building. Built for the then-substantial sum of $6.1
million, it was a 400,000-square-foot showplace with a glass and
stone facade that was intended to consolidate several scattered,
outdated LAPD offices. A newspaper story on opening day marveled at
its technological features:</TE>
<TE>   "Its nerve system is a maze of pneumatic tubes," The Times said.
"These tubes are threaded into virtually every direction in the
building and operators may route the capsules to any one of them by
simply dialing their destination before inserting them in the tube."</TE>
<TE>   The full-time services of a policewoman were required for months
to give tours to curious crowds. When Chief William H. Parker died in
1966 after leading the department for 16 years, the building was
renamed in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   Parker Center's drawbacks have been discussed for years. A
two-year study by Los Angeles real estate consultant Kosmont
Associates completed in 1996 concluded that the building should be
demolished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unsafe," consultant Larry Kosmont said Tuesday.
"Woefully inadequate in every way."</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation would provide cost savings and greater
effectiveness, Caruso and Kosmont said, including an end to the high
price of keeping Parker Center running. Maintenance and operation
costs at downtown's best modern high-rise office buildings are $10 to
$15 per square foot a year, Kosmont said, while it takes as much as
$20 a foot to keep Parker Center open. That doesn't include the
potential price of considerable deferred maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   It would cost as much as $12 million to bring the ventilation
system up to par, said Joe Gunn, executive director of the Police
Commission, and another $12 million to properly repair the fire and
safety systems.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be costing the LAPD as much money just to maintain
Parker Center as it would cost to rent elsewhere," said Kosmont.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers from Los Angeles real estate services company CB Richard
Ellis are compiling a list of properties downtown or nearby that
might serve as temporary home to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   CB Richard Ellis representatives declined to reveal what buildings
will be recommend to the Police Commission next week, but there are a
handful with large vacancies that might appeal to the department.
Among them are the three-building Transamerica Center, which has
330,000 square feet available in a 10-story tower at 1149 S. Broadway
and more parking slots than most downtown buildings. Monthly rent
there starts at $1.50 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   Other buildings, including Arco Plaza on Flower Street and 333 S.
Hope St., have large blocks of space available but may not meet the
LAPD's parking, security and cost requirements. Real estate sources
said buildings in downtown's industrial areas and south toward USC
may be more suitable.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski and Deaton said security concerns would be paramount
in selecting office space for police. However, Kosmont said, the
building needn't be a fortress, given its role as an administrative,
not a law enforcement, center. "There is a case to be made that many
of the specialized units like burglary, homicide and gangs do not
have to operate out of the operations center," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how much office space the department requires is
uncertain. Caruso said he would like to see as much as 500,000 square
feet of police office space in one location, but real estate sources
say it would be possible to gain many economies of scale in a
300,000-square-foot rented headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   That would make the LAPD a prize tenant for landlords in the
downtown office market, where a 100,000-square-foot lease is
considered large, and would probably garner a substantial discount on
rent.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he hopes that the Police Commission will decide next
week to recommend moving out of Parker Center and that approvals from
the mayor and City Council soon follow.</TE>

<HD>Great Oak Must Be Sacrificed to Atone for L.A.'s Past Sins</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Day 19, I say the tree's got to go.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that I don't like vegetation, and the gnarly old oak on
Pico Canyon Road near Santa Clarita is a beauty. But here's the
question: If you've got to fight insane traffic, squeeze past a
strip-mall gantlet, and turn left at Chuck E. Cheese's to get to a
tree, isn't it already too late to save it?</LD>
<LD>   For a moment Tuesday, I thought the Santa Anas would resolve the
issue. I was talking to tree-sitter John Quigley by cell phone, and
the wind was whistling past him with such a fury I thought he might
be blown off his perch.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't talk too long," he said, explaining that he needed to
secure his little treehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley told me his protest was never about anything but
protecting this single tree, which stands in the way of a
road-widening project that could eventually serve a gargantuan
housing development. But now he realizes his being up a tree means
something more.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand people need places to live," Quigley said. "But if
you're going to bulldoze the hills and trees for a subdivision that
hasn't even been approved yet, and then plant tree saplings, it's not
the kind of community I want to live in."</TE>
<TE>   Then he should come down out of the tree and get out of town.
Greater Los Angeles was built on the principle that no legal, moral
or natural force should stand in the way of growth beyond all reason.</TE>
<TE>   Why should this tree be different from those that were long ago
destroyed? "This is incredible, that they would even consider
removing a tree that's been here for 400 years," Gloria Jenne, a
retired high school secretary, told me under the oak in question.
Besides, she said, it's already too crowded in Santa Clarita to keep
building mammoth subdivisions that further destroy the quality of
life.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Russ, drove from six miles away in Saugus to
have a look, and for the sake of playing devil's advocate, I asked if
they grew up in Saugus.</TE>
<TE>   No, they said. They moved up from North Hollywood 22 years ago to
escape the city.</TE>
<TE>   Well then, how are they any different from the people who will
live in the new subdivision? I asked. How are they any different from
those who became tree huggers after moving halfway to Bakersfield,
only to congest the freeways and foul the air on long commutes?</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Jenne said they moved to an established community 22 years
ago, and it was rural back then. But she understood my point, and
agreed that too many people were able to follow them north because
there has never been any attempt to control sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   They used to be on the edge of wilderness, but now they're an
extension of the San Fernando Valley, and the overdevelopment they
tried to escape has swept past them in waves.</TE>
<TE>   "This breaks my heart and hurts in the pit of my stomach," Gloria
said while looking at the tree. Her husband said if it comes to a
showdown with developers, he'll gladly lock arms with compatriots and
stand in the path of the bulldozer.</TE>
<TE>   I once wrote about a tree that some people tried to save by
claiming they had seen the form of Jesus appear on a limb. The face
of Jesus has also been known to appear on a tortilla, and the Virgin
mother has made appearances in unexpected places as well.</TE>
<TE>   But I scoured the oak on Pico Canyon for an apparition and saw
only John Quigley's shadow moving through the branches. From the
roadway, he could be confused for Zacchaeus, or maybe one of the 12
disciples, but I don't think Quigley can save the tree.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first pro-environment vigil I've been to in which half
the rubber-neckers are in SUVs, but part of the crowd seems to be
drawn to the spectacle rather than the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a freak show," said a man who comes by for daily
entertainment. He pointed to a minivan that stopped near the tree and
picked up several towhead kids who'd been playing along the roadside.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Szabad, a dance major at CalArts, said she came to see
Quigley rather than the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see a man who wouldn't bend under pressure," she said
admiringly, but she was confused as to why so many people are drawn
to this development issue and not others. "I don't see people
complain when they put in another Target or an Albertson's or a
Starbucks."</TE>
<TE>   They're not anti-growth, said Jim Nicoson, who wore a
Save-the-Tree pin and said he used to hike in this area before deer
and other wildlife were driven out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about balance," he said. When I asked where he was from, he
said he was "of the Earth." The same cannot be said of L.A. County
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose solution to this standoff is to
transplant the oak.</TE>
<TE>   I'm no gardener. But this thing is the size of a Ferris wheel, and
I'm here to guarantee you it'll be dead as a Christmas wreath in two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   If Antonovich and other public officials had stood up to
developers, rather than roll over like lap dogs, there might not be
an existing subdivision so close to the tree that it has to be
chopped down to make way for the next development.</TE>
<TE>   A development that could add 75,000 new customers for the local
Chuck E. Cheese. If there were a halfway intelligent effort to link
housing development to job centers and public transportation, we
wouldn't keep adding more pain to our daily migraine.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike John Quigley, I see little hope.</TE>
<TE>   The tree has got to go. Like Jesus, it must die for our sins.*</TE>

<HD>Westlake Village Man Takes Stand to Deny Attacking Ex-Wife
in '99</HD>
<DH>Woman filed a civil suit after prosecutors found
insufficient evidence to charge her former husband in beating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cool and affable, a Westlake Village businessman Tuesday denied
beating his ex-wife over the head with a heavy metal flashlight three
years ago and told jurors he was home asleep when the near-fatal
assault occurred.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Mannheimer, 59, acknowledged that he has no alibi for the
late-night hours of Sept. 11, 1999, when the attack occurred.</LD>
<LD>   But he calmly denied entering the Camarillo-area home of his
former spouse, Linda Morrisset, and cracking her skull during a
violent rage, as she alleges.</LD>
<TE>   Morrisset, a 51-year-old accountant who is now partly paralyzed
and uses a wheelchair, told jurors last week that Mannheimer "bashed
my head in."</TE>
<TE>   But, asked by his attorney, Greg Ramirez, whether he assaulted
Morrisset, Mannheimer responded Tuesday: "No, never."</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after
Morrisset awoke from a 16-day coma and identified him as her
attacker. He was released from jail after prosecutors found too
little evidence to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer temporarily lost custody of his 9-year-old son amid the
allegations, however, and sued his ex-wife for slander. She, in turn,
sued him for assault and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers have characterized the civil trial in Ventura County
Superior Court as the extension of a very uncivil divorce.</TE>
<TE>   But Mannheimer testified Tuesday that despite some rough patches
after their breakup in 1993, he and his ex-wife got along fine and
shared custody of their son, Maxx.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, on the day Morrisset was attacked, Mannheimer said he
spent a pleasant day with his son, taking Cub Scout photos and
shopping at Universal CityWalk. He tucked the boy into bed about 9:30
p.m. and went to sleep himself an hour later, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said he never saw his ex-wife that day, although she
contended she went to his home in a mix-up over where Maxx would
spend the night.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said he was not aware of his former wife's near-fatal
injuries until investigators came to his office two days later.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer also flatly denied that he asked a business associate,
Anthony Gigliotti, to follow his estranged wife in mid-1993, or paid
him $10,000 to make her "disappear."</TE>
<TE>   "It never happened," Mannheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged murder-for-hire plot was investigated by federal
authorities and led to Gigliotti's arrest in August 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Gigliotti nor Mannheimer was ever charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned about the 1993 events, Mannheimer described Gigliotti
as a friend and business associate who had expressed concern over
Mannheimer's pending divorce and the potential of losing custody of
his son.</TE>
<TE>   Without his knowledge, Mannheimer said, Gigliotti had tried to
investigate Morrisset. He said he told Gigliotti not to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Gigliotti, a resident of Danville, Calif., also took the stand
Tuesday and denied involvement in a murder-for-hire scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Mannheimer, his former boss, offered to pay him $10,000
to follow Morrisset, Gigliotti scoffed and responded: "He's the
cheapest person in the world. No, he would never do that."</TE>

my head in."</TE>
<TE>   But, asked by his attorney, Greg Ramirez, whether he assaulted
Morrisset, Mannheimer responded Tuesday: "No, never."</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after
Morrisset awoke from a 16-day coma and identified him as her
attacker. He was released from jail after prosecutors found too
little evidence to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer temporarily lost custody of his 9-year-old son amid the
allegations, however, and sued his ex-wife for slander. She, in turn,
sued him for assault and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers have characterized the civil trial in Ventura County
Superior Court as the extension of a very uncivil divorce.</TE>
<TE>   But Mannheimer testified Tuesday that despite some rough patches
after their breakup in 1993, he and his ex-wife got along fine and
shared custody of their son, Maxx.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, on the day Morrisset was attacked, Mannheimer said he
spent a pleasant day with his son, taking Cub Scout photos and
shopping at Universal CityWalk. He tucked the boy into bed about 9:30
p.m. and went to sleep himself an hour later, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said he never saw his ex-wife that day, although she
contended she went to his home in a mix-up over where Maxx would
spend the night.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said he was not aware of his former wife's near-fatal
injuries until investigators came to his office two days later.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer also flatly denied that he asked a business associate,
Anthony Gigliotti, to follow his estranged wife in mid-1993, or paid
him $10,000 to make her "disappear."</TE>
<TE>   "It never happened," Mannheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged murder-for-hire plot was investigated by federal
authorities and led to Gigliotti's arrest in August 1993. Neither
Gigliotti nor Mannheimer was ever charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned about the 1993 events, Mannheimer acknowledged that
Gigliotti called him from a Northern California jail after the arrest
and two days later flew to Burbank to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer described Gigliotti as a friend and business associate
who had expressed concern over Mannheimer's pending divorce and the
potential of losing custody of his son.</TE>
<TE>   Without his knowledge, Mannheimer said, Gigliotti had tried to
investigate Morrisset. He said he told Gigliotti not to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Gigliotti, a resident of Danville, Calif., also took the stand
Tuesday and denied involvement in a murder-for-hire scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Mannheimer, his former boss, offered to pay him $10,000
to follow Morrisset, Gigliotti scoffed and responded: "He's the
cheapest person in the world. No, he would never do that."</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's attorney, Allen Ball, challenged that testimony,
reading excerpts of a police interview in which Gigliotti allegedly
told investigators that Mannheimer "just wants [his wife] to
disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Ball also cited portions of a more recent deposition in which
Gigliotti refused to answer questions, citing his constitutional
rights against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Gigliotti said he was trying to speed up the deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his friendship with Mannheimer, Gigliotti described
the businessman as "a gentle soul" who nine years ago called him in
tears when his former wife walked out on the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen Mr. Mannheimer angry," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's daughter from a prior marriage, Bentley Brown, offered
a starkly different portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Brown told jurors that Mannheimer yelled at her mother and abused
her physically. She admitted that she never saw Mannheimer hit
Morrisset, but said she saw suspicious bruises on her mother's legs
and hips. Brown said she feared her step-father.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter further testified that she searched her mother's
Santa Rosa Valley home with police the day after the attack and found
four necklaces missing from her mother's jewelry chest.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said she believes the necklaces were all gifts from
Mannheimer.</TE>

<HD>Marvin Mirisch, 84; Co-Founded Movie Production Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marvin Mirisch, the modest behind-the-scenes deal-maker of the three
brothers who formed Mirisch Co. to independently produce such Academy
Award-winning movies as "The Apartment," "West Side Story" and "In
the Heat of the Night," has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Mirisch died Sunday of undisclosed causes at UCLA Medical Center
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The production company, established in 1957, produced 68 motion
pictures over 17 years in an arrangement partly negotiated by Marvin
Mirisch with United Artists. Mirisch films were nominated for 79
Academy Awards and won 23.</LD>
<TE>   After Harold Mirisch's death in 1968, Marvin and his better-known
brother Walter moved to Universal Pictures, where their output
included films such as "Midway" and "Same Time, Next Year."</TE>
<TE>   Walter Mirisch was generally recognized as the producer and Marvin
as the money man.</TE>
<TE>   However, Marvin Mirisch also earned credit as executive producer
of such films as "Dracula" in 1979 and "Romantic Comedy" in 1983. In
the early 1990s, he was executive producer of the animated "Pink
Panther" cartoon series.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Marvin was the third of four Mirisch sons.
After graduating from City College of New York in 1939, he joined the
other three in Milwaukee. There he later worked with his brother
Irving in Theatre Candy Co., selling popcorn and other refreshments
to 800 movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin moved to Los Angeles in 1953, where Walter and Harold were
working for Monogram Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   As Monogram became Allied Artists, the brothers independently
packaged such fare as John Huston's "Moby Dick" and helped produce
Billy Wilder's "Love in the Afternoon" and William Wyler's "Friendly
Persuasion."</TE>
<TE>   Active in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Marvin
Mirisch served as executive of its investment committees and was on
the Board of Governors.</TE>
<TE>   He also chaired the motion picture division of the United Jewish
Welfare Fund, and was on the boards of Temple Israel and Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Florene; his brother
Walter; three children, Don Mirisch, Carol Hartmann and Lynn Rogo,
all of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Hillside Memorial Park.
The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the UCLA
Foundation, 10945 LeConte Ave., Suite 3132, Los Angeles, CA 90095.</TE>

<HD>Riders Vexed by Old Signs</HD>
<DH>Transit advocates say MTA needs to work harder to ensure
bus postings are current. Agency responds it will fix inaccuracies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an agency responsible for 18,000 bus stops, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority sometimes has trouble keeping track of all
its posted signs and schedules.</LD>
<LD>   Some mistakes are innocuous. But other misleading and outdated
information can be a real nuisance to those who depend on public
transit, riders and advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   In Sylmar, unwitting riders sometimes wait under an outdated MTA
sign for buses that will never come.</LD>
<TE>   In South-Central Los Angeles, bus stop displays advise riders to
purchase their monthly transit passes and tokens from shops in the
San Fernando Valley. Riders recently puzzled over the directory of
authorized vendors in Van Nuys, Panorama City and Pacoima for buying
MTA passes and tokens.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they put that here? It doesn't have anything to do with
this area," said Deanna White, 15. "It's got no point, no meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Flowers, a 40-year-old nurse, believes the posted
information is correct. MTA "wouldn't put false stuff up there,"
Flowers said. "That just means [the Valley is] the best place to buy
tokens and passes."</TE>
<TE>   At one stop, the posted schedule for buses going east, from Marina
del Rey to Pico Rivera, says the service is "westbound."</TE>
<TE>   "The information is just not accurate," said Esther Garcia, a
23-year-old teacher's aide, as she waited for a bus near a
South-Central street corner. "I don't expect much from these signs. I
don't even look at them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows the extent of the problem. Some riders say they
believe mistakes are pervasive. MTA officials say they haven't
received many complaints about erroneous information displays or
schedules, but concede there may be some inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not infallible," said Warren Morse, deputy executive
officer of marketing and customer relations. "If someone finds
something inaccurate, we want to check it out so we can take
corrective action."</TE>
<TE>   A team of 16 employees works full time, seven days a week trying
to keep MTA's signs and information displays clean and up-to-date,
said Pete Serdienis, facilities maintenance manager. Twice a year,
when the agency modifies its bus routes, employees scramble across
Los Angeles County to update 4,000 to 6,000 signs.</TE>
<TE>   Posting route maps, schedules and other helpful information at bus
stops can boost ridership by making transit easier to use, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the responsibility of the transit agency to make sure the
information is correct," said Paul Larrousse, director of the
National Transit Institute of Rutgers University. "You've got to
devote staff and financial resources to maintaining it."</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, the MTA has installed hundreds of
information cubes that display routes and schedules at bus stops, and
has affixed hundreds of information decals to bus stop poles.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency needs to work harder to make sure that its signage
is accurate and current, riders and public transit advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the work is laughable and embarrassing," said Bart Reed,
executive director of the Transit Coalition, an advocacy group based
in Sylmar. "It's done in such a stupid manner."</TE>
<TE>   Some areas have so-called orphan bus stops, which advertise routes
that no longer exist, riders say. At Sylmar Juvenile Hall, employees
say they've warned visitors that buses no longer serve the detention
center, but some are still fooled by an MTA sign in front of the
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Seten, a senior detention services officer, and others
have seen people waiting for the phantom bus. "People don't know;
they're stuck," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other riders complain that buses often don't arrive at scheduled
times. The signs are "useless," said Wenlu Shen, 74, a retired
accountant from Alhambra, glaring at a bus stop information cube in
Chinatown. "Nobody looks at them."</TE>
<TE>   Erroneous transit signs can impede the MTA's efforts to improve
service. Along one Van Nuys route, where buses recently were added,
information dating from 1997 says buses arrive every 30 to 40 minutes
on Saturdays. In fact, they run every 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   When informed of the errors, MTA officials said they would remove
or correct the signs.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage the public to call us, to contact us," said
spokesman Gary Wosk. "We can't correct [mistakes] unless we know
about them."</TE>
<TE>   But others believe the burden shouldn't be on riders to report
such errors.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish those responsible at the agency would test their signage a
lot more than they do," Reed said. "They should have the ability to
get it right the first time."</TE>

<HD>Oil Well Fire Near Castaic Is Extinguished With 'Mud'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A team of oil field disaster specialists extinguished an oil well
fire near Castaic, nearly three days after a wellhead explosion
killed one man and left another badly burned, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control used drilling lubrication
fluid, called "mud," to smother the fire late Monday, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Gene Gaz, area manager for Caza Drilling, the contractor operating
the derrick where the fire occurred, said a temporary cover has been
placed on the well until a permanent cap can be installed.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Currington, 43, of Bakersfield, died in the 2 a.m. Saturday
blast, which occurred when a plume of natural gas shot out of the
well and caught fire. Another victim, Delton Rosson, 35, of
Bakersfield, underwent skin-graft surgery Tuesday and faces another
operation later this week, said a spokeswoman for the Grossman Burn
Center.</TE>

<LD>If this were baseball, you would score it: Error -- congressman.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) sent out a news release informing his
constituents that he had boldly gone out on a limb and supported a
resolution to honor the World Series winners from Anaheim (see
accompanying). But he had a little trouble (twice) spelling the
team's name. Get in the ballgame!</LD>
<LD>   Now that summer has arrived: Michael Friedman of Valley Village
noticed that Calabasas apparently has developed a new strategy to
induce people to vote. In March's election there, folks will able to
cast their ballots while swimming (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Such a deal: Des Roberts of West L.A. came upon an ad for a car
that has "CD, Leather &amp; More" -- and it ought to, considering the
monthly lease payment (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Hi, I'll be your unemployed actor tonight: Sam De Silva told the
show biz journal Back Stage West that when he moved to L.A. three
years ago, "I would spend hours a day driving up and down streets
looking for places to apply."</TE>
<TE>   Not for an acting job, but for a position as bartender or waiter.
De Silva made the best of his situation by writing "The Bar and
Restaurant Job Guide."</TE>
<TE>   Others haven't been so fortunate. So many thespians are chasing
jobs in the beverage biz that they have to summon all their dramatic
skills to land one. Back Stage told the story of an actress who
perfected an English accent and applied at a pub.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, halfway through the interview, the manager asked what part
of England she was from. Unable to ad lib, she dropped the accent and
answered: "Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed and hired the Yank anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal (part II): Sol Taylor of Sherman Oaks saw a garage
sale that displayed this sign: "Our objective is to get rid of all
this stuff. Prices are cheap, cheaper, and even cheaper yet.</TE>
<TE>   "If you criticize any item, the price is doubled. If you break any
item, you bought it. No extra charge for dust, dirt, grease, stains,
spots or rust."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Not to make a federal crime out of it, but if you're
using a U.S. Postal Service plastic tub for storing files or
something else, you're harboring government property (see photo). The
post office, which uses the tubs for the delivery of magazines,
catalogs and books, estimates that it has just 65,000 in stock for
the holiday season with millions of unreturned ones in private hands.
They want you to leave yours out for collection by the letter
carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not have the department go postal, OK?</TE>

<LD>Like most of our readers, I've got a pretty firm grasp of freeway
construction and what it takes to put up a good, solid $12-million
flyover that can handle thousands of cars. Kind of makes me wonder,
then, why things have gotten all goofed up there at the junction of
the 55 and 405 freeways.</LD>
<LD>   But they have, which will bum out drivers who pass through there,
with each trip seemingly more death-defying than the one before. It
is this generation of Orange County drivers' particular hell to watch
Caltrans improve our freeway system, while trying to stay alive long
enough to see the finished product.</LD>
<LD>   For a long time now, the 405-55 (oh, let's throw in the 73, too)
zone has resembled a battleground. Iraq should look so good after the
U.S. runs through it. Large piles of dirt, huge blocks of concrete,
giant cranes looming over the horizon as earth movers rumble --
they're as much a part of the Orange County landscape as wildflowers
and eucalyptus.</LD>
<TE>   Still, we soldier on because we're told things are getting better.
We put up with lanes that once were there but no longer are, with
exit ramps that one day are all yours and the next day include
onrushing traffic from your blind spot. We accept wavy traffic lanes
that make you think you're drunk when you're not, all while you're
driving in what often seems like a NASCAR qualifying run.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh, the concrete abutments that have become a fixture on the
freeway. We'll miss them when they're gone, along with the excitement
of watching other cars miss scraping them by six inches at 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   All in the name of progress.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we get the grim news.</TE>
<TE>   Even though we all learned with Tinker Toys how to build a simple
flyover (just connect one piece to the other), somebody on this
project forgot something. Some chunks of concrete have cracked and
fallen from the new flyover that will connect the 405 and the 55.
Experts have said the bridge (more like a long ramp) won't fall down,
but neither can they guarantee it could handle the expected passenger
load. An April 2003 opening has been delayed for months.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine everyone's embarrassment. Knowing how easy it is
to build a $12-million bridge, the various parties are wondering who
screwed up and hoping it's not them.</TE>
<TE>   The Times has reported one possibility: Taxpayers -- those same
people who risk life and limb daily while navigating the zone --
might be on the hook. That is not a foregone conclusion, however, and
I say if we can pin it on the designers or builders, let's do it.</TE>
<TE>   We lay people, given our knowledge of freeway and bridge
construction, have a pretty good idea what happened here. My own
suspicions were confirmed when I read in the paper last week that
there had been previously expressed fears that "cable connecting
ducts" needed additional support.</TE>
<TE>   Had to be, I thought. If true, that would mean the girder ducts
might blow out during prestressing. Nobody wants to see a blown-out
girder duct.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, my concerns reflected the exact language -- made
available in a report last week -- used by a Caltrans engineer who
was quoting the project manager for the builder.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so, we're all on the same page here. Let's fix this thing.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of the drivers who have suffered enough in the 55-405
zone, let me offer some simple suggestions: First, eliminate chunks
of concrete falling from the bridge. Then, bolster those cable
connecting ducts.</TE>
<TE>   If you have any other questions, give me a call.</TE>
<TE>   Readers may reach Parsons by calling (714) 966-7821.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. David Francis Clyde, 77, an internationally known expert on
malaria who conducted research in Tanzania and later worked on key
malarial vaccine studies, died of pancreatic cancer Nov. 12 in
Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Meruit, India -- the son of a doctor -- Clyde studied in
England as a child and, after the outbreak of World War II, in Kansas
City, Kan.</LD>
<LD>   He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas and
a medical degree from McGill University in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Clyde went to Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in the mid-1950s for the
British Colonial Medical Service as clinician, malariologist,
epidemiologist and deputy surgeon general.</TE>
<TE>   There he saw the devastating effects of malaria and became
convinced of the need for a vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   His research led to a doctorate in parasitology from the
University of London.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Clyde moved to the University of Maryland School of
Medicine to work on preventing malaria.</TE>
<TE>   He spent 1975-79 as director of the department of tropical
medicine at Louisiana State University School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Clyde served as head of the World Health Organization's
Southeast Asia Division based in Delhi, India.</TE>
<TE>   Clyde returned to Baltimore to teach at Johns Hopkins University
and, until 1992, he chaired malaria studies at the University of
Maryland.</TE>

<HD>George Barrie, 90; Faberge Owner Used Celebrities in Ads</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Barrie, 90, a retired chief executive for Faberge products who
created Brut cologne for men, died of pneumonia Saturday in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Barrie was among the first to use celebrities to advertise
fragrances. Actor Roger Moore, actresses Farrah Fawcett and Margaux
Hemingway, and football star Joe Namath peddled Faberge products at
one time. Barrie also convinced film legend Cary Grant to sit on
Faberge's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   The New York native's first job in the beauty business was with
Rayette hair care products. Several years later, Barrie established
his own company, Caryl Richards, and in 1964 he purchased Faberge
Inc., which he owned and operated for 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Barrie branched out to create the film company
Brut Productions, and produced a number of feature movies, including
"A Touch of Class" with Glenda Jackson and George Segal in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   An amateur musician, Barrie took a hand in the movie's title song,
collaborating with legendary songwriter Sammy Cahn. The song, "All
That Love Went to Waste," was nominated for an Academy Award.</TE>

<HD>City Looks at Housing for Seniors</HD>
<DH>Moorpark council to vote on a $16-million bond issue to
finance affordable apartments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to provide low-cost housing for Moorpark's elderly, the City
Council tonight is expected to approve a $16-million bond issue to
help finance a 190-unit apartment complex.</LD>
<LD>   Vintage Crest Senior Apartments, a two-story complex with a
community room, pool and spa, would be built on about 9 1/2 acres on
Park Lane, south of Los Angeles Avenue. The complex would accept only
tenants who are 55 and older with annual incomes of $31,380 or less.</LD>
<LD>   "This project represents a very important ingredient in the
formula we've set out to provide affordable housing in the
community," said Hugh Riley, assistant city manager.</LD>
<TE>   The $22.5-million project would be developed by USA Properties
Fund of Roseville, which also plans to build 176 senior apartments
across from Simi Valley's City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Vintage Crest is located in an area "that has great transportation
access, neighborhood shopping nearby, and it's a tranquil site, with
the Arroyo Simi running behind it," said Steve Gall, USA Properties
executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Gall said below-market financing available from the bonds, plus
federal tax credits, will make the project attractive to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Rents for the 579-square-foot, one-bedroom units would range from
$700 to $840; rents for two-bedroom units would range from $840 to
$1,008.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the council, the bonds would be sold next month and
construction would begin in late December or January, with the
apartments expected to be available by early 2004.</TE>

<HD>Seven More Shot in L.A.</HD>
<DH>After Chief Bratton sounds alarms over 13 deaths on 'four
horrific days,' gang violence rages on in the south side of town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven people were shot on the streets of South Los Angeles Tuesday
night in less than an hour, continuing a spate of violence in the
city for the fifth straight day. One man was killed and two were
critically wounded.</LD>
<LD>   Between 6:40 and 7:15 p.m., attackers opened fire on men and women
between the ages of 20 and 25 in three separate incidents. Police
said at least two of the shootings appeared to be gang-related.</LD>
<LD>   "We do have a gang war. We have several," said Capt. James Miller
of the 77th Street Division as he surveyed the scene of the third
shooting at 76th Street and Western Avenue. "I've had 77 gang-related
homicides this year, involving 46 gangs, so that's where my problem
is."</LD>
<TE>   The shootings followed one the deadliest weekends on Los Angeles
city streets in recent memory. Thirteen people were killed between
Friday night and Monday, in what Police Chief William J. Bratton
called "four horrific days."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has warned that the city could become the homicide capital
of the U.S. by the end of the year. A total of 592 possible homicides
have occurred so far, the most since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A highly disproportionate number of the shootings have taken place
in South Los Angeles, and Bratton on Tuesday said the department
would begin a push to tackle the violence there. The chief already
has already ordered police officials to beef up their patrol presence
and has met with civic leaders to discuss what the community can do
to help.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Tuesday night's shootings, Bratton was calling
officers on their cell phones asking to be briefed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack took place on the corner of 83th Street and
Western Avenue. A man was shot in the head and later died. Police
said they didn't know what the dispute was about.</TE>
<TE>   The next two appeared to be gang-related, officials said, but
involved different gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 7 p.m., at 66th Street and Vermont Avenue, one woman
and two men were struck about 7:10 p.m., the woman in the leg, one of
the men in the back and the other in the leg. They were in stable
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes later, 76th and Western, three people were attacked
in another walk-up shooting. This time, one man was hit in the head,
one in the chest. They were in critical condition. A third was shot
in the leg and was in stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   No one was in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Loren Hickenbottom, 21, said he had dodged bullets and his friend
was struck as they stood outside an apartment building at 83rd and
Western. the scene of the first attack. "Four people dressed in black
walked up, showed us guns in their waistband and started shooting. No
words were said," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he was giving a statement to police, Hickenbottom said, he
heard the shots at 76th and Western and raced over.</TE>
<TE>   "How is something not going to be related if it happened within
minutes of each other?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors stood nervously talking a few yards from police tape
marking off an alley near 76th Street. Several said they had heard
gunfire, but no voices or cars.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just quiet, and all I heard was pop, pop, pop," said an
18-year-old who declined to give his name.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Lavender, 40, a 30-year resident of the neighborhood,
criticized police.</TE>
<TE>   "All this shooting? What are they doing? Nothing. They're not
doing something right," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The "new chief", Hickenbottom said, "can't do anything. [Former
Police Chief] Bernard Parks' own granddaughter got killed, and he
couldn't do anything about it."</TE>

<HD>County Urged to Grant Reprieve to Rehab Center</HD>
<DH>Woman in a wheelchair speaks for many when she says
patients will allow closure of Rancho Los Amigos 'over our dead
batteries.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 supporters of Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation
Center urged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday to
reconsider its decision to close the hospital, but members of the
board made no move to back away from their plans to shut it down.</LD>
<LD>   The sometimes raucous protest was the latest in a series of
actions by advocates of the 207-bed hospital, which specializes in
treating catastrophic injuries and ailments, including spinal cord
and head injuries, strokes, diabetes and liver problems.</LD>
<LD>   Rancho supporters said they would allow the county to close
Rancho, in the words of one woman in a motorized wheelchair, "over
our dead batteries."</LD>
<TE>   County officials are faced with a health-care deficit budget
projected to reach $500 million to $750 million in three years. The
Board of Supervisors decided in October that the county would save
$60 million to $70 million a year by closing Rancho, which treats
about 9,500 patients annually.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, a vocal cadre of patients used time allotted
for public comments during the board's weekly meeting to alternately
scold the supervisors for their decision and plead with them to
reconsider it.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts, the patients said, would come at the expense of some of
Los Angeles' most vulnerable people.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by doctors, health-care workers and advocates for
the disabled, including Eve Hill, executive director of the Western
Law Center for Disability Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said it would be discriminatory for the county to close
Rancho after the passage of Measure B, a property tax designed to
help fund the trauma care system that voters approved earlier this
month. That tax does not directly benefit Rancho because it is not
technically a trauma center.</TE>
<TE>   "You have proposed to eliminate the piece of the trauma system
that serves people with disabilities," Hill said. "[The county] must
provide services to meet the health-care needs of all its citizens,
not just those who are able-bodied."</TE>
<TE>   Waving signs that said "Keep Rancho Open, Keep Rancho County,"
critics of the decision to close Rancho filled many of the seats in
the hearing room, and the aisles were lined with people in
wheelchairs, many waiting to speak.</TE>
<TE>   The deluge of criticism sparked a defensive reaction from the
supervisors, including Gloria Molina, who objected when a man said
she voted to close Rancho because it was politically safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still trying to save an entire health-care system," Molina
said. "You may congratulate somebody on this board who isn't willing
to stand up to reality ... but we have a job to do and the reality is
that we are here to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Molina's comment was apparently a reference to Supervisor Don
Knabe, who cast the lone vote against closing Rancho, which is in his
district.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take my shots from Gloria," Knabe said. "I just didn't feel
the people at Rancho were given a fair shake on that issue."</TE>

<HD>Spitzer Surprises Colleagues by Quitting O.C. Board Early</HD>
<DH>Assemblyman-elect leaves them smiling after tenure marked
by some bitter battles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, whose brash style shocked and
shook up the often stodgy board he joined in 1997, staged his exit
from county government Tuesday with signature panache.</LD>
<LD>   He quit.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer was planning to leave anyway by Dec. 2, when he'll be
sworn in as the county's newest Assembly member.</LD>
<TE>   Still, waiting until the end of a 3 1/2-hour meeting with only a
handful of onlookers, Spitzer dropped one final fast one: He said he
was too busy preparing for his new job to give proper attention to
his old one. So he turned over his office to board Chairwoman Cynthia
Coad.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to have you leave any earlier than you have to," Coad
said with apparent surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The early exit, in fact, could have a personal impact on Coad: It
will probably disqualify her husband, Tom Coad, from running in a
special election in January to fill Spitzer's seat. Tom Coad didn't
register to vote in time at a new address in Spitzer's district,
elections officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The move was classic Spitzer, a vocal fighter for just causes in
the eyes of some, a shameless self-promoter in the eyes of others.</TE>
<TE>   He'd sparred with every one of his colleagues, demanding more than
asking, constantly confronting staff as he transformed his bully
pulpit into a billy club. At the same time, his overt political
ambition reshaped a county body seen more as a route to retirement
than a springboard to greater glory.</TE>
<TE>   Other supervisors were quick to acknowledge that their younger
colleague had rubbed off on them.</TE>
<TE>   "You kept things very, very lively," deadpanned Supervisor Chuck
Smith, who along with Coad sparred with Spitzer for six years over a
proposed airport planned for the former El Toro Marine base. Spitzer
opposed the airport, a view ultimately shared by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck, I have some holes in my door that you kicked," interrupted
Supervisor Jim Silva, who at one point was so sure that Spitzer had
leaked sensitive information from closed-door meetings that he tried
to have the behavior declared a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer reveled in the attention: fidgeting in his overstuffed
chair, his square jaw grinding overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the meeting, he'd mugged with Coad, their sometime
squabbles forgotten amid her accolades for a departing colleague. "I
know people have mixed emotions about me," he said. When the audience
erupted in guffaws, he turned and grinned. "What? Is that an
understatement?"</TE>
<TE>   Government watchdog Shirley Grindle of Orange, a constituent who
has known every board member for the last 33 years, said Spitzer was
one of a handful of supervisors who emerged as true leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very sorry to see him leave," she said, even while condemning
his recent vote to allow a housing development in Trabuco Canyon. "I
don't see any other person on the board willing to ask the tough
questions and raise uncomfortable issues."</TE>
<TE>   Among the projects Spitzer finished Tuesday was the board's
unanimous approval to spend $4.5 million to buy more than 500 acres
of the Barham Ranch, a swath of rugged hills in Orange adjacent to
Santiago Oaks Regional Park. Spitzer said he remembered the advice he
heard when joining the board in 1997, intent on restoring
accountability in a government disgraced by its historic bankruptcy
three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "They said you can do anything if you can count to three," he
said, referring to the three votes needed to approve board items. "I
thought I could do anything by counting to one for the longest time."</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer won the day on a number of big issues. He was once the
lone board critic of then-County Executive Officer Jan Mittermeier,

concluded it was time for her to go. There were those who weren't
sorry to see Spitzer go, including Tom Coad, who'd declared a month
ago that he intended to run in the special election for the 3rd
District seat. Other announced candidates are 71st District
Assemblyman Bill Campbell, whom Spitzer is replacing in Sacramento,
and Orange Councilman Michael Alvarez.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer Quits O.C. Board Early</HD>
<DH>Assemblyman-elect leaves them smiling after tenure marked
by some bitter battles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, whose brash style shocked and
shook up the often stodgy board he joined in 1997, staged his exit
from county government Tuesday with signature panache.</LD>
<LD>   He quit.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer was planning to leave anyway by Dec. 2, when he'll be
sworn in as the county's newest Assembly member.</LD>
<TE>   Still, waiting until the end of a 3 1/2-hour meeting with only a
handful of onlookers, Spitzer dropped one final fast one: He said he
was too busy preparing for his new job to give proper attention to
his old one. So he turned over his office to board Chairwoman Cynthia
P. Coad.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to have you leave any earlier than you have to," Coad
said with apparent surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The early exit, in fact, could have a personal impact on Coad: It
will probably disqualify her husband, Tom Coad, from running in a
special election in January to fill Spitzer's seat. Tom Coad didn't
register to vote in time at a new address in Spitzer's district,
elections officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The move was classic Spitzer, a vocal fighter for just causes in
the eyes of some, a shameless self-promoter in the eyes of others.</TE>
<TE>   He'd sparred with every one of his colleagues, demanding more than
asking, constantly confronting staff as he transformed his bully
pulpit into a billy club. At the same time, his overt political
ambition reshaped a county body seen more as a route to retirement
than a springboard to greater glory.</TE>
<TE>   Other supervisors were quick to acknowledge that their younger
colleague had rubbed off on them.</TE>
<TE>   "You kept things very, very lively," deadpanned Supervisor Chuck
Smith, who along with Coad sparred with Spitzer for six years over a
proposed airport planned for the former El Toro Marine base. Spitzer
opposed the airport, a view ultimately shared by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally don't remember any disagreements," Smith continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck, I have some holes in my door that you kicked," interrupted
Supervisor Jim Silva, who at one point was so sure that Spitzer had
leaked sensitive information from closed-door meetings that he tried
to have the behavior declared a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer reveled in the attention: fidgeting in his overstuffed
chair, his square jaw grinding overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the meeting, he'd mugged with Coad, their sometime
squabbles forgotten amid her accolades for a departing colleague. He
stood behind her, first pretending to choke her and then flashing a
V-sign above her head as cameras broadcast the exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people have mixed emotions about me," he said. When the
audience erupted in guffaws, he turned and grinned. "What? Is that an
understatement?"</TE>
<TE>   Government watchdog Shirley Grindle of Orange, a constituent who
has known every board member for the last 33 years, said Spitzer was
one of a handful of supervisors who emerged as true leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very sorry to see him leave," she said, even while condemning
his recent vote to allow a housing development in Trabuco Canyon. "I
don't see any other person on the board willing to ask the tough
questions and raise uncomfortable issues."</TE>
<TE>   Among the projects Spitzer finished Tuesday was the board's
unanimous approval to spend $4.5 million to buy more than 500 acres
of the Barham Ranch, a swath of rugged hills in Orange adjacent to
Santiago Oaks Regional Park. He worked on the project for five years
to provide more open space for the park-starved area.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he remembered the advice he heard when joining the
board in 1997, intent on restoring accountability in a government
disgraced by its historic bankruptcy three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "They said you can do anything if you can count to three," he
said, referring to the three votes needed to approve board items. "I
thought I could do anything by counting to one for the longest time."</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer won the day on a number of big issues. He was once the
lone board critic of then-County Executive Officer Jan Mittermeier,
whom he considered autocratic. But eventually, the rest of the board
concluded it was time for her to go. He led the charge against the
board majority on El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's outspoken nature didn't sit well with some, who
nicknamed him "Ready, Fire, Aim."</TE>
<TE>   There were those who weren't sorry to see Spitzer go, including
Tom Coad, who'd declared a month ago that he intended to run in the
special election for the 3rd District seat. Other announced
candidates are 71st District Assemblyman Bill Campbell, whom Spitzer
is replacing in Sacramento, and Orange Councilman Michael Alvarez.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's abrupt departure moves up the election from Feb. 4 to
Jan. 28. Under state law, to qualify for that election, candidates
would have had to be registered as residents of the district by Nov.
16.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coad said Tuesday that he put his new registration in the mail
Sunday. It hadn't been received by elections officials as of late
Tuesday. He said he has asked County Counsel Ben de Mayo for a ruling
on whether he still can run.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say whether he thought Spitzer chose to leave early
to thwart the campaign hopes of his former airport nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't blame anybody without knowing for sure," Tom Coad said.</TE>

<HD>County OKs Plan for 795 Homes in Tonner Canyon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved the construction of 795
homes in Tonner Canyon and the area's eventual annexation by Brea,
overriding concerns by environmentalists about houses being built
atop a former oil field.</LD>
<LD>   City officials voted for the development last month. Nuevo Energy
Co. promised to keep the bulk of the 798 acres as open space,
building on 180 acres and restoring the rest. About 16 acres will
remain in oil production until it is phased out.</LD>
<LD>   Three key changes made the project more palatable, county Planning
Director Tom Mathews said: The developer threw out plans to extend
Tonner Canyon Road, eliminated a commercial site and agreed not to
allow any bus storage or maintenance--a worry of city officials and
nearby residents.</LD>
<TE>   "I firmly believe the proper balance has been struck with this
project," Supervisor Todd Spitzer said. "We need more housing, not
less."</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers, however, criticized the county's environmental
review. They said traffic already is heavy from the Riverside Freeway
overflow and would get worse with 795 more homes.</TE>

<HD>Oak's Survival After Move Debated</HD>
<DH>Company says ancient tree in Santa Clarita Valley can be
saved with proper care, but conservationists argue against a
transplant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While activist John Quigley remained nestled in his perch in a
towering oak, the debate continued at ground level Tuesday over
whether the 400-year-old Santa Clarita Valley tree he is trying to
save could survive a move.</LD>
<LD>   Experts said it is possible to relocate the ancient oak, but
acknowledged that its ultimate survival will depend on how well the
tree is maintained once it is transplanted.</LD>
<LD>   "I honestly believe the tree can be moved, it can be saved, and
with the proper maintenance it will live," said Stuart Sperber, chief
executive of Valley Crest Tree Co. in Calabasas, which has been
tapped for the job. "But how long is the tree going to live? That's a
very good question. There are no guarantees, unfortunately."</LD>
<TE>   Several arborists said the uncertainty makes moving the tree a bad
plan. They said they are concerned that such a large and old tree
would not survive the move.</TE>
<TE>   "Trees are not meant to move," said Rosi Dagit of the Resource
Conservation District of the Santa Monica Mountains. "They don't do
that as part of their natural life cycle."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley, who has maintained a three-week vigil as part of a
campaign to preserve the oak, also has doubts about moving it. He is
asking arborists from across the state to weigh in on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "What it's really become," he said, "is a battle of the experts."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's supporters may unveil a new plan to save the tree at a
rally today at noon at the downtown office of Los Angeles County
Supervisor Mike Antonovich.</TE>
<TE>   It was Antonovich who proposed relocating the tree, which
developer John Laing Homes is required to move to make way for a
road-widening project necessary for future development in the
fast-growing region.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said he was assured by Valley Crest officials that it
could successfully move the oak from the site. The developer would
pick up the estimated $250,000 cost.</TE>
<TE>   Sperber said his company has moved thousands of trees during the
last 50 years, but none as large as the Santa Clarita Valley oak. He
said giving trees the proper care after they are transplanted is
crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not an advocate of just going in there and moving trees,"
he said. "We've had very good success because the developers have
made a point of maintaining them afterward."</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1988, Valley Crest moved more than 1,500 trees to make
way for a Ventura County luxury home development, Sperber said. About
90% of those trees have survived, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Tuesday, John Laing Homes said, "The best
solution for saving the tree is to move it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Valley Crest's success, Dagit found a different outcome in
Calabasas, where she has spent the last decade studying 87 oaks that
were transplanted in 1992. By April of this year, 17 of those trees
had died, 44 were in declining health and five were deemed
self-sufficient, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the trees cost nearly $1 million; maintenance and
monitoring ran $60,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of how many new oaks could have been planted for that sum,"
Dagit wrote in a recent journal article.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, a UC Riverside professor found that 57% of 593
oaks moved from a development project died three years later, with
another 14% in declining condition.</TE>
<TE>   And the city of San Bernardino had a high-profile problem with a
tree relocation in 1989, when residents raised money to move a
65-foot magnolia from a construction site to Seccombe Lake Park,
where it was featured on a new tourist-oriented "history walk."</TE>
<TE>   The move went well, but two years later the tree died, said Jim
Gondos, project coordinator for the city's Parks Department.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Head, who ran the landscape company that moved the tree, said
the city refused to take the extra care to water the tree's damaged
roots.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just dry as a bone," he said. "Within two years, the bark
was completely peeling off of it and they had to tear it down."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Quigley received a public endorsement and a visit
Tuesday from actress Rene Russo, who praised him for his activism.</TE>
<TE>   "Why have we not figured out a way to integrate the land with
people?" she asked. "Why has it come to this?"</TE>

<HD>'Kidding' or Plotting Murder?</HD>
<DH>A woman says she was joking when she discussed killing her
lover's wife with the alleged shooter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim woman accused of plotting to kill her lover's wife
tearfully testified Tuesday that she was drunk and only joking when
she talked about it with the alleged hit man.</LD>
<LD>   Adrianna Vasco, 35, said she and Dennis Godley, 32, were drunk and
on drugs when he confided in her, telling her that he was a fugitive
from North Carolina, wanted for robbery.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me about people he had in Carolina that would take care
of people," she testified. "So I told him I have a doctor friend that
wants to take care of his wife."</LD>
<TE>   Godley walked out of the room, then returned and took the offer,
Vasco testified.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I was just kidding," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't kid like that," she said Godley told her. "If you
say anything now, I'm going to kill you and your kids."</TE>
<TE>   "I was aware of the big mistake I made," she told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco and Godley are accused of hatching a murder-for-hire plot to
kill optometrist Carolyn Oppy-Stahl, 44, for $30,000. Prosecutors
said the plan went awry and Godley also killed Kenneth Stahl, 57, an
anesthesiologist who was having an affair with Vasco, a medical
secretary he met in 1992, to eliminate a witness. Their bodies were
found inside Oppy-Stahl's Dodge Stratus on Nov. 20, 1999, along
Ortega Highway in San Juan Capistrano by a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Vasco wanted to kill Oppy-Stahl because she was
interfering with her relationship with Kenneth Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco testified that Stahl had talked about killing his wife since
1995. When Godley ran out of money in 1999, she said, he forced her
to call Stahl and set up a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In opening his cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Conway
told jurors that Vasco is not as innocent as she tries to portray
herself. She is "freaky" and "aggressive," he said, and had been
convicted of physically abusing a boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   He accused her of knowing the plot since the three of them,
including Stahl, had met several times at a Huntington Beach mall and
Vasco gave Godley an envelope of money. The three also met on Ortega
Highway the day before the murders.</TE>
<TE>   "The only link from Ken to [Godley] is you," Conway said during
cross-examination. "Do you know that that looks really bad on you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she replied.</TE>
<TE>   "The die was cast for Carolyn's death and you knew that and you
didn't call the cops?" Conway asked. "You think he was going to kill
you and your kids. What, you think he wasn't going to kill Carolyn
Stahl? Didn't you think the day before was a dry run?"</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are expected to conclude today.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Rejects Proposal for Lowe's Store</HD>
<DH>Council members say they didn't object to the
home-improvement giant but to a drugstore that was expected to be one
of the site's tenants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura City Council has unanimously turned down a deal that
would have boosted city revenue by bringing a Lowe's home-improvement
store to a site now occupied by an empty Montgomery Ward building.</LD>
<LD>   Council members took pains to point out that their unexpected
rejection Monday night did not signal any less interest in securing
the home-improvement giant. They objected, however, to the project's
developer tentatively lining up a Sav-On drugstore instead of a more
upscale retailer as one of the midtown site's three tenants.</LD>
<LD>   "People are panting in this town for Lowe's to get off the
ground," Councilman Sandy Smith said. "To think we can't get a better
tenant [than a drugstore] at that site doesn't make any sense. We
feel like we're taking a big step backward."</LD>
<TE>   The drugstore chain most likely would move to the site from
another Ventura location, city officials said. Such a move would
create no new sales tax income for the city and leave a vacancy in a
shopping center elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The council's opposition surprised Thomas Malayil, a real estate
executive for the Macerich development firm. Malayil said months of
discussions with city staff members led him to believe that Monday's
meeting would be "a formality."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we've been misguided," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a proposal from city staff members that the council
agree to a request from Macerich and sign away its option to buy the
13 1/2-acre Ward's site across Mills Road from the Pacific View mall.
By abandoning its right to buy the property from Macerich, the city
would open the door for the purchase of 11 acres by Lowe's.</TE>
<TE>   But the sticking point Monday night involved the remaining 2 1/2
acres, which would still be owned by Macerich and very likely be
leased to a bank and a drugstore. City officials had hoped for a
high-end home furnishings store such as Pottery Barn or Crate &amp;
Barrel. But Malayil said such stores see no advantage in a Ventura
site.</TE>
<TE>   "Crate &amp; Barrel isn't even at The Oaks," said Malayil, whose firm
owns both The Oaks shopping center in Thousand Oaks and Ventura's
Pacific View mall. "We'll be able to bring these better uses to
Ventura in time, but they feel the demographics aren't here yet."</TE>
<TE>   That explanation did not satisfy council members, nor did the
company's claim that the Lowe's deal would collapse unless the city
acted immediately. "Those are negotiating tactics," Councilman Jim
Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   By turning down Macerich, the city may be forced by its contract
with the company to either buy the property or sell its option within
six months. That prospect did not worry Mayor Ray Di Guilio, who
passionately urged rejection of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about what's best for Ventura," he said. "It's about
[Macerich] getting the biggest return for their investment. If Lowe's
goes somewhere else, there will be another tenant who wants the
site."</TE>
<TE>   For several years Ventura officials have sought a big
home-improvement store as a way to keep a sizable amount of sales tax
dollars from flowing down the freeway to Oxnard. Two years ago,
pressure from residents worried over traffic and noise sunk a Home
Depot planned for the site of a defunct drive-in theater less than a
mile from the Ward's site.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the proposed Lowe's -- which at 135,000 square feet
would be 25% larger than the proposed Home Depot -- faced milder
neighborhood opposition, despite its location at one of the city's
most congested intersections.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for homeowners in the adjacent Buenaventura Gardens
condominiums said a Lowe's would be far better on the site than the
building abandoned after the Ward's bankruptcy. "Dead stores are the
death knell of any neighborhood," Ed Lacey told the council.</TE>

<HD>Admission Policies Not Leading to More Diversity, Report
Says</HD>
<DH>Universities that use guaranteed acceptance instead of
affirmative action do not see an increase in minority enrollment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Policies in California, Texas and Florida that guarantee admission to
public universities for top high school graduates do not make
campuses more diverse, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said
Tuesday in a draft report.</LD>
<LD>   Minority students in those three states are faring worse or no
better than they were under affirmative action programs, according to
the report.</LD>
<LD>   "If percentage plans grow in popularity, it is inevitable that the
number of minority students attending the most prestigious public
universities will decrease," commission Chairwoman Mary Frances Berry
said.</LD>
<TE>   The percentage plans guarantee admission to the top 4% of
graduates at California high schools, the top 10% in Texas and the
top 20% in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, the report showed fewer blacks and Latinos were admitted
and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin in 2001 than in
1996, before a federal court outlawed affirmative action in
admissions at public universities.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the same was true in graduate law and medical
admissions, the report said. The state voted to end race-based
admissions in 1996, although the ban did not take effect until the
1998-99 school year.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's state university system showed an increase in black and
Latino students since the advent of Gov. Jeb Bush's program to end
affirmative action in 2000. But at the University of Florida, the
most selective state institution, their numbers dropped.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Bush's office released figures showing that the
number of minority students enrolling for the first time at state
universities rose in the current school year, but not as quickly as
the overall growth in incoming students.</TE>
<TE>   That means that minority enrollment dropped almost half a
percentage point compared to last year's incoming class, despite the
overall increase.</TE>
<TE>   Bush maintained that the numbers show that his plan is helping
increase minority enrollment. "What I said was there would be more
African American and Hispanic students attending our university
system," he said in September. "Promise made, promise kept."</TE>
<TE>   University of California spokesman Hanan Eisenman said the
percentage of minority enrollment has increased for four straight
years and now exceeds what it was before the policy barring race as a
factor in admissions went into effect. California and the civil
rights commission used different base years in comparing affirmative
action admissions to those under percentage plans.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an initial drop, but since then we've been rebounding,"
Eisenman said.</TE>
<TE>   The California university system said that minority enrollment at
the medical and law schools is up over last year, but still is lower
than before Proposition 209, which outlawed affirmative action.</TE>

<HD>Compromise Salvages Security Bill</HD>
<DH>GOP concession quashes a potentially crippling Democratic
amendment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A key concession Tuesday by Republican leaders staved off passage of
a potentially crippling Democratic amendment, clearing the way for
Senate passage of the bill creating a Department of Homeland
Security.</LD>
<LD>   Under a deal brokered by Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) even as the roll call on the amendment proceeded, lawmakers
will have a rare chance early next year to make a handful of
revisions after the bill becomes law.</LD>
<LD>   Those changes would modify provisions in the bill that have been
attacked as special-interest favors for the pharmaceutical industry
and others.</LD>
<TE>   Lott secured assurances from House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) and Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) that the House would
look favorably on three proposed changes, lawmakers and aides said.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed revision would narrow a liability protection for
vaccine makers, exempting pending litigation. Another would restrict
the ability of companies to obtain government contracts if they move
overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. A third would open up to more
competition a homeland security research center many lawmakers
presume was directed toward Texas A&amp;M University.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, who will serve as majority leader in the next Senate, called
Hastert and DeLay from a cloakroom while three Republican centrists
-- Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Lincoln
Chafee of Rhode Island -- were listening. Hastert was reached while
en route to Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's assurances helped persuade the three Republican swing votes
and Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) to oppose the Democratic proposal to
strip the controversial provisions from the homeland security bill
now.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment failed, 52 to 47. Had it passed, the Senate might
have been drawn into a fight with the House that could have doomed
the bill for this year.</TE>
<TE>   Every Senate Republican except John McCain of Arizona opposed the
Democratic amendment. Along with Nelson, those Democrats breaking
ranks to vote against it were Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who
faces a Dec. 7 runoff in her reelection bid, and Zell Miller of
Georgia. Independent Sen. Dean Barkley of Minnesota also opposed the
amendment after obtaining what he said was a commitment from the
administration to waive certain requirements for his state under the
1996 Welfare Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said Lott told him that Senate and House Republican leaders
would favor bringing up the proposed revisions to the homeland
security bill at the first opportunity in the new Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm assuming it will be done in good faith," Nelson said. "It was
explained to me in good faith, and we'll just have to wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), soon to be head of
the minority, laughed when asked about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard promises like that before," Daschle said. "I'm very
dubious."</TE>

drifting toward a violent merger and an eruption of energy that will
warp the fabric of space. It is all happening in a bright galaxy 400
million light-years away.</LD>
<LD>   Images from the orbiting Chandra X-Ray Observatory have captured
for the first time the circling dance of two black holes -- each
millions of times the mass of the sun -- as they whirl around each
other in a 100-million-year pirouette to merger.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time we have ever identified a binary black
hole," said Stefanie Komossa, an astronomer at the Max Planck
Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and the co-author of a study
of the double black hole. "This is the aftermath of two galaxies that
collided sometime in the past."</LD>
<TE>   Each of the galaxies was about the size of the Milky Way, with
billions of stars, and each contained at its center a super-massive
black hole with a mass equal to perhaps 100 million suns, Komossa
said Tuesday at a news conference announcing the discovery. When they
blended, the galaxies formed a single, extraordinarily bright galaxy
in the constellation Ophiuchus known as NGC 6240. Because of its
distance from the Earth, the image now seen is 400 million years old.</TE>
<TE>   Although NGC 6240 is far away, astronomers said the merger is a
glimpse of what may await the Earth's galaxy. Astronomers believe
that in about 4 billion years, the billions of stars and the black
holes of the Milky Way and of the nearby Andromeda galaxy will
collide and merge.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing our own future," said Steinn Sigurdsson, a
Pennsylvania State University astronomer who participated in the news
conference as a visiting expert.</TE>
<TE>   The astronomers said that as the galaxies of NGC 6240 merged, the
two black holes began circling each other, starting a
100-million-year spiral toward a collision that was expected to spew
radiation and gravitational waves across the universe. That collision
would not be viewed on Earth for at least another 100 million years,
the astronomers said.</TE>
<TE>   Gunther Hasinger, a Max Planck astrophysicist and co-author of the
study, said the Chandra images indicate the black holes are about
3,000 light-years apart and circling each other at a speed of about
22,000 mph. As they grow closer and closer over millions of years,
the circling speed will get faster and faster, eventually approaching
the speed of light, about 671 million mph, Hasinger said.</TE>
<TE>   When the black holes merge, much of the angular momentum of their
waltz will be converted into gravitational waves that will race
across the universe, touching and affecting everything they pass,
Hasinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Centrella, a NASA astrophysicist who did not participate in
the Chandra study, said the merger would briefly warp the fabric of
space, just as a pebble thrown into a still pond will cause
bank-to-bank ripples. The effect of the gravitational waves on other
stars, galaxies and planets will be like the way ripples in that pond
cause floating leaves to rise and fall slightly, said Centrella.</TE>
<TE>   "The ripple across space will be such that a planet could
pulsate," said Sigurdsson. "A whole planet could be squeezed by an
inch or so every few minutes," depending on how close it is to the
merged black holes. Satellites would jiggle and navigation equipment
could wobble momentarily, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The merge will also trigger an enormous eruption of light and
X-rays, spewing in all directions, along with jets of plasma matter
racing out of the ends of the doughnut-shaped cloud of dust and gas
swirling about the black holes.</TE>
<TE>   Hasinger said the two black holes have enormous appetites -- each
minute sucking in mass about equal to that of the sun.</TE>
<TE>   A black hole is a point in space so dense with matter that its
gravitational field will not let anything -- not even light --
escape. Stellar black holes, each with a mass of 3 1/2 to 15 times
that of the sun, can be formed by the collapse of a single massive
star. But galactic black holes, such as those in NGC 6240, are much
larger, equal perhaps to many millions of solar masses, and are
usually at the center of a galaxy. The Milky Way, home galaxy of our
solar system, has a black hole at its center.</TE>
<TE>   With its immense gravitational pull, a black hole can suck in gas,
dust and other matter from surrounding space. Entire stars can be
stripped and pulled into the bottomless maw.</TE>
<TE>   As it spirals in at near light speeds, matter captured by a black
hole heats by millions of degrees and gives out intense radiation in
several parts of the spectrum, including X-rays. The Chandra
observatory can detect these X-rays down to the very edge of the
black hole and relay the data to Earth for study by astronomers.</TE>

<LD>At least 81 people treated at a cancer clinic in Fremont have tested
positive for hepatitis C in an outbreak that may have been caused by
a contaminated vial of medicine, health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Tom Safranek, the state epidemiologist, said poor medical
practices at Dr. Tahir Javed's clinic may be to blame.</LD>
<LD>   It is possible that a clinic worker used a syringe to administer
medicine to a patient who had hepatitis C, then drew more medicine
from the same vial for the patient with the same syringe, Safranek
said.</LD>

<HD>Senate Approves Plan to Pay Bills Until January</HD>
<DH>Stopgap budget delays tough decisions until GOP-led
Congress convenes. Some worry about impact on domestic programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate passed a bill Tuesday night that keeps the government's
domestic programs running through mid-January at current spending
levels, a stopgap budget that clears the way for the 107th Congress
to adjourn.</LD>
<LD>   The spending bill, which was approved 92-2 and has passed the
House, postpones major budget decisions until after the new
GOP-controlled Congress convenes in early January.</LD>
<LD>   The measure is needed because lawmakers have passed only two of
the 13 appropriation bills -- for the Pentagon and military
construction -- needed to finance the government in the budget year
that began Oct. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Postponing action on the other spending bills culminates a year of
budget meltdown that has been almost without precedent. Not in recent
memory has Congress left so much of its basic fiscal work undone for
so long.</TE>
<TE>   "That's almost malpractice by the 107th Congress, to leave town
without having completed the basic functions of the Congress," said
Robert Reischauer, a budget expert who heads the Urban Institute, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The deadlock had its roots not only in divisions between the
parties on spending priorities, but also in intraparty schisms. For
the first time since the modern budget process was established, the
Senate failed to pass a budget resolution setting spending guidelines
for the year -- largely because Democrats who control the Senate
could not keep their party together behind such a plan.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, appropriation bills were stalled largely by a power
struggle within the GOP that pitted conservative leaders -- who want
to keep spending on non-entitlement programs to President Bush's
request of about $750 billion -- against members of the powerful
Appropriations Committee, who want to spend more.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the government running after Oct. 1, Congress passed a
series of short-term measures to keep funding at last year's levels.
The latest version would extend that funding level through Jan. 11,
which is more than one-quarter into the current budget year.</TE>
<TE>   That means most programs scheduled for increases in pending
appropriation bills will not get them before mid-January, if then.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that shortchanges the bipartisan initiatives that
reflect new priorities of the last year, including homeland security
and corporate reform, for which big increases are in the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) said that
holding spending to last year's level amounted to "forcing the entire
domestic side of the government to operate by automatic pilot."</TE>
<TE>   House Appropriations Chairman C.W. "Bill" Young (R-Fla.) said in a
memo to GOP leaders last month that freezing domestic program
spending would have "disastrous impacts on the war on terror,
homeland security and other important government responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   To ease the pressure on the homeland security programs, the
stopgap spending bill includes a provision giving the secretary of
the new Department of Homeland Security authority to transfer up to
$500 million between agencies being folded into the new department.
It also provided $140 million in start-up costs for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Making up for another lapse of this Congress, the stopgap bill
provides for an extension of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul
through Jan. 11. That law expires at the end of this year, but
Congress did not reach agreement on a renewal; another bill to extend
the program through March 2003 died in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The stopgap spending bill guarantees that the first issue to come
before the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 7, will be to settle
spending disputes that have eluded lawmakers for months.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with Republican appropriation leaders last week, Bush
said he wanted the funding dispute resolved by the time he delivers
his State of the Union address, either in late January or early
February. He urged them to stick as close as possible to his
$750-billion figure, a source familiar with the exchange said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), incoming chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said he expected the final funding to be a
little higher than that to accommodate additional demands on the
president's budget, such as drought aid and firefighting costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working out a new number that would be effective," Stevens
said.</TE>

<HD>City May Soon Be Wetting Whistle</HD>
<DH>Monmouth, Ore., voters ended a temperance law in existence
since 1858. Loss of the town's only market was pivotal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONMOUTH, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The last legal drink sold in this town founded by Christian pioneers
changed hands in 1858, back when the West was still wild, the Eastern
railroads ended on the Great Plains and Oregon had yet to earn its
star on the American flag.</LD>
<LD>   The next legal drink could be sold as soon as January, ending
Monmouth's claim as the last dry city on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in this community of tree-shrouded, wood-frame houses
decided Nov. 5 to allow beer and wine sales in hopes of reviving the
local retail district and attracting a grocery store. The town of
7,800 has been without a market for two years.</LD>
<TE>   "We hardly have a downtown as it is," said Carol Nelson, who has
lived on a 240-acre farm at the edge of the city for more than 30
years. "We'd all like to have a nice restaurant, and have a glass of
wine with dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Townsfolk say there's a certain cachet, a self-conscious embrace
of idiosyncrasy, that comes with being able to say you live in a dry
town in the middle of a place known both for its wine grapes and its
hops, a key ingredient in beer.</TE>
<TE>   But what was once a novelty became an inconvenience to longtime
residents like Lew Pinnock, a retired Western Oregon University
biology professor, who voted against alcohol sales during the last
referendum in 1976 but switched sides this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided that it was ridiculous, for the feeling of being
special, to jeopardize the town's welfare," said Pinnock. "We don't
need a dry law to make us special."</TE>
<TE>   The turning point for many longtime residents came two years ago,
when the Market Place, Monmouth's last grocery store, went out of
business in part to competition from stores in the adjoining city of
Independence, which allows alcohol sales. It's one thing to leave
town to buy beer; it's another to have to leave to buy toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody shops in town for hardly anything," said Nelson, whose
husband is a former mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The store's closing led John Oberst, a stay-at-home dad and former
high school biology teacher, to launch a grass-roots campaign to end
what he and other local boosters saw as a hurdle to reviving a
downtown of low buildings, many of them vacant.</TE>
<TE>   "I really did feel the Market Place closing was the last straw for
me," said Oberst, a native Kentuckian. "We were killing our
commercial base.... I saw Monmouth in a downward spiral."</TE>
<TE>   Monmouth was founded in the early 1850s by members of the
Christian Church of Monmouth, Ill., who followed the Oregon Trail in
search of a place to open Monmouth University, a Christian college.
In 1858, confronted with a merchant selling "spiritous and vinous
liquors," the town fathers persuaded the Oregon Territorial
Legislature to grant Monmouth a charter allowing it to regulate
business -- and ban alcohol sales.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Monmouth's biggest employer and dominant institution
is the 5,000-student Western Oregon University, a public school
descended from the original college. And while the city counts more
than a dozen churches, it has no industry, declining property values
and few places for the hungry to find a good meal.</TE>
<TE>   Housing values reflect the economic torpor. The average sales
price of a single-family home in August was $138,000, down about
$4,000 from the same time in the prior year.</TE>
<TE>   The November election -- 58% voted to go wet -- was the sixth time
the issue has gone to a public vote. The last repeal effort, in 1976,
was defeated by more than 75% of voters. Things have changed since
then, said local historian Kyle Jansson. Growth has made Monmouth a
bedroom community for workers in Salem and Corvallis, both larger
cities with higher housing costs about half an hour's drive away.
"That added outside viewpoints to the debate," Jansson said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the last members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union
moved away in the late '80s, leaving the philosophical descendants of
Carrie Nation without a flag bearer.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, pedestrians in the four-block business
district were outnumbered by a small work crew replacing sidewalks.
Occasionally, cars crept along East Main Street, the downtown strip.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not a lot of places for students to hang out," said
Miranda Wagner, 21, a junior social sciences major who is hoping the
town will now get some night life. "It would be so much easier to
walk to a bar than to drive to Independence."</TE>
<TE>   Predictably enough, many Western Oregon students aligned behind
the repeal, although some voted against it, saying they didn't think
lifting the ban would do much for the town.</TE>
<TE>   They joined teetotaling traditionalists who, alarmed by visions of
bar fights and drunks urinating in public, saw no need for change.</TE>
<TE>   "The town was very nice the way it was," said Don Dutcher, 66, who
retired with his wife, Patty, from Portland to Monmouth two years ago
to escape urban sprawl. "The people that wanted it [wet] stated that
the town needed to grow, that the town needed a shot in the arm.
That's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   For Dutcher and others opposed to ending the ban, the argument
that alcohol sales would spark a renaissance was a red herring.</TE>
<TE>   Monmouth, they argued, isn't the kind of town in which the sale of
alcohol will make or break a business.</TE>
<TE>   But Oberst and others point to the opening in recent years of two
food stores in Independence -- both selling beer and wine, one near
the city line -- as evidence that the alcohol ban was hurting
Monmouth's ability to draw new business.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some who voted to end the ban are dubious about the
benefits, although they say they'll be happy when they can buy a
drink in town.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think what they're going to do is going to change the
flavor much," said Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   At least one student also figures the odds are against
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were doing pretty good," said Jennifer Myers, 20, a
business major who voted against the measure. "Now people will get
drunk and be stupid."</TE>

<HD>Nebraska Committee Rejects Lethal Injection Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>The Nebraska Legislature's Judiciary Committee rejected a bill
Tuesday that would have changed the state's method of execution from
the electric chair to death by injection.</LD>
<LD>   Nebraska is the only state with the chair as its sole means of
execution, which some fear could lead a court to rule the state's
death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.</LD>
<LD>   But Sen. Kermit Brashear, the panel's chairman, said there is no
immediate need to end Nebraska's use of the electric chair. The bill
was rejected, 5 to 2.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers are meeting in a special session to deal with
constitutional questions in the state's death-penalty laws, after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that said juries, not judges, must
decide whether a murder merits the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In Nebraska, judges have made that determination since the
Legislature decided in the 1970s that there was the potential of bias
by juries.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama had been the only other state using the electric chair
exclusively.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Donald Siegelman signed a bill earlier this year making
lethal injection the primary method of execution there, unless the
inmate requests the electric chair.</TE>

<HD>Cabinet Agency for Homeland Security Wins Senate OK</HD>
<DH>The 90-9 vote for a huge anti-terror department follows
approval by the House. It marks the largest government overhaul in 50
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate overwhelmingly approved the most sweeping government
shakeup in half a century Tuesday, passing a bill that will create a
new Cabinet department responsible for reducing the nation's
vulnerability to terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate vote, 90 to 9, followed House passage last week of a
virtually identical measure to forge a Department of Homeland
Security out of about two dozen government agencies.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, one government agency will be responsible for
coordinating protection of the nation's borders, coastlines,
airports, landmarks, utilities and other major facilities, both
public and private. The new agency, expected to have more than
170,000 employees, will also help lead the nation's defense against
potential chemical, biological or nuclear attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Bush pushed hard for the bill after the Republican triumph in this
month's midterm elections, and Tuesday's action handed him a major
victory as the 107th Congress drew to a close with key Senate votes
approving terrorism insurance and stopgap spending legislation, and a
new federal appellate judge.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will sign the homeland security bill as soon as lawmakers
iron out minor differences between the Senate and House versions and
send it to him.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's enactment will set in motion the most extensive
reorganization of the executive branch since the creation of the
modern Defense Department and intelligence agencies in the late
1940s.</TE>
<TE>   That change was a major legacy of World War II and the Cold War.
The new homeland security agency is part of Washington's response to
last year's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone call from Air Force One while flying to Prague for
a NATO summit, Bush congratulated jubilant GOP leaders as the bill
neared passage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making great progress in the war on terror," Bush said via
speakerphone. "Part of that progress will be the ability for us to
protect the American people at home. This is a very important piece
of legislation."</TE>
<TE>   After the bill's passage, the Senate moved toward conclusion of
the lame-duck congressional session that began last week. It
confirmed a conservative nominated by Bush for the federal appellate
court, Dennis W. Shedd, and gave final congressional approval to a
bill making the government the insurer of last resort for terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, the Senate approved a stopgap budget bill for a raft
of government agencies, leaving decisions on increased spending
proposals for the new Congress. That finished the Senate's business
for the year; the House completed its work last week.</TE>
<TE>   The 108th Congress will convene Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   In launching the new security agency, the Bush administration will
face fresh challenges: appointing and winning confirmation of the
department's leading officials and finding enough money to make the
department work.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor who serves as White
House director of homeland security, is the leading candidate to head
the new Cabinet department.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the agency, projected to have an annual budget of more
than $38 billion, is a major question. Congress failed this year to
approve billions of dollars that Bush and lawmakers from both parties
had sought to bolster security programs that will be coordinated by
the new agency. Leading Republicans say they will act on the funding
proposals as soon as the new Congress convenes.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), one of the first lawmakers to
propose a homeland security agency that would merge various
functions, said the new department would help bring coherence to a
scattershot federal anti-terrorism effort -- one often criticized for
failing to connect crucial pieces of intelligence and then act on
them.</TE>
<TE>   "The dots are going to be on one board at this department, and
that's going to help our government see the terrorist threats before
they attack, and therefore, to stop them," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill will take effect 60 days after Bush signs it. And when
the 15th Cabinet department opens for business, the new secretary of
Homeland Security will oversee employees drawn from about two dozen
agencies now spread throughout the federal government. Only the
Defense and Veterans Affairs departments will have more personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Operating under the new department's umbrella will be the
Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the U.S.
Customs Service -- agencies responsible for securing airports,
coastal waters and incoming cargo, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The beleaguered Immigration and Naturalization Service will be
officially abolished and its functions split into two bureaus within
the new department, one to guard borders and the other to serve
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Other department components include the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, responsible for disaster relief, and the Secret
Service, in charge of guarding the president and spearheading
security measures at major national events.</TE>
<TE>   The department will be organized into four major divisions: border
and transportation security; emergency preparedness and response;
science and technology; information analysis and infrastructure
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Notably absent from the department's jurisdiction were two
agencies that have been criticized for intelligence and
law-enforcement breakdowns that preceded the Sept. 11 terrorist
strikes: the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers critical of the CIA and FBI may target them for overhaul
in the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) cautioned that the new department may
not be able to work miracles from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult and it's going to take longer than
everybody thinks -- because it's a part of the federal government,"
Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Others promised that the agency would get close congressional
oversight, signaling that lawmakers are far from done with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge undertaking. We all know this hasn't been done for
50 years," Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said. "We're
going to bring together 170,000 people and try to make this thing out
of whole cloth? It's going to be a tremendous challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) fought the bill from the beginning
and opposed it to the end. "The nation will have this unfortunate
creature, this behemoth, this bureaucratic bag of tricks," he said.
"And it will hulk across the landscape of this city, touting its new
mission and eagerly gobbling up tax dollars for all manner of things,
many of which have nothing to do with saving the lives of American
people."</TE>
<TE>   Voting for the bill were 48 Republicans, 41 Democrats -- including
Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California -- and
independent Sen. Dean Barkley of Minnesota. Opposing it were eight
Democrats and independent Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont. Sen.
Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) did not vote.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came after the Senate narrowly rejected a Democratic
amendment to strip several special-interest provisions from the
legislation, a proposal Republicans said could have derailed the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, the bill's final passage culminated a lengthy and at
times clamorous debate that began shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bush's first acts following the attacks was to name Ridge
to coordinate federal anti-terrorism efforts from within the White
House. But Democrats, led by Lieberman, clamored for more. They
wanted a new Cabinet officer with budget authority and power to give
orders to far-flung security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush initially resisted. But in a nationally televised address
June 6, he shifted course. He embraced the idea of a new department
and unveiled a massive reorganization plan that had been a closely
kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation that emerged from Congress more than five months
later largely followed Bush's blueprint -- though at 484 pages, it
was much longer than his original 52-page bill.</TE>
<TE>   In the House debate, Bush rolled over most opposition to the
merger from senior Republicans who sought to protect bureaucratic
turf. He wanted the Coast Guard in the new department. Some lawmakers
wanted it out. He won.</TE>
<TE>   Bush wanted agriculture inspectors in the department to help
defend against bioterrorism. Some lawmakers wanted them out. He got
most of what he wanted -- the inspectors at border points, seaports
and airports.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, leading Democrats fiercely objected to language
Bush sought to revise normal government personnel rules, giving him
more leeway to hire, fire, demote and promote within the department.
Democrats proposed to restrict Bush's power to waive collective
bargaining rights for more than 40,000 employees within the
department now represented by unions.</TE>
<TE>   The clash over workers' rights remained unresolved when Congress
recessed a few weeks before the Nov. 5 election. Bush campaigned
across the country for GOP candidates who would back him in the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   When elections yielded GOP victory, Bush pressed for the bill to
be finished on his terms during the lame-duck session. Ultimately,
Democrats were forced to accept a version that gave Bush most of the
personnel powers he wanted. As a result, the new department will
become a laboratory for civil service reform.</TE>

<HD>Hormone, Vitamin Therapies Doubted Anew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Hormone supplements and antioxidant vitamins showed no heart benefits
in older women who already had heart disease, according to yet
another study that casts doubt on some long-held assumptions about
both treatments.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, heart disease also appeared to progress more quickly in
women who took hormones, high doses of vitamins E and C, or both, for
nearly three years than in those on dummy pills.</LD>
<LD>   The finding was not statistically significant, but the researchers
said the trend was worrisome.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a little bit surprising that the outcomes for both
treatments were so bad. When the study was designed in the early
1990s, both of these treatments were thought to be highly promising,"
said study author Dr. David Waters, chief of cardiology at San
Francisco General Hospital and a professor at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Hormone supplements once were thought to benefit the heart because
naturally occurring estrogen helps keep cholesterol at healthy
levels. But a landmark study announced last summer found that the
pills may actually increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Antioxidant vitamins have been touted as disease-fighters and also
promoted as helping keep the heart healthy, theoretically by blocking
the effects of cell-damaging oxygen molecules.</TE>
<TE>   But more recent studies have questioned the heart benefits and
suggested the vitamins might interfere with cholesterol-lowering
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The new study appears in today's Journal of the American Medical
Assn. The study involved 423 post-menopausal heart patients who were
put on one of four treatments for nearly three years: hormones;
vitamins E and C; hormones and the two vitamins; or placebo pills.</TE>
<TE>   Two women on placebos died, compared with four in the hormone
group, six in the vitamin group and 10 in the vitamin-hormone group.</TE>
<TE>   The findings support recommendations from the American Heart
Assn., which says taking hormone supplements or antioxidant vitamins
to benefit the heart is unwarranted, said Dr. Robert Bonow, AHA
president.</TE>

<HD>Terror Insurance Bill Backed by Bush Is Passed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A bill to make the federal government the insurer of last resort for
future terrorist attacks, touted by President Bush as critical to the
nation's economic security, cleared the Senate by a wide margin and
was sent to the White House on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrorism insurance will help get America's hard hats back on the
job, create new jobs for America's workers, and spur billions in new
investment in construction projects all across the country," Bush
said in a statement after the legislation was passed. "This bill
comes at a critical time, as commercial construction is at a six-year
low."</LD>
<LD>   The 86-11 vote came as the Senate headed toward adjournment of its
lame-duck session, passing another one of Bush's priorities in the
war on terrorism, a bill creating a Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<TE>   "We have dealt with ... the physical security of our country since
9/11," said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), one of the bill's
sponsors. "But no security is ever final unless you've also dealt
with economic security."</TE>
<TE>   The bill had been stalled for months because of a dispute over
Republican efforts to limit damages in terrorism-related lawsuits.
But Bush broke the deadlock, persuading the GOP-controlled House last
week to pass the bill, saying it was too important to the economy to
delay any longer.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get this done because the president wants to get it
done," a Senate GOP leadership aide said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein, voted for the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation creates a three-year, $100-billion program, under
which the government will cover 90% of terrorism-related losses after
insurance companies pay an initial amount. Insurers will be
responsible for the remaining 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The industry will be required to repay the government -- through a
surcharge on commercial policyholders -- for payments up to $10
billion in the first year, $12.5 billion in the second year and $15
billion in the third year.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation is the second major package to aid an industry
from the economic fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks. The other was a
$15-billion package for the airline industry. Insurance industry
officials say the insurance measure is not a bailout because
government funds will go to policy-holders.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) called the bill a "backstop," not a
bailout, for catastrophic losses resulting from acts of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is about the economy," he said. "It's not about
insurance.... Fundamentally, it is a jobs bill."</TE>
<TE>   "It's grease on the economic wheel," said Kurt Pfotenhauer, senior
vice president of government affairs for the Mortgage Bankers Assn.
"Our members were telling us that [the lack or high cost of terrorism
insurance] was a real factor in their day-to-day transactions, and
this will be a big help."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer and taxpayer groups questioned whether the bill was
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "More than a year after Sept. 11, a private market for terror
insurance is developing and this kind of broad taxpayer assistance is
no longer necessary," said Travis Plunkett, legislative director for
the Consumer Federation of America. "Congress is roaring up to the
scene of the accident with a lot of money while the patient has
gotten up and limped away."</TE>
<TE>   The industry expects to be able to cover the estimated $40 billion
to $50 billion in claims arising from last year's attacks, and this
legislation does not cover them. Industry officials have said that
without government assistance, they cannot insure against the
incalculable liability from future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A wide range of business interests, from builders and mortgage
bankers to hotels and sports teams, lobbied for the legislation,
contending that the unavailability or the high cost of terrorism
insurance has stalled more than $15 billion in projects.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters were unable to provide a list of such projects. "No
one really wants to call attention to problems they're having in
obtaining terrorism insurance," said a spokeswoman for the Real
Estate Roundtable, a Washington-based policy group.</TE>
<TE>   Still, businesses say they are paying more for insurance coverage,
but getting less.</TE>
<TE>   In Port Elizabeth, N.J., the privately run Maher Terminals Inc. is
paying about $1 million for property insurance -- about double what
it paid a year ago -- that provides only one-fourth the terrorism
coverage the container terminal operator needs, said Sam Crane,
Maher's vice president of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company has proceeded with plans to build new
terminals. "We've continued ahead because we assumed that at some
point there would be action by Congress," he said, "and that a market
would be created that would make it affordable and available."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans were upset that the bill did not bar individuals
injured in an attack from suing businesses for punitive damages. Bush
has pledged to make reform of the legal system a priority when
Republicans take control of both houses of Congress in January.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats argued that the threat of punitive damages was necessary
to force businesses to take reasonable steps to ensure security.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd said he hopes the measure is never needed. "But it's a
critically important safety net in place if the threat arises," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us can say with any certainty whether this structure we
created will do the job," Dodd added.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never done this before. But we're relying on expert people
who have told us this will be enough for the market to begin to take
over and price a product so people can afford it."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Long-Delayed Appeals Court Nomination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A divided Senate on Tuesday approved 55 to 44 President Bush's
long-delayed appellate court nomination of U.S. District Judge Dennis
W. Shedd, a protege of retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.).</LD>
<LD>   Shedd's appointment was bitterly opposed by civil rights and
women's groups, who accused the 49-year-old South Carolina judge of
siding mainly with employers in discrimination suits.</LD>
<LD>   But Shedd's supporters accused the judge's critics of ignoring the
message from the election earlier this month that will give
Republicans control of both houses of Congress in January.</LD>
<TE>   "The election showed that Americans trust this president,
including in his selection of judicial nominees," said Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch (R-Utah), who will become chairman of the Judiciary Committee
when the 108th Congress convenes.</TE>
<TE>   In support of Shedd's nomination, Thurmond -- who turns 100 on
Dec. 5 and came to the Senate in 1954 -- delivered his last speech on
the Senate floor, saying that the judge would "uphold the rights of
all people." He received a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   While campaigning for GOP candidates this fall, Bush assailed the
Democratic-led Senate for blocking qualified judicial nominees for
political reasons, creating what he called a vacancy crisis on the
federal bench. Democrats, in turn, have accused Bush of attempting to
pack the bench with conservative ideologues.</TE>
<TE>   Of 862 federal judgeships, 60 are vacant, according to the Justice
Department. Shedd was among several of Bush's judicial choices who
have been waiting for a Senate vote since they were nominated on May
9, 2001. However, that is still less than the nearly four years that
Judge Richard A. Paez of Los Angeles, a nominee of President Clinton
to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, waited before he won
confirmation two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say they have confirmed 100 judicial nominees since
taking over the Senate. But Republicans say Bush's choices have
encountered more resistance than those in previous administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Shedd, a former aide to Thurmond and a former chief
counsel to the Judiciary Committee, won approval because Democrats
are picking their battles more carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "This would not appear to be the appointment with which to draw
some line in the sand and make a fight," said Elliot Slotnick, a
political science professor at Ohio State University. "Those fights
might come -- certainly over some prospective Supreme Court nominees
should a vacancy arise."</TE>
<TE>   Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist,
said Bush was taking advantage of the stronger mandate he received
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shedd confirmation is just the beginning of a flood of Bush
court appointees we're likely to see once the Republicans formally
retake control of the Senate in January," he said. "Democrats will
filibuster a few, but their options are limited by political reality.
They will have to pick and choose their filibusters carefully to
avoid the image of obstructionism, which means most Bush judges will
get to the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Federal district and appellate court judges have lifetime terms.</TE>
<TE>   Battles are expected next year if the Senate moves ahead with
plans to revive Bush's nominations of U.S. District Judge Charles W.
Pickering of Mississippi and Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla
Owen, both nominated for the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals. Both were rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee as
being too conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Thurmond delivered a rare tongue-lashing on the Senate
floor at Democrats for delaying a vote on his former aide.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Democrats joined 48 Republicans in supporting Shedd's
elevation to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers
South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was South Carolina's other senator, Democrat Ernest F.
Hollings, who in June called Shedd "my kind of judge -- hard and
tough, but hard and tough on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Both California senators, Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein, voted against the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, pointed to a 2-foot-high stack of letters from individuals
and groups expressing concern about Shedd.</TE>
<TE>   "His record as a whole raises serious concerns about whether he
should be elevated to a court that is only one step below the U.S.
Supreme Court," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hatch accused Shedd's detractors of distorting the judge's
record.</TE>
<TE>   "The well-paid left-wing lobbyists who have turned attacking
President Bush's judicial nominees into a small cottage industry see
only what they want to see and not what the truth would show them,"
Hatch said.</TE>

<HD>Congress OKs Auto Safety Rules for Older Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The family car will be safer for preschoolers and older children
under legislation approved by Congress and expected to be signed by
President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Named "Anton's Law" after a 4-year-old killed in 1996 when an
adult seat belt failed to hold him in a crash, the bill would set
federal auto safety standards for children weighing more than 50
pounds, require carmakers to install shoulder belts in rear center
seats and promote research on how best to protect older kids.</LD>
<LD>   In auto-safety parlance, children ages 4 to 8 are known as
"forgotten children" because they are too old for conventional child
seats, yet their bodies are not big enough to be effectively
protected by adult seat belts. The legislation, passed late Monday,
aims to close that loophole.</LD>
<TE>   "These children are in danger without some extra kind of
protection after they leave that child seat and go on to the adult
seat belt," said Autumn Skeen, Anton's mother. "This bill is saying,
'Look, this is a really important aspect of public health.' " Skeen,
a writer from Walla Walla, Wash., became a safety advocate after her
son's death.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and safety experts strongly recommend that parents use
booster seats for 4- to 8-year-olds who have outgrown conventional
child seats.</TE>
<TE>   Most booster seats are essentially pads that let children sit
higher in a car so adult lap and shoulder belts do not cut across
their stomachs and necks. Emergency-room doctors have documented a
pattern of abdominal and neck injuries in children as a result of
using adult belts. In severe crashes, lap belts have been shown to
cause serious injury to the liver, spleen, intestines and even the
spinal cord.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recognized risks, only 13 states require older
children to ride in booster seats. In California, the requirement
applies only to children ages 4 to 6.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), the main sponsor of the bill, said
he hopes it will save lives by upgrading standards, expanding
booster-seat testing and placing new safety rules on automakers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main provisions of Fitzgerald's bill would require
automakers to install a combination lap and shoulder belt in the rear
center seat of all new vehicles, beginning in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The middle of the back seat is statistically the safest place for
a child to ride, but most vehicles have only a lap belt there. A
booster seat cannot be used effectively without a shoulder belt.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration have had the authority to require automakers to
install full lap and shoulder belts in the middle seat, but they had
been reluctant to act without a congressional mandate.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also would direct the agency to establish new
auto-safety standards for booster seats for children weighing more
than 50 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also would have to design and build a crash dummy
representing an 80-pound, 10-year-old child, and incorporate it into
vehicle safety testing. The U.S. has lagged behind European countries
in child-safety testing of autos.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would authorize $5 million for research into whether
child seats that are built into a vehicle would prevent more injuries
than the seats that parents now have to install.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 2,588 children ages 15 and under were killed in car
accidents. That was the lowest on record, reflecting increased
awareness and prevention. Nonetheless, car accidents remain the
leading cause of death in childhood.</TE>

<HD>Mystery Surrounds an Apparent Suicide of Engineer</HD>
<DH>Man falls out of an airplane after he had been questioned
about a stolen NASA computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>He was an aerospace engineer, one of the hundreds who work in gray
anonymity at the Johnson Space Center south of this city. But after
federal authorities questioned him last Thursday about a stolen
government computer, 47-year-old Russell Edward Filler made a
dramatic exit.</LD>
<LD>   The recreational pilot apparently jumped to his death from the
Cessna 152 he was co-piloting Sunday as his flight instructor
momentarily looked away. Filler's body was found late Tuesday
afternoon by sheriff's deputies searching the rice fields and
pastures of rural Waller County northwest of here.</LD>
<LD>   "He was being treated for depression, and I think the legal
problems with the stolen computer just added to it," Waller County
Sheriff Randy Smith said. "I think the flight on Sunday was just a
pretext for him to commit suicide."</LD>
<TE>   Filler had worked for six years at United Space Alliance, a space
station contractor with offices in the NASA complex. The computer --
a Dell laptop -- disappeared after an Oct. 25 meeting in a space
center conference room, Harris County Sheriff's Capt. Robert Van Pelt
said. Police traced the laptop to Filler's home this month after he
used it to go online, tripping a device that sent his phone number to
a government tracking center.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with investigators from the Harris County sheriff's office,
the U.S. inspector general's office and Johnson Space Center
security, Filler said that he had spotted an ad for the computer on a
bulletin board at a neighborhood Kroger's grocery store. After paying
the seller $500 in an anonymous parking lot exchange, Filler said, he
took the laptop home and turned it on. It was then that he realized
it contained government software.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he knew it was stolen when he bought it, but he never
reported it," Van Pelt said. "He kept it in his possession."</TE>
<TE>   Filler, who was single, needed more flight hours to renew his
pilot's license, Smith said. On Sunday, he drove 75 miles to a small
airport in Hempstead, Texas, where he climbed into the Cessna with a
flight instructor. Forty-five minutes later, the plane was cruising
at 9,000 feet. "The flight instructor heard a noise, and the man had
opened the door and out he went," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Filler's mother, who answered the phone Tuesday at his suburban
Houston home, said she had traveled to Texas from Ft. Wayne, Ind.,
after receiving a distraught call from her son last week. "He was
real depressed," said the woman, who would not give her name or talk
about the cause of her son's distress. "And now this. It's so awful.
No one can believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wonderful son," she added. "He was very outgoing and had
friends all over the world because he traveled with his job."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Curie, a spokesman for United Space Alliance, said that
Filler had worked for several Johnson Space Center contractors since
1981. His current job included testing hardware before it was
installed on the space station, Curie said. Filler's death is "a
shock," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Van Pelt said that there was "nothing of a sensitive nature on the
computer." If no NASA secrets were stored on the computer,
investigators are left to ponder why a possible theft charge would
cause Filler to take his life. "It's all speculation right now," Van
Pelt said. "I don't know what was in this man's mind."</TE>

<HD>After Many Months of Labor, the Birth of an Agency</HD>
<DH>Away from the spotlight, the Homeland Security Department
takes shape. Much progress has been made, but there is still a way to
go.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On the eighth and 10th floors of a nondescript office building two
blocks from the White House, hidden from tourist and terrorist alike,
the Homeland Security Department is taking shape memo by memo and
step by carefully managed step.</LD>
<LD>   It has no secretary. It has no staff. In fact, Congress hasn't
quite finished the legislation authorizing it to exist.</LD>
<LD>   No matter. Here at the tightly guarded headquarters of the
homeland security transition planning office, mid-level officials
have labored for five months to fashion a single, effective
department from 22 agencies now scattered across the bureaucratic
landscape.</LD>
<TE>   The transition office is wallowing in administrative details:
Should its 170,000 employees use the Microsoft Outlook e-mail program
or Lotus Notes? At the same time, it is pondering the deepest and
most intractable questions: Given limited resources, which potential
terrorist targets should the government protect -- and which should
it not?</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the budding homeland security apparatus -- the White
House office headed by former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and a 24/7
operations center -- has had little direct involvement with the
formulation or implementation of anti-terrorism policies. Those jobs
have fallen to existing government agencies and the new
Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   But from the moment President Bush reversed his long-standing
opposition to a single anti-terrorism agency and instead proposed the
largest government reshuffle since the Truman administration, working
groups made up of officials from all the affected agencies have been
laying the administrative foundation on which the massive new
department will stand.</TE>
<TE>   That the administration gave itself such a long head start on the
process -- dictating procurement policy to some agencies, for
example, even as Congress was debating the very shape and rules of
the new department -- reflects both a political commitment to making
the agency work and a realistic acknowledgment of just how difficult
that will be.</TE>
<TE>   "They have their eyes wide open on the administrative burdens they
face," said Paul C. Light, a government scholar and vice president at
the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government is not a monolith," he said, and the
process of trying to merge incompatible personnel, financial and
computer networks from different agencies shows that "this is not a
plug-and-play system."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a massive reorganization," said Gordon Johndroe, spokesman
for Ridge's White House Office of Homeland Security. "It's going to
take some time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while a report released last month by a blue-ribbon task
force applauded efforts to create the department, it warned that the
nation "will not see the full effect of these fundamental changes for
several years." For now, the report concluded, "America remains
dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic
attack on U.S. soil."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials respond that they have already
overseen significant security improvements. They cite the
federalization of airport security workers, a dramatic increase in
the government's supply of vaccines and other drugs needed for
treatment of smallpox and other bioterrorism agents, systematic
searches of shipping containers at U.S. and some foreign ports, and
the expenditure of more than $31 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, they say, the new agency will overcome the
government intelligence and security failures that made it possible
for 19 hijackers to commandeer four airliners on Sept. 11, 2001,
killing about 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The new department's information analysis unit will process
intelligence information from the FBI, CIA and other security
agencies. It will "connect the dots, assess the threats and then
decide how to take action on them," Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   The critical departure from how the government has operated,
Johndroe said, is the action piece. "This will be the first time the
federal government has had a department to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Outside observers agree that, while the department faces enormous
administrative, cultural and technological challenges, a lot has been
done to get it up and running.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the all-important task of figuring out how to convert
intelligence information into action that will protect America from
attack, "there is a great deal of momentum," said Phil Anderson, a
senior fellow at the private Center for Strategic and International
Studies who is familiar with some of the planning. "That's very
reassuring."</TE>
<TE>   As early as July, the Office of Management and Budget began
directing the heads of the agencies that would move to the proposed
department to stop all major spending on information technology and
management systems until the needs of the new department could be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the Congress has not approved the new department," OMB
Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. said in a July 19 memo, "these steps
are critical to advance the federal government's overall homeland
security mission in an efficient and cost-effective manner."</TE>
<TE>   Transition staffers have been working hard to link the computer
systems of the component agencies so that they can communicate with
one another. Based on calls he has received soliciting his advice,
Michael Scardaville, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, believes the transition office has almost completed this
task.</TE>
<TE>   Transition staffers have also been considering where to house the
new department. "Don't expect a massive, Pentagon-style building,"
Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, whose work gets to the heart of the new department's
mission, said it could offer the nation a new, more sophisticated
level of "threat vulnerability integration" -- a method allocating
defensive resources based on assessments of terrorist threats and
security weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Three administration officials -- Adm. James M. Loy, director of
the Transportation Security Administration; Jerome M. Hauer, director
of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Health and Human
Services Department; and Winston P. Wiley, a deputy director of the
CIA -- participated last month in "Silent Vector," a privately funded
emergency simulation exercise conducted by Anderson and others.</TE>
<TE>   The officials were given mock intelligence information indicating
that within two days, terrorist teams would attack energy facilities
on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson would not say how the officials chose which of about
1,000 targets to protect, or how successful their efforts were. But
he said his experience with the exercise and his knowledge of the
transition operation assured him that homeland security officials
"are doing what citizens should want them to do."</TE>
<TE>   Light cautions that it is the not-so-sensational task of creating
a workforce unified behind a core mission that poses the greatest
challenge for the department.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no technology I know on Earth that's going to make an
immigration agent want to work with a customs inspector," he said.
"It is going to take a secretary with a lot of grace and ability. If
Moses were available, I'd appoint him."</TE>
<TE>   In Moses' absence, the president is looking closely at Ridge,
director of his Office of Homeland Security.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two of the University of Virginia's oldest fraternities have been
suspended by their national organizations while under investigation
for a Halloween party at which a few guests were photographed wearing
blackface.</LD>
<LD>   Photos from the party, hosted Oct. 31 by Zeta Psi and Kappa Alpha,
circulated on the Internet for several weeks before they came to the
attention of campus and fraternity officials Monday. University
sources who saw the photos said they showed three costumed students
with their faces painted black or brown. One man was dressed as Uncle
Sam; two other men were dressed as tennis champions Venus and Serena
Williams.</LD>
<LD>   National fraternal leaders stepped in to investigate, and they
joined Virginia students and university officials in denouncing the
costumes.</LD>
<TE>   The fraternity investigations, first reported Tuesday in the
Cavalier Daily student newspaper, are the latest in blackface
incidents at college fraternities nationally.</TE>
<TE>   In one, two fraternity houses at Auburn University in Alabama were
suspended after members attended parties in blackface and Afro wigs
and Ku Klux Klan robes.</TE>

<HD>100-Plus N.Y. Airport Workers Arrested</HD>
<DH>Accusations involve lying while applying for security jobs,
but no evidence of terror links.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>More than 100 New York airport workers with access to secure areas
were arrested Tuesday and accused of faking documents to obtain jobs
and lying about criminal records, in what officials said was one of
the largest security sweeps at U.S. airports.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials said at a news conference that up to 118
employees at John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports
lied while applying for security positions, but there was no evidence
of larger crimes.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no evidence to date that these individuals have
connections to terrorist organizations or intended to engage in any
acts of terrorism," Roslynn Mauskopf, U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District of New York, told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   "But these individuals represent a significant vulnerability to
the security of our air transportation system," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were made a day after the federal government said it
had completed staffing U.S. airports with 44,000 passenger screeners,
part of new security measures prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the FBI, police from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey and other agencies carried out the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The employees had access to aircraft parking and maintenance
areas, the tarmac and ramp, cargo storage facilities and passenger
and baggage screening areas.</TE>
<TE>   Some workers failed to disclose convictions for armed robbery,
assault, larceny, burglary, weapon and drug charges or allegedly used
bogus immigration documents and Social Security numbers, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities said one man used the Social Security number of a
woman born 20 years ago in Puerto Rico, and another worker used an
8-year-old's Social Security number.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's arrests represent a culmination of a nine-month
investigation by federal, state and local agencies into the
backgrounds of 40,000 individuals who work at [the airports] and have
access to restricted, high-security areas," Queens District Atty.
Richard Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty for misuse of a Social Security number or
lying on a security employee application is five years' imprisonment
and a fine of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, authorities announced the arrest of about 20 cleaners
and security personnel at Newark Liberty International Airport on
similar charges.</TE>

<HD>For-Profit Dialysis Sites a Risk to Patients, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Facilities' status may be cause of 2,500 deaths each year,
according to scientists. Some experts discount findings, saying study
used old data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Private for-profit kidney dialysis centers may provide worse care for
patients than private centers that are not-for-profit, resulting in
about 2,500 premature deaths in this country every year, scientists
report today in a new analysis of patient data.</LD>
<LD>   A likely cause, according to the authors, is the need by
for-profit centers to pay taxes and make money, which could lead
companies to reduce staff, employ less-qualified workers and cut the
time a patient spends in dialysis.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.,
pooled data from eight previously published studies and found 8% more
deaths each year with for-profit institutions than with
not-for-profit private institutions.</LD>
<TE>   About 75% of people requiring dialysis for kidney failure in the
United States receive their care at for-profit dialysis centers. "The
study suggests that one should seriously rethink whether for-profit
health care should be delivered or allowed," said Dr. Holger J.
Schunemann, assistant professor of social and preventive medicine at
the University of Buffalo and a co-author on the study.</TE>
<TE>   However, several scientists commenting on the study expressed
doubts about its findings, in part because it was based on
information collected from 1973 to 1997 that could be outdated by
modern practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a stretch," commented Philip Held, adjunct professor
of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and
founder of the University Renal Research and Education Assn., a
kidney research foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if what they say is true -- and I'm not very convinced by
what they report -- it's history. It borders on ancient history."</TE>
<TE>   Several studies using more recent data have found no significant
difference between for-profit and not-for-profit dialysis centers,
Held said.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Thiry, chief executive of Torrance-based DaVita Inc., which
provides kidney dialysis to 44,000 patients in the United States,
said the study published today was "very frustrating, because there's
no new data, and a lot of the data being used has been discredited."</TE>
<TE>   The study, led by Dr. P.J. Devereaux of McMaster University in
Canada, selected eight research papers that had tracked more than
500,000 patients in the United States. The researchers selected only
private for-profit and not-for profit centers, omitting public
dialysis centers because they account for very few of the procedures
performed each year.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the studies reported increased mortality at for-profit
centers. The remaining two studies showed no significant differences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of scary: You always worry that your patients are not
being taken care of ... that someone's shaving the edges," said Dr.
Elaine Kamil, clinical director of pediatric nephrology at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and president of the medical board of the
National Kidney Foundation of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   However, she added that dialysis practices have markedly improved
in recent years. In 2000, the National Kidney Foundation created a
set of dialysis guidelines covering every aspect of patient care,
from how long to give someone dialysis to managing the anemia that
patients with kidney failure often experience.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, the guidelines have been uniformly adopted

<HD>Shaq Cleared for Friday</HD>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was cleared by Dr. Robert Mohr to return to the
Lakers on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls at Staples Center,
according to O'Neal's agent, Perry Rogers.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who had surgery on his big right toe Sept. 11, had
targeted Friday's game, pending clearance by Mohr, who performed the
procedure.</LD>
<LD>   According to Rogers, Mohr "feels great about" O'Neal's recovery,
despite the soreness that lingered on the underside of the toe well
into the rehabilitation. That has recently subsided, O'Neal said, as
Mohr predicted it would.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal, who will be examined by Mohr again Thursday after the trip
through Dallas and San Antonio, said he would not play before seeing
Mohr, who is expected to attend Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said Mohr had made some final adjustments to the orthotics
gear O'Neal wears, and that those devices should be ready in time for
Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Without him, the Lakers have lost eight of 11 games. .</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a savior," O'Neal insisted before Tuesday's game against
the Dallas Mavericks. "However, I think I can bring their spirits
back up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will retire a jersey with Chick Hearn's name on it in a
ceremony Sunday night. Jerry West and Hearn's widow, Marge, are
expected to attend.... Devean George (ankle) and Mark Madsen
(hamstring) made the trip, but did not dress. Madsen is on the
injured list.</TE>

Cleveland. The Spurs beat the Lakers, 87-82, on opening night at
Staples Center. Forward Tim Duncan, held to 14 points in that game,
is averaging 19.9 points and 9.6 rebounds. Guard Steve Smith, who had
a strained groin and sat out seven games, returned Monday night
against Cleveland. Center David Robinson is one of 11 NBA players to
have amassed 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.</TE>

<KH>WEST COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW</KH>
<HD>Title Hopes Come in Waves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Westphal got a taste of success last season in his debut as
men's basketball coach at Pepperdine, but he didn't walk away
satisfied.</LD>
<LD>   If anything, the surprising run that resulted in Pepperdine tying
nationally ranked Gonzaga for the West Coast Conference
regular-season title and earning a berth in the NCAA tournament only
whetted Westphal's appetite for more fulfilling accomplishments.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to take a step forward from what we did [last season],"
the former NBA player and coach said. "That means getting to the NCAA
tournament and winning some games."</LD>
<TE>   Yes, the expectations are high in Malibu. And for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves have one of their most talented and balanced teams, an
athletic group that runs and presses, dunks and hits three-point
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "They have unbelievably great talent," said Coach Steve Aggers of
WCC rival Loyola Marymount. "With their style of play, they're
capable of going out and [scoring] 120 on you any given night." True
to form, the Waves averaged 111 points in winning two exhibition
games.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal says he has seven players capable of starting, including
four from last season's 22-9 team that lost to Wake Forest, 83-74, in
the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Waves, who lost only to
Gonzaga on their way to a 13-1 conference record, have their top five
scorers back.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with all that, Pepperdine might not be the best team in the
conference. Gonzaga won two of three games against the Waves last
season, including a 96-90 victory in the conference tournament final,
and again poses a big challenge for any team hoping to end its streak
of four consecutive WCC tournament titles.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 22-ranked Bulldogs will be tough to knock off despite the
loss of WCC player of the year Dan Dickau, a sharp-shooting guard who
is with the Atlanta Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look for them to miss a beat," Aggers said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga will test Pepperdine's mettle in the middle with a
physical front line that features Zach Gourde and Cory Violette, a
pair of 6-foot-8, 250-pound all-conference forwards, rangy Ronny
Turiaf (6-9, 230) and transfer Richard Fox (6-11, 270).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a classic clash of styles," Westphal said. "Gonzaga has
added more big guys to possibly the best group of big guys in the
country, and we've added more athletic guys to an athletic team. It
will be our slashers against their beef."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine hopes to cut the Bulldogs down to size with a running,
pressing style. Senior all-conference forwards Jimmy Miggins and
Boomer Brazzle, sophomore guard Terrance Johnson and senior point
guard Devin Montgomery return.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-7 Miggins is the Waves' most consistent and competitive
player, traits that rub off on the rest of the team, Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to our team is Miggins," Westphal said. "He's a real
versatile guy with very few weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   Will Kimble, a 6-10 junior, takes over at center for 6-11 Cedric
Suitt. The Waves will miss Suitt's low-post defense and shot-blocking
ability, but Kimble is a better scorer and rebounder as well as a
capable defender.</TE>
<TE>   It is a testament to Pepperdine's depth that a player who declared
for the NBA draft before withdrawing his name last spring probably
will be a reserve. Glen McGowan, a 6-9 junior, is a valuable
contributor who can play forward or center. His availability early in
the season could be limited while he recovers from arthroscopic knee
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Another player who figures prominently in the Waves' plans is
swingman Alex Acker, a 6-5 sophomore who sat out last season as an
academic nonqualifier.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is we have to stay together," Westphal said. "We
have a lot of guys who can score. As long as the players remember to
play as a team and not go their own way, I feel the wins and losses
will take care of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's nonconference schedule includes home games against UC
Santa Barbara on Dec. 7, No. 11 Oregon on Dec. 14 and Utah on Dec.
20.</TE>
<TE>   Those tests should help Pepperdine prepare for a conference
schedule highlighted by two games with Gonzaga, and a possible third
meeting in the WCC tournament. Under the new tournament format, the
top two finishers in the regular season will have byes through the
first two rounds and need only one victory to reach the final.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now Gonzaga and Pepperdine are the lead dogs," Loyola's
Aggers said. "Everyone else is kind of looking at them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   TEAM CAPSULES</TE>
<TE>   GONZAGA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mark Few.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 29-4 overall, 13-1 in West Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: The Bulldogs' imposing front line is considered among
the best in the nation. All-conference forwards Zach Gourde and Cory
Violette combined to average 26 points and 15 rebounds last season.
Joining them is 6-foot-9 sophomore Ronny Turiaf, who's already
drawing interest from NBA teams. If that isn't enough of a low-post
presence, the Bulldogs have added 6-11 center Richard Fox, a transfer
from Colorado. Junior guard Blake Stepp, whose five three-point
baskets helped sink Pepperdine in the WCC tournament final, runs the
show.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: If the Bulldogs can get efficient guard play and avoid
costly turnovers when they run into Pepperdine's press, they can
retain their place at the top of the WCC. Gonzaga has won four
consecutive WCC tournament titles.</TE>
<TE>   LOYOLA MARYMOUNT</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Steve Aggers.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 9-20, 2-12.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Sophomore forward Andy Osborn, junior guard Kent
Dennis and junior forward Keith Kincade are returning starters. The
6-9 Osborn averaged 10 points as a freshman and has improved his
defense and rebounding. Sophomore Charles Brown is the team's most
experienced point guard. Junior forward Jason Dickens, a 6-8 transfer
from Davidson, is coming off surgery on both ankles.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With nine new players, including seven freshmen, Loyola
will experience growing pains. Aggers is hopeful the Lions mature
into a competitive unit by the time conference play starts in
January, but it's more likely the process will continue into next
season. "We lack game experience, so it's going to be two steps
forward and one step back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule: Friday: Loyola-Chicago, 7 p.m.; Nov. 25: Cal State
Sacramento, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 28: vs. Villanova in Great Alaska
Shootout, at Anchorage, 6:30 p.m.; Nov. 29-30: at Great Alaska

Pepperdine, 6 p.m.; Feb. 28: San Francisco, 7 p.m.; Mar. 1: St.
Mary's, 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   PEPPERDINE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Paul Westphal.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 22-9, 13-1.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: The Waves return their top five scorers, led by
senior forward Jimmy Miggins, who ranked first on the team in scoring
(14.9 points), rebounding (7.5) and steals (1.3) last season. Senior
point guard Devin Montgomery made 50.6% of his three-point shots and
teams in the backcourt with sophomore Terrance Johnson, last season's
WCC freshman of the year. Senior forward Boomer Brazzle and center
Will Kimble, a 6-10 junior, round out a formidable starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Westphal expects Pepperdine to improve on last season's
accomplishments. That would mean winning the conference tournament
for the first time since 1994 and posting an NCAA tournament victory
for the first time since 2000. With a deep and talented team, those
goals appear within reach if the Waves can avoid internal squabbles.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule: Friday: at Bradley; 5 p.m.; Nov. 30: UC Irvine, 7:30
p.m.; Dec. 2: at Long Beach State, 7 p.m.; Dec. 4: at Cal State

13: at San Diego, 7 p.m.; Feb. 16: at Santa Clara, 1 p.m.; Feb. 22:
Loyola Marymount, 6 p.m.; Feb. 28: St. Mary's, 7 p.m.; Mar. 1: San
Francisco, 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   PORTLAND</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Michael Holton.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 6-24, 2-12.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Junior guards Casey Frandsen and Adam Quick propel
the Pilots, who favored an up-tempo style in Holton's first season as
coach. Frandsen ranked second in the WCC in scoring with a 19.2
average and Quick averaged 5.7 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Holton, a former UCLA and NBA point guard, has his hands
full trying to turn around a program that has had only three winning
records in the last 20 seasons. He'll take his lumps -- a three-game
stretch against Oregon, Oregon State and UCLA, Dec. 4-14, could get
ugly.</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Brad Holland.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 16-13, 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Junior forward Jason Blair averaged 14.4 points and
6.8 rebounds last season. Nick Lewis, a 6-9 redshirt freshman, and
6-10 senior center Jason Keep, a transfer from Oklahoma State, are
expected to play key roles. Travis Smith, a freshman from Santa
Margarita High, has the early edge over sophomore Michael McGrain to
play point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Under the new WCC tournament format, teams that finish
third and fourth in the regular season get first-round byes. That
should be a goal for the Toreros, who have the advantage of playing
host to the tournament and are always dangerous at home.</TE>
<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Phil Mathews.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 13-15, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Forward Darrell Tucker, a 6-9, 245-pound senior,
could be the best player in the conference. A scoring threat, he
averaged 18.9 points and a WCC-best 10.1 rebounds last season. Two
other starters -- senior guard Shamell Stallworth and junior swing
player John Cox -- round out San Francisco's returning nucleus.
Former St. Mary's point guard Jovan Harris figures to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: San Francisco appears to have the best shot of crashing
an anticipated Gonzaga-Pepperdine party at the top of WCC standings.
The Dons have a solid starting five -- but questionable depth.</TE>
<TE>   SANTA CLARA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dick Davey.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 13-15, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: The Broncos are led by junior Kyle Bailey, who is
among the top point guards in the conference. The other returning
starter is sophomore forward Jordan Legge, who has been slowed by a
bulging disk.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Santa Clara ended last season with a surprising overtime
loss to St. Mary's in the first round of the WCC tournament. Look for
the Broncos, who haven't had a losing conference record under Davey
in eight seasons, to improve on that finish.</TE>
<TE>   ST. MARY'S</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Randy Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 9-20, 3-11.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Junior forward Chase Poole averaged 10.2 points and
5.6 rebounds last season. The Gaels will need the 6-8 Poole to play
at a high level because guard Paul Marigney, the team's leading
scorer, is expected to redshirt because he has not sufficiently
recovered from surgery for a torn knee ligament.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: In its first season under Bennett, a former Pepperdine
assistant, St. Mary's ended a 23-game losing streak -- the longest in
the nation at the time -- and won its first WCC tournament game since
1999.</TE>

<HD>Orosco Leaves Dodgers for Padre Guarantee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran reliever Jesse Orosco agreed to terms on a one-year, $800,000
contract with the San Diego Padres on Tuesday, bringing an end to his
brief Dodger career and shedding more light on the tight financial
constraints the Dodgers are working under this winter.</LD>
<LD>   Orosco, the 45-year-old left-hander who went 1-2 with a 3.00
earned-run average in 56 games this season, wanted to finish his
career in Los Angeles, and the Dodgers would have welcomed his
return.</LD>
<LD>   But the formerly free-spending Dodgers declined to offer a major
league contract--even for only $500,000 over the minimum salary--or a
roster spot. Orosco got both, as well as a no-trade clause, from San
Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Orosco, who came to Dodger camp on minor league contracts the last
two years, limited hitters to a .229 average in 2002. He has an 85-78
career record and 3.04 ERA in a major league-record 1,187 games over
22 seasons. He also has limited Barry Bonds to a .160 average (four
for 25).</TE>
<TE>   But he will be 46 in 2003, he had a few nagging injuries this
season, and those were concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "As close as we are to the [$117-million] luxury tax threshold, we
have to make every dollar count," General Manager Dan Evans said. "We
didn't feel this was worth the risk. We like the player, he was a
solid guy, but we think we can replace him."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have about $95 million committed to 12 players next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Among the free agents the Dodgers might consider to replace Orosco
are Mike Stanton, Mark Guthrie, Dan Plesac and Jeff Fassero, and
Evans said he has a lot of trade possibilities. Alan Meersand,
Orosco's agent, thinks the Dodgers could have saved time and money by
re-signing his client.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems peculiar the Dodgers are worried about money, because
what Jesse wanted was small in the big scheme of things," Meersand
said. "The difference between his contract and the major league
minimum [of $300,000] is only $500,000. That's like Donald Trump
worried about spending $4 or $3 on a sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added outfielder Robb Quinlan and pitchers Rich Fischer
and Bobby Jenks to the 40-man roster, protecting them from next
month's draft of minor league players.</TE>
<TE>   Quinlan, 25, the only one of the three with a chance to make the
major league club in spring training, was selected most valuable
player in the Pacific Coast League after hitting .333 with 20 home
runs and 112 runs batted in at triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>

<LD>It's all about LeBron.</LD>
<LD>   That's LeBron James. His games will be on pay-per-view cable in
parts of Ohio this season -- his high school basketball games. The
Chicago Bulls are joking about being in the James derby. And Ohio
State running back Maurice Clarett has him on speed dial on his cell
phone.</LD>
<LD>   James recently made another list, pulling up at No. 6, behind
Allen Iverson, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter and Tracy
McGrady. That's right. According to Lycos, an Internet search engine,
James gets more search hits than every NBA player except those five.</LD>
<TE>   One question: Where was Shaquille O'Neal? Has he tumbled into the
what-have-you-done-for-me-in-the-last-five-minutes category?</TE>
<TE>   Add hoop-la: There's always the next Jordan on deck, or in this
case, the next LeBron waiting in the wings. Newsday columnist
Johnette Howard got an eyeful from a magazine spread on a high school
junior.</TE>
<TE>   "Curiously, not enough people shrieked 'exploitation' when next
year's LeBron James -- Sebastian Telfair, now a junior star at
Brooklyn's Lincoln High School -- showed up recently, dripping with
diamonds and gold jewelry and surrounded by models wearing lingerie
in an eight-page photo spread in Dime magazine," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Dime issue showed up in my mailbox, I couldn't believe
it. Telfair is what -- all of 17? Are we supposed to believe the poor
lamb was tricked? Bamboozled? Originally told those models would be
wearing terrycloth bathrobes instead of next to nothing?</TE>
<TE>   "Or did Telfair happily pose like that because he's living the
life, playing the game?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many times did Michigan beat rival Ohio State in
football in the '90s?</TE>
<TE>   Prep kudos: And now, a much-needed pause from negativity in high
school sports.</TE>
<TE>   Two prep teams were honored in Massachusetts for acts of
sportsmanship. Westboro High's golf coach found a scoring error after
his team had won its state title and everyone had departed. He
reported the mistake and the trophy went to Woburn.</TE>
<TE>   The other team was the Reading High girls' soccer team. When the
team, which, incidentally, hadn't received a red card or even a
yellow card all season, realized it had inadvertently received a
higher-seeded spot in the playoffs than it was entitled to, officials
were informed of the error.</TE>
<TE>   Reading room: Cue the ominous music for the Bulls' annual marathon
trip, having to vacate the United Center for the circus. But Coach
Bill Cartwright won't be handing out the same sort of reading
material Phil Jackson used to hand out to the Bulls, a specific book
for each player.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody read those books Phil passed out," Cartwright told the
Chicago Tribune, smiling. "That's the part you should understand."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Seven.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: NASCAR Vice President Jim Hunter on new Winston Cup
champion Tony Stewart: "He is definitely not vanilla, he is
Neapolitan, and you get a little bit of everything with Tony Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he can charm Godzilla when he wants to. We also know that
when he puts on his game face and gets ready to race, leave him
alone, get out of the way."</TE>

<LD>Michael Olowokandi took 19 shots, made 11 and scored 24 points in the
Clippers' victory Monday against the Golden State Warriors. He took
five shots, made two and scored eight points in a loss Sunday against
the Seattle SuperSonics.</LD>
<LD>   "We pounded the ball inside," Coach Alvin Gentry said of the
change in game plans from Sunday to Monday. "That's where our
strength is."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry has been pleading for the Clippers to start their offense
with a pass inside to Olowokandi or Elton Brand. If they have a good
shot, they're free to take it. If not, they are encouraged to pass to
open teammates on the perimeter.</LD>
<TE>   It's fundamental basketball, but too often, and for reasons that
Gentry cannot explain, the Clippers take hurried shots from the
outside.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of teams have a center capable of neutralizing
Olowokandi and a power forward who can slow Brand. Several have one
but not the other. Quite a few have neither.</TE>
<TE>   Most teams have tried to thwart the Clipper inside game by
double-teaming Olowokandi and Brand whenever they catch the ball on
the low block. It's up to Olowokandi and Brand to spot open
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "In order for us to have a balanced attack, we have to establish a
presence in the low post and once we do that we have very athletic
guys who can slash to the basket," Olowokandi said. "We also have
very, very good shooters."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers clicked Monday against the Warriors, making them pay
for their failure to double-team the post in the second half.
Olowokandi scored 20 of his 24 points in the second half. Brand
scored 10 of 17 in the final two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the ball to him," Gentry said of the Clippers' plan to
feed Olowokandi. "I thought we could have got it to him more. We
spread out the floor. He did a great job in the second half. In the
first half, he caught it on the block, but couldn't get it in the
basket. He had some good shots."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mike Leclerc will miss at least three to four weeks, according to
Mighty Duck officials, after having arthroscopic surgery Tuesday to
repair a torn lateral meniscus and have cartilage removed in his left
knee.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc, fifth in scoring with 11 points this season, will miss at
least 10 games. He has offensive skills, with two goals and 11 points
this season, and is a physical presence.</LD>
<LD>   "When you lose a top-six forward you can't replace him," General
Manager Bryan Murray said. "You hope that guys like Patric
[Kjellberg] will play responsibly, but you are not going to get as
much scoring."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks will not call up a player from Cincinnati, especially
since center Adam Oates (broken left hand) could return in a week to
10 days. The only minor league player the Ducks would consider is
Jonathan Hedstrom, who is out at least two more weeks after getting
hit in the eye with a stick.</TE>

<HD>A Point Lessens the Pain</HD>
<DH>Ducks lose to Rangers, 3-2, in overtime, but finish trip
with seven of a possible 10 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks can't seem to lose for losing these days.</LD>
<LD>   Pavel Bure racing up the ice, past three defenders, to score the
game-winning goal in overtime should be a terrible thing for a team
to take home. The Ducks, while not thrilled at the sight, didn't
leave New York empty-handed.</LD>
<LD>   Bure's goal gave the New York Rangers a 3-2 victory Tuesday in
front of 18,072 at Madison Square Garden. Yet the Ducks return home
feeling pretty good about their five-game trip.</LD>
<TE>   The NHL rules served them well. This was the Ducks' third overtime
loss on this trip, following ones at Detroit and New Jersey. Combined
with victories over Columbus and Atlanta, the Ducks got seven out of
a possible 10 points on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the NHL point system," Duck center Matt Cullen said.
"Obviously that's the silver lining for us tonight. We just have to
keep on building."</TE>
<TE>   That erector-set chore had the Ducks swinging one way, then the
other Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were dominated in the first period, falling behind, 2-0.
They took control in the second, outshooting the Rangers, 22-6, and
tying the score on goals by Cullen and Ruslan Salei. They returned to
hibernation in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in overtime, Bure picked up the puck at the end of an active
Duck shift, where the Duck players had been on the ice for 50
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a chance to change and he had the puck," Duck
center Steve Rucchin said. "That's not the situation I want to be
in."</TE>
<TE>   Bure raced up ice and into the Duck zone and past three Ducks
before slipping a shot past goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere 57 seconds
into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a defenseman and that's one of the fastest guys in the
league," Rucchin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were left with the somewhat strange feeling of losing so
abruptly, yet going home with points in five road games.</TE>
<TE>   "You never feel good anytime you lose, especially in that
fashion," Duck captain Paul Kariya said. "All we can do is take the
point and go back home."</TE>
<TE>   Those points are beginning to add up. The Ducks have picked up at
least one in eight consecutive games, tying a franchise record, which
has allowed them to meet their first goal, being in the playoff
picture 20 games into the season.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the league is now, if you don't get off to a good start,
you could be out of it by Christmas," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to be in the thing at the quarter pole," said Coach Mike
Babcock, whose team is 6-1-1-3 in the last 11 games. "What did we
have after 12 games, four wins? I didn't know if we should unpack the
boxes."</TE>
<TE>   The good china can now be put on the shelf at the Babcock home.
The Ducks' effort Tuesday was an indication that they are on better
footing than in recent seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers got first-period goals from Mark Messier and Eric
Lindros and were poised to bury the Ducks. The Ducks had to survive
two minutes of a two-man Ranger advantage late in the period after
Kevin Sawyer and Mike Brown had minor penalties tacked onto fighting
majors. The Ducks wiggled out of the jam, then turned on the Rangers
in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen made it 2-1 three minutes into the second period with a
shot from the blue line that went off the stick of the Ranger
defenseman Dale Purinton. Salei tied the score at 18:26 of the period
with a blue-line shot after Marc Chouinard won a faceoff in the
Ranger zone.</TE>

<HD>Gonzalez to Resign as Franklin Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez, one of the City Section's
longest-tenured coaches, will resign his post after 17 seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez, 52, will coach his team through the remainder of the
season. Franklin (9-1) will play Dorsey on Thursday night in the
first round of the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   One of the section's most respected coaches, Gonzalez has presided
over 14 league champions and his teams won four 3-A division
championships in the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   He moved his family to Laguna Niguel two years ago and cited a
need to be closer to home for his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The commute has become kind of rough for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is 159-34-3 over three different stints -- 1980-83,
1986-89 and 1994-2002 -- at Franklin and has a 27-year association
with his alma mater. He will remain a dean at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said he wants to coach his 12-year-old son Erik when he
gets to high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to deny if something opens up down there, I'd be
interested if it was a good situation," he said of South Orange
County. "I'm not retiring because I'm burned out. I still have a lot
of fire in me."</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section will take no action against the Long Beach
Wilson boys' water polo program for an incident two weeks ago that
led to a San Clemente player needing 24 stitches to close a gash on
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Simmons, section administrator for boys' water polo, said he
found no conclusive evidence that Wilson's Garrit Barth acted
maliciously when he made contact with San Clemente's Sean Staudenbaur
in a game on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Staudenbaur contended that Barth punched him in the head. Barth
said he struck Staudenbaur with his knee, trying to escape his grasp.
No penalty was called at the time of the incident and videotape was
inconclusive, Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   With Staudenbaur back in the water Saturday, San Clemente lost,
13-8, to North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake in the second round of the
Southern Section Division I playoffs. Wilson (29-0) plays Lake Forest
El Toro today at 4:15 p.m. in a Division I semifinal at Newport
Harbor.</TE>

<LD>Tony Wimberly, the second-year girls' tennis coach at Pasadena
Mayfield, was not present for his team's 15-3 loss to top-seeded
Brentwood in a Southern Section Division III quarterfinal Tuesday.
But from a hospital bed at USC's Norris Cancer Institute in East
L.A., he was there in voice and spirit -- as he has been since the
playoffs began.</LD>
<LD>   "He's such an inspiration to the girls," said Cub assistant David
Gerletti, who has coached the team in Wimberly's absence. "Over the
holidays [last Christmas] he weighed 112 pounds. He was practically
on his death bed."</LD>
<LD>   Not even a debilitating illness can keep him from doing what he
loves -- and that's coaching. "He may not be here with us physically,
but he is telephonically," Gerletti said. "We call him to ask for
advice and what lineup to play. We do a cheer for him before every
match."</LD>
<TE>   Even without two of its top players, Brentwood advanced to a
semifinal Thursday at a site to be determined against fourth-seeded
Long Beach Wilson, which defeated Valencia on games, 86-77. Freshman
Austin Hansen lost one game in three sets at No. 1 singles and the
Eagles (16-2) won eight of nine doubles sets. Mayfield finished 17-5.</TE>
<TE>   Wimberly, 43, has undergone chemotherapy for leukemia and is
primarily confined to his room. Yet, he was positive and upbeat when
contacted by phone during Tuesday's match.</TE>
<TE>   "My blood count is low, my immune system is weak and I have to
wear a face mask because I'm susceptible to a lot of germs," he said.
"I've been through about five or six different cycles of chemo,
though, so I'm used to this. I'm going to keep fighting."</TE>
<TE>   First diagnosed with cancer two years ago, and due for another
round of chemotherapy in two weeks, Wimberly said coaching took his
mind off his disease. Following his team's growth has given him a lot
to live for.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was just to reach the playoffs," Wimberly said. "I
figured anything after the first round would be like icing on the
cake. And here we are in the quarters -- I couldn't be happier."</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos d. Long Beach Poly, 15-8, 15-10, 15-7 -- The
second-seeded Griffins took only 1 hour 20 minutes to defeat the
Jackrabbits and advance to the Southern Section Division I-AA girls'
volleyball finals for the second time. Los Alamitos won a section
title in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   It sets up a title game against top-seeded Long Beach Wilson
(33-2), the No. 1 team in The Times' rankings. Wilson defeated
Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula, 15-8, 15-5, 15-3.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (28-7) -- No. 4 in The Times' rankings -- got 11
kills from Katie Carlson, four aces from Erin Senozan and 32 assists
from setter Ashley Tarutis.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Garbisch put away the first game with a dump. Senozan buried
an ace to end the second game. A couple of kills each from Alexandra
Filkins and Kara Uhl proved key in the final game.</TE>
<TE>   Talaya Whitfield had 14 kills for Poly (18-8), which lost to
Wilson in five games this season at the Gahr tournament.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>It has been a grind, no question, but the Kings' eight-game, 17-day
trip, which wraps up Thursday night at St. Louis, is far from the
most grueling Coach Andy Murray has experienced.</LD>
<LD>   "This one doesn't even compare to the national team trips," said
Murray, who coached Team Canada from 1996-98. "Those were
unbelievable."</LD>
<LD>   On a 1997 trip, Murray said, he brought the Canadians to Warsaw
for their first visit in 20 years. After a 10-hour flight from
Calgary to Frankfurt, Germany, a three-hour layover and a 90-minute
flight to Warsaw, they boarded a bus.</LD>
<TE>   "It was right out of the 1940s," Murray said. "The driver, who
didn't speak English, had maybe two teeth, and there were beer
bottles on the dash."</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, the bus wasn't big enough to fit the team and its
equipment comfortably, so the players and coaches had to sit on their
luggage. Then came the bad news: They weren't making a short trip to
a hotel; the game had been rescheduled for a smaller city about eight
hours away.</TE>
<TE>   A snowstorm en route stretched the trip to more than 10 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to tell the guys all the time about the power of flexing,"
Murray said. "If you can't do anything about something, don't worry
about it; just flex and roll with it. We were about six hours into
that bus ride and one of the players yelled from the back, 'Coach,
I've had about all the flexing I can handle for one day.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lubomir Visnovsky sat out Tuesday night's game because of back
spasms. "It's unfortunate," Murray said. "He's been our best
defenseman." ... Chris McAlpine replaced Visnovsky and Mikko
Eloranta, activated from injured reserve after sitting out five games
because of a sprained left knee, replaced Jaroslav Bednar.</TE>

<HD>Kings Are Weary but Not Beaten</HD>
<DH>Near end of 17-day trip, they are satisfied tying the Wild,
2-2, even though they failed to keep two leads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Even after twice giving up one-goal leads, the Kings found little to
complain about after Tuesday night's 2-2 tie with the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe they were too tired.</LD>
<LD>   In the seventh game of an eight-game, 17-day trip, nearing the end
of a stretch in which they will have played 13 of 15 games on the
road, the Kings matched one of the NHL's hottest teams goal for goal
while killing seven penalties and generating 14 more shots on goal in
front of a sellout crowd of 18,064 at Xcel Energy Center.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, they might have fared better if they'd scored more than
one goal while outshooting the Wild, 17-5, in the first period, but
who's to quibble?</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed we didn't get two points," King Coach Andy
Murray said, "but with our work ethic we sent a message that we're
going to continue to battle and fight through everything we've had to
fight through here in the last month."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 4, the night before they left on a trip that started Nov.
5 at San Jose and will end after Thursday night's game at St. Louis,
the Kings gave up three goals in the third period of a 5-2 loss to
the Wild at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they got a first-period goal from Ziggy Palffy, his
third of the season and first not scored into an empty net since
opening night, and a second-period goal from Alexander Frolov, who
leads NHL rookies with six.</TE>
<TE>   The Northwest Division-leading Wild countered with a second-period
goal by Marian Gaborik and a third-period goal by Sergei Zholtok.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we could have won this game," said Palffy, whose goal was
his 100th in 213 games with the Kings. "We just have to stay away
from the box and play our game. If you're going to play penalty
killing, you're getting more tired."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had the man advantage only twice, had to kill only
one penalty while dominating the first period. But all they had to
show for it was Palffy's goal, scored at 18:36 on a tap-in after a
shot from the point by defenseman Chris McAlpine squirted between the
legs of goaltender Dwayne Roloson.</TE>
<TE>   With Roloson looking out toward the point, the puck landed behind
him and Palffy streaked in to poke it into the unprotected net.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had an opportunity to have a fairly good lead in the
first period and we didn't get it," Murray said, "but the Wild is a
good team, a resilient team."</TE>
<TE>   At 2:51 of the second period, Gaborik rifled a shot from the right
faceoff circle that beat King goaltender Felix Potvin, pulling the
Wild even.</TE>
<TE>   Frolov scored on a rebound at 11:18, but Zholtok tied the score
again at 5:48 of the third period, carrying the puck around
defenseman Aaron Miller from near the right corner and beating Potvin
with a backhanded shot from the slot.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the Kings killed one more penalty, a slashing call
against Mathieu Schneider that gave the Wild a man advantage over the
last 1:24 of regulation and the first 36 seconds of overtime. Potvin
was up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the last 29 seconds, the Kings had the advantage after
the Wild was penalized for having too many players on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Roloson bobbled a last-second shot by Schneider but hung on.</TE>
<TE>   The tie left the Kings with a 2-3-1-1 record on the trip, their
longest in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   Since they first left home Oct. 22, they're 5-5-2-2, 4-4-2-2 on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a battle to get up for these games right now,"
Schneider said. "It's just been such a grueling trip. The last 30
days have been incredible for us. To come out with an effort like we
did tonight speaks volumes about our team."</TE>

<HD>It's One of Doze Games</HD>
<DH>Bryant rips into teammates after Lakers have their worst
shooting night. Mavericks improve to 11-0 with 98-72 romp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>On a Tuesday night in a place where the Lakers almost never lose, the
weight of too many games without Shaquille O'Neal and too many jump
shots gone astray became too much to bear.</LD>
<LD>   "I look around the locker room and I don't see any fire in
anybody's eyes," Kobe Bryant said. "Everybody's just kind of dozing
off a little bit. I don't know if they're waiting for Shaquille to
get back or whatever. I don't know. But there's just no intensity."</LD>
<LD>   So the discontent grew again for Bryant, who sprained an ankle and
a thumb in a 98-72 loss to the unbeaten Dallas Mavericks at American
Airlines Center, and then wondered where the life was.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers, who shot an L.A. franchise-low 30.8% (28 of 91) after
nearing the record several times in three horrendous weeks, have lost
six of their last seven games, eight of 11 overall, and it all looked
that much sorrier held up against the giddy Mavericks, winners of 11
in a row to start the season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he'd seen the same disconnected expressions at
halftime of the Boston defeat nearly two weeks ago, and for Bryant it
began a short period in which he was sullen and distant in the
presence of his teammates. An hour after Tuesday's loss -- he scored
16 points on seven-of-21 shooting, Steve Nash had 21 points and Dirk
Nowitzki and Michael Finley each had 18 -- Bryant warned that
O'Neal's return might not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really tell you what they're thinking," he said. "I don't
know. The shots that they're getting should be going down. They're
the same type of shots they're going to get when Shaquille gets back,
that they're going to have to make. They have to be more aggressive
and play within themselves and things will work out for them."</TE>
<TE>   While Maverick owner Mark Cuban danced gleefully on the far end of
the floor, the Lakers made seven of 27 shots in the second quarter,
five of 19 in the third quarter and six of 22 in the fourth. Nine
years ago, the Lakers made 31.2% of their shots in a game against
Denver, and until Tuesday it had stood as the futility standard.</TE>
<TE>   No more. Not when Rick Fox misses 11 of 15 shots and Derek Fisher
misses six of nine and Slava Medvedenko misses five of six and Kareem
Rush misses nine of 11 and Brian Shaw misses six of nine. Bryant, who
missed 14 shots, summoned the authority to flog his teammates with
his own disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating, but it just kind of fuels my hunger," he said.
"It makes me even hungrier. I hear the fans in the stands talk this,
talk that. It's a long season. We're going to be there at the end of
the season."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, "Each individual player has to dig
inside themselves and find the confidence within themselves. I try to
do that throughout the game.... That's the way it has to be."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson, the holder of perspective and keeper of
optimism, did not disagree with Bryant. Standing outside the somber
locker room, he was the first to disparage the effort of his players,

determination, if not outright talent.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had slogged behind the Mavericks in most areas -- they
were outshot, outrebounded and outplayed at all turns -- particularly
after falling behind by 15 points at halftime. The Lakers cleared 70
points, the L.A. franchise low set in Cleveland two weeks ago, with
less than a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our resolve I'm disappointed in," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   For those assuming this couldn't possibly get worse, it threatened
to just over three minutes into the game, when Bryant rose up for a
jump shot and upon landing rolled his left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   He lay on his side, gripping the ankle with both hands. When he
got to his feet, he took two steps and slapped his hands together in
disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hours earlier, he had the last of the four stitches
removed from his lip, and he had to figure things were getting
better.</TE>
<TE>   So, he yelped a little every time he landed on the ankle. Then,
early in the third quarter, the ball deflected off his left hand, and
he shook that for a few possessions as the Maverick lead grew toward
20, and Laker jump shots continued to find the heel of the rim. After
a timeout, Bryant returned to the floor with his thumb wrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Bryant managed a wry smile.</TE>
<TE>   "My ankle's hurting," he said. "But I figure if Donovan McNabb can
play with a broken ankle, I can play with a badly sprained one. I'll
play tomorrow."</TE>

<LD>Philadelphia 76er guard Allen Iverson is afraid police are targeting

<LD>   "I want to be in Philadelphia, but I'm scared to be here," the NBA

<TE>   The woman accused of extortion by Michael Jordan responded with
her own lawsuit in Chicago, saying he offered her $5 million to keep
quiet about their relationship. Karla Knafel asked the court to force
Jordan to pay her the money because he was in breach of contract.
Jordan filed a lawsuit in October, contending he had a relationship
with Knafel 10 years ago and paid her $250,000 "under threat of
publicly exposing that relationship."</TE>

<LD>Tony Stewart, newly crowned Winston Cup stock car racing champion,
will race after all in the Turkey Night Grand Prix at Irwindale
Speedway on Nov. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, who won the 100-lap race for midget cars in 2000, after
having finished second in 1999, had feared that duties associated
with his NASCAR title might keep him from the Thanksgiving night
festivities but car owner Steve Lewis of Laguna Beach said Stewart
had cleared the decks.</LD>
<LD>   "The car is ready and Tony will be here to drive it," Lewis said
Tuesday at a test session at Irwindale.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, a former USAC national champion in midgets, sprint cars
and Silver Crown dirt-track cars before switching to Winston Cup
stock cars four years ago, has long been a backer of midgets and the
Turkey Night race.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart missed Turkey Night last year because a postponed Winston
Cup race was run that weekend.</TE>

<LD>Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Tommy Maddox is out of the hospital,
fully recovered in less than two days from a spinal cord injury that
easily could have been much worse.</LD>
<LD>   How long it takes him to get over the emotional stress of the
scary experience may determine how quickly he returns -- and how well
he plays.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox breezed through tests for his cerebral and spinal cord
concussions Tuesday before being released from a Pittsburgh hospital,
glad to be out but weary from the frightful ordeal.</LD>
<TE>   "There certainly is a psychological effect," said Joseph Maroon,
the neurosurgeon who treated Maddox. "When you're lying on a football
field, unable to feel your arms or legs and unable to move, I can't
imagine a more frightening experience. I've seen this in quite a few
athletes, and they haven't returned to function."</TE>

<LD>The Philadelphia Flyers used size to their advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Gagne had a goal and an assist as the Flyers beat the Tampa
Bay Lightning, 3-2, Tuesday night at Tampa, Fla., in a matchup of
early-season division leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "They are a big team," Tampa Bay Coach John Tortorella said. "It's
not the style of the Broad Street bullies. They're a well-coached
hockey club. They play under a strict team concept. They fill a lot
of the ice with big bodies."</LD>
<TE>   Jeremy Roenick and John LeClair also scored for the Atlantic
Division-leading Flyers, who have lost once in their last 11 games
(8-1-2) against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, who had tied their previous three games, ended a
five-game winless streak. They had five goals over the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a great hockey game tonight," Philadelphia Coach Ken
Hitchcock said. "We played with a lot of emotion. We got good
performance from our key players."</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 29 shots for the Southeast
Division-leading Lightning, which fell to 7-1-0-1 at home. He kept
the game close by making 25 saves through two periods.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 3, Washington 2 -- Evgeni Nabokov made 46 saves,
frustrating the Capitals and leading the Sharks to victory at
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Selanne, Patrick Marleau and Owen Nolan scored for the
Sharks, who climbed out of last place in the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Nylander and Mike Grier scored for Washington, which had
gone 129 minutes 20 seconds without a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Florida 3 -- Shawn McEachern scored a power-play goal
at 3:23 of overtime to give the Thrashers a come-from-behind victory
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Olli Jokinen extended his scoring surge with a pair of
shorthanded goals. His 11 goals ties his career high.</TE>
<TE>   There was more good news for the Thrashers, who reached a
tentative agreement on a contract with free-agent goalie Byron Dafoe.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Calgary 0 -- Curtis Joseph made 29 saves at Calgary,
Canada, for his second shutout of the season as the Red Wings won
their fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Maltby had a goal and two assists, and Darren McCarty, Igor
Larionov, Sergei Fedorov and Kris Draper also scored for the
defending Stanley Cup champions.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 4, Buffalo 3 -- Scott Niedermayer scored 1:23 into
overtime to give the Devils a victory at East Rutherford, N.J., which
extended the Sabres' winless streak to 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Tverdovsky, John Madden and Jeff Friesen also scored for the
Devils, who overcame a 2-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Chicago 1 -- Ethan Moreau and Steve Staios scored
shorthanded goals in the first period as the Oilers won at Edmonton,
Canada. Staios' goal was his second of the season, both shorthanded.
He redirected a pass from Mike York.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Ottawa 4 -- Bates Battaglia and Ron Francis scored 53
seconds apart early in the third period, and Rod Brind'Amour had a
goal with eight minutes left as the Hurricanes earned a tie at
Raleigh, N.C.</TE>

<KH>THE RIVALRY/ USC vs. UCLA</KH>
<HD>Palmer's Legacy Up in the Air</HD>
<DH>Quarterback has the statistics, but Trojan historians will
judge him by the next two weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fact: Carson Palmer is the most prolific passer in USC history.</LD>
<LD>   Fiction: He is the most successful quarterback in USC history.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers speak for themselves. By the time he finishes his
college career this season, a career spanning four seasons and part
of a fifth, Palmer will hold virtually every significant school
passing and total offense record.</LD>
<TE>   By the time the first quarter ends Saturday against UCLA, he could
very well have the 76 yards he needs to become the career passing
leader in the Pacific 10 Conference, eclipsing such quarterbacks as
Jim Plunkett, John Elway, Troy Aikman and Drew Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for many, the only numbers that matter are those Palmer is
able to help USC put on the scoreboard the next two weeks against the
Bruins and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson Palmer's career will hinge on these two games," said Troy
Winslow, the Trojan quarterback in 1965 and '66. "If he plays well
and they win, it will carry over for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his gaudy statistics, Palmer lacks the achievements that
truly define a successful quarterback. He hasn't won a Pac-10 title.
He hasn't played in a Rose Bowl game or another major bowl. In his 42
career starts, USC is 24-18, including 0-2 in bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   Without a strong finish this season, Palmer probably will be
remembered as the USC quarterback who couldn't win the big one.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that is going to hang over his head, and this is
why this year is so important, is the wins and losses," said Paul
McDonald, the quarterback of the USC team that won a national title
in 1979. "That's a very important part of it, winning a championship
or winning a Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, winning is all that matters. I think
Carson Palmer would be the first guy to tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   Most agree, though, that Palmer hasn't had it easy. At least in
comparison to some of the more successful quarterbacks in school
history.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Haden played on national championship teams in 1972 and 1974,
won two of three Rose Bowl games and never lost a conference game in
his three varsity seasons. Yet he acknowledged that his
responsibilities fell far short of Palmer's during an era when USC
quarterbacks were known more for handing off than passing.</TE>
<TE>   "I played when USC was a running back-dominated team," said Haden,
whose tailback was All-American Anthony Davis. "Any moderately
talented quarterback could have done what I did.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson played in a quarterback-driven offense, which most
offenses are these days. So there's been a lot more pressure on him
from week to week. He had to wake up every Saturday morning and say,
'Hey, if I don't play well, we're not going to win this game.'</TE>
<TE>   "The quarterbacks in my era and before me didn't have to do that.
We had moments when we had to win games, but not every Saturday. It's
a whole different mind-set in responsibility for the position today."</TE>
<TE>   There also is the matter of teammates. When Haden and McDonald
played, in the era before scholarship restrictions, USC was a
perennial national power whose backups often were better than an
opponent's starters.</TE>
<TE>   In McDonald's three seasons, from 1977 to '79, his teammates
included tailback Charles White, the 1979 Heisman Trophy winner, and
five all-conference offensive linemen who would go on to play in the
NFL -- Pat Howell, Brad Budde, Anthony Munoz, Roy Foster and Keith
Van Horne.</TE>
<TE>   In his first four years at USC, Palmer played with only one
all-conference offensive lineman -- Travis Claridge -- and without a
consistent running game to help take the pressure off the
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's had a tremendous supporting cast throughout
his career like some of the quarterbacks that have gone before him,"
McDonald said. "And I think because of that, his [passing] numbers
are even more impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Winslow, who spent the 1965 season mostly handing off to Heisman
Trophy winner Mike Garrett, said the emergence this season of senior
tailback Justin Fargas and an improved running game have helped
Palmer enjoy his most productive season.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that they're running the ball, it's taking all the pressure
off of him," Winslow said. "That's the biggest difference between him
now and the last three years. When you can't run the ball, you're
dodging blitzes on every play."</TE>
<TE>   After being labeled a disappointment for much of his career,
Palmer finally is living up to the immense expectations that followed
him when he signed with the Trojans out of Santa Margarita High and
became the starter midway through his freshman season.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six games, he has passed for 1,997 yards and 19
touchdowns while USC has gone 5-1, its only blemish an overtime loss
to Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody expected Carson to play the last four or five
years like he has the last month," Haden said. "I don't remember
expectations being higher for a quarterback than when I heard about
John Elway coming out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   "That can be a difficult thing for an 18-year-old kid. I've
admired the way he's handled the down moments, because he's had his
share of those."</TE>
<TE>   (The Elway comparison is noteworthy. Stanford had a 20-23-1 record
with the future NFL legend at quarterback.)</TE>
<TE>   Though he doesn't know Palmer well, Haden said it's obvious that
the 6-foot-6, 230-pound senior has exceptional mental toughness.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been easy for him to blame other people when things
weren't going well, to hang his head, to mope and complain, to
transfer," Haden said. "He didn't. He hung in there. He never had a
great running game. He went through a change in the coaching staff.
And I've never seen him blame anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps coming back and playing hard the next week, and I think
that's a real testament to his character."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has gotten to know Palmer as an announcer for USC radio
broadcasts and admires the way he deals with success and failure.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been humble throughout the whole process," McDonald said.
"He has been self-effacing. He's always the first guy to compliment
everybody else on the team. He never points a finger.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's the ultimate sign of a winner, not only on the
field, but in life."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how the season shakes out, Palmer already has left
his mark. Among his USC career records are: total offense (10,619
yards), passing yards (10,836), plays (a Pac-10 record 1,704),
touchdown passes (63), completions (855) and attempts (1,470). He
also holds the school record with 47 interceptions, but has thrown
only eight this season in 380 attempts. And none in his last 93
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   He is considered a potential top-five pick in the NFL draft, a
reflection of his strong arm and better-than-average mobility. "He's
a physically gifted, very skilled player," said Haden, who played six
seasons with the Los Angeles Rams.</TE>
<TE>   Though a longshot for the award, Palmer can advance his Heisman
Trophy candidacy by playing well and helping USC defeat rivals UCLA
and Notre Dame for the first time in the same season since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   If he needs a pep talk before those games, he might want to chat
with Winslow, a longtime high school teacher and president of the
Trojan Football Alumni Club.</TE>
<TE>   "[Coach] John McKay once asked us in the locker room, 'What's the
job of the quarterback?' Winslow said. "I said, 'It's good if you can
run the team.' McKay said, 'No, the job of the quarterback is to win.
No matter what you have to do, win.'</TE>
<TE>   "If Carson can use his abilities to win, then he's a winner. I
don't care if he throws the ball 30 times or 10 times. He's got to do
what it takes to win."</TE>

<HD>Glory Day</HD>
<DH>Walk-on John Barnes got his shot 10 years ago on L.A.'s
biggest stage and made the most of it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MENLO PARK</DL>
<LD>A year before The Game, he watched it from the stands, having sneaked
into the Coliseum bearing the student ID of a USC coed.</LD>
<LD>   Three months before The Game, he dreamed about it from the bench,
a fifth-string, non-scholarship quarterback who held a practice
dummy.</LD>
<LD>   One month before The Game, allowed into the huddle only because of
injuries to others, he struggled to hide a learning disability that
caused him to jumble up the plays.</LD>
<TE>   Three weeks before The Game, he jumbled the plays so badly during
a test that one of the coaches accused him of smoking pot.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks before The Game, another coach formed letters with his
body on the sidelines to remind him of those plays.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before The Game, when confirming that this kid would be
actually his starting quarterback, the head coach closed his eyes and
softly banged his head on a table.</TE>
<TE>   Then John Barnes, the UCLA senior with a vagabond past and vague
future, staggered into The Game.</TE>
<TE>   It was 10 years ago this week.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has been the same since.</TE>
<TE>   He threw one touchdown pass against USC on an audible while his
coach, Terry Donahue, was shouting, "No! No! No!"</TE>
<TE>   He threw another touchdown pass on an audible that had receiver
coach Rick Neuheisel shouting, "Oh my God! What is he doing?"</TE>
<TE>   He threw for 384 yards that afternoon, 204 yards during a
fourth-quarter comeback, and 90 yards on a game-winning touchdown
pass.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Bruins to a 38-37 victory over the Trojans that
confirmed why The Game remains eternal.</TE>
<TE>   It has no memory and holds no expectations.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't care who you were before kickoff, or who you will
become later.</TE>
<TE>   It is about one city, one afternoon, one moment.</TE>
<TE>   John Barnes bears witness to how anyone with enough under his
jersey can grab that moment.</TE>
<TE>   He was starting for only the third time at UCLA. He was attending
his fifth college. As a senior who had run out of time and
transcripts, this was his last chance.</TE>
<TE>   What he did with that chance will endure forever.</TE>
<TE>   Even if, in keeping with the game's personality, his moment ended
that night.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember walking outside into the Rose Bowl after the game and
they were cutting the grass," Barnes said, shaking his head. "Cutting
the grass! It was like, man, it's over."</TE>
<TE>   On the way to a Westwood party, Barnes was approached in a gas
station.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes took him for a fan, but he gave Barnes $5 and asked him to
fill his tank on Pump No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I went from hero to 'Five on Five,' " Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Man, was it ever over!</TE>
<TE>   Barnes never threw another pass in this country.</TE>
<TE>   He never represented UCLA in another public function.</TE>
<TE>   When he attended the UCLA-Stanford game recently, nobody
recognized him.</TE>
<TE>   When a search for him began last week, the athletic department
didn't even have his phone number.</TE>
<TE>   He lives today with his wife and infant in Silicon Valley, in a
comfortable brick home in an upscale neighborhood full of technology
soldiers succeeding in a similarly rough game.</TE>
<TE>   Unless his plans change, this is where they will be Saturday, John
and Cristy and baby Rowen, quietly celebrating a 10-year anniversary
with baby toys and dog walks and memories of an afternoon that still
outreaches description.</TE>
<TE>   "About the best thing I can say about my story is, 'Only in
America,' " said Barnes, now 33, but still maintaining that boyish
grin while chewing sunflower seeds in his family room.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been a fairy tale, but there were too many dragons.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been a success manual, except Barnes says, "The road
was too tough and too lonely. I could never recommend it to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   It could at least have been an identity, except Barnes has shed
that as easily as he once shed Trojan tacklers.</TE>
<TE>   He has no videotape of the game, no souvenirs, no newspaper
clippings. When he met his future wife, he was so worried about being
mired in the past, he told her he had been UCLA's student manager.</TE>
<TE>   He has only one photograph of himself in a Bruin uniform, one that
he keeps in a home office he now uses in his job as a technology
salesman.</TE>
<TE>   It is of Terry Donahue hugging him while his world applauds him as
he walks off the field on that November night.</TE>
<TE>   That's all he needs to see.</TE>
<TE>   One city, one afternoon, one moment.,</TE>
<TE>   "I have been through so much in my life, there are times when I
need to look back and say, 'What have I accomplished? What is there,'
" he said. "For me, this game represents there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The extended story of John Barnes begins with the short bus.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Illinois, diagnosed with learning disorders that
included dyslexia, he spent several years in special education.</TE>
<TE>   He has not publicly revealed this before. He hopes his former
teammates at UCLA will understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "Every morning, running from my house to the short bus as it
waited for me at the end of my driveway, all the other kids looking,"
he said. "That was tough."</TE>
<TE>   He said the only way he could feel normal at school was through
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder, then, that when he graduated from Trabuco Hills
High in Orange County, he wanted to continue playing football, even
though he had no scholarship offers?</TE>
<TE>   So, first, there was Saddleback College, where he was benched
sporadically. He left before playing a second season.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Long Beach State, where he lasted only one week and
never even met famed then-Coach George Allen.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed up for spring workouts, went to the equipment room to
get a football to throw, and they said that only scholarship guys get
footballs," he recalled. "So I left."</TE>
<TE>   Sight unseen, he then drove to Western Oregon College, an NAIA
Division II school in a small town south of Portland.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities were so bad, he never showered in the locker room
after practice. The coaches weren't that impressed with him either,
benching him after the first game.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, how bad can it be?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He soon found out when he transferred to UC Santa Barbara, had a
decent season ... and then the program was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, sitting on his couch with a beer, Barnes saw Tommy
Maddox appear on television to announce he was turning pro.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'There's a place for me,' " Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   So, in the spring of 1992, with no connections or advocates, he
dressed in a suit and put his tapes in a briefcase and showed up for
a meeting with the UCLA coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I was, a senior trying to walk on," he said. "I thought I
had to look good."</TE>
<TE>   Said Neuheisel: "We thought, who is this? He wanted to join the
program and we thought he wanted to invest our money somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   He tried out for quarterback coach Homer Smith while wearing the
suit, actually showing him his drop-back footwork in dress shoes.</TE>
<TE>   When it appeared they weren't going to throw him out, he showed up
for classes, even though he had not been officially admitted.</TE>
<TE>   He spent a week living in his car, leaving it only to sleep on a
buddy's couch at night.</TE>
<TE>   He finally found a room in an apartment, began riding his bike
down Wilshire to practice every day, began lifting weights and
avoiding alcohol, getting serious.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "A senior, a walk-on, his first year here ... it was like he was a
waste," said Charlie Smith, then the student manager who became a
close friend. "I was working there for the longest time before I ever
even heard anybody mention his name. Why would anybody spend any time
on somebody like that, with no future here?"</TE>
<TE>   After starter Rob Walker was injured early, Donahue made the point
again by telling Barnes that he would remain fifth string because the
scholarship guys needed their chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Riding that bike home every night, brakes broken, stopping it
with my feet, I would still envision what it would be like if I
played," Barnes said. "What decisions I would make. How I could lead
us."</TE>
<TE>   He practiced his drop-back moves under a streetlight near his
apartment. He sat outside the coaches' office so they would see him
studying the plays.</TE>
<TE>   He moved the scout team in practice against the first-team
defense, even changing his cadence to draw them offside.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone finally noticed. The Bruins had lost their first two
conference games, so why not? After he'd given a stirring Friday
night speech before a game against Washington State, Barnes was given
a start.</TE>
<TE>   And now the hard part began.</TE>
<TE>   He threw an interception early in that game, and was benched for
what he thought would be forever.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked back to sit next to me on the bus, and you could tell
he had been crying, his career was over," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when he was given another chance, he realized that, with his
learning disability, he would need help figuring out the complicated
offense.</TE>
<TE>   So he confided in Neuheisel, who calmly told him it was no big
deal, that he would help him as long as it didn't mean circumventing
the other coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I acted calm. I didn't want John to see me running into a
room shouting, 'Oh no, we're dead!' " Neuheisel said. "But it was
very, very unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Together, they worked on helping Barnes remember the offense.</TE>
<TE>   And when Barnes couldn't, Neuheisel stood on the sidelines,
contorting his body like a Y or a Z to remind Barnes of his primary
receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was crazy, like somebody doing the 'YMCA' dance over there,' "
Barnes said. "But it worked."</TE>
<TE>   Then came The Game, when Neuheisel simplified the Bruin signs so
that all Barnes had to do was nod at J.J. Stokes, and the receiver
would run downfield for a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't think he would do it on third down on our 10-yard
line!" said Neuheisel, the Washington coach who is still close to
Barnes today. "I about died."</TE>
<TE>   The throw was perfect, the run was dazzling, the touchdown was
scored with 2:04 remaining as the Bruins took a lead over USC that
they never lost.</TE>
<TE>   It was a moment Barnes never repeated.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks later, he was given a scholarship, and it
allowed him to finish school, but the glory died.</TE>
<TE>   He played football in Italy one year, enjoying sights such as
offensive linemen smoking on the sidelines, experiencing adventures
such as calling the wrong plays in Italian.</TE>
<TE>   Then he turned to a life of selling, which is what he had been
doing for years anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "All this taught me that you never give up, that good things will
happen if you hang in there long enough," he said, an example of all
that is possible with college athletics. "Believe me, I got as much
out of that game as UCLA did."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, plus a little acting job in an acclaimed movie.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes played the Alabama quarterback who handed the ball to Tom
Hanks' character.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1992 game was something I'll never forget, and the movie was
perfect," Neuheisel said. "John Barnes was UCLA's Forrest Gump."</TE>

<LD>USC vs. UCLA</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Polamalu's playing style is a lot like his long curly locks:
impossible to control, flowing this way and that, yet covering
everything.</TE>
<TE>   The USC senior safety is menacing, instinctual and savvy. In
short, he is a living, breathing nightmare for freshman quarterbacks
such as Drew Olson and Matt Moore of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the first thing we are going to look for when we break the
huddle," Moore said. "He's dangerous. I've seen him line up on the
line of scrimmage, at linebacker and as a defensive back. He's
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu will feign a blitz and drop back into coverage on one
play. Then on the next he will play possum and creep forward, timing
the snap and making a beeline to the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "He is such an active player," Bruin offensive line coach Mark
Weber said. "He comes from so many locations and gives you different
looks. They give him freedom to go. He flies around. But it's all
within their scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu's greatest asset is his aggressiveness. It also is his
greatest weakness. And he knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "I do a lot of things that sometimes hurt the team," he said.
"Sometimes I go more on my instincts and try to do too much."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will try to bait Polamalu, tempting him to blitz and throwing
a screen pass, for example. He is susceptible to getting caught out
of position because he is a gambler at heart.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing it's only me [and not my teammates], because if
two people do that, it's two huge parts of our scheme," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Various Bruins will block him, although on many plays no one is
assigned to block the strong safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He is real aggressive stopping the run," Olson said. "He can come
up and make a play. He's not a guy you want to go after on every
play."</TE>
<TE>   An ankle injury that slowed Polamalu for several weeks has healed.
He had perhaps his best game of the season against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best he's been physically," Trojan Coach Pete Carroll
said. "He's noticeably freer to run and change direction and
accelerate. That's real encouraging as we finish up."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, an All-American last season, has 272 career tackles, and
of his 59 tackles this season, 12 are for losses and he leads the
Trojans with six sacks. He also has returned three of his six career
interceptions for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody lauds Polamalu, but perhaps the greatest compliment came
from his own quarterback last week. Carson Palmer was discussing
Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs, a Lombardi Award finalist
who leads the nation in sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't take over a game like Troy Polamalu," Palmer said. "With
Troy, as a quarterback you definitely have to know where he is on
every play."</TE>

<HD>Ending Is Seen as Real Stretch</HD>
<DH>Ever since legendary Seabiscuit won the 1940 Santa Anita
Handicap, there have been suspicions that result was decided by
owner, not the horses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If differences of opinion make for horse races, those races do not
necessarily settle the arguments.</LD>
<LD>   So although the epic showdown with War Admiral in 1938 at Pimlico
is widely portrayed as Seabiscuit's signature race, the other race
that ought to be crammed into any time capsule is his 1940 Santa
Anita Handicap. Not necessarily because of the obvious trappings --
Seabiscuit breaking the earnings record, in a record time, in what
would be his final race -- but because of the gnawing suspicion that
Kayak II, Seabiscuit's younger stablemate, might have been the better
horse that day, had he been given the chance to run all out through
the stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Such conjecture, more than 60 years later, is hot-stove horse
racing at its best. Tom Dante, who was there in the record Santa
Anita crowd of 68,526, tosses a few logs on the fire with the adamant
opinion that Buddy Haas, Kayak's jockey, loafed through the last
sixteenth of a mile, allowing Seabiscuit to win.</LD>
<TE>   "I said right after the race that Haas didn't try with his horse,
and I'm still saying it," said the 86-year-old Dante, who trained
horses for nine years and still owns one or two. "There's no question
in my mind that this is what happened. I have always been absolutely
convinced. Haas moved his horse into second place at the eighth pole,
but the rest of the way he just didn't try to beat Seabiscuit. He
only sat on Kayak, instead of just laying into him [with the whip].
He hand-rode him to the wire."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Racing Form's footnotes to the official race chart,
written only minutes after Seabiscuit had crossed the finish line,
also suggest that Haas was content to finish second with Kayak.
Conversely, at least two still-active trainers who saw the race
believe that Seabiscuit was a legitimate winner.</TE>
<TE>   As for Laura Hillenbrand's recent best-seller about Seabiscuit,
the author said she chose not to include the controversy because she
didn't buy into the Kayak-was-better scuttlebutt. A spokeswoman for
the movie based on Hillenbrand's book, which recently went into
production, said that the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap would be filmed
toward the end of the shoot, and it was unclear how much, if any, of
the behind-the-scenes intrigue would be included.</TE>
<TE>   Enough went on -- or might have gone on -- in that Big 'Cap to
fill a two-hour film by itself.</TE>
<TE>   Kayak was an Argentine-bred who had won the Santa Anita Handicap
in record time in 1939, a year in which Seabiscuit went lame, ran
only once and was bred to several mares. That victory by Kayak was
posted under a feathery impost of 110 pounds. In 1940, paying the
penalty for having won eight races the year before, Kayak was
weighted at 129 pounds, one fewer than a supposedly declining
Seabiscuit. But Kayak lost by a length as Seabiscuit and jockey Red
Pollard reached the wire in 2:01 1/5, a fifth of a second better than
Kayak's 1939 clocking.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the 1940 Big 'Cap, The Times said that Haas "seemed
to take things easy" in Seabiscuit's wake. The unsigned story also
said, "Many left the track with the impression Kayak II might have
won the big race if Buddy Haas ... had more vigorously ridden the
black Argentine [horse] in the final sixteenth."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, that speculation kept rearing its head. In 1978,
Jane Goldstein, writing in the Blood-Horse magazine, said, " ... Some
thought ... that Kayak II was not pushed to challenge sentimentally
favored Seabiscuit." Goldstein referred to the chart footnotes,
which, much like the next-day account in The Times, pointedly said:</TE>
<TE>   "Kayak II, slow to get going, ran a sensational race to make a
very strong move in the backstretch, and might have been closer to
the winner had he been vigorously ridden in the last sixteenth."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, writing in Spur magazine, Jack McDonald said:</TE>
<TE>   "Seabiscuit had passed Sun Beau's all-time money-earning record
[becoming the first horse to reach the $400,000 mark] and the acclaim
was his, although some thought Kayak II had been purposely restrained
in the stretch to benefit his illustrious stablemate."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Bob Hebert, who had retired as a turf writer for The
Times, opened the door of suspicion only halfway.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard that Kayak wasn't supposed to beat Seabiscuit," Hebert
said in an interview with his old paper. "But I know one thing --
Seabiscuit ran an awfully game race that day."</TE>
<TE>   Seabiscuit and Kayak were owned by Charles S. Howard, who'd made
his fortune selling Buicks, and trained by Silent Tom Smith, a
laconic, savvy horseman who had gone from wrangling to the track. In
1940, the 7-year-old Seabiscuit and the 5-year-old Kayak II were
coupled in the betting, which meant that a $2 win bet on the entry
paid $3.40, regardless of which horse won the $121,650 race. But
Ralph E. Shaffer, a professor emeritus in history at Cal Poly Pomona
who recently researched the race, said there had been reports that
Howard, known to bet large amounts on his horses, had placed a
substantial future-book bet on Seabiscuit at Caliente, where the
horses weren't coupled. To cash that bet in Mexico, Howard would have
needed Seabiscuit to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come across any rumors of such a wager," said Laura
Hillenbrand, who spent four years assiduously researching her book.</TE>
<TE>   It bothers Shaffer, though, that Hillenbrand, in print, didn't
explore the possibility of Kayak's winning the race.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand said, "I actually put a fairly long section on it in
my early drafts of the manuscript but ended up cutting it at the
suggestion of those who read the drafts. Raising the issue
necessitated a great deal of explanation, right at the end of the
story, and to devote several paragraphs to speculation on something I
think was extremely unlikely -- and which generated interest only
briefly -- would have shifted the narrative focus away from what was
much more important: Seabiscuit delivered a historic performance....
I didn't want to take the focus off of Seabiscuit's accomplishment
for the sake of belaboring a minor issue."</TE>
<TE>   Seabiscuit had suffered two near-misses in the Santa Anita
Handicap. In 1937, his reputation ahead of him, Seabiscuit carried
only 114 pounds but couldn't last as Rosemont, carrying 124 pounds,
beat Howard's horse by a nose. In 1938, they piled 130 pounds on
Seabiscuit, and with George Woolf riding instead of the injured
Pollard, he was nosed out again, this time by the 3-year-old
Stagehand, who had won the Santa Anita Derby only two weeks before.</TE>
<TE>   Seabiscuit's 2:01 1/5 time in 1940 was not only a Santa Anita
record, though, it was the second-fastest 1 1/4 miles ever run in the
U.S. The only one faster, 2:00 4/5, had been run by Sarazen 16 years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Seabiscuit's 1940 race, Paul Lowry of The Times
wrote that Haas had told friends that Kayak was the best horse in the
race. In 1995, Lowry's son, Biff Lowry, wrote that Kayak "hovered
protectively in second place, ready to take over if Seabiscuit had
faltered."</TE>
<TE>   In his 1985 article, McDonald said that Haas "always vigorously
denied he eased up on his mount to let his stablemate win."</TE>
<TE>   Dante doesn't doubt what Haas said, but he questions the late
jockey's sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   "If he let Seabiscuit win without riding his own horse all the
way, what else is he going to say?" Dante said. "It was to Charlie
Howard's considerable advantage that Seabiscuit win. Seabiscuit was
thought to have a big stud career ahead of him, and a win in the
Santa Anita Handicap was bound to help his [breeding] fee."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond dispute is that the jockeys, Haas and Pollard, "saved,"
which meant they split their commissions from the purse money earned
by both horses. The front-end money for Seabiscuit was $86,650 and
Kayak earned $20,000 for second. At 10%, Haas and Pollard took home
about $5,300 apiece. "Saving" might be a questionable practice, but
it was tolerated by racing authorities for decades, and was still
being done by several jockeys as recently as the 1980s. Because
"saving" was so widespread during Seabiscuit's era, Haas and
Pollard's pre-race deal would only amount to circumstantial evidence
in any Seabiscuit-versus-Kayak debate.</TE>
<TE>   Another pre-race development was Howard's going to the stewards on
race day and "declaring to win" with Seabiscuit.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Howard was saying that if the race came down to
his two horses -- as it did -- Kayak might be held back so Seabiscuit
could win.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring to win with a two-horse entry seems quaint now, but at
the time it was not uncommon. Leonard Dorfman, an 80-year-old Santa
Anita trainer who saw the 1940 Big 'Cap, was once moved to tears by a
sensational Seabiscuit race. Dorfman remembers hearing Joe Hernandez,
the track announcer, telling the crowd before the race that Howard
had "declared to win" with Seabiscuit.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorfman doesn't believe Haas let up with Kayak. He thinks
Seabiscuit won on the up and up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a bunch of bull that [Haas] pulled up his horse,"
Dorfman said. "Tom Smith said before the race that he had Seabiscuit
as good as he'd ever been, and he was right."</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the race, Smith had worked Seabiscuit and Kayak
in company. Running a mile, Seabiscuit put his stablemate away.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Pollard was on one of the horses, and I've forgotten what
jockey was on the other," said the late Alfred Shelhamer, a former
jockey who'd become a steward, in a 1978 interview. "But anyway, they
broke the two horses off at the finish line and worked an easy mile.
The time, I don't think, makes any difference. The horses ran like a
team until they hit the head of the stretch, and about the eighth
pole, Seabiscuit pulled off from Kayak. Kayak quit. He pinned his
ears. Tom Smith said that Seabiscuit broke Kayak's heart right
there."</TE>
<TE>   Shelhamer never rode Seabiscuit, but in the San Antonio Handicap,
a prep race for the 1940 Big 'Cap, he rode Kayak. Getting a
four-pound break in the weights, Seabiscuit won by 2 1/2 lengths as
Kayak finished second.</TE>
<TE>   Shelhamer spent many years in the stewards' stand with Pete
Pedersen and the late Hubert Jones, another retired rider. Jones'
father had worked with Charlie Howard's cattle and saddle horses for
15 years and Hubert Jones, besides breaking many of Seabiscuit's
yearlings at the Howard ranch, 135 miles north of San Francisco, also
herded cattle with Seabiscuit after the horse was retired.</TE>
<TE>   "Shelly and Hubert were extremely close to the Seabiscuit people,"
said Pedersen, still a steward at Santa Anita. "They were the kind of
guys who I think would have said something about that Kayak business
if they had known, and you would think they would have been in a
position to know. But over a lot of years, rubbing elbows with them a
lot of days, I never heard one word from either Shelly or Hubert
about Kayak not being allowed to win."</TE>
<TE>   For owner Howard, the cloud over Seabiscuit's Big 'Cap win
wouldn't go away. In 1949-50 he raced Noor, an Irish-bred who beat a
fading Citation four times. The first time was in February of 1950 --
Noor at 110 pounds, Citation carrying 132 -- in the Santa Anita
Handicap. A frail Howard, who would die about three months later,
trudged to the press box high above the track to accept
congratulations and answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Noor might become another Seabiscuit, Howard stiffened
and said, "Sir, there will never be another Seabiscuit."</TE>
<TE>   That sent the interview into another direction, and Howard was
asked once more if Kayak could have beaten Seabiscuit in the 1940 Big
'Cap.</TE>
<TE>   "Kayak," Howard said, "never saw the day when he could beat
Seabiscuit doing anything -- at any distance, at any track."</TE>
<TE>   Both Dorfman and Hillenbrand point out that although Kayak, who
was 13th and last after the first half-mile, made up a lot of ground
with a stunning move, it is folly to assume that he could have kept
running and passed his stablemate.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, Kayak passed all those other horses as if they were tied to
a fence," Dorfman said. "People in the grandstand might have thought
he was about to pass Seabiscuit too. But you had to know Seabiscuit.
A lot of horses ran up to him and then couldn't get by. This would
have been another one of those days."</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand found a quote from Pollard: "It may have seemed that
[Kayak could have passed Seabiscuit], but you have to ride Seabiscuit
to know him. No horse is ever going to pass him, once he gets to the
top [of the stretch] and the wire is in sight. He's just too game. A
horse racing alongside him just makes him run all the harder."</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand also found evidence that Howard, trying to clear the
air once and for all, took Haas aside and asked the jockey to level
with him.</TE>
<TE>   "The race is over, and I don't care what you tell me, but I need
to know," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hillenbrand, Haas flatly told Howard that Kayak could
not have beaten Seabiscuit that day.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know, will we?" said Noble Threewitt, still training
at 91 at Santa Anita. "I was there, and I just think that Seabiscuit
was the best horse. All the rest of it has just been gossip over the
years. One thing we can be sure of, though: the job Tom Smith did
with the horse. He took a cripple and won the Santa Anita Handicap.
That had to be the best training job of all-time."</TE>

<HD>Chargers Not Goofing Off About Moving to L.A.</HD>

<LD>We would have had Michael Vick, the Kobe Bryant of the NFL, playing
here every week in our backyard if they hadn't given him to Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   But that's our team for you, owned by a couple of Goofs, and every
time ESPN shows another incredible Vick highlight, you might want to
get upset with the Chargers -- it'll be good practice when they begin
play here in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, the Chargers are coming, and here's how it's going
to unfold:</LD>
<TE>   * The Chargers, given 60 days to trigger an escape clause in their
Qualcomm Stadium lease beginning Dec. 1, will do so Jan. 27, the day
after the Super Bowl has been played in San Diego. (You might be
familiar with escape clauses: The Rams used one to vacate Anaheim
Stadium and go to St. Louis.)</TE>
<TE>   * The city of San Diego and the Chargers -- per agreement -- will
have 90 days to come to terms on a new stadium, which won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   * That brings us to around May 1, and for the next 18 months the
Chargers will be free to shop elsewhere for a stadium deal, which
will be show-and-beg time for the Rose Bowl, Coliseum and Avenger
owner Casey Wasserman, who is interested in building a downtown
football stadium near Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   * The prediction here is the Chargers won't wait 18 months, but
only until the 2003 season is over -- the last year they're obligated
to play in Qualcomm. Then they will come to terms on a new stadium in
Los Angeles -- giving San Diego 60 days to match a stadium offer or
say goodbye. A new stadium in L.A., of course, is going to be filled
with hundreds of luxury suites set at a high corporate price, which
will be prohibitive to match in a small market such as San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers will leave San Diego, move into their Carson training
camp facility, which they are already contracted to begin using this
summer, and will kick off the 2004 season here -- in a temporary site
such as the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   * I presume, knowing Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's sense of humor,
the NFL will pit the Raiders against the Los Angeles Chargers in the
2004 opener -- the first NFL contest to be played here in 10 years. I
wonder if it will be a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALEX &amp; DEAN, the Spanos Goofs, who own the Chargers, are
interested only in finding a new playpen for their team. It doesn't
matter if that playpen remains in San Diego or is placed in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The escape clause in their Qualcomm Stadium lease is going to give
them that leverage -- pitting San Diego's insecurity against Los
Angeles' promise of lots of luxury suites and the NFL's overriding
desire to have a team and new Super Bowl stadium again in the
entertainment capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the NFL made it clear recently it has an interest in
placing a Super Bowl here in 2008 -- a Super Bowl that would fall
into the hands of the Spanos Goofs to help market the sale of suites
and premium seats in a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the NFL hooked up John Moag, point man in the Browns'
move from Cleveland to Baltimore, with the Rose Bowl folks fighting
for survival.</TE>
<TE>   And that is why Wasserman bears watching. In addition to being a
close friend of Roger Goodell, the NFL's No. 2 in command and
considered by most the leading candidate to replace Tagliabue some
day, Wasserman has taken a leadership role in expanding the Arena
Football League, which is doing business now with several influential
NFL owners.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman also has aligned himself with billionaire supermarket
magnate Ron Burkle. (I wish the Grocery Store Bagger had thought of
that.) The pair had been rumored to be interested in buying the
32-story Transamerica Center in South Park and surrounding land with
the intent of building a new football stadium there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have looked at it," Wasserman confirmed Tuesday. "Are we
buying it? We're not buying it today. We clearly believe that's the
best site for a football stadium, but some of the land down there is
owned by [Philip] Anschutz, some by Transamerica, some by people
you've never heard of. But that's why we've looked into buying the
Trans-am building. I don't think anything will happen, though, for a
couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers will begin looking for a new home in a couple of
months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NFL has had a fascination with Burkle, or maybe it's Burkle's
bank account, for several years. The league considers Wasserman and
Burkle a dynamic duo capable of winning political support here, while
also taking on an ownership piece of a team. The NFL also likes
anyone here who makes no mention of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Now the more successful the Chargers are this season, the more
difficult it's going to be for city political leaders to let the team
go. The last time the team went to the Super Bowl, the city not only
renovated Qualcomm, but agreed to guarantee sellouts for 10 years,
which so far has cost taxpayers more than $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers are tied for first, but will collapse and miss the
playoffs. Tampa Bay will play Miami in the Super Bowl (remember, I'm
a professional -- don't try this at home), and the next day the
hand-wringing will begin when the Chargers make it official they
might be leaving.</TE>
<TE>   They'll play the 2003 season in San Diego, but no one will know
for sure if they're staying or going while negotiations continue for
a new stadium, the suspense and bids building, and ultimately the
Spanos Goofs emerging the big winners.</TE>
<TE>   It'd be nice to make them pay for not bringing Vick with them when
they come here, but with one fewer game on TV once they arrive, I
know who's going to pay once again.</TE>

<LD>Fifty of the world's 203 national teams, including 15 of the top 20
on FIFA's worldwide rankings, are playing this week. Four countries
already have done so, and 46 others play today.</LD>
<LD>   The United States defeated El Salvador, 2-0, Sunday, a result that
will do no harm to its No. 10 ranking. As Coach Bruce Arena said, the
new-look American squad "played some good soccer at times."</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, South Africa and Senegal played to a 1-1 tie at
Johannesburg.</LD>
<TE>   Of today's 23 games, a handful are of particular interest. Here
they are, with the team's ranking in parentheses:</TE>
<TE>   Japan (26)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Argentina (5)</TE>
<TE>   Japan will be without its coach, Zico, who flew to Brazil on
Sunday after the death of his mother in Rio de Janeiro the day
before. Masakuni Yamamoto, Zico's assistant, will be in charge for
the game at Saitama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot think of football at a time like this," former World
Cup standout Zico said before leaving. "Right now, I have to be with
my family. Everything I achieved in football and in life is thanks to
my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina will be without the services of two of its most gifted
midfielders, Pablo Aimar of Valencia and Juan Roman Riquelme of
Barcelona, who were injured while playing in Spain's La Liga over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea (20)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Brazil (1)</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, which said this week that it is looking for a
European coach to take charge of the team by March, will be bidding
farewell to two retiring veterans: striker Hwang Sun-Hong, who scored
50 goals in 102 games during a 14-year national team career, and
Galaxy-bound defender Hong Myng-Bo, who will be playing his 135th and
last game for South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil comes into the game at Seoul as world champion and with
most of its top names.</TE>
<TE>   Germany (4)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Netherlands (9)</TE>
<TE>   German Coach Rudi Voeller has stuck with the squad that finished
second to Brazil at the World Cup, but injuries have caused him to
call in four players who were not at Korea/Japan '02: Hertha Berlin
defender Arne Friedrich, Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Hanno Balitsch,
and forwards Fredi Bobic of Hanover 96 and Paul Freier of VfL Bochum.</TE>
<TE>   For Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat, today's game is a chance to show
that the Netherlands belonged in the World Cup although it failed to
qualify, and is also a legitimate challenger for the European
Championship in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Italy (11)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Turkey (8)</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to shake up his under-performing team and also
preserve his job, Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni included seven
players on his 23-man roster who have never played for the national
team.</TE>
<TE>   Against a team as powerful as Turkey, it could be a move that
backfires, even at Pescara, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey Coach Senol Gunes, who led his team to a surprise
third-place finish at the World Cup, is using the game as preparation
for a key Euro 2004 qualifier against England in April.</TE>
<TE>   France (2)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Yugoslavia (15)</TE>
<TE>   Former world champion France's post-World Cup revival faces its
first real test when the physically powerful and technically gifted
Yugoslavs come calling at Saint-Denis, outside Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jacques Santini's plans have been upset because playmaker
Zinedine Zidane pulled out with a back injury and temperamental
Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka rejected a call to replace
injured forward Sydney Govou. Anelka now faces a ban from FIFA
because of it.</TE>

<HD>Solheim Cup at Augusta?</HD>
<DH>Holding women's event at home of the Masters is suggested
as a way to quiet the debate over female membership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire and Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the hope of extending an olive branch into the divisive debate
over the absence of female members at Augusta National Golf Club,
John A. Solheim, whose parents founded the international women's golf
competition known as the Solheim Cup, has suggested playing the event
at the club.</LD>
<LD>   No one at Augusta National would comment on the idea, but insiders
suggested that it might be something chairman Hootie Johnson would
consider, if he were convinced it would provide a way out of the
conflict over female membership.</LD>
<LD>   In a prepared statement, Solheim, the chairman and chief executive
of Ping Golf, the company created by his father, Karsten Solheim,
said, "It's always been my dream to hold the Solheim Cup at Augusta
National. There is always a right time for everything."</LD>
<TE>   Since 1934, the Masters tournament has been the only professional
event held at Augusta National. The Solheim Cup, considered the
women's equivalent of the Ryder Cup, is biennial match-play
competition between teams from the U.S. and European professional
tours. It has been played since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be wonderful to have a women's tournament there,
because Augusta is one of the truly great American golf courses, and
it was designed to showcase all of golf -- men's, women's, seniors,"
said Amy Alcott, a 1999 hall-of-fame inductee from Pacific Palisades
who won 29 LPGA Tour events.</TE>
<TE>   With the next Solheim Cup date in the United States already
secured -- the 2005 event will be at Crooked Stick Golf Club in
Carmel, Ind. -- and the 2007 event scheduled for Europe, the earliest
the Solheim Cup could be played at Augusta National is 2009.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have most staunchly criticized Johnson said their calls
for female membership would not be muted, even if it were announced
before next year's Masters that Augusta National would host the 2009
Solheim Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice delayed is justice denied," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
who last week promised to organize a massive picket-line protest
outside Augusta National during Masters week next April if the club
didn't halt what he termed "gender apartheid."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, agreed that the far-off date probably dooms the
Solheim Cup scenario as a solution to the Augusta National membership
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm sorry," Burk said. "It's a start, but if they're going to
do it then, why not do it now? Seven years from now, girls in high
school will be out of college and probably still can't be a member at
Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   "A Solheim Cup [at Augusta National] would be insufficient. It
would be a nice gesture, but only in conjunction with opening the
club."</TE>
<TE>   Since June, Burk and the NCWO have waged a campaign to pressure
Johnson and Augusta National to admit a woman as a member before the
2003 Masters. Last week, Johnson reiterated that there is no
timetable for inviting a woman to join the club.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said anything less than the addition of a female member
was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Hootie should join the spirit of the times," Jackson said. "You
can't be a little bit right on this issue, just like you can't be a
little bit pregnant."</TE>
<TE>   Alcott refused to comment on the female membership debate, but
said she would aspire to serve as the U.S. team captain if the
Solheim Cup were ever played at Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   LPGA Commissioner Ty Votaw said he could not comment on the
Solheim Cup possibility, pending his state-of-the-tour message to be
delivered today at the Tyco/ADT Championship in West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>

<LD>Improvement, or continued incompetence? A week after UCLA lost its
first men's basketball exhibition by 24 points, the Bruins played
another collection of former college players more closely, losing,
70-64, to EA Sports on Tuesday night at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   EA Sports was 0-12 and had lost the previous four nights,
including 118-79 to Georgia on Monday. But the Bruins were no match
for a team led by former Arizona forward Bennett Davison (18 points)
and former Santa Clara guard Brian Jones (17).</LD>
<LD>   UCLA forward Jason Kapono did not play because of a sprained right
thumb. Senior guard Ray Young scored 26 points to lead the Bruins,
who shot 39.6%. "I'm discouraged, we played poorly and we have a
long, long way to go," Coach Steve Lavin said. "We've made
incremental progress [since the first loss]. But we are not going to
become a well-oiled machine in a week."</LD>

<LD>Stan Kurman, 85, died last week, and for Bruin fullback Pat Norton,
the hype surrounding the game against USC was pierced by a jolt of
perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Norton had rented a room for the last year from Kurman. A car
struck Kurman while he was crossing a street in Santa Monica en route
to an aerobics class Nov. 13.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the healthiest man I knew," Norton said. "He inspired me."</LD>
<TE>   Kurman, a UCLA basketball season-ticket holder for the last 34
years, took Norton to games. They also played everything from chess
to poker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cool to come home and have him there," Norton said. "If I
needed to talk to somebody, he always had great advice."</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, Kurman operated Needham Book Finders, a store on
Westwood Boulevard specializing in out-of-print books.</TE>
<TE>   His son-in-law, Marc Wade, introduced him to Norton, who had dated
Wade's daughter in high school. They hit it off immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "When Pat would tell his friends he was living with a senior, he
really meant a senior," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   A service will be held Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Fairmont Miramar
Hotel in Santa Monica. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to
the special collections department of the UCLA library.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson followed a shaky Monday practice with a strong
performance Tuesday. The freshman quarterback said that taking three
days off affected his timing with receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt more comfortable today," he said. "Timing is a huge thing.
We took the Friday through Sunday off and you can't come back right
away and have it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Theotis Brown, No. 7 on the all-time Bruin rushing list, will
attend the game because his son, Theotis Brown III, is taking an
official visit to UCLA. The younger Brown, a defensive back from
Shawnee Mission, Kan., committed to the Bruins last week.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Among Olympic Picks</HD>

qualifying tournament next year and 2004 Athens Games.</DH>

<LD>The Lakers' Phil Jackson is among four NBA coaches nominated to lead
the U.S. men's basketball team through an Olympic qualifying
tournament next summer and, if successful, at the 2004 Athens Games
-- but there's a catch.</LD>
<LD>   USA Basketball officials said Tuesday they hadn't spoken to
Jackson about the job, for which Philadelphia's Larry Brown, Utah's
Jerry Sloan and Miami's Pat Riley are also being considered. And
whoever accepts the challenge of restoring the luster tarnished by
the U.S. men's sixth-place finish at the World Championship in
September must agree to several conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Among the terms are possibly extending the pre-Olympic training
period, having the team stay in the Olympic village at Athens, and
adjusting strategy to the international game, which includes more
perimeter play and less post play.</LD>
<TE>   "Many of the international teams field teams that train together
for years, often under one coach and similar philosophy," said Stu
Jackson, chairman of USA Basketball's senior men's national team
committee. "Our players seem to be better one-on-one talented
players, but unable as a collection to overcome the team part that
international teams bring to these competitions."</TE>
<TE>   Stu Jackson said a coach would be chosen by the end of the month.
Three assistants, one from the NBA and two from the college ranks,
will be named early next year.</TE>
<TE>   They will have a core group of eight or nine players who will be
chosen by late December and will commit to playing in the qualifying
tournament and the Olympics. Two or three players will be added by
February but won't be guaranteed Olympic spots.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining three or four "will come from a variety of
constituencies," Stu Jackson said, among them U.S. and European pro
leagues. Trials might be set up to choose a college player or two.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Jackson said USA Basketball had "reached out" to Kobe Bryant
but had so far received no response. He added that he hadn't spoken
to Shaquille O'Neal, who expressed interest in playing only if Phil
Jackson were the coach, but said O'Neal might be invited regardless
of the coaching choice.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not be a factor," Stu Jackson said. "Our objective here
is simply to gain a commitment from the coach we feel would be best
suited to get the gold medal back."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady, Tim Duncan, Ray Allen and Jason Kidd have contacted
him and agreed to play in the qualifying and Olympic tournaments, Stu
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certain both Kobe and Shaq are going to be candidates," he
added. "We're committed to getting our very best players. Hopefully,
both will eventually participate if they both are selected."</TE>
<TE>   Stu Jackson acknowledged that the rest of the world had caught up
to the U.S. men, but said he believes they can regain supremacy.</TE>
<TE>   "USA Basketball will continue to attempt to enlist the very best
players possible and formulate the best team possible to take into
these competitions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Jernstedt, president of USA Basketball, said the decision to
house the men's team in the Olympic village stemmed from security
concerns, although building camaraderie was also a factor. The men's
team stayed at posh hotels in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, Atlanta in
1996 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Fresh Off Upset Victory, Trojans Get Bigger Test</HD>

<LD>The road upset over then 19th-ranked Colorado State didn't vault USC
into the top 25 this week.</LD>
<LD>   But it did get the attention of fourth-ranked Kansas State, which
plays host to the Trojans tonight in the semifinals of the preseason
WNIT.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm impressed with any team that could go into Colorado State and
win, which is a very tough place to play," Wildcat Coach Deb
Patterson said. "To gut out a last-second win there shows toughness
and character."</LD>
<TE>   It also showed the Trojans (2-0) that this season can be better
than last season because the Trojans are more versatile.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't yet put two good halves together," USC Coach Chris
Gobrecht said. "But what has been good is we realize even if we may
not play our best we can win if we keep our heads on. We have enough
weapons that someone will step up."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game, however, will be a much tougher challenge for the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats (2-0), who defeated Ball State and Georgia Tech in
the WNIT, may be relatively young with a starting lineup of four
sophomores and a junior. But they are returning four starters from
last season's 26-8 team that finished third in the Big 12 and reached
the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State boasts a potent center in 6-foot-4 junior Nicole
Ohide, who has averaged 19 points and 11 rebounds in the two games.</TE>
<TE>   USC has made only 39% of its field-goal attempts this season
(including 17.4% from three-point range) which helps to account for
its 61 points per game average. But the defense is good, allowing
only 56.5 points.</TE>

<HD>Senior Bowl Sends Invitation to Fargas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running back Justin Fargas received an invitation Tuesday to
participate in the Senior Bowl all-star game, an indication that the
fifth-year senior's recent performances have caught the attention of
NFL scouts.</LD>
<LD>   The Senior Bowl, which will be played Jan. 18 in Mobile, Ala.,
annually attracts NFL scouts, coaches and general managers.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to make a big deal about it because there are more
important things at hand," Fargas said. "We have two more games and a
bowl game.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad to be in a position to earn the chance."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas sat out the 1999 season at Michigan because of injury and
missed last season because of NCAA transfer rules. He was No. 1 on
the depth chart at tailback coming out of spring practice but was
slowed during fall training camp because of a hamstring strain.</TE>
<TE>   He made his first start against Oregon on Oct. 26 and rushed for a
career-best 139 yards against the Ducks. He gained 125 yards last
week against Arizona State and enters Saturday's game against No. 25
UCLA with 432 yards and four touchdowns in 105 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC has taken extra security measures this week to prevent
unwanted visitors from viewing practice, but USC Coach Pete Carroll
made light of the situation before the workout began when he directed
players to look toward the roof of a 10-story building near Howard
Jones Field.</TE>
<TE>   A member of USC's equipment staff appeared to be wrestling with an
intruder on the rooftop. Moments later, what turned out to be a
stuffed figure wearing a blue and yellow T-shirt fell to a ledge
below.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we got it on film. I'm anxious to see what happened,"
Carroll said. "This is a great week and this is fantastic to be part
of this whole thing. We want to have as much fun with it as we can
and work really hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Mike Williams said he received treatment for his sore
left quadriceps and that he would be ready for Saturday's game.</TE>

<HD>Vargas Faces Suspension, Fine for Using Steroids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- Members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, set to
rule today on disciplinary action against boxer Fernando Vargas for
steroid use, appear to favor by a narrow majority a lenient penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas, who will face the five commissioners at a hearing today,
is expected to be suspended and fined for using the androgenic
anabolic steroid stanozolol before his September match against Oscar
De La Hoya. But if the commissioners are in a lenient mood, that
suspension could be for six months or less, perhaps even retroactive
to the fight. That would leave Vargas three months to serve, a period
in which he wasn't going to fight.</LD>
<LD>   At the crux of the issue is confusion over the current status of
Nevada's ban on steroids for boxers and others engaged in licensed
combat. A memorandum on the ban issued July 1 of this year states,
"This is not a period of amnesty. Steroids have never been an
approved drug or injection. Rather, there will be a period of
leniency until Dec. 31, 2002. This time frame will give all
competitors who may currently be under the influence of steroids time
to be completely free of steroids."</LD>
<TE>   Luther Mack, chairman of the commission, doesn't feel punishment
should be different in this six-month period. Commissioner Edwin
"Flip" Homansky, a former ringside physician, feels education of
fighters on the dangers of steroids is more important over this six
months.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to set the record straight," Mack said, "that steroids
will not be tolerated. I don't see this as an advisory period at all.
I see this as something the commission cannot condone. We must let
the world know it will not be tolerated. I think you'll be surprised
to see how things go."</TE>
<TE>   Homansky was emphatic that no agreement has been made by the
commissioners, no decisions have been made and that he would not
comment on the specifics of the Vargas case.</TE>
<TE>   "Steroids are a major problem in our sport," he said. "Our main
goal in the six-month period is the education of the fighters and
that continues to be my goal."</TE>
<TE>   A urine test, administered to Vargas after he lost to De La Hoya
by technical knockout, came up positive for steroids. At first,
Vargas demanded additional testing.</TE>
<TE>   He subsequently sent a letter to the commission pleading
ignorance, claiming he was given the steroids without his knowledge
by others in his camp. The two indicated are strength and
conditioning coach John Philbin and nutritionist Mazzan Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Philbin, who resigned after the fight, has vehemently denied his
involvement in a letter to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "With a guy like that [Ali] around," Philbin said by phone
Wednesday, "nothing surprises me. I did not assume Fernando was
taking steroids at the time, I was shocked. As much as Fernando hates
to lose, I do not think he would knowingly jeopardize the biggest
fight of life. This guy [Ali] came in and disrupted my entire karma."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by the commission to get a response from Ali had failed
as of Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Vargas knew what he was ingesting will not be the
determining factor in Mack's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have an accountant who gives you the wrong information,"
Mack said, "he's not going to jail. You are. That's a lame excuse by
Fernando and I'm not sure it's something we will consider. He knew
what he was doing. That's not something you buy over the counter."</TE>

<HD>Walker-Williams Deal Is Almost Set</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Colorado Rockies put together their second big trade within a
week, agreeing Tuesday to a tentative deal that would send Larry
Walker to Arizona for Matt Williams and three other players</LD>
<LD>   Arizona also would send first baseman Erubiel Durazo, outfielder
David Dellucci and reliever Bret Prinz to Colorado for the 1997
National League most valuable player.</LD>
<LD>   Walker and Williams, both five-time All-Stars, must waive no-trade
clauses for the deal to be completed. Diamondback owner Jerry
Colangelo said the teams were granted a 72-hour window Tuesday to
finalize the swap.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the Rockies completed a complicated deal that sent
left-hander Mike Hampton to Florida for catcher Charles Johnson. The
Marlins then traded Hampton to Atlanta for $30 million and two
pitchers.</TE>
