<HD>Genocide haunts and connects them</HD>
<DH>Atom Egoyan plumbs Armenian history to tell the tale of
'Ararat.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as Steven Spielberg reached a point at which he was prepared to
tackle the Holocaust, in which some of his own relatives lost their
lives, with "Schindler's List," Canada's boldly idiosyncratic Atom
Egoyan became ready to deal in his own way, in his audacious
"Ararat," with the less well-remembered genocide of his own ancestral
people.</LD>
<LD>   In 1915, the Turks attempted to eradicate Armenians from their
Anatolian homelands in East Turkey through massive forced marches to
the deserts of what is now Syria, resulting in the deaths of more
than two-thirds of the Armenian population -- well more than 1
million fatalities. Death came through starvation, dehydration and
disease or by rape, brutality and outright massacre. To this day, the
Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that with the advent of
World War I a well-orchestrated plan to exterminate the Armenian
population of Ottoman Turkey ever took place.</LD>
<TE>   "Ararat" is, first of all, a triumph of strategy. To depict the
massacre, Egoyan decided upon the distancing device of a
film-within-a-film. That film is directed by a famous Armenian
director, Edward Saroyan (Charles Aznavour), from a script by a
screenwriter of Armenian descent (Eric Bogosian) working from "An
American Physician in Turkey," a 1917 memoir by missionary Clarence
Ussher, a survivor of the Siege of Van. When Saroyan and Bogosian's
Rouben attend a lecture given by Toronto art historian Ani (Arsinee
Khanjian) on the celebrated Armenian emigre painter Arshile Gorky,
they see an opportunity to work the artist into their plot, as Gorky,
born Vosdanig Manoog Adoian, was a survivor of the genocide that cost
his mother her life. They then persuade the reluctant Ani to serve as
a historical consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "Ararat's" key figure is Ani's 18-year-old son, Raffi (newcomer
David Alpay), who has been moved to go to Turkey with his video
camera to make a film diary of the ruins of his ancestral homeland.
Returning home, he is held up at length in customs by an implacable
official (Christopher Plummer) on his last day of work before
retiring. Egoyan's plot is complicated, thickly populated, with its
characters more closely connected to each other than they will ever
know. Plummer's David is having difficulty accepting his son's gay
relationship. David faces even greater challenges on the home front,
torn between his love for his mother and for his half-sister, Celia
(Marie-Josee Croze), who is obsessed by her belief that Ani is
responsible for her father's death and is determined to force Ani to
acknowledge it.</TE>
<TE>   Egoyan interweaves the strands of his plots and themes so tightly
that the elusive yet haunting presence of the genocide hovers over
everything while he explores the complexities of redemption and
forgiveness, the parent-child relationship, the relationship between
art and reality, and the moral imperative to remember the past.
Egoyan covers all this territory and more with aplomb and clarity.
The controlled passion that reverberates throughout the film sustains
stretches of crucial yet inevitably didactic commentary in regard to
the genocide, as well as the increasingly erratic behavior of Celia,
who carries on like a vengeful heroine of Greek tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting of the film-within-the film, on location and sound
stages in Canada, becomes an ironic commentary on the compromises of
commercial filmmaking, which Egoyan himself has successfully resisted
his entire career. We learn that Saroyan has been considered passe
for 20 years, and the sequences we see from his film are well staged
but conventional. Yet at some points the line between an event's
re-creation for film and the event itself blurs, catching us up in
the terrible immediacy of the genocide. At other times, the
film-within-the-film seems so lurid and hackneyed that it is
impossible to imagine it can be very good. While wanting to honor his
Armenian heritage, Rouben comes across as a nervous hack, swift to
rationalize "artistic license."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Egoyan's oblique, layered attack ultimately pays off, evoking
a strong emotional connection between past and present, the
historical and the personal, in a flowing, cinematic manner in
collaboration with his frequent cameraman, Paul Sarossy. The film
makes use of an intoxicating array of Armenian music.</TE>
<TE>   It's no exaggeration to say that Egoyan challenges his cast, with
the regal Khanjian embodying the enduring spirit of Armenia. Other
key players include Brent Carver as David's son Philip, Elias Koteas
as Philip's actor lover, Bruce Greenwood as the actor cast as Ussher
and Simon Abkarian as the tormented Gorky. "Ararat" makes
considerable demands of the audience but richly rewards those
prepared to go the distance.</TE>

<HD>Grand 'Bank Ban' is positively operatic</HD>
<DH>A Hungarian legend is stirring in its translation to the
screen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Bank Ban," regarded as the most important musical drama of Hungary's
national cultural heritage, has at last reached the screen in all its
grandeur in a textbook example of how to turn an opera into a film in
a manner in which the two art forms complement instead of canceling
out each other.</LD>
<LD>   To accomplish this, Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond
was lured back to his homeland, which he fled in 1956 during the
Hungarian uprising, to shoot his first feature ever in Hungary.
Zsigmond teamed with first-time director Csaba Kael and screenwriter
Gabor Meszoly, who adapted Jozsef Katona's play, which in turn
inspired the 1852 Ferenc Erkel opera with its libretto by Beni
Egressy. "Bank Ban" the opera has never before been filmed, but
Katona's play was filmed in 1914 by Mihaly Kertesz, who in 1926
became Warner Bros.' legendary Michael Curtiz, director of
"Casablanca" and other Hollywood classics.</LD>
<LD>   So much for the heavy-on-the-accents pedigree of the opera, based
on 13th century legend. With actual early Gothic castles and
unspoiled countryside as its settings, the filmmakers respect the
solemn majesty of the opera, but Zsigmond, shooting in muted color,
brings to it a remarkable fluidity and cinematic grace. The
filmmakers furthermore take the opportunity, in the opera's move from
stage to screen, to reveal considerable psychological complexity in
the characters.</LD>
<TE>   The word "ban," a long-ago discarded term designating noble rank,
in this instance refers to the status of Bank (Atilla Kiss B.) as
viceroy of Hungary. It is 1213, and Endre II (Kolos Kovats) is off
fighting foreign wars, leaving his beloved Queen Gertrud (Eva Marton,
who possesses a shrewd and commanding presence). Gertrud is Meranian
rather than Magyar and wastes no time in moving her countrymen into
positions of power.</TE>
<TE>   While off traveling through the countryside to ascertain the
condition and needs of the people, Bank has left his beautiful,
adored young wife Melinda (Andrea Rost) in the care of the court as a
lady-in-waiting to the queen. As Bank is discovering widespread
famine and oppression, the honorable and faithful Melinda is finding
herself at the mercy of Gertrud's younger brother, Prince Otto of
Meran (Denes Gulyas). His passionate pursuit of Melinda is encouraged
by Gertrud, who also pressures Melinda to submit to her brother's
advances.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers respect the heady 19th century melodrama inherent
in the material yet enrich it in revealing the conflict in Otto
between love and lust. Similarly, Bank himself is conflicted as a man
who takes honor and duty seriously and thus is slow to believe the
worst about Gertrud.</TE>
<TE>   It would take an opera expert to judge the merits of "Bank Ban"
and its renowned singers. But to the layman Erkel's music soars, and
the singers' voices sound glorious. Erkel's emotion-charged music has
been compared to that of middle-period Verdi, and "Bank Ban" is an
altogether stirring experience in an inspired meld of the visual and
the aural.</TE>
<TE>   Erkel and Egressy wrote the opera at a time when Hungary was under
the domination of the Hapsburgs, and given the country's turbulent
history, it is clear why "Bank Ban," as a fervent protest of foreign
occupation and an equally impassioned expression of national pride,
resonates so strongly with the Hungarian people to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, "Bank Ban" became the subject of heated
parliamentary debate last year as one of a series of state-supported
productions intended to celebrate Hungarian history and culture at a
time when so many Hungarian filmmakers, in the post-Communist era,
are struggling to survive. While it is highly unlikely that "Bank
Ban" will reach a wide audience in the U.S., it certainly looks as if
every cent of the film's reported $2.6-million budget is on the
screen.</TE>

<LD>Rory &amp; Ita''Rory &amp; Ita'</LD>
<LD>   By Roddy Doyle</LD>
<LD>   Viking: 338 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rory Doyle is one of the funniest men on Earth, but who would ever
know if his novelist son Roddy hadn't written "Rory &amp; Ita"? The
younger Doyle is best known for his fiction about the Irish, most
recently "A Star Called Henry" (1998), based on the Easter Uprising
of 1916.</TE>
<TE>   In "Rory &amp; Ita," Doyle goes straight to the facts in what is,
among other things, a portrait of life in Ireland from about 1930 on.
His parents are the eyewitnesses; in alternating chapters, Rory and
Ita do all the talking. Readers must be patient with this
arrangement. No dramatic action or engaging insight by a narrator
opens the story or leads us to suggest larger concerns or themes.
Instead, Rory and Ita tell stories about their lives, spent in tandem
for most of their 70-some years. The effect is gradual but
cumulative. Toward the end of their account, it is delightfully clear
that Doyle has captured the Essence of Irish and bottled it at the
source.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle explains his plan in a preface. "The book is about my
parents, about the people they were before they became my parents,"
he writes. His only inserts are to help clarify new developments in
their stories. "Her father had married again," he tells us in a
chapter in which Ita recalls what life was like after the age of 3,
when her mother died. Pearl, Ita's stepmother, enters the scene. A
woman of secrets and silences, Pearl has a drinking problem although
Ita rarely sees her drink. (What Irish family doesn't have its
secrets?)</TE>
<TE>   From the early pages it is clear that these are working-class
Irish, born in Terenure, on the outskirts of Dublin. Rory's family
moved to nearby Tallaght when he was a little boy. It seems there are
no "only" children in Irish stories. Ita is one of three children,
Rory is one of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Their earliest memories breathe-in their Catholic tradition as
naturally as air. Rory's parents rented the family house from the
Dominican nuns. Sunday Mass and a home altar to the Blessed Mother
Mary are part of life. Like many of his stories, he recalls one about
the altar as if it were a docile vignette.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary done up for the May
altar," he begins. "A beautiful lace veil put on it and flowers and
all and a candle carefully burning. And Aileen it was [one of his
sisters] came along and messed with the thing and the veil caught
fire. The lace was ablaze, and the screeching and roaring." Aunt Lil
rushes in and tosses a bucket of water at the trouble. "She put out
the fire and drenched the whole lot of us."</TE>
<TE>   This is Irish storytelling refined to a satin finish. The live-in
relatives, the Catholic faith, the children left to their own
devices, the lurking calamity; plenty of Irish Americans who have
never set foot on the Emerald Isle are likely to recognize the home
life Rory recalls.</TE>
<TE>   They are well-educated, these ordinary folks. Ita went to the
nuns, Rory to the Christian Brothers. "There was Mother Madeleine;
she taught us English," Ita recalls. "She was lovely -- she was tall
and slim and very gentle." English, French, religion, literature.
School life for Ita was a social gathering. She left at 18 to take a
job as a secretary. Rory was more interested in academics. The
Brothers raised him on Latin, Gaelic poetry, English literature, all
of these committed to memory. After high school, he got a job as an
apprentice printer and made a career of it. Their memories of World
War II are uniquely Irish. They refer to the war as "The Emergency"
-- an oblique reference similar to "The Troubles," which is a
euphemism for the current struggle for independence in the North. Ita
recalls taking a black pen to the holes in her black stockings, but
she says that rations were more a threat than a reality. Rory was far
more involved in the struggles of the Fianna Fial, the Irish
political party he joined before the age of 20, following his
father's lead.</TE>
<TE>   Courtship got off to a rocky start for the Doyles. They give
details with a he said/she said difference of opinion, with
unmistakably romantic feelings. "I liked the look of her," Rory
begins about the Sunday night dance where he first saw Ita. "So I
headed in that direction and eventually ended up beside her. I asked
her up to dance." Pretty sure of himself, it seems.</TE>
<TE>   "The earth did not move," she corrects him. He'd been drinking:
"He was on his way to footloose." She decided to dance once, but no
more. "I didn't like him one bit, I thought." That changed at the
next dance. Then came the bicycle rides, the family tea, the
Christmas Eve engagement, the sisters-in-law to help sew the wedding
clothes, a reception crowded with women because men didn't attend
such affairs. And, finally, the first house.</TE>
<TE>   "I was prepared to live in a tent," Rory explains. "Ita said she'd
like a bungalow. Well, as far as I was concerned if she'd said she
wanted Aras An Uachtarain,(the President's house) good, I'd go after
it." (From what I know of Irish men, they all think alike on this
point.)</TE>
<TE>   They had five children, including one who lived for only about 24
hours. Ita, who marks time according to the people closest to her at
a given time, recalls friends and relatives offering to help. Rory,
whose memories are physical and visceral, describes the infant's
funeral. It is a boy, named after his father. Rory carries the small,
white coffin to the cemetery. "A profoundly sad experience," he says.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of their account about life together so far, we readers
can almost hear Rory and Ita breathing in unison. We can also see
which talents from her, which from him, were passed on to their
writer son. Light-handed humor, an acceptance of people as they are,
a way with words, all belong to Roddy Doyle now. He is grateful. "As
for the parenting," he writes in his preface, "the teacher in me
gives my mother and father eight out of ten, but is it too late to
add, 'Making good progress'?"</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One San Bernardino afternoon, Walter Ohlinger (Raymond J. Barry)
invites over his neighbor, an unemployed cameraman named Ron
Kobeleski (Dylan Haggerty), and drops the bomb that he was the second
gunman in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Incredulous, Ron
nonetheless keeps his video camera running, first out of curiosity,
then out of mounting self-interest. (He has a wife, a kid and a house
to keep going, along with a decrepit sense of self to repair.)</LD>
<LD>   The more footage the cameraman shoots, the more deeply he buys
into his neighbor's story, which he traces from a bank vault, where
Walter brandishes a gun shell, to the grassy Dallas knoll where the
alleged sniper walks Ron through the past, narrating the execution
with geometric precision.</LD>
<LD>   Shot in hand-held digital video, "Interview With the Assassin" is
another faux documentary about the power of suggestion. The film was
written and directed by newcomer Neil Burger, who uses the JFK
assassination and its aftermath to score a few points about how our
culture of fear dovetails with our obsession with surveillance. Ron
wants to believe what he sees, but it may be that he's just seeing
what he believes, a distinction that takes on a perversely comic bent
when he and his wife scrutinize some home-video images for intruders,
turning the blurred pictures into their very own Zapruder footage.</LD>
<TE>   Burger knows how to shoot and this is one feature where the dingy
digital imagery arguably makes sense, but it's too bad he didn't work
harder at finding something more original with which to test his
talent than the JFK assassination and the gimmick of the phony
nonfiction film. The smartest move he makes is to keep his sights
tightly focused on Barry's bristling paranoia. Whether softening his
military cadences with a touch of the South or shimmying down the
outside wall of a motel, the veteran character actor goes a long way
toward padding what is a clever if fundamentally minor conceit. His
homespun menace keeps you watching.</TE>

<HD>'Half Past Dead' is way past dreadful</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>A threadbare retread of Steven Seagal's "Under Siege," the
unfortunately named "Half Past Dead" again finds the actor's stock
character, an enigmatic slab with an exotic name (here, car thief
Sascha Petrosevitch) called on to single-handedly right a world gone
wrong. Except that this time, surrounded by the sort of young black
talent that's meant to furnish white guys a patina of cool, and all
but obscured by strategically darkened rooms, oblique angles and long
shots, Seagal ends up being less of an action hero than simply
missing in action.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after the FBI nabs Sascha and his cohort (rapper Ja Rule),
the two are sent to the "new" Alcatraz, where they're promptly swept
up in violent intrigue. The day the pair lands on the Rock, a heavily
armed gang storms the prison in hopes of extracting lucrative
information from a condemned prisoner. Snapping and swirling their
black dusters like witchy woman Stevie Nicks, the crew is led by a
prison insider (Morris Chestnut, in regulation goatee and shaved
head), who divides his time baiting a female judge and leading his
crew back and forth over the same three sets, sometimes in slow
motion.</LD>
<TE>   Working from his own script, director Don Michael Paul (who also
wrote "Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man") has made the sort of
mindless trash-action picture that ends up going straight to video in
this country and clogging foreign screens. Absent one original moment
and bathed in de rigueur steel blue punctuated by sporadic bursts of
flaming orange, the movie is notable only for its creative approach
to Seagal's bulky gracelessness: Not since "Apocalypse Now" has a
film gone to such lengths to hide what its star looks like.</TE>
<TE>   -- Manohla Dargis</TE>
<TE>   "Half Past Dead" Rated PG-13 for pervasive action violence,
language and some sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>A welcome if belated debut for Andre Watts</HD>
<DH>The pianist makes his Pacific Symphony bow with an
expressive Brahms concerto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before our eyes and ears, Andre Watts has gone from being a
prodigious youngster to, at 57, an almost-elder American musical
statesman. He has become a pianistic icon and expert in his repertory
-- Schubert and the Austrian-German composers, mostly -- step by
step, over the decades.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night, Watts made a belated Pacific Symphony debut in
Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. With the
solid and sensitive collaboration of conductor Carl St.Clair and this
accomplished orchestra, he played Brahms' D-minor Piano Concerto in a
performance at once vehement, tender and controlled.</LD>
<LD>   This was Brahms at his most expressive. Watts and his colleagues
gave us the composer in all his aspects -- Brahms the angry
saber-rattler, Brahms the lovesick youth, Brahms the playful bear,
Brahms the world-weary traveler. This was a reading remarkable in its
breadth and comprehensiveness, passionate and mellow, technically
unassailable, powerful and touching. The audience responded to Watts'
playing with a spontaneous standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   The wonder of the evening was that its second half did not prove
anticlimactic. St.Clair and his players gave the same care and
detailing to a contrasting but equally powerful piece, Prokofiev's
massive and beloved Fifth Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   This was a highly polished reading, effortlessly balanced, tight
in its continuity. The conductor paced it astutely and the
instrumentalists gave it articulate attention and unflagging energy.</TE>

<HD>Scratching their backs</HD>
<DH>Commercial radio outlets advertise sister stations owned by
the same parent company; public stations are also now
cross-promoting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seems like Radio 101: Once you have a listener, you don't go
suggesting that he or she tune into another station.</LD>
<LD>   In commercial radio, more listeners means higher ratings, which
increases advertising revenue. And in public radio, more listeners
means more potential financial donors.</LD>
<LD>   But during news programs on KCRW-FM (89.9), you'll hear
promotional spots touting the jazz on KKJZ-FM (88.1), or the
classical music on KUSC-FM (91.5), while those stations push some of
the news programming on KCRW.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very bullish on cross-promotion," said Ruth Seymour, KCRW
general manager. "The idea to do it is that people would discover the
station who didn't know it before. The more you do, every little bit
adds up."</TE>
<TE>   In an environment of ever-increasing ownership consolidation, the
tactic is more obvious for stations that are part of the same chain.
For example, Clear Channel Communications, which owns eight stations
in the Los Angeles market, tells listeners on its FM music channels
to get headlines from its news-talk outlet KFI-AM (640). The practice
evolved from Sept. 11, 2001, when the FM stations aired KFI news
reports on the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That went really well, and what we started to do after that was
cross-promote all the radio stations," said Bill Lewis, director of
AM marketing for Clear Channel-Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   So now they'll promote big concerts sponsored by their corporate
siblings, and suggest sampling other music styles. "Very rarely will
someone be a single-station listener," he said. "We just want to make
sure you listen to stations that are part of the Clear Channel
cluster."</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis said stations with similar offerings and audiences --
such as adult contemporaries KBIG-FM (104.3) and KOST-FM (103.5) --
won't be scratching each other's back.</TE>
<TE>   Such is also the reasoning behind public-station promotions. KKJZ
and KUSC don't air the National Public Radio newsmagazines "Morning
Edition" and "All Things Considered," and Seymour said she wants to
drive listeners to those programs on KCRW.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the two big programs they do not carry, and we wanted
to establish that in their listeners' minds," she said, adding that
they're also promoting Warren Olney's KCRW shows "Which Way, L.A.?"
and "To the Point."</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to promote the same thing on another station,"
Seymour said, noting, for example, that KPCC-FM (89.3) isn't in the
arrangement because it airs "Morning Edition" and "All Things
Considered" about the same time as KCRW does. And though KCRW airs
music, the eclectic playlist is very different from what's heard on
KKJZ and KUSC.</TE>
<TE>   But KKJZ and KUSC aren't promoting each other, because there's
little overlap in the jazz and classical audiences, said Brenda
Barnes, KUSC president and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We see people leaving our station and looking for news. We're not
going to offer news, so it makes sense to send them to KCRW," Barnes
said. "My own staff had questions about it at the beginning. My basic
view of it is, people do have eclectic tastes. Letting them know what
else is out there isn't a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Seymour said promotions are ingrained in the culture at KCRW,
which has done them with Laemmle Theatres for 15 years. KCRW also
works with public television's KCET, and others. The arrangement with
KUSC has gone on about two years, Seymour said, while KKJZ has been
involved about a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we share an audience," she said. "None of us is doing it
out of charity, or even love -- even though we like each other. We're
doing it because it's the smart thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Letterman now on radio too</TE>
<TE>   In his 20 years on late-night television, David Letterman has
occasionally closed his program by thanking the audience for watching
and adding, "If you're driving home ... for heaven's sake, turn off
the television!" But now motorists can safely catch the CBS program,
since "The Late Show With David Letterman" began simulcasting on
radio this week. The Infinity radio network, which shares with CBS
the corporate parent Viacom, began airing the program Monday on 15
stations nationwide, including KLSX-FM (97.1), where it's heard
weeknights from 11:35 p.m. until 12:37 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday's program, Letterman -- who got his start in radio in
his Indianapolis hometown -- shot fireworks from the roof and joked
about the limited potential of enjoying them via radio. On Tuesday,
his list of "Top Ten Things People Said While Listening to 'The Late
Show' on the Radio Last Night" included, "Something must be wrong....
I don't hear anyone laughing," "It's like watching TV with your eyes
closed!" and "If Marconi were here right now, I'd hit him with my
car."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spanish-language ratings adjustment</TE>
<TE>   What Spanish-language broadcasters called an alarming discrepancy
in the most recent ratings -- in which numbers for almost every
station in the genre plummeted during the summer quarter -- may be
addressed by a change that the Arbitron ratings service announced
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The highest-rated Spanish station, KSCA-FM (101.9), fell from
second place in the spring to eighth in the summer, with its share of
the overall audience dropping from 4.7% to 3.2%. Other broadcasters
saw similar declines. Station owners blamed the figures on a
lower-than-normal number of primary Spanish speakers being included
in the survey. Arbitron had the same ratio of Latinos in the survey
as usual, but the company included more English speakers, who then
listened to more English-language stations.</TE>
<TE>   After a meeting Tuesday in Los Angeles with Spanish-language
broadcasters, Arbitron announced that it will begin using language
preference as a variable to weigh future ratings, to further
determine whether Latinos participating in the survey favor English
or Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "We see there's a connection between the language preference of
Hispanics and their radio listening," said Thom Mocarsky, Arbitron's
vice president of communications, saying the company has looked at
the phenomenon for years. "The summer [ratings] book itself was not
the sole impetus." He didn't have a timeline for the change, however.</TE>

<HD>Vietnam heartbreak</HD>
<DH>Heidi Bub had high expectations when she returned home
after 22 years. So did the documentary team that accompanied her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andre Chautard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When documentarians Gail Dolgin and Vicente Franco traveled to Da
Nang, Vietnam, with Tennessee-raised Heidi Bub to film her reunion
with her birth mother -- who sent 7-year-old Heidi to the United
States at the end of the Vietnam War -- they thought they would be
documenting a joyful experience.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Dolgin and Franco watched as the weeklong visit in 1997
ended in an emotionally charged family meeting where cross-cultural
misunderstandings and misgauged expectations led to a meltdown for
Heidi. The filmmakers were then faced with the tough decision of
whether to keep the camera rolling.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very difficult moment for us," Dolgin says. "We felt
torn between extending ourselves with great compassion and comfort,
and continuing to film the story that we had begun."</LD>
<TE>   They chose to stay true to their commitment to the truth. "We're
not out to gain glory by filming somebody's tragedy," Dolgin says,
but she hopes that by filming what actually happened the documentary
provides audiences "something we can all grow from, learn from, heal
from."</TE>
<TE>   The resulting film, "Daughter From Danang," won the Grand Jury
Prize for best documentary at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The
critically acclaimed film opens in Los Angeles today exclusively at
the Nuart and will air in April on PBS.</TE>
<TE>   "Daughter From Danang" grew out of a casual conversation Dolgin
had with her journalist friend Tran Tuong Nhu, who had recently made
a trip to Vietnam to deliver a letter from Heidi to her birth mother,
Mai Tai Kim. Heidi had been searching for her mother for several
years when Nhu located her in the southern city of Da Nang.</TE>
<TE>   Kim had feared that her Amerasian daughter, the progeny of an
affair with an American naval officer at the military base where Kim
once worked, would face danger when the war ended. Kim placed Heidi
on a plane to America as part of "Operation Babylift" -- authorized
by President Ford weeks before the fall of Saigon in 1975 -- which
brought 2,000 Vietnamese "orphans" (many had living parents) to San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing an extraordinary story, Dolgin and Franco approached
Heidi, asking to document her journey, and scrambled in six weeks to
raise enough funds to cover their travel expenses. They met
face-to-face with perky Heidi only the day before the flight, and
Heidi was eager to share in detail her history of being raised in
small town Pulaski, Tenn., where she says she became "101%
Americanized." Nhu easily secured the cooperation of Heidi's
Vietnamese relatives, and Kim was filled with pride and excitement
that her daughter was returning.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi, whose husband could not accompany her on the trip,
gradually became overwhelmed by the intensity of meeting her
long-lost birth mother and three half-siblings, as well as the
culture shock and economic conditions in the city outskirts where
they were living, and being away from her own two young daughters.
When the relatives finally made a request for financial assistance --
by many accounts customary in Vietnamese culture of family members
living abroad -- Heidi broke down in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't able to understand that for her family, asking for the
money didn't mean that the love they were feeling for her was reduced
in any way," Dolgin says. In addition, Heidi, who was still feeling
the pain of estrangement from her adoptive single mother, was not
prepared to be obligated to relatives with whom she'd had no contact
in 22 years. Upon her return to the United States, Heidi "felt that
she had exposed herself so emotionally and wasn't sure she wanted us
to continue and share this profound, emotional vulnerability with the
world," Dolgin says.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers put together for Heidi a 17-minute rough cut that
included the most emotional scenes and told her they would abandon
the project and give her the footage if that's what she wanted.
Although she felt embarrassed by her behavior and thought others
would judge her harshly, Heidi encouraged them to proceed. She told
the filmmakers that the project was helping her reexamine the trip
and to "put all the pieces of the puzzle that had been floating
around in my life together into one cohesive picture," Dolgin says.</TE>
<TE>   Dolgin and Franco sent Heidi a copy of the film as soon as it was
completed, and Heidi couldn't bring herself to watch it. After they
called with the news of the Sundance award, she promised them she
would. Weeks later she finally did, and she said to them, "It's a
very powerful film. It's a good film. I just wish it wasn't about
me."</TE>
<TE>   "Daughter From Danang" was shot with one mini-DV camera by the
bare-bones crew of Dolgin, Franco and a sound operator, to be as
inconspicuous as possible. Dolgin and Franco, longtime working
partners who first met at a film festival in Havana and co-directed
the 1993 documentary "Cuba Va: The Challenge of the Next Generation,"
say the final budget was around $350,000, not including a lot of
donated equipment and time.</TE>
<TE>   The response from audiences at film festivals has been very
divided, both to Heidi and to how noble or solicitous the Vietnamese
family is portrayed, even among Vietnamese American viewers. Some
people have revised their opinion upon a second viewing, according to
the filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Nhu brought a tape of the film to Heidi's relatives in Vietnam
this summer. "It gave them an understanding of what kind of
upbringing [Heidi] had" and how that informed Heidi's reaction,
Franco says. Nhu also brought a short letter from Heidi, her first
correspondence to her family since the visit.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, [Heidi] is unable to get to the point at which she feels
comfortable with her own past, with the trip and with the results of
it," Franco says. "We like to believe that the journey will continue
and, hopefully, it will be a positive continuation from the damage
that was," Dolgin adds.</TE>
<TE>   Nhu also brought some money to the Vietnamese family sent by
Dolgin and Franco, and Kim told Nhu she would use some of it to buy a
telephone. Notes Dolgin: "She said she's going to sit by the phone
and hope that someday it will ring and she'll answer it and she'll
hear a voice say, 'Hello, mother.' "</TE>

<HD>Reunion and Hurt in 'Daughter'</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proverb about being careful what you wish for because it just
might come true has rarely had such a poignant, unsettling
illustration as it does in the affecting documentary "Daughter From
Danang."</LD>
<LD>   "Daughter" begins with the happy expectation of a dream come true:
29-year-old Heidi Bub, born Mai Thi Hiep, is going to go back to Da
Nang, Vietnam, to be reunited with a mother she hasn't seen in 22
years. "It's going to be so healing for both of us to see each
other," she says. "It'll make all those bad memories go away." At
least that is the plan.</LD>
<LD>   How Hiep became Heidi with a Southern accent, how she was turned
into someone she calls "101% American," is a cautionary tale all by
itself. With her soldier father gone and her mother fearful of having
a mixed-race child once the North Vietnamese took over, 7-year-old
Hiep was sent to the U.S. as part of a program called "Operation
Babylift" that was supposedly intended for orphans.</LD>
<TE>   Adopted by a single mother in Pulaski, Tenn., Heidi had a sadder
childhood than anyone knew. Her new mother, who is not interviewed,
was more possessive than warm and apparently abusive as well, leading
to a permanent split between the women and causing the already
insecure Heidi to wonder what she had done to lose the affection of
not one but two mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Daughter From Danang's" co-directors, Gail Dolgin and Vicente
Franco, formed a strong rapport with Heidi and, when her trip back to
Da Nang began to unravel, the filmmakers were there to take it all
in.</TE>
<TE>   For it turns out to be not so simple to reunite with a virtual
stranger from another world who, into the bargain, is your mother.
The gulf that had grown between parent and child was much greater
than either side anticipated and, with different cultures leading to
different expectations, a storybook experience was not going to
materialize. Heidi's pre-trip worry that "we're going to hurt
someone's feelings" turned out to be true all the way around.</TE>

<HD>Funk Brothers: in 'Shadows' spotlight</HD>
<DH>Anecdotes and tales of exploitation at founder Berry
Gordy's Motown song factory highlight a film about the invisible
session musicians behind the studio's hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where did the love go? According to the eager-to-please documentary
"Standing in the Shadows of Motown," when Berry Gordy moved his
company to Los Angeles the love remained in Detroit. Three decades
after the music entrepreneur split Motortown, the love continues to
tenderly envelop the studio musicians who call themselves the Funk
Brothers and whom Gordy unceremoniously left behind.</LD>
<LD>   Musicians like Joe Hunter, a keyboardist who joined Motown at its
launch. Seen playing piano in a Michigan bar, a tip jar roosting on
the instrument's glossy surface, Hunter quickly plumbs the depths of
the Funk Brothers' heartbreak story in a few words: "When the dust
cleared, it was all over and we realized that we were being left out
of the dream."</LD>
<TE>   Hunter is vague about the shape of that dream and whether he means
his hopes or Gordy's ambitions remains unexplained. What we do learn
from this cautiously worded film is that at the close of the 1950s --
what narrator Andre Braugher calls the "days of American innocence"
-- a pool of talented jazz and R&amp;B men began playing for Motown,
furnishing the studio's heart and backbeat. The producer had been
searching for a way to break out of the confines of "race music" and
into the rock 'n' roll mainstream, and with the Motown sound he
succeeded, spectacularly. His multiracial lineup, culled from every
smoky club corner in Detroit and beyond, spent hours, days and
finally years shut up in the company's small recording studio
(nicknamed "the snakepit"), churning out hits that white and black
kids would take into their boomer twilight.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Motown stars were born
and created, launched on the bass lines and guitar licks put down by
the Funk Brothers. The hits crowded the Billboard charts (the
company's nickname was "Hitsville, U.S.A.") and the Supremes landed
on Ed Sullivan -- but back in the snakepit, the Funk Brothers were
earning $10 a song. You wouldn't know it from the documentary, but it
wasn't necessarily easy or lucrative for the name-brand talent
pouring their souls and dreams into the microphones, either. In her
autobiography, "Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme," Mary Wilson
revealed that the smash girl group was paid a 3% royalty rate that
had to be divided among the singers, estimating that a
million-selling single would have personally earned her all of about
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gordy maintained a famously tight hold over his talent. He kept
the musicians under exclusive contract, demanding that they not play
for anyone else. They in turn ignored Gordy's edict and secretly
played for whoever would pay, occasionally touring the country and
even England. The music industry is notoriously exploitative, but
Motown seemed in a class of its own: The studio actually paid some of
the Funk Brothers to spy on one another (they pocketed the money and
laughed); the overworked musicians, meanwhile, took to hiding from
the boss in a nearby funeral parlor. Even as the rest of the industry
began listing studio musicians' names on album covers, these brothers
remained invisible men.</TE>
<TE>   "Standing in the Shadows of Motown" gives the Funk Brothers their
due and more, mostly through wonderfully juicy anecdotes. The film,
which takes its name and inspiration from co-producer Allan Slutsky's
1989 book about bassist James Jamerson, is a blast into the past, but
as with many nostalgic trips it's also shrouded in mist. The awkward,
almost embarrassed way in which director Paul Justman, as well as
writers Walter Dallas and Ntozake Shange, deal with race is
unfortunate, as is the tendency toward overstatement. Early on, Steve
Jordan, who arranged two numbers Bootsy Collins sings in the film,
says of the Motown hits, "anybody could have sung them. You could
have had Deputy Dawg singing some of the stuff." You understand the
sentiment, but as the majority of the contemporary renditions
produced specifically for the documentary makes clear (even
Collins'), it's also untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Collins slides into the groove of his two numbers (the shocking
pink ostrich hat helps), as do Gerald Levert and Meshell Ndegeocello,
who eases into "Cloud Nine" as if she'd been born there. And while
Joan Osborne's version of "Heat Wave" shows off her throaty vocals,
her Janis Joplin-esque rendition of "What Becomes of the
Brokenhearted" is at odds with the sort of confluence at which Motown
excelled, in which vocals and instruments were equal partners.
Osborne at least seems eager to prove her chops to the Funk Brothers,
who accompany all the singers, but not so Ben Harper, whose version
of "Ain't Too Proud to Beg" lacks the Temptations' silky insinuation.
It isn't only that he doesn't come across as a man who would ask
(much less beg) a woman to stay with him, it's that his vibe is
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, however, gets at the singularity of the Motown sound than
the film's closing number, which brings together Montell Jordan and
Chaka Khan for a duet of Marvin Gaye's 1971 masterpiece "What's Going
On," the title song from one of the first Motown albums to carry the
studio musicians' names. Seated on a stage, with the Funk Brothers
bobbing around them, Jordan and Kahn, who seems to have dropped in
from another planet, croon Gaye's anguished, politically charged
lyrics without an ounce of soul, passion or conviction.</TE>
<TE>   It's a disappointing finish to this entertaining but glib
documentary and nearly as surreal as the blessing that Gordy has
bequeathed on the film and its subjects.</TE>
<TE>   He claims to be thrilled to see the Funk Brothers receive their
"long overdue recognition." Better late than never.</TE>

<HD>Schwarzenegger backs re-release of 'Pumping Iron'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger encouraged the director of "Pumping Iron," the
documentary that launched him in Hollywood 25 years ago, to
re-release it unedited -- including a marijuana-smoking scene.</LD>
<LD>   "I would refuse to wipe out that record or change it or alter it
because of image's sake," Schwarzenegger said this week. "That would
not be true to the filmmaker."</LD>
<LD>   George Butler's critically acclaimed 1977 documentary follows
Schwarzenegger as he prepares to defend his Mr. Olympia title against
fellow bodybuilders including Lou Ferrigno.</LD>
<TE>   A digitally enhanced version of "Pumping Iron," repackaged with
previously unseen footage and interviews with actors and athletes
influenced by Schwarzenegger, debuts at 8 tonight on Cinemax.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding after winning the
competition and began to build a movie career, including "Conan the
Barbarian" (1982) and the breakthrough "The Terminator" (1984).</TE>

<HD>Lessons grounded in reality</HD>
<DH>Hands-on experience gives architecture students a deeper
appreciation for their art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Eastman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Ross is at the center of an academic movement that honors the
hands-on tradition of Arts and Crafts architects, welds the goals of
those who design a house with those who build it and offers
real-world experience to new grads stepping into the workforce. Yet
to hear him tell it, he just has a weird job.</LD>
<LD>   As a caretaker of a remote 12-acre site in San Luis Obispo, the
23-year-old shoos away tryst-seekers, mows wild grass and even fixes
the public restroom. His compensation is free rent in a fishbowl
house that straddles a mostly dry creek bed and gets poor TV
reception.</LD>
<LD>   A good gig? Ask him and he'll tell you he's hoping to stay as long
as he can; there's a two-year limit because of heavy interest in the
glass-walled house with views of a nighttime sky full of stars and a
brilliant orange "smiley face" sun each morning.</LD>
<TE>   Poet? Naturalist? No. Ross is an architecture student at Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo and one of two caretakers of a canyon in the hills on
campus where undergrads have been designing and building full-size
shelters for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   About the size of Disneyland's Tomorrowland, the Experimental
Building Facility site in Poly Canyon makes this state university
unique: It's the only campus with an expansive outdoor lab dedicated
to student projects, and its longtime emphasis on letting "paper
architects" experience the real joys and woes of seeing their ideas
succeed or fail from the ground up is being adopted by other schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a trio of Cal Poly students set their drafting tools
aside and assembled a stretched-fabric shelter that looks like a
handkerchief floating in the breeze. The 20-foot-tall tensile tent is
next to the first experiment, a geodesic dome inspired by Buckminster
Fuller's visit to the campus and moved to Poly Canyon in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   The sloping land is dotted with buildings aptly nicknamed Shell,
Stick, Spider and Pole. Ross' Bridge House, which was built in 1968
of then-uncommon Corten steel struts and solar-reflective glass, is
within sight of the Underground House, a stucco mound that is only
partly buried and is often called Alien because its projecting light
shafts resemble antennas.</TE>
<TE>   Some parts of the canyon look like graveyards scattered with the
skeletons of incomplete or failed projects; says one professor,
"Thank goodness they learned those lessons there and not in your
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A movement is born</TE>
<TE>   The practical approach of bringing together everyone involved in
an architectural project from the conceptual stage through
construction didn't have a name when Cal Poly and a few other schools
started teaching it decades ago. But it's now called "design/build,"
and there are books, magazines and professional firms that specialize
in it.</TE>
<TE>   Schools, which have treated architecture and construction as
distinct fields since the 19th century, now see the merits of
orienting students early to real-world collaborations. Design/build
programs were offered at 10 architectural schools a decade ago, and
at least 40 schools have since embraced the movement, says William J.
Carpenter, author of "Learning by Building: Design and Construction
in Architectural Education." (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1997).</TE>
<TE>   A few colleges -- notably the Rural Studio associated with Auburn
University in Alabama, and the Yale School of Architecture -- have
long-established design/build programs in which students create
solutions to community needs, from low-cost housing to libraries.
Students are given a project to design, an off-campus site to build
it on, a budget and a client. They then get their hands calloused and
their fingers smashed working alongside the construction crew.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk to students about the value of a nail, but it
doesn't mean much," says George Elvin, assistant professor in the
school of architecture at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, which has a two-acre plot on campus for
experiments. "But when they pound two pieces of wood together and see
how hard it is to take it apart, they understand the sheer strength
of the nail."</TE>
<TE>   Without design/build, he says, architecture students think the
world "is like 'Sim City,' and they get to be the god of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly's College of Architecture and Environmental Design has
the luxury of acres of campus space as well as 1,839 students
enrolled in five related disciplines: architecture, architectural
engineering, landscape, construction management, and city and
regional planning.</TE>
<TE>   A requirement for graduation at this polytechnic university, as
with the one in Pomona, is a senior project. Students earn credits by
working for design firms, contributing to community projects such as
Habitat for Humanity and sketching renderings for hoped-for clients.</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, some have taken on more ambitious projects
that have them scrounging for donations and working well past
graduation: They build modern structures in Poly Canyon, a spot so
rural that confused cows bump against the student-installed glass
windows and walls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Street signs become shingles</TE>
<TE>   Discarded, discounted and donated materials make up most of the 40
permanent structures in the canyon. The blocky Modular house, where
the second caretaker, Seth Pare-Mayer, makes his home, is shingled in
old street signs, and the teak floor in the living room is crafted
from inch-wide slats used in patio umbrellas.The newest structure was
built for less than $600 out of pocket, with the building team
receiving more than $9,000 in cash and $10,000 in PVC-coated
polyester roof fabric, turnbuckles and other materials. It's
impossible to estimate how much time was given by students and
faculty in the design and construction departments, as well as
outside professionals.</TE>
<TE>   This year's team selected a tensile structure because every piece
is necessary -- no ornamentation or frills here -- and yet it's an
elegant form. Architectural engineering graduate Kieran Kelly-Sneed,
architecture student Royce Chow and landscape architecture graduate
Theresa Zaro spent a school year making models, planning the
construction process and enduring the heat of the welding torch to
make three precisely angled steel poles. Along the way, there were
adjustments and compromises -- exactly what those working in the
industry experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the easy way, but it's the real way," says K. Richard
Zweifel, Cal Poly's interim dean of architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Ross was enrolled at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa when he
heard about the projects in Poly Canyon. Each spring, Cal Poly hosts
Design Village, for which a few hundred community college students
bring portable shelters into the canyon for a weekend of judging
based on design, craftsmanship and cost.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 the theme was "Disaster Relief," and Ross and seven
teammates created a floatable shelter made from marine foam and
plumbing pipes, with bunk beds cobbled together from plastic pipes
and chicken wire. They won the People's Choice award, voted by the
other 14 teams and visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Ross transferred to Cal Poly and lived his first year in a
120-year-old Victorian in downtown San Luis Obispo, where he didn't
make a single improvement. Since moving into the 1,000-square-foot
Bridge House three months ago, he has been a working example of the
university's learn-by-doing philosophy, in which students dig deeper
to understand concepts if they see a direct benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Ross has yanked out the once-cherished linoleum and carpet, and
painted the concrete floor a dark burgundy to match the rusted Corten
steel exterior, bronze reflective windows and all-too-real earth
tones of the surrounding landscape. And by trial and error, he has
remodeled the spartan kitchen. Bottled water boiled on a barbecue and
microwaved Hot Pockets sustained him during construction. "I knew I
was home when I installed a fridge and could finally have a gallon of
Moose Tracks ice cream on hand," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Another example of putting academics to the test is coming soon:
The third-year architecture student will complete his senior project
requirement by bringing better TV reception and high-speed Internet
connections to the canyon's two occupied houses. Says the deprived
"Late Night with Conan O'Brien" fan, "I must learn how to make a
satellite."</TE>

<HD>Shanghai Ballet's precise 'Coppelia'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Fisher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Shanghai Ballet, dancing "Coppelia," made its first local
appearance at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Wednesday night,
looking beautifully schooled and just the slightest bit stern in
their pursuit of perfect placement and unison. It didn't help that
they were working with an oddly arid version of the ballet, but some
moments of beautiful dancing still managed to shine through.</LD>
<LD>   With his 1973 reworking of "Coppelia," Pierre Lacotte wanted to
get closer to the ballet's original 1870 choreography, by Arthur
Saint-Leon. Compared to more familiar "Coppelias," he appears to have
added more mime, subtracted many comic moments, and rendered group
dances more static. Petipa-influenced versions by the National Ballet
of Cuba and Inland Pacific Ballet, seen here in recent years, are
much more charming and happily kinetic.</LD>
<LD>   In the Lacotte, mime is done in rhythmic lock step, losing any
sense of naturally motivated communication. Nor is there a sense of
community in this ballet about two lovers who tease, engage in capers
and publicly celebrate their wedding. Still, Fan Xiaofeng, as
Swanhilda, and Sun Shenyi, as Franz, warmed up in their roles,
dancing with feathery precision. Her stunningly articulate legs flew
in high extensions and whipped into small flourishes; his airy leaps
and concise double turns impressed. Zhong Min made an impish Dr.
Coppelius.</LD>
<TE>   Exactitude was the byword for the various corps mazurkas and
lyrical third-act dances. When featured briefly, a male contingent
looked particularly promising, although faces often were grim all
around. A certain brightness of expression emerged during curtain
calls, and one wished that that sense of ease could have pervaded
more of the dancing presented by this clearly accomplished troupe.</TE>

<HD>Anderson Quartet reaches out</HD>
<DH>The acccomplished string musicians give concert-goers at
the Cerritos Center a little something extra.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cerritos Center's new, modestly priced Sierra Nights series has a
pronounced eclectic bent, nonchalantly mixing classical music, jazz,
cabaret and other idioms, hoping to get people to open their ears a
bit. And the chamber music representative on the schedule Wednesday
night, the Marian Anderson String Quartet -- formerly the
ensemble-in-residence at Cal State L.A. now based in Texas -- was
well-equipped to reach out to them.</LD>
<LD>   Several chamber groups now talk to their audiences as a matter of
course, but this one does that and more, holding an informal,
sometimes sassy question-and-answer session just before intermission.
The players thoroughly mined the broad humor of Haydn's notorious
"The Joke" Quartet (first violinist Marianne Henry produced gliding
effects with undisguised glee), and brought jaunty rhythms and a
touch of rambunctiousness to Dvorak's "American" Quartet.</LD>
<LD>   They trotted out an attractive rarity, a soulfully modal Adagio
movement from the Quartet No. 1 by composer-conductor
Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson that was intriguing enough to make you
wonder why they didn't play the entire quartet (there was plenty of
time available on the short program). They drew an unusually diverse
audience, in terms of ethnicity and age, for a chamber music concert.</LD>
<TE>   Their sound is grounded in the bass end, yet overall it is a
clear, classically etched blend that suited the acoustics of the
Sierra Room Theatre, which seats 330. Joining Henry, second violinist
Nicole Cherry and irrepressible violist Diedra Lawrence was a fine
new cellist, Prudence McDaniel, who produced an especially rich
rendering of the tune from the second movement of the Dvorak.</TE>

<HD>Murphy pushes envelope with his vocal pyrotechnics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writing a review of a Mark Murphy performance inevitably raises the
question of why this extraordinary vocal artist has never really
crossed over to the wider music audience. Despite a five-decade
history in which he has performed with an all-star catalog of jazz
artists, released more than 40 albums, received six Grammy
nominations and repeatedly been selected as Down Beat magazine's Male
Jazz Vocalist of the Year, Murphy's greatest acknowledgment has come
from other performers and a relatively small but fiercely loyal fan
base.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, working with pianist Tom
Garvin's trio (bassist Tom Warrington and drummer David Rokeach),
Murphy underscored the enigma of his relatively low visibility by
kicking off his set with a rhythmically charged romp through several
standards.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, his renderings included an entire catalog of vocal
sounds, falsetto head tones, chesty growls strung throughout
variations that virtually reinvented each of the songs. All of it,
from quick starts to occasional vocal cadenza finishes, was offered
with the extraordinary self-confidence of an artist who continues, at
70, to insist upon stretching the envelope of his music.</LD>
<TE>   By the middle of his set, however, Murphy nearly hit the
opening-night wall that looms before so many performers, sounding
distracted, even a bit disinterested, during a tepid version of
Milton Nascimento's "Vera Cruz" (via the English-language version,
"Empty Faces," by Lani Hall). But that was only a momentary glitch in
a program that quickly picked up speed, embracing a harmonically
intriguing interpretation of "All the Things You Are" and climaxing
with extraordinary takes on "All of You" and "I Thought About You."</TE>
<TE>   Part of Murphy's problem may trace to the fact that he does so
many vocal things so well -- driven by a rapidly flowing imagination
that takes him in a multiplicity of directions -- that he rarely
lands on a passage long enough to allow his listeners to fully
connect with him. Occasional moments in ballads, for example,
revealed his capacity for warmly intimate phrasing. But he seemed
loath to allow those moments to expand.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no denying that Murphy is one of the jazz world's
most magical performers, one of its two or three most fascinating
male vocalists, and an artist who deserves far more attention.</TE>

<HD>Savage Republic's punk art hardware still stimulates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have the members of Savage Republic ever thought that if they'd just
painted themselves blue and spat marshmallows at each other, they
might be rich and famous today?</LD>
<LD>   Way before Blue Man Group started making music with PVC tubing and
oil drums, these Los Angeles art-rockers were making similarly
powerful, rhythmic instrumentals, just with different hardware and
without the conceptual comedy.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday at the Knitting Factory, Savage Republic, reunited for
the first time in more than 13 years, showed theirs to be a more
nuanced, more sophisticated and more viscerally stimulating brand of
music than the azure upstarts'.</LD>
<TE>   With five of its six members rotating on electric guitars and
basses, anchored by martial drumming and at times extra beats banged
out on their own oil barrel, SR's majestic music evoked Pink Floyd
playing surf music, or Dick Dale jamming with German space-rockers
Neu. Mediterranean tones melded with epic sonic sweeps and, in a few
songs, poetically polemic vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps performance art renown was never in the band's destiny,
but it probably could have found success creating film scores and
multimedia campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   But then, mainstream fame never seemed a priority to them or to
the three other veteran L.A. punk-era, art-oriented acts on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Human Hands (with three original members) still offers L.A.'s
answer to early Talking Heads or XTC. The Urinals found an unlikely
middle ground between PiL and Brian Wilson, and Mike Watt's new band,
the Secondmen, finds his thundering bass complemented in intricate
compositions by organist Pete Mazich and drummer Jerry Trebotic,
showcasing new material of near-operatic scale.</TE>
<TE>   It was challenging yet approachable -- the hallmark of this night
of distinction without regard to commerce.</TE>

<HD>Sentiment, humor hit 'Home'</HD>
<DH>Natural performances from first-time actors highlight the
appealing South Korean film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeong-Hyang Lee's "The Way Home," a tale about a small boy and his
aged grandmother, has inherent sentimental appeal, but Lee balances
it with considerable humor and an unblinking eye toward the realities
of a primitive way of life. Eschewing professional actors, Lee
gambled on little Seung-Ho Yoo to play pugnacious 7-year-old Sang-woo
and on 78-year-old Eul-Boon Kim, who had never even seen a movie, to
play his grandmother. As Lee has said, she got lucky, but she also
displays skill in drawing from her stars natural portrayals that have
not a trace of self-consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   A tired, forlorn woman (Hyo-Hee Dong) arrives in a remote mountain
region on a scruffy bus with her little son in tow. With no advance
notice and few words, the mother, having trudged up a rugged
mountainside with her boy, dumps the kid on her own mother, who's
mute and bent-over with age; she has not seen or contacted her mother
since she ran off to Seoul with a local boy at age 17. He abandoned
her and their son long ago, and her little shop has failed, leaving
her in debt and unemployed. She promises her mother she'll return in
about two months, by which time she expects to have landed a job and
gotten her affairs in order.</LD>
<TE>   Sang-woo, who bears all the marks of a kid who has been
alternately neglected and indulged, understandably feels abandoned
and is hit by cultural shock -- what, no pizza, burgers or KFC? He
reacts with predictable rage and doesn't realize or care that his
grandmother, although she cannot speak, can hear him when he exclaims
to her that she's stupid. His grandmother unwaveringly responds to
this and much more bratty behavior with an unconditional love.</TE>
<TE>   The woman lives under minimalist conditions in what is little more
than a ramshackle hut clinging to the hillside. The presence of a TV,
although never seen turned on, suggests she must have some sort of
power source, but she most definitely has no plumbing. As surely
difficult and painful as it must be for her to get around, she
reveals a generous, caring nature toward others. She is a woman of
dignity, at peace with herself, and she's reached the point in life
at which it's hard to tell whether she simply accepts her lot in life
uncomplainingly or has merely become resigned to it. While we're
wondering whether she will ever have any impact on her irascible
grandson he in turns has further difficulties relating to a
neighboring girl (Kyung-Hoon Min) and boy (Eun-Kyung Yim).</TE>
<TE>   "The Way Home" is simplicity itself, and Lee is alert to the
details and incidents of everyday life to sustain the film with wryly
amusing observations and much affection, even for the boy, who after
all has been asked to go through a singularly difficult adjustment.
The first South Korean film to receive major studio distribution,
"The Way Home" is a loving little film of considerable appeal.</TE>

<HD>TV's idea of keeping it real could use a make-over itself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television continues to hemorrhage "reality" shows, hour after hour
of life so raw and ferocious that you want to take to your bed and
pull the covers over your head.</LD>
<LD>   How much more of this tenaciously gritty realism can America
handle?</LD>
<LD>   Arriving Thursday on ratings-challenged ABC, for example, is
"Extreme Makeover." That's right, pal, extreme! No half measures
here. Clamp on your seat belts and cast your peepers on a trio of
physically imperfect subjects who, we're assured, will be
reconfigured in ways that will "ultimately redirect their destinies."
Yes, their destinies!</LD>
<TE>   The hour won't be pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Think nose jobs, plus brow and under-eye lifts. Think liposuction,
a chin implant, a breast implant and -- brace yourself -- one of
those grisly tummy tucks.</TE>
<TE>   But kids, don't try this at home.</TE>
<TE>   Nor "Love by Design," the new "reality" series on Home and Garden
TV that works like this: Someone chooses a date from three prospects,
sight unseen and based solely on their home decor, and then -- in a
display of realism almost too brutal to witness -- helps redecorate
the place before the owner arrives home.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about shining a light on the human condition. Why, just the
thought of it gives me the chills.</TE>
<TE>   Get serious.</TE>
<TE>   Although symbolic of our times, the loopy "reality" mind-set is
hardly new to television. It's been more than a decade since a
psychologist called me with an idea for a series he insisted couldn't
miss. Money in the bank. A cinch. It's name? "Suicide Squad."</TE>
<TE>   Am I kidding? No more than he was kidding.</TE>
<TE>   He hadn't hammered out the details, but said he'd need only a
hotline and a fleet of TV-equipped vans for a series that would go
like this: People leaning toward taking their own lives would be
urged to call the show's counselors, who would do their best to
dissuade them. But on those occasions when they failed, well, the
show might as well salvage something from the tragedies. So call out
the vans to videotape the suicides for America's viewing enjoyment.</TE>
<TE>   "Suicide Squad" never materialized. Like many twisted visionaries,
its creator was custodian of an idea before its time.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of calling, many "reality" show wannabes now advertise
their ideas to the media via e-mail. That's how I learned of John
Surowy's proposed "Godfather Court," which he calls "comedic
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Comic something, anyway. Surowy would encourage actual civil
litigants to lie while arguing their cases before judges who would be
actors or actresses known for playing crooks on the screen,
celebrities who had run-ins with the law and convicted criminals who
had done their time.</TE>
<TE>   Who said Winona Ryder wouldn't work again?</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail that landed the loudest, though, came from Richard B.
Vasquez, who is itching to hit the airwaves with "BUMS."</TE>
<TE>   Is he on the level? Who knows. In any case, that he would even
float such an idea is a reflection of the mood in television today.</TE>
<TE>   A New Yorker, Vasquez says "BUMS" would "document the daily
struggles of homeless people" by following six people hoping to
survive harsh conditions on the streets of Manhattan for one month in
January-February.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in "BUMS," Vasquez wrote, would have no access to
"money, food, shelter, bathroom facilities or any other resource
unless ... acquired on the street." But they could beg for money to
sustain themselves, and occupy homeless shelters "if they can indeed
get in." Vasquez would let them also collect bottles and cans "to
recycle and turn into money."</TE>
<TE>   Surviving a month would earn a "bum" a cash prize. In case of more
than one survivor, Vasquez says, "a bum will gain points by sleeping
on the streets at night as opposed to a shelter, and also for
sleeping in train stations without being asked to leave by police,
and for begging larger amounts."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a plan. At last, I thought initially, here was a
"reality" proposal with some meat and social relevance. It was about
time someone chronicled the plight of the nation's homeless. Except,
it turns out, Vasquez has a tougher reality in mind. He'd have his
participants be faux homeless.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, he'd dress "everyday people" in clothes whose "worn
appearance would help them assimilate easier to street life." They'd
also get a day's worth of food, cardboard and a marker "to write
signs for begging," and a cup for the cash.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each episode, they'd be asked: "Do you want to
continue to be a bum?"</TE>
<TE>   Not liking this at all is Donald Whitehead, director of the
National Coalition for the Homeless. It was Whitehead's group that
led the fight against "Bum Fights: A Cause for Concern, Volume 1," a
notorious video showing homeless people battling each other viciously
and a "Crocodile Hunter" spinoff in which some of them are tagged
like animals in the wild and taken away in vans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that exploiting the harsh life of someone
experiencing homelessness should be part of any television program,"
Whitehead said from Washington, D.C. "Any exploitation of people's
poverty and misfortune is just outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez insisted that wouldn't be the case when I phoned him at
his Bronx home. He said he sympathized with the homeless. Which is
why, of course, he would name his series "BUMS?" Get out.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been mulling it over," he said. "It will be either 'BUMS,
'HOBO' or 'Homeless.' Vasquez envisions "BUMS" also originating from
other cities, including Los Angeles. Curious how "BUMS -- Los
Angeles" would play among those most intimate with the topic, I
informally surveyed a few of the homeless at Santa Monica's Palisades
Park. I wondered how they would respond if learning one of their
number was a pretender trying to win money on a TV show called
"BUMS."</TE>
<TE>   One man replied, "My father owned a television store, so I hate
television," then walked away. Another said: "I'm a Christian, so I'd
welcome him and shake his hand."</TE>
<TE>   I tapped someone under a blanket, but got no response. Seated
under a tree beside a man staring at the ground was a woman with an
open bible. She pointed to a page when I asked her about Vasquez's
idea, and said, smiling, "The answer's right here."</TE>
<TE>   Shuffling along was a man carrying a clear plastic bag containing
discarded soft drink cans. What about meeting up with a "BUMS"
impostor? "Kick his butt!" he replied. "Kick his butt!"</TE>
<TE>   None would be kicked in New York's "BUMS." Instead, Vasquez would
assign to each contestant a "protector bum" who would act as a
bodyguard and operate a hidden camera.</TE>
<TE>   Why not monitor real homeless people, whose stories would be more
meaningful and more interesting? "I think real homeless people
shouldn't be cast in the light that way," Vasquez said. "A lot of
them have mental problems. Besides, there is no problem for them to
live on the street. But a lot of other people will not be able to. A
New York winter is very rough."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said he'd never been homeless himself. I asked him what he
did for a living. "I'm unemployed right now," he said.</TE>

<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words on the American poster for the Mexican film "El Crimen del
Padre Amaro (The Crime of Father Amaro)" say it all: "Love. Lust.
Sin." Of the many kinds of movie love, forbidden love gives off the
greatest charge, and what could be more forbidden than the love of a
handsome young Catholic priest for a 16-year-old parishioner? You can
almost feel the College of Cardinals reaching for its collective
smelling salts.</LD>
<LD>   In Mexico, where the Catholic church has so much influence that
Martin Scorsese's "Last Temptation of Christ" was never released, "El
Crimen" caused such a sensation that both of its stars were
threatened with excommunication. Despite, or perhaps because of, the
scandal, the film prospered, becoming the country's highest-grossing
domestic film ever. Quite an accomplishment for something based on a
Portuguese novel published in 1875.</LD>
<LD>   True to its source, "El Crimen" is at its core an unapologetic
anticlerical melodrama dating from the days when the church truly
wielded power. The remarkable things about the new film, adapted by
Vicente Lenero and directed by Carlos Carrera, are how smoothly it
has been transposed to today's Mexico and how far good acting and
skillful directing have gone toward tempering those melodramatic
roots.</LD>
<TE>   The updating was probably the easiest part of that equation. The
predatory sexual nature of some priests and the resultant
ecclesiastical cover-up have been one of the major international news
stories of the past year. As to the other issues raised -- the
church's acceptance of money from drug lords, and priests
collaborating with guerrilla forces -- director Carrera told The
Times, "All of this behavior seen in the film has happened in
reality. None of this is a lie or a part of our imagination."</TE>
<TE>   So while "El Crimen's" plotting never lets us forget it's a
melodrama, the fact that the issues are real adds to our interest.
Similarly, Carrera's low-key style and the strong performances of his
cast make this a melodrama that rarely pushes its luck, that knows
enough to avoid overdoing things whenever possible</TE>
<TE>   The film's best performance, by "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and "Amores
Perros" star Gael Garcia Bernal, is in the title role. He makes Padre
Amaro into a more convincingly complex character than we might
expect, a sympathetic young man who wants to do good but finds,
almost to his own surprise, that he is too weak and too ambitious to
resist the snares of the world.</TE>
<TE>   A favorite of the local bishop, the 24-year-old, newly ordained
Padre Amaro has been sent to the small town of Los Reyes to get some
seasoning. What he, and we, gradually discover is a place mired in
all manner of corruption, down to crazed parishioner Dionisia (Luisa
Huertas) stealing from the collection plate and feeding communion
wafers to her sick cat.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil came to this town years ago," someone says. "He built
his lair here."</TE>
<TE>   The town's veteran priest, Padre Benito (Sancho Gracia), has taken
local cafe owner Sanjuanera (Angelica Aragon) as his mistress and
happily accepts money from drug kingpin Chato Aguilar to fund a
hospital he wants to build, reasoning, "Should we be choosy where
money for good comes from?"</TE>
<TE>   The only idealist within earshot is Padre Natalio (Damian
Alcazar), a follower of the liberation theology movement who works
with local peasants in the mountains and shrugs off complaints that
he is too close to rebel forces.</TE>
<TE>   The true innocent in town is the beautiful young Amelia (Ana
Claudia Talancon), Sanjuanera's devout daughter. Confusing the sacred
and the carnal, she falls hard for the handsome padre,
inappropriately reaching for his hand and telling him in confession
that she is an extremely sensual person. As my mother used to say, no
good will come of this. We may root for love conquering all, but in
the context of "El Crimen," that turns out to be a naive hope.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is hardly an advertisement for organized religion, "El
Crimen" is surprisingly adept at conveying the sense of power and
mystery the church has at its command, at showing the intensity of
belief that ritual and mysticism can inspire.</TE>
<TE>   The film is also determined to treat its characters, weak and
strong, as fallible human beings, not caricatures, and to carefully
delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges
and an institution concerned with self-preservation. "The only hell
is loneliness," Sanjuanera reminds Padre Benito.</TE>
<TE>   Replies the chastened priest, "I hope God sees it that way."</TE>

<LD>Recent photographs by Donald Blumberg, whose retrospective is
currently at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, focus on quiet
anomalies in the landscape. Subtle peculiarities in the world make a
viewer increasingly conscious of similar oddities produced by camera
vision.</LD>
<LD>   Blumberg almost always works in black and white, and every piece
in his handsome show at Jan Kesner Gallery (his first in six years)
is a luxurious gelatin silver print. The use of black and white,
given the difference from the colorful avalanche of pictures that
inundate the modern commercial landscape, has been a traditional
signal of artistic seriousness for artists of Blumberg's generation
(he's 67).</LD>
<LD>   The rural locations in England, Ireland, Scotland, Greece and New
Zealand pictured in all but three of the 27 works further isolate the
photographs from common concerns of pop culture. Blumberg moves us
away from the familiar, but his aim seems to be to make us more
conversant with the camera imagery we confront every day.</LD>
<TE>   A pair of photographs shot in Wales show a rocky outcropping that
juts into the sea -- one image taken from a distance, the other close
up -- turning your eye into a zoom lens. The close view looks oddly
monumental and imposing, the far view pastoral and bucolic.</TE>
<TE>   Boulders on a hillside in Greece mingle almost imperceptibly with
the stone foundations of a long-gone building. The ruined foundation
becomes a subtle historical memory for the clusters of houses and
other buildings glimpsed in the distance. Time telescopes.</TE>
<TE>   A magnificent waterfall cascading down a mountain slope in New
Zealand finds visual echoes in the patterns of striation on small
stones in the foreground. Solid mimics liquid. Macrocosm reverberates
against microcosm.</TE>
<TE>   Blumberg, like other conceptually oriented photographers such as
Eve Sonneman, often juxtaposes two photographs, which has the
contradictory effect of emphasizing the selectivity of the camera's
lens. The existence of things outside the frame is italicized, gently
underscoring the vastness of what has been excluded from the picture.
Cameras invent context, and Blumberg's work shows how knowing things
have been left out is often as important as seeing what's there.</TE>

<TE>   Revuelta scenes mistake truisms for content</TE>
<TE>   Last year's debut exhibition at Iturralde Gallery of Spanish
figurative artist Alfredo Garcia Revuelta was marked by a refreshing
willingness to be aesthetically plain-spoken and direct -- that is,
by a lack of ironic posing. However, his second outing demonstrates a
pitfall of that approach: Leaving something out of a work of art
doesn't answer the question of what to put in.</TE>
<TE>   Revuelta's new works are familiar homilies, which he's given the
bold, punchy, graphic look of cartoons. A cheerful blend of pop and
folk art, each of the 14 pictorial scenes is a canvas cutout whose
forms are filled in with threaded lines of brightly colored glass
beads. The artist gave his designs to craftsmen to execute (he
encountered bead workers first in Bali, later in rural Mexico), and
they performed with skill. Figures are typically outlined in black,
while the colored shapes are flat.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects are platitudes. In "Trapped by Time," five
cookie-cutter bureaucrats are held in bondage by the confining
"ropes" of enormous wristwatches. "The Friends" shows three dully
attired businessmen, their faces literally green with envy,
surreptitiously sticking knives into the back of their flamboyantly
dressed colleague, who clutches a trophy.</TE>
<TE>   In "Tree of Love" -- at more than 6 feet tall, the largest work --
young sweethearts carve a symbol of their devotion into the trunk of
a tree, whose leafy limbs coil into a tangle of knots. "Without
Comment" replays the old European Baroque theme of the eager and
uncultured rube being fleeced by a sophisticated and unscrupulous
beauty -- here, two businessmen ogle a painting of a recumbent nude,
who takes advantage of their distraction to reach out of the picture
frame and pick one man's pocket.</TE>
<TE>   The simplicity and familiarity of Revuelta's stories are undone by
his appropriation of the folk-craft technique. Not only has it been
used to more poignant effect by other artists (most notably Alighiero
Boetti); it's also hard not to be distracted by the knowledge that
the unidentified artisans doubtless create works of equal caliber on
their own. Why do they need him?</TE>
<TE>   Iturralde Gallery, 116 S. La Brea Ave., L.A., (323) 937-4267,

<TE>   Motherwell, thin but still bloated</TE>
<TE>   Robert Motherwell (1915-1991) is the most overrated painter of the
New York School. Important as a writer and editor who could put an
intellectual gloss on the radical abstractions of his more gifted
compatriots, he became their unofficial spokesman. With a pedigree of
European travels and a Stanford degree in philosophy, he was also
significant as a social bridge: Motherwell helped make the scruffy
bohemia of downtown Manhattan safe for conservative uptown
collectors. But his own repetitious paintings are pompous and thin.</TE>
<TE>   At Manny Silverman Gallery, a selection of 51 drawings, collages,
studies and mostly small paintings spans most of Motherwell's long
career, although it emphasizes his later years (only four works date
from the 1940s and 1950s, the heyday of Abstract Expressionism).
Automatism, a European Surrealist technique in which the artist
suppresses conscious control of his hand to allow the unconscious
mind to take over, assumed a boundless American scale in Motherwell's
art. It's implied even in these mostly modest examples.</TE>
<TE>   The show includes studies, drawings and other souvenirs related to
Motherwell's two most familiar bodies of work. The dark, brooding,
sexually suggestive forms of his endless series "Elegy to the Spanish
Republic" began in 1949. In the "Open" series, the lyrical expanses
of color, interrupted by a few spare lines recalling doors and
windows, date from 1967 and after.</TE>
<TE>   Color and touch are the reference points of Motherwell's work,
regardless of series. The telling juxtaposition of two tiny abstract
paintings, one from 1947 and the other from 1991 (said to be his last
work), shows superficial movement over four decades. Color gets
lighter; brushstrokes get looser. What began as a pontifical treatise
on artistic absolutes evolved into vacant, bloated chatter on an
artist's signature style.</TE>

<TE>   Reveling in wicked side of childhood</TE>
<TE>   The buoyant graphic style of 30 line drawings in white pencil by
Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone, whose L.A. debut is at Works on Paper
Inc., instantly evokes cheery illustrations in a children's book.
Happy boys and girls cavort with bunnies and puppies.</TE>
<TE>   As the boundless curiosity of children is frequently matched by
their vicious cruelty, however, it comes as only a mild shock to
discover on closer inspection what they're up to with their pets. A
little boy gaily saws the head off a flop-eared rabbit. A precocious
little girl introduces a carrot to the wrong end of a dachshund. And
the painted-on grin of a circus clown slowly transforms into a
grotesque leer, thanks to all that drool at the corners of his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the scatological implication of the brown paper on which
Rondinone draws lurches front and center.</TE>
<TE>   Rondinone's wicked drawings are executed with elegance and flair,
each figure isolated in the center of the page, anchored in the
self-conscious space of art. And they're stylishly installed.</TE>
<TE>   At the artist's direction, the drawings have been hung in two
tiers of 15 on a single dark wall upholstered in loosely textured
burlap. (The rest of the gallery is painted a warm mocha hue.) In a
world where bunnies do unspeakable things to Easter chicks, older
boys teach horrifying lessons to younger ones and frogs are less
princes-in-disguise than lechers-in-pursuit, panache matters.</TE>
<TE>   It may be worth noting that Rondinone executed the 1988 series
while a 24-year-old student at art school in Vienna, city of Freud.
Sex and violence are approached with wide-eyed wonder. The suite may
not be a major revelation about the repressions and idealizations of
childhood, but it does signal an artist of unusual stylistic verve.</TE>

<HD>Art creates an uproar in a world where science rules</HD>
<DH>A proposed Serra sculpture is causing yelps of protest from
an unlikely source -- students and faculty members at Caltech.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Biologist Marianne Bronner-Fraser likes what she sees when she looks
out her Caltech office window. It is grass, green and simple. It is
often adorned with students tossing Frisbees and scientific theorems
around. Bronner-Fraser says she can envision a sculpture on the lawn
-- a work of soaring excellence that would equal in creativity the
innovation for which Caltech is so well-known.</LD>
<LD>   But she can't imagine the sculpture that has actually been
designed and proposed for the spot, and has caused months of growing
agitation in the Caltech community. It is an 80-ton, zig-zagging wall
of steel by artist Richard Serra that would bisect the lawn like a
parade barrier. The hot new rumor on campus this week is that the
sculpture will not, after all, be built.</LD>
<LD>   This bit of possibly inaccurate news caused joy among those who
oppose the monumental artwork but who've had few signs thus far that
their prolonged protests matter.</LD>
<TE>   The protests themselves are unusual on this campus of brainiacs,
traditionally not an activist bunch. Most are so totally immersed in
scientific investigations and computations that they can be counted
on to ignore issues unrelated to their esoteric areas of expertise.
That non-activist tradition changed suddenly a few months back, when
Caltech President David Baltimore somewhat casually informed the
school community that Serra had been chosen to design a sculpture for
the grass in front of the two biological sciences buildings.</TE>
<TE>   After students and faculty got a look at the proposed work, they
drew battle lines, signed petitions, even constructed a comical
effigy of the proposed piece, which mysteriously appeared on the lawn
last month where the real thing is slated to sit. Meetings were held,
at which Baltimore tried to engage dissenters in open discussion --
to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on whether to sign a binding contract for the sculpture
was originally scheduled for July. It has been repeatedly postponed
by administrators, for whom it has apparently become a diplomatic and
artistic hot potato. Caltech officials said again this week that
they've made no decision, and had no comment on new rumors that the
sculpture would be too heavy for the site, would damage underground
equipment installations, and so will be rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Students and faculty have called the proposed art piece
unattractive, inappropriate, spatially divisive and visually
disruptive. "It is aesthetically unpleasing and artistically
insignificant," said Susannnah Barbee, a doctoral candidate in
biology. "I would love a Serra piece on the site, maybe one of his
beautiful buoyant rounded ones -- but not that particular piece. The
symbolism of a wall is ill-suited to the nature of this beautiful
campus. It speaks of isolation and separation, and what's wanted is
exactly the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Bronner-Fraser, chair of faculty at Caltech, likes the idea of
bringing great art to this campus. "I applaud David Baltimore for
what he is trying to do. That said, I don't like this piece for this
space. To my mind, it's divisive."</TE>
<TE>   By opposing the massive art work, dissenters are squaring off
against Eli Broad, L.A.'s most ubiquitous philanthropist-about-town.
Broad has offered to provide principal funding for the $2-million art
piece, which would sit in front of the Beckman Institute and the new
$50-million Broad biological sciences building, an architectural gem
for which the benefactor also provided principal funding.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the first major public sculpture by a celebrated
artist to be placed on campus. It would also bisect the lawn students
use for Frisbee games and as a shortcut to housing across the street.
The work consists of four steel plates, each 3 inches thick and 60
feet long, with the tallest one rising to 9 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On a small, highly focused campus like Caltech, where many of the
great scientific breakthroughs of modern civilization have taken
place, school officials admit surprise at the amount of passion
generated by the proposed art gift, which has spurred discussion that
ranges far beyond the sculpture itself. What kind of art belongs on
campus, should students and faculty have a voice in the process (they
have none at present), and why should so much money be spent on art
at a time when essentials like health benefits may have to be cut
back?</TE>
<TE>   Broad wants the sculpture to be approved, he said by phone from
his office. "I think Serra is the world's most important living
sculptor. I know that David Baltimore likewise has a very high regard
for him. As the Broad Center was being built, David and I always
talked about having a great piece of sculpture on the lawn in front
if it. I offered to be the major contributor if Serra would allow
himself to be commissioned."</TE>
<TE>   Serra was selected from a short list of five artists developed by
the 12-member Caltech arts committee, which advises the school
president, who apparently made the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, neither Broad nor Baltimore could have known that Serra
would come up with one of his "Vectors" -- a series of sculptures he
began in the 1970s, based on walls rising out of the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't tell an artist what you want," Broad said. "You show
him the site, and he comes up with what he wants to create for it."</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore isn't talking about the matter these days. Through an
aide he said he'd rather discuss it after a decision has been made --
and no date has been set for that. In response to calls about the
persistent rumor that the sculpture has been rejected, the school's
public relations director, Jill Perry, said there may be a decision
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Broad said he believes the work will ultimately win the required
approval from both the school and Pasadena, which requires a portion
of private development cost to be allocated for public art. He just
doesn't know when. Serra's wife, Clara, reached by phone at their
Manhattan home, said her husband is waiting for word on the design he
submitted many months ago and will not talk about the matter until he
has an answer. "We have no hostility," she told a caller. "It's just
that we've been through all his before, and we've learned."</TE>
<TE>   There have been many instances in Serra's embattled but brilliant
career when either his creations or his feisty temperament have
resulted in rejection of prestigious commissions for which he was
tapped. A 40-foot tower of overlapping steel plates he designed for
Wesleyan University was rejected as too tall for the site. (The piece
later went to a museum in Amsterdam.) A proposed sculpture for the
Centre Pompidou in Paris was turned down because architects
considered it too intrusive. He was fired from a prestigious
commission in Washington, D.C., after clashing with the noted
architect on the project, Robert Venturi.</TE>
<TE>   The major battle of Serra's career occurred in the mid-1980s when
a government agency placed a Serra sculpture in a large plaza in
front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building in Lower Manhattan. The
tilted wall of steel was reviled by many who worked in the building,
including a judge who led a campaign to have the offending piece
removed. Serra refused a government offer to relocate the sculpture.
He sued for $30 million, for breach of contract, and lost the case
four years later. The sculpture was moved to a government parking lot
in Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   The highly publicized case temporarily stunted his popularity in
America, but not his talent. He reached even greater artistic heights
with his torqued ellipses, some of which are walk-in sculptures. The
rapturous, soaring, curved and tilted steel walls seem to transport
viewers through time and space, reviewers have said. An exhibit,
which included these works, was held in New York last year, one month
after Sept. 11. It was so well-received that one critic said it
helped the city start to heal. Calvin Tompkins, writing in the New
Yorker, said the ellipses offered viewers "a jolt of euphoria." A
young couple who repeatedly visited the ellipses asked permission to
be married inside one of them. It is one of these newer works that
students and faculty say they wish Serra would have selected for
their campus. Instead, he has designed one for UCLA across town, a
work for which Eli Broad will also provide principal funding. UCLA
Executive Vice Chancellor Daniel Neuman says the torqued ellipse will
be installed by 2005, in front of what will be the new Broad Art
Center complex.</TE>
<TE>   Some distinguished voices in the fracas believe the Caltech
sculpture would be a good thing. Melvin I. Simon, professor of
biology and former member of the school's art committee, thinks it's
"wonderful that we would have a piece of world-class art by one of
the great sculptors of our time." All art, and especially Serra's, is
controversial in nature, Simon said, and some people will be unhappy
no matter what is chosen. "When you work with a great artist, you
must relinquish control."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Schkolne, a computer sciences graduate student, thinks
"it's cool that they're putting a sculpture in that space --
otherwise a new building might go up there in a few years." He thinks
most students are upset "for reasons other than the art, for reasons
which are valid." Still, Schkolne wishes that "something more
interesting had been selected. This is not his best work. If Caltech
puts art on campus to stimulate artistic thinking, it needs to select
pieces that are over the edge."</TE>
<TE>   The sculptor has explained in writing why he preferred a "Vector"
for the Caltech lawn. "In trying to conceive this work, the choice
was one of sculptural object versus sculpturally structured field."
He opted for the latter, he wrote, so that "as one drives along or
walks the site, the sculptural configuration foreshortens and
extends, compresses and expands the entire field and its urban
surroundings, continuously redrawing the viewer's relationship to the
landscape and the architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Caltech community, it seems, don't want to have their
views of the landscape "redrawn." The intimate campus is a paradise
of winding flower and tree-lined pathways with small, ornamental
surprises -- reflecting pools, fountains, friezes, statuary -- at
almost every twist and turn. It is the perfect, pastoral environment
for some of the world's most talented scientists and their proteges
to think deep, theoretical thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   It does, however, lack world-class public art -- an image problem
Baltimore is trying hard to correct. Whether Serra's steel wall helps
solve that problem remains to be seen.</TE>

<HD>Talent burns away 'Stormy Weather'</HD>
<DH>The singer-songwriter tradition takes center stage as women
stars lead a benefit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stars aplenty shone from the Wiltern stage Wednesday at the second
"Stormy Weather" concert, a fund-raiser for Don Henley's Walden Woods
Project. Yet despite many stellar performances among short sets by
Joni Mitchell, Stevie Nicks, Reba McEntire, Trisha Yearwood, Sheryl
Crow, Norah Jones, Paula Cole, Deborah Cox, Susan Tedeschi and
Michelle Branch, the star of the evening wasn't a single one of them.</LD>
<LD>   The true headliner was the singer-songwriter tradition itself. The
10 women, each given time for a couple of songs with a 60-piece
orchestra, championed that tradition, from newcomer Branch's opening
notes to Mitchell's captivating closing set more than two hours
later.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to samples of their own songs, most of the
participants saluted at least one of their favorite songwriters.</LD>
<TE>   Mitchell easily handled Bob Dylan's Mitchell-esque "Sweetheart
Like You," Jones glided through the Band's "It Makes No Difference"
and Crow deftly rendered Steve Earle's heartbreaking "Goodbye." Cole
inhabited Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan's "House Where Nobody
Lives," while Yearwood aced Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin's "The Man
That Got Away."</TE>
<TE>   There were moments, however, when some of the relative newcomers
didn't seem quite at home alone in front of an orchestra. The
blues-based Tedeschi, for instance, did an admirable job as a torch
singer, both on the standard "These Foolish Things" and in an
appropriately moody reading of Mitchell's melancholy holiday song
"River." Still, you ached for someone to hand her a guitar so she
could really cut loose.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, jazz-blues sensation Jones, while exhibiting the
evocative vocal phrasing that has made her one of the year's
brightest arrivals, appeared especially ill at ease without her piano
in front of her.</TE>
<TE>   That may have been as much a function of experience as sheer
comfort level. As the show progressed to the veterans, the poise and
confidence level rose.</TE>
<TE>   McEntire gave a reminder of what a marvelous straight country
singer she was before she became a mistress of all media, with her
treatment of the Ray Price hit "I Won't Mention It Again."</TE>
<TE>   Even Nicks stepped convincingly out of character, delving deeply
into the blues of Etta James' "Sunday Kind of Love."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell capped the evening as spiritual godmother to the women
who had preceded her onstage with a stunning update of "Woodstock"
that recast its original wide-eyed optimism into a haunting fable
that mourned the loss of youthful idealism.</TE>
<TE>   If she truly intends to retire from music, as she's been quoted as
saying recently, she made it clear that when she does, she's not
about to go gentle into that good night.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Super tycoon Alfred Taubman, age 76, seems to be flourishing in
prison (actually, he is in a federal medical hospital in Rochester,
Minn.) in spite of his generally poor health.</LD>
<LD>   He'll be there another six months for his role in price-fixing
between his auction company, Sotheby's, and Christie's. And though
his wife, Judy, says he is depressed, Taubman, in fact, seems to be
thriving while incarcerated, unlike the woman who testified against
him. Dede Brooks hasn't done nearly so well under her "house arrest,"
which ended recently in Manhattan. She has been criticized, scorned
to the max and banished from society save for a few defenders.</LD>
<LD>   Dominick Dunne reports this month in Vanity Fair that the popular
and trendy thing to do for the so-called jet set is to fly up to
Minnesota "to visit Alfred!" Everyone who is anyone seems to believe
that when Taubman emerges from his enforced time away, he'll pick
right up where he left off, living the high life and enjoying the
heck out of his pals and wife, a onetime beauty queen. (If Alfred is
depressed, it might only be because Judy is planning to spend
Christmas in Switzerland with her grandchild. He, on the other hand,
is said to feel so guilty at having been sent to prison, he urges her
to take such holidays.)</LD>
<TE>   Alfred has lost 15 pounds since arriving in Minnesota and is said
to be writing a book. Some visitors say he is in enormously good
spirits. So here's my nugget of news. Taubman gets along in prison so
well with his cellmates that the last time Mrs. Taubman flew up to
visit him, he had her bring along the wives of his cellmates in the
family's private plane.</TE>

<HD>A bare- knuckle Emmy battle</HD>
<DH>After HBO agrees to the academy's $10- million-a-year
price, the networks show how well they can throw their weight around.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In unscripted television shows, characters settle their differences
in plain view, and the results, while often interesting to watch, are
seldom flattering to anyone involved.</LD>
<LD>   The same could easily be said of this week's drama surrounding
rights to televise the Emmy Awards, which followed a messy, fractious
path to what most would agree was a fairly equitable and logical
conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences possessed scant leverage
in dealing with the major networks, which, in an uncertain economy,
were reluctant to pony up a major raise over the $3-million annual
fee they had been paying to share the awards on a rotating basis.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Home Box Office, the pay cable service. Once the academy was
free to entertain outside offers, HBO agreed to its $10
million-a-year asking price, setting off a flurry of negotiations
that concluded Wednesday night at the nonprofit group's monthly board
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the networks committed to a substantial raise -- more
than doubling the current fee, to an average $6.5 million over the
next eight years -- that still fell well short of HBO's bid.</TE>
<TE>   How they got there, however, underscores just how much clout the
industry's major players wield and provided a stark display of the
hardball manner in which they can exercise it.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned by the prospect of losing the Emmys to HBO, the major
networks stated that they would withdraw support from the ceremony
should the academy strike an exclusive deal, in the process crippling
not only the awards but the organization itself.</TE>
<TE>   The networks stressed that these weren't idle threats. In
presenting the network proposal on behalf of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox on
Wednesday, sources say CBS Television President Leslie Moonves
delineated all sorts of punitive actions the networks could take if
the academy went with HBO, from discouraging employees from joining
the group to scheduling a big-budget special the night of the Emmys
to siphon away potential viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that this will destroy the academy," said one industry
source with knowledge of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Such rhetoric couldn't be lost on the academy's elected officers
or governors, who are volunteers who work in the TV industry. The
academy is structured to represent the entire industry, from
craftspeople such as hairstylists and sound technicians to actors,
writers and executives.For academy representatives, alienating
high-powered network executives was hardly an enticing option. To
cite one example, the academy's chairman, Bryce Zabel, is a
writer-producer with a series prototype in development at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Academy officials were said to be taken aback by the vehemence of
the networks' response, even though there is precedent for it. When
Fox and ABC gained exclusive rights to the awards, competing networks
threatened to boycott the ceremony and opted not to buy tickets to
the event.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most seriously, the networks raised the possibility of
establishing a rival awards program, though recent events --
including awards presented by TV Guide and the American Film
Institute -- have drawn lackluster ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Through these warnings, network officials delivered a clear
message to both the academy and HBO -- namely, if the rival bid
proved successful, the pay channel would be acquiring a damaged
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, even if HBO had been simply acting as a stalking
horse for the academy, the channel appeared to have miscalculated how
the channel's offer would be perceived in light of its success
winning awards, which has already irked competitors. In fact,
industry sources have suggested that the Emmys are worth far more to
HBO airing on the major networks, providing wider exposure for
nominated programs such as "The Sopranos," "Sex and the City" and
"Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   With this week's game of "TV Smackdown!" behind it, the academy
can now focus on what to do with its new revenue. Known best for
presenting the Emmys, the organization faces pressure to expand a
profile characterized in recent years by internal bickering that has
turned off some members.</TE>
<TE>   Many point to the Superhighway Summit, which assembled industry
heavyweights to examine the future of telecommunications, as an
example of the leadership role the academy can play, but that took
place in 1994, and few initiatives since have approached that level
of ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Having long complained about the networks' paltry license fee
compared to the Grammys or Oscars, the group must solidify its status
as an industry forum and more fully develop its outreach activities,
which include college scholarships, internships and a videotape
archive chronicling the memories of industry veterans. If not, the
networks might well ask what their millions are buying.</TE>
<TE>   As for the average viewer and the industry's rank and file,
nothing much has changed.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmys will still be seen on a major network. Millions will
watch elegantly attired stars, writers and directors parading to the
podium to accept awards from their peers ... and, as often as not,
thanking HBO.</TE>

<LD>It has been said that we will never be content with the weather until
each man makes his own. True. I complain constantly that there is no
real weather here, only a flat, enervating sunlight that saps the
spirit and diminishes creativity. Even Oakland has weather.</LD>
<LD>   But for a few days last week and part of the week before, we were
witness to a combination of weather and color that painted our town
with brush strokes that not even Monet could equal. It began with a
sunset so intense it seemed artificial, streaks of pastel golds and
reds in a fiery mix that burned into the scattered clouds above it.</LD>
<LD>   I was on a balcony at the Getty when I saw it, startled by what
seemed to be an abrupt burst of color, as if the horizon had suddenly
exploded. I waited until it had subsided, then stopped along PCH on
the way home to watch darkness descend like a dream over the ocean,
the last traces of sunset melting into the Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   While I realize that it was not a performance meant especially for
me, I was moved to begin noticing the intricacy of color and weather,
one blending into the other in remarkable displays of dependency,
creating a glory isolated only for a few moments and then, like
drifts of a passing memory, gone.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, fog embraced the Santa Monicas, creeping over
the hilltops in billowing strands of silver that added a sheen to the
trees along the canyon roads and down the slopes of the valleys. I
don't know why I hadn't noticed before how autumn dresses the
mountains in a harmony of shades that glow in the dampness of the
passing mists. The leaves of the trees -- elms, liquidambars,
pomegranates and buckeyes -- responded to the cool moisture with a
chromatic affirmation of fall that could move a poet to tears. It
wasn't the fierce autumn colors of the Adirondacks, but it did at
least contribute a moment of splendor to a city that hungers for
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Then the rain came, quickly and unexpectedly, tapping on the roof
like a hesitant drummer, then building into downpours to signal with
gusto its return to the land of eternal sunshine. I couldn't believe,
even as the sky darkened, that it would actually rain. Heavy clouds
moved in, then broke up, leaving diagonals of sunlight slicing
through the darkness to illuminate flowers still braving the weather
change. Then it poured.</TE>
<TE>   It was a storm of modest proportions compared with the horror that
plagued parts of the East and the South. No tornadoes tore through
our cities, killing and uprooting like demons descending from the
sky. The winds that followed our rain were more benign than
murderous. Trees fell here and there, power lines snapped in the
gusts that blew down from the northeast and the lights went out in
some parts of town. But the effect of the wind was to enhance what a
poet called "the perfect image of the infinite."</TE>
<TE>   It scrubbed the sky into a blue so dazzling it hurt the eyes, and
faked our vision into believing that Santa Catalina Island was but a
touch away. As it blew, the leaves of fall fluttered like butterflies
to the mountain trails, laying pathways of gold for us to wonder at
their destination. Then it whisked them away into corners of the
poetic infinity that weather creates. The cries of crows riding the
wind filled the day with music, completing the chemistry of fusion
when weather changes.</TE>
<TE>   Autumn to me is a time between seasons, an unraveling of
complexities, an easing of tensions. Even as God's patience is tested
amid the bluster of warrior kings, autumn cautions us to wait, to
listen, to sigh deeply into the wind and to walk softly on the fallen
leaves. This pause between summer and winter reminds us of the
transitory nature of beauty and of the fleeting moments of grandeur
meant to be absorbed and remembered.</TE>
<TE>   There will be other sunsets and other rainy days, mornings laced
with strands of fog and nights lit by starry skies. The wind will
blow and the multi-colored leaves will grace its  currents and settle
softly to earth. But they won't come often in a combination of
weather and color that set our world aglow for a few days in
November. I was moved to regard it as a message from heaven to a
troubled world, and to wonder at its timing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the Mark Taper Forum has rocked and rolled harder than it did
at the Wednesday night opening of Deaf West Theatre's production of
"Big River" but if so, I missed it. Fueled by the show-stopping
voices of Rufus Bonds Jr., as the runaway slave Jim, and Gwen
Stewart, as the captured slave Alice, this revival of the 1985 Tony
Award-winning musical adaptation of "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" at times shook the Taper like a gospel church to the sound of
Roger Miller's powerful country spirituals about freedom denied and
regained in Mark Twain's racially divided America.</LD>
<LD>   The show marks the first time in its 35-year history that the
Taper has imported a play or musical from a smaller Los Angeles
theater. In doing so with Deaf West Theatre, the Taper has
reconnected with one of its own previous landmarks, Gordon Davidson's
1979 staging of Mark Medoff's "Children of a Lesser God," which
carried the subject of deafness on to Broadway and around the world.
Phyllis Frelich, the deaf star of that production, is also part of
this one, playing the parts of Miss Watson and Aunt Sally.</LD>
<LD>   This revival of "Big River," directed and choreographed by Jeff
Calhoun, is not about deafness but incorporates American Sign
Language into a hybrid form of narrative that deftly mingles speaking
actors with signing ones, doubling some parts and voicing others from
offstage or through another character.</LD>
<TE>   If it sounds odd, it's not. From the opening scene when Scott
Waara, as Mark Twain, struts out in period coat and bow tie and
begins to speak for Tyrone Giordano, the deaf actor portraying Huck,
we get an enduring double vision of the author and his literary
creation joined onstage. With the aid of body microphones, Waara and
others in the cast are able inconspicuously to provide the words for
deaf actors who are simultaneously signing their speeches.</TE>
<TE>   It's a contrivance, but a contrivance that quickly becomes
secondary to the historic tale unfurling on the imagined Mississippi,
and once we see that the hearing actors are also signing, a bond is
built that unites the ensemble in a way that only echoes the central
bond between Huck and Jim.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the added art of sign language and the overcoming of human
frailty it represents can be said to underscore the deeply felt
emotion of Huck's loss of innocence and Jim's dreams of being
reunited with his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   There are many moments to sing about in this "Big River," but its
greatest single image may be the stunning Act I tableau of Jim on the
raft, his back to the audience, standing and staring into the looming
blue screen of the river and the sky and the future all joined in a
timeless prospect of possibility, to the sound of American guitars. I
think Mark Twain himself might have choked up at the sight.</TE>
<TE>   The show's scenic design, by Ray Klausen, is most effective for
its simple but nonetheless ingenious creation of the raft on the
river, with movement suggested by the apparent sliding away of
riverbank as the raft heads upstage in an illusion created by a
change in depth perception.</TE>
<TE>   The primary set, however, is one that emphasizes the story's
literary origins: oversized pages of Twain's text scattered here,
there and everywhere, including the floor and the ceiling. Some of
the pages flip open, revealing actors who leap to life from a book.
This works well most of the time, but during the night scene when
Huck and Jim lie on their backs and stare at the stars and speculate
about the makings of the universe, the heavenly canopy itself is
unfortunately blocked by the pages. Perhaps this is making an
artistic point. Perhaps not.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which we tend to forget was published to great
consternation in 1884, is a blend of barbed, satirical observations
of some lesser aspects of American civilization and a heartfelt
reckoning with the legacy of slavery. Reinvented as a musical, with a
book by William Hauptman, it carries a bit more uplift and oomph than
Twain's original episodic novel, but, again, in this revival, manages
not to seem false to his broader purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The daring friendship between young Huck and slave Jim lends
itself to musical interpretation, and that bond is beautifully
re-imagined in the late Miller's very American songs, here sung with
ringing bass-noted authority by Bonds and a suitably higher-pitched
boyish counterpoint by Waara, strolling up into the aisles with
guitar and banjo while his lyrics are acted onstage by Giordano.</TE>
<TE>   Waara won a Tony for his role as Herman in the Broadway revival of
"Most Happy Fella" and cuts a fine figure as Twain. But Bonds, who
comes to the show straight from his role as Mufasa in "The Lion King"
at the Pantages, is absolutely heroic as Jim, embodying the troubled
hopes of a new nation -- even if we know those hopes won't be
realized for another century. His rendition of Jim's rocking song
about the Mississippi, "Muddy Water," will likely still be with you
when you leave the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Musical accompaniment is provided by a quintet, positioned above
and to the side of the stage, led by Steven Landau on piano and
including guitar, violin, mandolin and harmonica.</TE>
<TE>   Among the cast of supporting characters Huck and Jim encounter on
their trip down the Mississippi, the mountainous Lyle Kanouse as the
con man king who comes aboard the raft and later sells Jim to a slave
owner, proves a crowd pleaser with his bilious and bellowing Southern
fraudulence (and he gets to sing a couple Miller's funnier songs). On
an altogether higher plane (in fact, she sings from a platform
aloft), Stewart lights up a multi-octave range of emotion as the
gospel-belting Alice, a portrait in grief and musical transcendence.</TE>
<TE>   Might Huck have been deaf? It's an unavoidable thought interjected
by the sight of the wonderfully callow-faced Giordano, in straw hat
and suspenders, furiously signing the story's major narrative. I'm
not sure it really matters except to show that deaf or not, he
remains a storyteller whose visionary American tale we never tire of
hearing -- or singing.</TE>

<HD>Is Jackson's nose what the doctors ordered?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a wonder the jury can focus on the breach-of-contract case when
the more pointed issue in the Santa Maria courtroom where defendant
Michael Jackson is testifying this week is the pop star's nose. An
apparent plastic surgery lifer, he seems to have gone under the knife
so many times that the tip of his raw-looking schnoz now comes to a
point.</LD>
<LD>   "In his zeal to have this sharply defined nose, he's had so many
things done, the tissue is no longer able to withstand it. The skin
is so thin from operations that the bone or cartilage or silicone
implant is pushing through," said Dr. Les Bolton, a Beverly Hills
plastic surgeon, who made his assessment, as did other doctors, after
looking at photos shot Wednesday in court.</LD>
<LD>   "What he's done is to go from a Negroid or black nose, which is
round and broad and flat, to a Caucasian nose that's narrow and
projecting," said Dr. Harvey Zarem, a former chief of plastic surgery
at UCLA who practices in Santa Monica. "To do that, you have to put
cartilage or silicone or bone in the nose like a tent stake to make
the nose stick out. But when you do that enough, the cartilage or
silicone or bone pokes through."</LD>
<TE>   After so much work, it would seem that the Peter Pan of pop may be
beyond repair. Can this nose be saved? Never say never, say doctors,
especially about the king of Neverland.</TE>
<TE>   "If what is protruding is artificial material such as an implant,
the treatment of choice would be to remove the implant, let the nose
heal and reconstruct it later with some of his own tissue, such as
cartilage from the ear or bone from the rib," said Bolton.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Edward Domanskis, a Newport Beach plastic surgeon, agrees.
"Short of wearing a prosthesis, which maybe he even does now and
that's why he covers his face with a mask [Jackson entered the
courtroom with a surgical mask over his nose and mouth, then removed
it before taking the stand] you could take tissue from the forehead
or the back of the ear to build up the area. But I don't think he
wants that. It seems like he's fairly comfortable with the way he
looks, which is unfortunate because it's a bad reflection on all of
plastic surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, Jacko is getting what he asked for. Most surgeons say
that without a code of ethics that addresses when to say no to
patients who can't say no to themselves, it's difficult to know when
to refuse a request for more surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "What is a plastic surgeon there for but to achieve what the
patient is seeking and make them happy?" Zarem asked. That said, he
concedes that doctors confront an ethical dilemma with patients who,
like Jackson, seem insatiable. "This is a common thing. We do our
best, and the patient says it's an improvement, but they want more,"
he said. "That's why I always tell my residents that the enemy of
good is better."</TE>
<TE>   Domanskis believes that drawing a line with some patients is
particularly difficult. Jackson "probably should have stopped three
or four noses ago. But it becomes very difficult with a person who is
powerful and wants his way. There are enough plastic surgeons out
there who are going to feel special if he comes to them that he is
probably always going to find someone willing to operate."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Josh Korman, a plastic surgeon in Mountain View, Calif., and a
faculty member at Stanford University Medical School, agrees. "A lot
of times, doctors are trying to help patients, but it comes down to a
judgment call. I always say that plastic surgeons can operate on the
ears but not on what's between the ears."</TE>

<HD>Director deflects fire and brimstone</HD>
<DH>Carlos Carrera's controversial film, which opens in the
U.S. today, has drawn the ire of Catholic groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Carlos Carrera seems to have lost his appetite. Picking at
his grilled chicken, the weary-looking Carrera says he doesn't
understand why his movie, "El Crimen del Padre Amaro," which opens
today in the U.S., has caused such an uproar. Having riled
conservative Catholics in his native Mexico and now in the U.S., the
movie has caused him more grief than he imagined possible.</LD>
<LD>   In Mexico, Carrera is being sued by a conservative Catholic group
for allegedly "violating the rights of Catholics." He found himself
in the eye of the storm when top members of the Mexican clergy tried
this summer to have the film banned. A government official asked him
to delete some of the more offending scenes -- including a scene in
which Father Amaro makes love to a parishioner under the mantel of
Our Lady of Guadalupe. Carrera refused.</LD>
<LD>   The onslaught of criticism has flowed to the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The Catholic League, a conservative activist group, has issued a
press release saying that Catholicism is "being assaulted" in the
film. The group has spearheaded past protests against the Brooklyn
Museum for a controversial art show as well as Kevin Smith's film
"Dogma." The group also plans to campaign against Miramax's "The
Magdalene Sisters," the Venice International Film Festival
prize-winner about an asylum run by Irish nuns, due out next year.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Giovino, director of communications for the league, said he
has seen "Padre Amaro" and called it "a shallow and biased screed"
but said the organization had no plans to protest beyond its
denunciation of the movie in the press release.</TE>
<TE>   Another conservative Catholic group, the American Society for the
Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, has orchestrated mailings
of thousands of postcards protesting the film as blasphemous. The
group planned to demonstrate outside the Galaxy Theater in Hollywood,
where a screening was scheduled, Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, movies that dealt with controversial religious themes
have sparked scattered picketing at theaters and sometimes huge
demonstrations, as was the case with "The Last Temptation of Christ"
in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the film will be released initially only on 45
screens in five cities, targeting the art house crowd and cities with
large Latino populations such as Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Goldwyn Films has run an extensive campaign on Spanish
language radio and television stations.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling an exhausted doctoral student in his loose sweater and
glasses, the diminutive Carrera said he remains perplexed by the
film's notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   "It was made very respectfully," he said during an interview in
Los Angeles. "We never talk about faith or the presence of Christ in
communion. None of the fundamental principles of the religion are
ever questioned. What is questioned are some of the positions that
the church has taken as a political institution."</TE>
<TE>   He said he even agreed, at the urging of government officials, to
push back the date of release in Mexico so it would not coincide with
the pope's visit to the country in July.</TE>
<TE>   "We agreed because releasing the film at that time would have
looked like a provocation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which became Mexico's highest-grossing domestic film, is
based on a 19th century Portuguese novel by Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz
but is set in contemporary Mexico. Gael Garcia Bernal ("Amores
Perros," "Y Tu Mama Tambien") plays an ambitious young priest who is
drawn into an affair with a young parishioner, with tragic results.</TE>
<TE>   The movie also deals with issues confronting many Mexican priests,
including accepting large donations from drug dealers and aiding
guerrilla activities in more rural and impoverished areas of Mexico.
Carrera says it's startling to note that the book's main issues have
not changed in more than a century since the novel was published.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is still relevant, including the hypocrisies of
society and the church and the principal story -- the love story
between Amaro and Amelia," Carrera said. "We were always looking for
the human side of this story. We did not want to make a protest
film."</TE>
<TE>   Carrera, 40, is considered one of the top directors of the new
Mexican cinema. He began his career as an animator at age 12. In
1991, Carrera's first feature, "La Mujer de Benjamin" (The Wife of
Benjamin), won best original screenplay at Mexico's version of the
Academy Awards. Another film he made in 1998, "Un Embrujo" (Under a
Spell), also earned him critical praise, but none of his films has
come close to the box-office success of "Padre Amaro."</TE>
<TE>   "Next time," he joked, "we are going to hire the bishops and the
guy from Pro-Vida [the group that filed the lawsuit in Mexico] to
promote our films."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of the latest British invasion of U.S. television, CBS has
picked up the award-winning animated special "Robbie the Reindeer in
Hooves of Fire," but it will arrive on these shores missing much of
its English accent.</LD>
<LD>   British pop star Robbie Williams, who narrated the stop- action
short that first aired in Britain in 1999, will be replaced,
reportedly by James Woods. Williams is a huge star in Europe who
recently signed a recording contract worth more than $100 million and
clearly hopes to make an impact in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   He's not the only one bumped from the transatlantic trip. Irish
comedian Ardal O'Hanlon is being replaced by Ben Stiller as the voice
of Robbie, and Jane Horrocks ("Absolutely Fabulous") will be replaced
by Britney Spears as the voice of Donner. The cast won't be entirely
Americanized, though: Hugh Grant is substituting for Steve Coogan
("24 Hour Party People") as Blitzen.</LD>
<TE>   "Hooves of Fire" and a new sequel, "Robbie the Reindeer in Legend
of the Lost Tribe," will air on CBS on Dec. 13.</TE>

<HD>Soderbergh's 'Solaris' gets PG-13 rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals board has overturned the R rating given Steven
Soderbergh's romantic outer-space drama, "Solaris," and the film will
now carry a less restrictive PG-13 rating, 20th Century Fox confirmed
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Motion Picture Assn. of America initially had rated the film R
for "some sexuality/nudity," objecting to two scenes depicting actor
George Clooney's naked backside. The director vowed to appeal.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview last week, Soderbergh told The Times that he did
not consider the two scenes in question really sexual. One shot shows
Clooney and co-star Natascha McElhone slow-dancing in an extremely
darkened room, while the other shot depicts the two of them in bed on
their stomachs, talking.</LD>
<TE>   Soderbergh, the Oscar-winning director of "Traffic," and Jim
Gianopulos, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, personally appealed
the case to the MPAA's classification and rating appeals board
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the film, due for release Nov. 27, is now rated "PG-13 on
appeal for sexuality/nudity, brief language and thematic element."
Soderbergh will not be required to trim any scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Under MPAA guidelines, an R rating means moviegoers younger than
17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. PG-13 states
that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.</TE>

<LD>"Happy Tears," a 1964 painting of a red-haired woman smiling through
her tears by pop art master Roy Lichtenstein, was sold for $7.1
million Wednesday night at Christie's New York, setting a record for
the artist.</LD>
<LD>   Although Lichtenstein's work has commanded big prices at auction
for many years, "Happy Tears" shattered a record set in 1990, at the
peak of the art market, when his painting "Kiss II" was sold for $6
million.</LD>
<LD>   The Lichtenstein sale was a highlight of a $66.9-million auction
of postwar and contemporary art that failed to find buyers for 13 of
the 75 works offered but set records for seven artists. Among them
were "Portrait of Nick Wilder" by David Hockney, which edged up his
1989 auction record price from $2.2 million to $2.8 million, and an
untitled painting by Laura Owens, which was sold for $47,800, more
than five times the young Los Angeles artist's 2-year-old auction
record of $8,813.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Australian record industry has proposed new rules that would
prevent the sale of some CDs to anyone younger than 18. Advocates say
it would be similar to the R rating used on movies, BBC News reports.</LD>
<LD>   "We think if there are CDs that are truly R rated in content, then
they shouldn't be sold to under-18-year-olds," said Stephen Peach,
chief executive officer of the Australian Record Industry Assn. "It's
just simply applying community standards that apply already to film,
television, videos and video games."</LD>
<LD>   The proposed guidelines would take effect in March.</LD>

<LD>Once a few curious lapses are remedied, the six-week, Wednesdays-only
Cuadro Flamenco series at the Fountain Theatre (through Dec. 18)
promises to provide an ideally intimate and varied overview of local
contemporary flamenco style.</LD>
<LD>   Along with distinguished flamenco singer Antonio de Jerez, each
program features guitarist Antonio Triana, who also serves as
artistic director for the series. Unfortunately, Triana neglected to
give himself a solo spot on the brief inaugural program. Instead, he
concentrated on supplying vibrant accompaniments for the dancing. The
evening's trios prioritized formal, gracious interaction but
otherwise did little more than summarize the qualities that each
participant would develop later in extended solos. But those solos
proved memorable.</LD>
<LD>   Marcellina de Luna's solo emphasized hearty attacks and vivid
emotional projection. Playoffs between heel- and toe-emphases and a
walking passage with artful hesitation steps displayed her very solid
technique, but these effects almost always remained subordinate to
her expressions of mood or spirit.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, the solo by La Yeni remained essentially sculptural,
marked by dramatic shifts of position and a kind of sinewy pliancy.
The tiniest dancer on Wednesday, she could detonate startling
explosions of percussive steps, but her performance always seemed
more about beautiful design than states of feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing a solo by Roberto Amaral that offered a lot of flamboyant
effects but no real shape, Timo Nunez reveled in the mock-surly
stances, flashy turns and sudden percussive flurries assigned him. He
also used his height brilliantly, sometimes seeming to fill the whole
platform stage with a single stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely aimless, the full-company second half of the program
offered the shortest of solos by each of the dancers, after which
they invited friends and colleagues in the audience to perform. These
guests included Suzie Bartes, Sue Connor and Vanessa Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   Besides lending his vocal artistry to the dances, De Jerez sang a
robust "Cante Andaluz."</TE>

<LD>Norman Lear meets Norman Vincent Peale in "Acts of God" at Actors
Workout Studio in North Hollywood. Writer-director Peter Fox's triad
of plays links the battle between art and commerce to existential
theological questions, with sidesplitting results.</LD>
<LD>   First is "God Knows," in which pregnant Ruth (Jessica Randle) and
fiance Joe (understudy Dave Dettore) seek counsel from Father Mike
(Brennan Byers). After God (Cary Thompson) appears to Ruth, the
ensuing debate sets forth the evening's skewed course in miracles.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece, "God's Nose," finds "God Knows" author Peter
Reynard (Greg Forshay, subbing for Joel Stoffer) and television
producer Sid Markowitz (Bob Neches) at an upscale eatery. Their
negotiations lead to another divine encounter, embodied by a waitress
(Minda Burr).</LD>
<TE>   The finale, "God Noes," depicts Sid's pasteboard sitcom pilot. By
its conclusion, everyone from cast (Bridget Nelson, Matt Corboy,
David Keats and Tim Starks) to audience (understudy Gus Buktenica) is
demanding better representation, especially the Deity.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has a bright central concept, and his staging is adept. The
actors are hilarious, with the howl-inducing Neches stealing the
show.</TE>
<TE>   The satiric reach is limited by excessive polemic and
disproportionate focus, plus an unnecessary intermission.
Nevertheless, the witty irreverence on tap recommends "Acts of God"
to agnostics and AFTRA members alike.</TE>

<TE>   In this version, it's all about Ophelia</TE>
<TE>   Prominent theatrical iconoclast Steven Berkoff leaves no cliche
unturned in "The Secret Love Life of Ophelia," an
uncharacteristically prosaic offering receiving its U.S. premiere at
the Odyssey Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Berkoff's two-person epistolary play, directed by Barry Phillips
based on Berkoff's original staging, examines "secret correspondence"
between Hamlet and Ophelia.</TE>
<TE>   In "Hamlet," Ophelia, who has been painfully spurned by Hamlet,
returns Hamlet's letters upon orders of her father, Polonius. In
Berkoff's revisionist take, Ophelia and Hamlet feign their
estrangement to gull their elders. (Why they feel this is necessary,
when there is no obvious impediment to their union, remains obscure.)</TE>
<TE>   Berkoff's version takes on a certain resonance in the second act,
when Hamlet's murder of Polonius and his subsequent exile launch
Ophelia on a dark path to obsessive guilt and madness. Unfortunately,
the one-note first act, a dramatization of the lovers' erotic
correspondence, is a soft-core diatribe that soon wears parchment
thin.</TE>
<TE>   In Berkoff's priapic profusion, Hamlet (Dominic Comperatore)
gushes on and on about quills and inkpots, quivers and bows, furrows
and plows, while Ophelia (Ingrid Nelson) sighs and heaves in
rapturous response.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps all this grunt-and-grope verbiage is meant to be amusing,
but the production's overall tone gives little clue to Berkoff's
intent. Considering the eventual segue into tragedy, the steamy
silliness seems misplaced. Prepossessing and passionate, Comperatore
and Nelson excel in the play's second half, and they handle the
preposterousness of their initial scenes with the necessary brio.</TE>

<TE>   Gleeful send-up on growing old</TE>
<TE>   "I'm somehow aging much faster than everyone else .... It's only a
matter of time before I'm the oldest man in show business."</TE>
<TE>   So laments Steve Rudnick in "The Oldest Man in Show Business,"
Rudnick's two-person play, now in its world-premiere engagement at
the Hudson Backstage. Fifty and "tired of lying about it," veteran
screenwriter Rudnick (co-writer on "The Santa Clause" and "The Santa
Clause 2") gleefully bites the development deal that feeds him in his
vaguely autobiographical send-up. Although it may not qualify as
deathless art, Rudnick's bright, slight comedy makes serious points
about Hollywood ageism and the misappropriation of the creative
process by rank novices and bean counters.</TE>
<TE>   Under the skillful direction of John Riggi, Rudnick stars as a
battered survivor of the Hollywood trenches forced to "pitch" to
young studio executive Jason (fresh-faced, funny Brian Dietzen), a
rankly ignorant puppy whose cultural literacy stretches back about as
far as the Smurfs. In an amusing turnabout, the action frequently
switches back to the heyday of the Hollywood studio system, with
Rudnick holding court as tough uber-mogul Shmule Mordechai. Shmule
rules his movie-making roost with an iron hand, while such nervous
underlings as Nelson (Dietzen), a young contract writer, scurry to
execute his every capricious command.</TE>
<TE>   What a difference a few decades make. The action ends with a
nicely surreal twist, complete with a hilariously swashbuckling sword
fight (credit fight directors Pason Burt and Charles Currier) in
which the best -- make that the oldest -- man wins. Call that
middle-age wish fulfillment, if you will. But call it funny.
Rudnick's scathing, curmudgeonly comedy is that too, and in spades.</TE>

<TE>   Loss of innocence in doo-wop time</TE>
<TE>   Loss of innocence might seem an awfully downbeat topic for a
doo-wop musical. But "Willie, Mickey &amp; the Duke," being given its
premiere by the California Repertory Company, handles the topic
intelligently, while delivering a winning succession of a cappella
harmony numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the summer of 1956, Scooter (Kelley Hinman)
recalls a time when life with Wick (Wesley Hunt), Cotton (Wilson
Bell), Bobby (Jay Wallace) and Bobby's girlfriend, Marilyn (Heidi
Godt), revolved around the heroics of their favorite baseball
players, not the McCarthy hearings or the H-bomb scare.</TE>
<TE>   But the outside world intrudes when, shortly before Scooter's
departure for college, his father spends the tuition money to build a
bomb shelter.</TE>
<TE>   With eyes newly opened to national security concerns, Scooter
begins to see the color barrier faced by Cotton and other African
Americans moving into their Bayside, Queens, neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Then, idealism gets crushed between the gears of capitalism.
Hoping to replace Scooter's tuition money, Bobby challenges a rival
team to a high-stakes game of stickball. The wager becomes a metaphor
for all of the joy that has been leeched out of big-money baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Now and again, the script, by Cal Rep artistic producing director
Howard Burman, is clumsily plotted, but the doo-wop tunes, created
with composer Matt Vinson, power the story through its rough spots.
The staging, by Joanne Gordon, aches with memory, and the set, by
Elissa Stankiewicz, envisions an inviting, wide-banister stoop as the
scene of happier times.</TE>

<TE>   Museum motif unifies festival</TE>
<TE>   Creativity and mortality interface in "escape/artists" at the Los
Angeles Theatre Center. Alternating two different programs weekly,
this ninth edition of Moving Arts' annual one-act play festival uses
a museum motif as unifying metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the reviewed "Gallery 1," this year's model favors
stylized think pieces, with varying results.</TE>
<TE>   Notably effective is D.T. Arcieri's seriocomic "The Scream," a
bisexual triangle involving a successful artist (Brendan Broms), a
caustic bank clerk (Melissa Marie Thomas) and a free-spirited gallery
owner (Liesel Kopp). Under Paul Nicolai Stein's adroit direction, all
three actors are excellent, and the net result is memorable.</TE>
<TE>   The festival winner, Marc Chun's "Match," presents five archetypes
(D.G. Bannon, Keith Berkes, Gary Marschall, Amy Thiel and Lori
Yeghiayan), whose interlocking stories form a Hollywood gloss on
"Rashomon." Kimberly Glann's direction elicits admirable ensemble
cohesion, with Thiel outstanding, although the script seems more
clever than profound.</TE>
<TE>   Robyn Burland's "After Loyal," in which two teenagers (Kathi
Chandler and Melissa Jones) loiter about a golf course while their
dysfunctional households play out around them, is MTV fodder.
Rosemary Frisino Toohey's "In the Tank" is negligible beyond its
cracked premise and the performances of Bannon and Broms.</TE>
<TE>   The second program, "Gallery 2," features "Crossed Wires" by Mark
Chaet, "Busted Jesus Comix" by David Johnston and "Casse-Tete" by Rob
Nixon.</TE>

<HD>Sinatra's in, talk is out at KLAC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'll be seeing it in all the old familiar places: Adult standards
are returning to KLAC-AM (570).</LD>
<LD>   Station owners plan to announce today that they are giving up the
14-month-old talk format and will return next month to playing the
songs of Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Ella Fitzgerald. But with a
twist.</LD>
<LD>   "We're calling it the martini format," said Robin Bertolucci,
director of AM programming for Clear Channel-Los Angeles, which owns
KLAC. "We're calling it 'the Fabulous 570.' It's going to be this
swank, cool station. We want this station to be a destination on your
dial, like entering a martini bar."</LD>
<TE>   None of the roster of talk hosts on KLAC -- which includes L.A.
radio fixture Michael Jackson -- will be retained or shifted to
sister station KFI-AM (640), she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a very difficult task to wedge another talk format into
this market. We've had some very talented people, and I feel very
sorry that it wasn't more successful."</TE>
<TE>   According to program director Brad Chambers, the new KLAC will
feature lively promotions, contests and even celebrity disc jockeys
and thus won't be like other stations that play the American
songbook, which, he said, "bored me to tears."</TE>
<TE>   "If we present this music in an interesting blend and do it in a
contemporary, fun fashion, we're going to attract a broader
audience," he said, adding that the playlist will include such recent
artists as Diana Krall, Norah Jones and Steve Tyrell. The use of
standards in movies and commercials and the success of cover albums
by rock artists indicate the ground is fertile for a station like
this, Chambers said.</TE>
<TE>   KSUR-AM (1260), which goes by the moniker "K-Surf," launched in
March and bills itself as "contemporary standards," a similar
updating of the format.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of respect for what they're doing, but this is
going to be on a much bigger scale," Bertolucci said, with KLAC
having a larger signal and larger corporate backing than K-Surf's
Saul Levine, the Southland's sole remaining independent broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   The new KLAC will debut Dec. 12, Sinatra's birthday.</TE>

<HD>'The Big Griddle -- Just Like Home'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Albert's good luck piece has helped
Schmul repair his shield generator. Now Albert has to get home before
it is turned on. Which postcard will take him home?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mel Gilden</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert knew he didn't have much time. Schmul would be turning on his
shield generator at any second. If he did not choose the right
postcard before that happened, Albert would be stuck on Forbush
forever.</LD>
<LD>   Albert ran to the rack in front of the restroom and frantically
pawed through the postcards. Every one had a Big Griddle -- Just Like
Home restaurant on it. He had to find the one with a pepper tree out
front.</LD>
<LD>   "Take it easy," Albert cautioned himself. He grabbed the postcard
that looked the most like the Big Griddle he'd left and ran with it
to the door. It had a layer of metal foil, just like the postcard
that had brought him to Forbush. That was something, anyway. Albert
held his breath, flung open the door and ran into the dining room
beyond.</LD>
<TE>   He stood for a moment looking around. The dining room looked like
the one in his Big Griddle -- Just Like Home restaurant, but he
couldn't be sure. All Big Griddle dining rooms looked alike, after
all. Through the windows he could see a normal human city, but even
that didn't mean much. There must be hundreds of Big Griddles on
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly he knew he was in the right place. There was the pepper
tree. Grinning wildly, he ran to where he parents still sat in the
booth, right where he'd left them.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get all the syrup off?" his mother asked, as if he hadn't
been gone any time at all.</TE>
<TE>   Albert said nothing but just hugged his parents tightly.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on?" his father asked. "You act as if you've been
gone for years."</TE>
<TE>   Albert laughed. "I'm glad this Big Griddle is really just like
home," he said. "That's all."</TE>

<HD>'Murder in Greenwich' weaves a thick plot, but one strand
strays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a twist: Mark Fuhrman as hero.</LD>
<LD>   Justice was delayed in the mysterious 1975 slaying of teenage
Martha Moxley that stunned tony Greenwich, Conn. -- but not denied --
when Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel was convicted of the murder this
summer, two years after his arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Now Fuhrman, the disgraced former L.A. cop whose testimony
inadvertently helped free O.J. Simpson in another famous trial, gets
his due -- and maybe more -- for his role in the Moxley case in
"Dominick Dunne Presents: Murder in Greenwich" (8 p.m., USA).</LD>
<TE>   In the first of a planned series of true-crime films "presented"
by journalist Dunne, Fuhrman (Christopher Meloni from "Law &amp; Order:
SVU") is an abrasive but noble gumshoe whose doggedness broke the
case open.</TE>
<TE>   That angle figures, since the film stems from Fuhrman's 1998 book,
"Murder in Connecticut: Who Killed Martha Moxley?," but some have
questioned whether he merits so much credit.</TE>
<TE>   Credibility questions aside, this tragic story is well told.
Director Tom McLoughlin stylishly weaves two parallel plots: Those
fateful days in 1975 when brash Tommy Skakel (Toby Moore) and his shy
brother Michael (Jon Foster) vied for the heart of their neighbor
Moxley (Maggie Grace), and Fuhrman's legwork years later with the
help of Steve Carroll (Robert Forster), the local detective who
originally worked the case.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it's hard not to question this portrayal of
Fuhrman. In one scene, he tries to spin his perjury in the Simpson
case as well-intentioned, saying he lied about using a racial slur so
as not to distract the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he was a scapegoat or villain in that case, he makes for
an implausible hero in this one.</TE>

<HD>Dark magic</HD>
<DH>New 'Harry Potter' may leave viewers bewitched, but
bothered and bewildered as well, with its emphasis on the gruesome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is deja vu all over again,
and while that is a cliche, nothing could be more appropriate. It's
likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or
con -- you'll likely think of this one. Still, even partisans of
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" may well be put off by parts
of the new film.</LD>
<LD>   "Chamber of Secrets" displays such zeal for re-creating the book's
more grotesque aspects, from man-eating spiders to venom-dripping
monster serpents, that it is sure to rattle the cages of the smallest
viewers, sending them under their seats if not out of the theater.</LD>
<LD>   For the Harry Potter novels have a kind of magic that it is beyond
the powers of these films to duplicate. The darkness that invades
"Chamber of Secrets" underlines how well the books managed to exactly
balance good and evil, dark and light, so that within their pages you
seemed to be experiencing both at the same time. Not so here.</LD>
<TE>   Because "Chamber of Secrets" can't seem to get the balance right,
it ends up broadly overdoing things on both ends of the spectrum. The
film's scary moments are too monstrous and its happy times have too
much idiotic beaming, making the film feel like the illegitimate
offspring of "Alien" and "The Absent-Minded Professor."</TE>
<TE>   It's fortunate that Alfonso Cuaron is set to take over the series
from Chris Columbus and direct the next installment, "Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban;" with Columbus in charge the J.K.
Rowling books are fated never to get completely satisfying film
versions. The original material is wonderful, but what's clearer
after two films than one is that Columbus' cinematic treatments are
unlikely to rise above the acceptable level of expensive copies to
become truly memorable in their own right.</TE>
<TE>   "Chamber of Secrets," like its predecessor, is intelligently cast
and makes good use of behind-the-camera talent like returning
screenwriter Steve Kloves and new cinematographer Roger Pratt. And
the problem has never been anyone's intentions toward the material;
"Chamber's" two-hour, 41-minute length shows that, if anything, the
films are more concerned than they should be about leaving something
out.</TE>
<TE>   To give the devil its further due, "Chamber" has a bit of the
magic of the Rowling originals, mostly in its ability to reproduce
some of the book's peripheral tricks. It's amusing to see the
Whomping Willow, the screaming mandrake plants and the bad-tempered
Howler sent by Mrs. Weasley to chastise the misbehaving Ron. Truly,
all that money can buy has been bought, and though that is an
accomplishment of a sort, it is not great filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   The acting in "Chamber of Secrets" is a similarly mixed bag. While
it is charming to see how appropriately Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and
Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as inseparable pals Ron Weasley and
Hermione Granger have matured in a year, the eagerness of Grint's
Weasley to continually make "Little Rascals"-type faces is
unfortunate.</TE>
<TE>   As for the adults, Alan Rickman seems already tired of his role as
Professor Snape, while Maggie Smith appears to be getting more used
to being Professor McGonagall. Of the newcomers, who include Jason
Isaacs as the villainous Lucius Malfoy, the most satisfying acting is
done by, of all people, Kenneth Branagh.</TE>
<TE>   As celebrity author Gilderoy Lockhart, Hogwarts' new Defense
Against the Dark Arts professor, Branagh does some of his best film
work in years, bringing the same kind of pleasure to the part of a
self-absorbed and fatuous fop that Robbie Coltrane brings to the
stalwart giant Hagrid.</TE>
<TE>   The plot of "Chamber" begins when an annoying house-elf named
Dobby pleads with Harry not to return to Hogwarts if he values his
life. Once back at the school, Harry and his pals have to contend
with petrified fellow students and writings on the wall that
ominously proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies
of the Heir, Beware."</TE>
<TE>   This all unfolds capably enough until the appearance of Aragog, a
9-foot spider with an 18-foot leg span, and a dreadful snake known as
the Basilisk. To be fair, these creatures appear in the book as well,
but it is one thing to read about them and another to actually see
them on the big screen, a difference the filmmakers, without a sense
of what is fitting in a film like this, should have been sensitive to
but were not.</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable moments in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets" involve not some expensive special effect but the unplanned
poignancy of Richard Harris' performance, the last of his long
career, as headmaster Albus Dumbledore.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as an acting choice, perhaps because of the effects of the
illness that eventually took his life, Harris plays Dumbledore with a
quavering but resolute frailty that gives the character an effective
gravity. His speech about the life span of his beloved phoenix,
Fawkes, one of those creatures that "burst into flames when it is
time for them to die," provides an unintentional valedictory to an
impressive career.</TE>

<HD>'Bloody Sunday' may be ineligible for Oscar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Bloody Sunday," a searing documentary-style drama re-creating events
surrounding a 1972 civil rights march in Derry, Northern Ireland,
that left 13 civilian protesters dead at the hands of British troops,
could be ruled ineligible for Oscar consideration this year because
the movie has aired on Irish and British television.</LD>
<LD>   Paramount Classics, the film's U.S. distributor, sent a letter
this week to Frank Pierson, president of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, asking that the organization bend its rules
to allow "Bloody Sunday" to compete for the Academy Awards. The
letter said it would be "an incredible injustice" to the movie and
director Paul Greengrass should the academy declare the film
ineligible.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be odd for one of the best-reviewed films of the year
not to be considered, not to have the possibility to be nominated,"
producer Mark Redhead said Thursday via telephone from London.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, tersely declined to
comment on the merits of the appeal. "We generally try to avoid
helping out on a picture's publicity campaign. So, we will have no
comment on this or any other waiver request" until the board takes
action.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the request for a waiver will be referred to the
academy rules committee, which will then forward its recommendation
to the board of governors, which meets Dec. 10. A decision could be
made then.</TE>
<TE>   David Dinerstein and Ruth Vitale, the co-presidents of Paramount
Classics, say the movie has a strong shot in three Oscar categories:
best picture, Greengrass for best director, and James Nesbitt for
best actor in a leading role. The film shared the top award for best
picture at this year's Berlin Film Festival and was co-winner of the
audience award at the Sundance Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Redhead said the filmmakers always considered the film a
theatrical release, but the 30th anniversary of the Derry march
earlier this year became an enormous event in the United Kingdom and
Ireland and they thought their film deserved a wider showing.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was constructive to get it before an audience in
one collective mass viewing -- not only in the United Kingdom, but in
Ireland. It attracted an enormous audience."</TE>
<TE>   The film debuted in London theaters on Jan. 20 -- 10 days before
the 30-year anniversary of the march. That same night, the picture
aired throughout Britain and Ireland on national television -- the
only airing of the film on TV to date. The film opened in the U.S. on
Oct. 4 and is playing on 52 screens. As of Tuesday, it had grossed
$570,000 in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Academy rules state that a picture first theatrically exhibited
outside the U.S. prior to the Los Angeles qualifying run "may not be
exhibited publicly in any other medium for a six-month period
following the commencement of its initial theatrical engagement."</TE>
<TE>   In their letter to Pierson, the producers and studio executives
acknowledge that academy rules seem to eliminate "Bloody Sunday" from
Oscar consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet, is this rule faithful to the spirit of the academy?" the
letter asks. "Has it always been honored in academy history?"</TE>
<TE>   The letter cites the Academy Awards of March 27, 1957, when Sir
Laurence Olivier was up for best actor in the British film "Richard
III." Just over a year earlier, on March 11, 1956, the film "Richard
III" aired on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, 'Richard III' was an exceptional case," the letter states.
"Its network airing was a national event -- a milestone in the
establishment of color television. 'Richard III' was a film that
appeared simultaneously on the small screen.... We feel the same
should also be the case now. 'Bloody Sunday' is also an exceptional
film."</TE>
<TE>   The letter was signed by Dinerstein, Vitale, Redhead and executive
producers Jim Sheridan, Pippa Cross and Tristan Whalley.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Olivier comparison, the academy's Davis replied: "The
board will not feel bound by the rules that existed in 1957. This
whole television problem hadn't surfaced at that time. It wasn't in
the rules."</TE>

<HD>Xtet ensemble begins a promising residency</HD>
<DH>The first of three concerts at LACMA explores a wide range
of new music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over its 17-year life, the fine and malleable new-music-minded
ensemble Xtet has been more than a lurking presence on the
performance scene but less than a steady one. The advent of its first
residency at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a three-concert
series that began Wednesday, promises more continuity in public and a
well-deserved opportunity to flex its agenda.</LD>
<LD>   That agenda involves the usual new-music business of giving
premieres, but also tapping the annals of 20th century music.
Wednesday's concert filled the bill nicely, with the U.S. premiere of
Christina Viola Oorebeek's "temptations of the beat, number one," but
also Mary Ellen Childs' 1986 "Still Life," an anything but still,
dance-like work for three percussionists.</LD>
<LD>   For history's sake, they dusted off Henry Cowell's enticing
pre-Minimalist String Quartet No. 4 ("United Quartet"), circa 1936,
and Luciano Berio's sonorous, lightly salted "Folk Songs." Overall,
the program was an easy-does-it affair, whose most atonal and
arrhythmic moments came from Oorebeek's work, for three
percussionists and five strings. Though ostensibly inspired by Dizzy
Gillespie and hip-hop, the score follows an abstract course, craftily
resisting temptation to give in to the beat or a tonal center.</LD>
<TE>   Composers have long bowed to, and filched from, folk traditions,
but Berio's "Folk Songs" collection is unique in its mercurial blend
of sincerity and subversion.</TE>
<TE>   Varying attitudes and arrangements swirled around soprano
Daisietta Kim's lucid, persuasive treatments of the songs, from
America, France, Italy, Armenia and Azerbaijan, the last of which is
a jaunty, fittingly inscrutable capper.</TE>

<HD>Veritas Gets SEC Subpoenas in AOL Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government's investigation of accounting practices at AOL Time
Warner Inc.'s America Online unit has triggered subpoenas to
California technology company Veritas Software Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Mountain View-based Veritas said in a quarterly financial filing
Thursday that it received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange
Commission "relating to transactions we entered into with AOL in
September of 2000."</LD>
<LD>   The targeted transactions involve a $50-million Veritas software
sale to AOL and a $20-million purchase of advertising from AOL,
Veritas said.</LD>
<TE>   A Veritas spokeswoman said the subpoenas were received in August.
The company said it was cooperating in the probe and also was
reviewing its own accounting treatment of the transactions.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner said in July that the SEC and the U.S. attorney's
office in Alexandria, Va., had launched investigations after
disclosures that the company's Internet unit improperly accounted for
some of its advertising deals with several companies.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, investigators are looking at whether AOL used
barter deals to inflate its revenue by exchanging advertising or
purchase contracts of comparable value with outside companies during
the dot-com craze.</TE>
<TE>   AOL said last month that it would reduce its revenue for the last
two years by $190 million because of accounting questions. But the
company has not identified any of the companies or deals involved.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal investigators are paying particular attention to some of
the ad deals handled by former AOL managers David Colburn and Eric
Keller, both of whom worked in the online company's now-defunct
business affairs unit.</TE>
<TE>   AOL fired both men after internal investigations turned up
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials have told investigators that they believe Keller may
have cut side deals with some outside companies to help them report
higher earnings or ad revenue. The companies include Las Vegas-based
Purchase Pro and Westlake Village-based Homestore Inc., according to
sources close to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner said in a federal filing Thursday that it expected
the government investigations to continue into next year.</TE>
<TE>   In its filing, Veritas said the software sale to AOL resulted in
the recognition of $37 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of
2000, with the remaining $13 million expected to be recognized over a
three-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The $20 million of advertising expense was recorded "over the five
quarters during which AOL provided advertising services to us,
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000 and ending in the fourth
quarter of 2001," Veritas said.</TE>
<TE>   News of the Veritas filing was reported after markets closed.
Veritas shares rose $1.45 to $18.25 in regular Nasdaq trading. AOL
Time Warner shares rose 8 cents to $15.30 in regular New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press and Bloomberg News were used in compiling this

<HD>Argentina Defaults on Loans</HD>
<DH>Government withholds a $805-million payment to the World
Bank as it continues to negotiate with the IMF and seeks political
consensus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina defaulted Thursday on its World Bank loans,
with officials saying the move was an attempt to break the deadlock
in an 11-month effort to reach agreement with the International
Monetary Fund over a bailout for this troubled South American
country.</LD>
<LD>   Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna announced that the Argentine
government would not make an $805-million payment to the World Bank
due Thursday. Instead, the government made a token payment of $79
million to cover interest due, not enough to avoid a default as
defined by lenders.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, the World Bank announced that under its rules it
could not consider any new loans for Argentina and that further
disbursements under existing loans would be cut off in four weeks
unless Argentina makes good on its obligations.</LD>
<TE>   Cabinet Chief Alfredo Atanasof said making a full payment to the
World Bank would have dropped Argentina's reserves below the $9
billion that the International Monetary Fund has recommended the
country maintain. He said Argentina would make its overdue payments
as soon as the IMF agrees to give the country new loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Argentina intends to continue negotiating with the IMF toward a
definitive agreement," Atanasof said.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF is the lender of last resort to developing nations. Its
policies and decisions are closely followed by other such agencies,
including the World Bank, which focuses on loans to finance long-term
development.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's action, which came as Lavagna met with IMF officials in
Washington, placed Argentina in the small club of international
deadbeats that includes Iraq and Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Argentina defaulted on most of its loans owed to
private banks -- about $100 billion in commercial bonds. But it had
remained in good standing with the World Bank, the IMF and other
multilateral institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said Thursday's default was, in part, a
warning to the Argentine Congress, which is debating new laws --
including populist measures that would change the tax code and
bankruptcy laws -- that could scuttle an IMF deal.</TE>
<TE>   The lending agency has made repeal of similar laws, which it
believes harm the local business climate, a condition of any future
support to the country. During the 1990s, Argentina's attempts to
implement free-market reforms favored by the IMF were undercut, in
large measure, by the country's inability to balance its budget and
by political infighting among its top leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to default," said a source close to President
Eduardo Duhalde. "But the president is trying to send a strong
message to the Congress and to Argentina society as a whole that we
need consensus if we're ever going to reach an agreement with the
IMF."</TE>
<TE>   The source said Lavagna and IMF officials had reached agreement on
most technical issues. After four years of recession, Argentina's
economy came crashing down last year. Most of the $8 billion in IMF
emergency loans to Argentina in 2001 flowed out of the country to
overseas depositors in an unsuccessful attempt by the government to
shore up the banking system.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the government of then-President Fernando de la Rua
froze most bank accounts, prompting a popular uprising that drove him
from power.</TE>
<TE>   Congress selected Duhalde as president in January. He devalued the
peso and pushed hard for a new agreement with the IMF, suggesting for
months that an accord was near.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Argentine media reported that an agreement was
"very close" and that Duhalde hoped an accord would be reached before
Thursday's World Bank deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes them look bad, very weak," Lawrence Krohn, chief Latin
America economist at ING Financial Markets, told the Dow Jones News
Service. "It makes them more of a pariah."</TE>

<HD>Cadiz Loss Narrows, but Funding Unclear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Hiltzik</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc. said Thursday that it narrowed its third-quarter loss
thanks to improved farming conditions but indicated that it has not
yet reached final arrangements with all lenders over critical new
financing.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based agricultural company said it would put off
its quarterly earnings conference call with investors until after it
completes "financing discussions" with certain lenders.</LD>
<LD>   The restructuring of the company's notes and loans became more
pressing last month after the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California canceled a proposed $150-million joint project with Cadiz
for a water storage program in the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after the MWD vote, company Chairman and Chief Executive
Keith Brackpool said Cadiz had reached agreements to extend the Jan.
31 maturity date of its $35 million in bank loans by three years and
the July 2004 redemption date of $12.5 million in preferred stock by
two years.</TE>
<TE>   A company official said Thursday that under the new terms the
imputed annual interest rate on the bank debt would be significantly
higher than the current charge.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said the financing demands of its Sun World
agricultural subsidiary would rise sharply next year. The company
said Sun World would require $15 million over and above the $30
million available under a preexisting revolving credit line to cover
expenses from April to June. It said it hopes to find the financing
on "commercially reasonable terms" if it is able to reach unspecified
new arrangements with holders of $115 million in Sun World notes.</TE>
<TE>   For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company reported a net
loss of $1 million, or 3 cents a share, on revenue of $64.3 million,
compared with a net loss of $5.3 million, or 15 cents, on revenue of
$48.7 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all revenue came from produce farming, packing and
licensing by Sun World, for which the third quarter customarily
generates more than half of annual sales. The company attributed the
improvement to better production conditions in the Central Valley as
well as improved marketing of proprietary produce.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz shares fell 2 cents to close at $1.12 in Nasdaq trading
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The company was vague about the fate of its water program in the
Mojave Desert in the wake of the MWD action. Cadiz said "several
different scenarios to maximize the value of this water resource" are
under "current evaluation." The company declined to give further
details.</TE>
<TE>   Bulk sales of water from the Mojave tract could be difficult,
however, as there is no efficient way currently to transport water to
customers. For example, the nearest aqueduct, MWD's Colorado River
aqueduct, could be reached from Cadiz only via a $70-million
pipeline, which the MWD -- the only entity that has federal
permission to build it -- has canceled. Moreover, environmental and
political issues still exist that could limit the amount of water
Cadiz could extract from the site.</TE>

<HD>Chertoff Touted as New SEC Chairman</HD>
<DH>The Justice Department official is seen as a frontrunner,
but he appears uninterested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael Chertoff, the head of the Justice Department's criminal
division who has helped spearhead this year's corporate-fraud
crackdown, emerged early Thursday as a leading candidate to become
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   But by the end of the day his lead appeared to have faded, perhaps
at his own request.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department issued a statement indicating that Chertoff
would prefer to stay where he is.</LD>
<TE>   "Michael Chertoff is happy in the job he currently holds, and he
looks forward to helping the president and the attorney general
continue fighting the war against terrorism," said Bryan Sierra, a
Justice Department spokesman. He declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is scrambling to replace Harvey L. Pitt,
who announced his resignation as SEC chairman last week after a
political uproar over his choice of William H. Webster to head the
nation's new accounting-oversight board. Webster resigned Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Early Thursday, rumors swirled that Chertoff would get the nod.
The assistant U.S. attorney general, 48, has helped lead
investigations into alleged fraud at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.,
and directed the criminal case against accounting firm Arthur
Andersen. As a former counsel to the Senate, he ran the probe of
former President Clinton's Arkansas land dealings.</TE>
<TE>   He also has played a major role in the pursuit of terrorism
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff's name has been mentioned prominently as a potential SEC
choice in part because his law-and-order background and perceived
lack of ethical conflicts would help to smooth a Senate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   He is a respected prosecutor who would help restore credibility at
the SEC, which has been riven by the repeated controversies that
dogged Pitt, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a person of impeccable credentials and reputation," said
Jonathan Macey, a Cornell University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff also has strong political skills, honed in part through
his close work with the administration on terrorism and corporate
crime, said Paul Fishman, who worked with Chertoff as a prosecutor in
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a fair bit of experience dealing with politics," Fishman
said. "He knows more than a little bit about the way the Hill works."</TE>
<TE>   However, Chertoff's aggressive record as a prosecutor, and his
lack of experience in regulatory matters, could provoke opposition,
some said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution of Andersen, which resulted in an
obstruction-of-justice conviction stemming from the firm's work for
Enron, effectively put Andersen out of business. Some critics said
the punishment didn't fit the crime.</TE>
<TE>   A Chertoff nomination could strike fear in the accounting
industry, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.
"Chertoff is their real nemesis," Coffee said. "I suspect his
appointment would send shudders across the accounting profession."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Chertoff lacks a background in regulatory and technical
financial issues, which some say are highly desirable in an SEC
chief, given the markets' complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Other names mentioned in recent days as Pitt successors include
Mary Schapiro, vice chairwoman of NASD, the securities industry's
self-regulatory group; former federal judge Stanley Sporkin; and
Richard Breeden, a former SEC chairman.</TE>

<HD>Psychic Hotline Settles Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH>The two firms behind Miss Cleo's infomercials will forgive
$500million in uncollected bills but do not admit guilt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest psychic hotline operation in the United States has agreed
to unplug its phones and pay $5 million to settle charges that it
misled customers looking for a supposedly free glimpse into their
future, the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies behind husky-voiced psychic Miss Cleo also
agreed to forgive an estimated $500 million in uncollected bills and
send back uncashed checks to customers who were charged an average of
$60 for the supposedly free calls, the FTC said.</LD>
<LD>   Miss Cleo's Caribbean-inflected television appeals faded from the
airwaves shortly after the FTC filed fraud and unfair telemarketing
charges in February against her two Florida backers, Access Resource
Services Inc. and Psychic Readers Network Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The companies already have paid $150,000 in fines and forgiven
millions in outstanding bills to settle civil and criminal charges
brought by several states, and they face an ongoing investigation in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of widely broadcast infomercials, Miss Cleo -- born
Youree Dell Harris in Los Angeles -- promised free insight on
careers, love prospects and other personal matters through psychic
readings or tarot cards.</TE>
<TE>   But callers who dialed the toll-free number to speak to Miss Cleo
were given another number to speak to a psychic. Only if they stayed
on that first line would they be told that the first three minutes at
the new number would be free, after which they would be charged $4.99
a minute, the FTC alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Callers often used up their free time on the second call verifying
their name, birth date and other personal information, and then
racked up charges as calls stretched up to an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Psychics were pressured to keep callers on the line for as long as
possible or face termination by the companies, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   The companies, run by cousins Steven Feder and Peter Stolz, took
in about $1 billion over the years and triggered thousands of
consumer complaints, Beales said.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies, which share an office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
did not admit guilt as part of the settlement but acknowledged that
the FTC had a "good-faith basis" for its charges.</TE>

<HD>Dell Profit, Sales Surge in Third Quarter</HD>
<DH>The computer maker's earnings increase 31% as it regains
spot as the No. 1 PC seller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp.'s profit jumped 31% in its fiscal third quarter
as the company regained the No. 1 spot in the personal computer
market and continued to lure consumers away from its rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Dell's profit in the three months ended Nov. 1 increased to $561
million, or 21 cents a share, from $429 million, or 16 cents, a year
earlier. Sales rose 22% to $9.1 billion, and sales of workstations,
servers and other high-end gear grew 27%.</LD>
<LD>   The Round Rock, Texas-based firm said U.S. shipments rose 33%,
while the rest of the industry shipped only 2% more than a year
earlier. Dell's consumer shipments grew 51%.</LD>
<TE>   Dell's business has continued to improve as its rivals suffer. The
most recent victim is Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard Co., which
briefly became the top PC seller when it bought Compaq Computer Corp.
in May.</TE>
<TE>   Dell is more profitable because it sells chiefly over the Internet
and by phone, eliminating much of the shipping and inventory costs
its competitors rack up. HP is trying to sell more of its machines
directly in response.</TE>
<TE>   The latest results matched Dell's projections of a month ago, and
its shares fell slightly in after-hours trading. They had risen 89
cents to $30.94 on Nasdaq in hopes that Dell would exceed those
projections.</TE>
<TE>   For the coming quarter, Dell said it anticipated a 20% increase in
revenue from the year before, to about $9.7 billion, with earnings
per share of about 23 cents. That was roughly what analysts had been
expecting.</TE>
<TE>   Dell is introducing printers, hand-held organizers and switches to
its lineup to expand into markets dominated by HP, San Jose-based
Cisco Systems Corp. and others. And it is selling more data-storage
devices, especially those co-branded with industry leader EMC Corp.
In the latest quarter, sales of external storage systems rose 73%.</TE>
<TE>   After the earnings release, Dell executives said they weren't
counting on a broad industry recovery in the near future. Both Dell
and HP have been cutting prices to spur sales, but there is little
hope for a big holiday season for computer sellers.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Are Steady; Jobless Claims Dip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joanne Morrison</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reports released Thursday offered some encouraging signs the
resilient consumer can hold the economy afloat and that the labor
market is stabilizing.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said retail sales, which make up about 40%
of consumer spending, were unchanged in October at a seasonally
adjusted $301.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   But the picture brightened when a 1.9% drop in auto sales was
stripped out. Without autos, retail sales logged the biggest gain in
six months, an unexpectedly strong 0.7%.</LD>
<TE>   Although markets and many economists took the news as a good sign
for the recovery, it was clear that cheap auto-financing deals, which
have helped fuel consumer spending over the last several months, are
beginning to lose their allure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a separate Labor Department report showing a second
straight week of declines in new applications for jobless benefits
offered hopes the labor market may be struggling out of a weak patch.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department said jobless claims dipped by 8,000 to a
seasonally adjusted 388,000 last week. The more reliable four-week
moving average of claims also fell, breaking a 10-week run above the
400,000 mark economists see as signaling a lackluster labor market.</TE>
<TE>   "The jobless claims data is not insignificant. This plays into the
view that yes, we're in a soft spot but perhaps we've seen the worst
of it," said Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast Ltd. in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists expressed lingering concern about future prospects
for consumer spending -- the key force holding up the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Worries of a possible military action against Iraq, terror threats
and the loss of wealth from tumbling stock markets could hinder
spending, they cautioned.</TE>

<LD>Freeing several of the nation's biggest mobile phone companies to
pursue other means of securing airwaves for their growing masses of
subscribers, federal regulators Thursday agreed to let carriers opt
out of their obligation to pay $16 billion for wireless licenses now
owned by NextWave Telecom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the Federal Communications Commission was a
victory for Verizon Wireless Inc., VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and
more than a dozen other carriers that had sought to wash their hands
of a 6-year-old airwave dispute that left the ownership of 197
government-issued wireless phone licenses up in the air.</LD>
<LD>   "As the months have passed and the economic difficulties worsened,
it has become increasingly clear that allowing the winners to exit
the auction is the right course," FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell said
Thursday. "Although the commission cannot cure the capital crunch, it
can remove the cloud of uncertainty."</LD>
<TE>   The FCC said the mobile carriers could apply in the next 45 days
to be relieved of their financial obligations and reclaim millions of
dollars held by the federal Treasury as deposits. Companies that
elect to rescind their bids would not be barred from a future sale of
the licenses should they become available again.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless carriers have been counting on amassing more wireless
spectrum to deliver advanced services such as high-speed Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   But their quest has been thwarted by Hawthorne, N.Y.-based
NextWave. The company bid $4.7 billion for its wireless phone
licenses at a 1996 FCC auction. But the company failed to pay for
them and entered bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC subsequently took back NextWave's licenses and
re-auctioned them. But NextWave successfully challenged the FCC's
action and the dispute now is pending before the Supreme Court.</TE>

<HD>Gap Earnings Beat Raised Expectations</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc. reported positive third-quarter earnings on Thursday,
indicating that the nation's largest specialty apparel chain's
turnaround plans are gaining traction.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based retailer's earnings rose to $135 million,
or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, compared with a
loss of $179 million, or 21 cents a share, for the same quarter last
year. It was Gap's first quarterly year-over-year earnings increase
since the first period of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   A consensus of analysts from Thomson First Call had boosted its
earnings expectations to 14 cents a share from 6 cents a share, after
a positive report from Gap last week.</LD>
<TE>   Sales rose 9% to $3.6 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the
same period last year. Sales at stores open at least a year increased
2%, compared with a 17% decrease in the comparable period the year
before. It was the first quarterly comparable-store sales gain since
the fourth quarter of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's stock hit a three-month high on Thursday, closing at $13.90,
up 20 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading. The earnings were
released after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   While some analysts remained cautious in their assessment of the
results, others said the company, parent of more than 4,200 Gap,
Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, has turned a corner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced [the turnaround] is already underway," said Dorothy
Lakner, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. "I think customers are
beginning to return to the Gap."</TE>
<TE>   A conference call after the earnings release also gave Wall Street
its first chance to hear from the company's new chief executive, Paul
Pressler, who was hired in September as the company was trying to
reverse the lingering slump.</TE>
<TE>   To get a feel for the company, the former Walt Disney Co.
executive said he is spending his first three months on the job
"listening and learning" and immersing himself in the business. He is
speaking with the top 50 people at the company and visiting
distribution centers. He even intends to work in one or two stores,
probably over the Thanksgiving weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler plans to sell clothes and stock shelves, spokesman Alan
Marks said. "He wants to understand all aspects of the business,
particularly from the customer's point of view," Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad plan, Lakner said. "It probably is the best way to know
the problems the people in the stores are up against," she said. "I
think that's going to be something that should speed up his learning
curve and make him much more effective as a CEO."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, who was in charge of Disney's theme parks and resort
division, said the two companies are similar in that they have made
emotional connections with their customers.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney "we were storytellers," he said. "The more I think about
it, I think about this business no differently."</TE>
<TE>   That comparison drew a skeptical response from analyst Joe Teklits
with Wachovia Securities. "I don't see the emotional connection he's
talking about with the customers, and I don't see the ability to
control capital expenditures and spending and also tell a story in
those stores, especially Gap stores," he said. "I kind of view Gap
stores as selling a commodity more than selling a dream."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, industry insiders want to see how Pressler -- who
succeeded retailing icon Millard "Mickey" Drexler -- will make his
mark on the company, since Pressler is known for his marketing
prowess, not his fashion sense.</TE>
<TE>   Ilse Metcheck, director of the California Fashion Assn., expects
the company to shift "from a product-based retailer to a
marketing-based retailer."</TE>
<TE>   "It remains to be seen whether the product can keep up with the
razzmatazz that he will bring to the display," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap says it has no shortage of product expertise since the
presidents of each of its brands are experienced as merchants.</TE>
<TE>   The company ran into trouble after opening too many stores and
stocking too-trendy merchandise in a bid to woo younger shoppers. Gap
suffered a sort of identity crisis, analysts said. The company's net
income dropped from $1.1 billion in fiscal 1999 to a net loss of just
less than $7.8 million in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   To redefine itself, the company refocused on the basic apparel
that for years had attracted shoppers to its stores, including basic
jeans, khakis and classic white shirts.</TE>
<TE>   That suits Quinn Breece, 20, a San Francisco resident who was
shopping at Gap's flagship store there.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that you can find classic styles because most stores are
trendier," said Breece, a Trinity College student who particularly
likes Gap's jeans.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco store is a reflection of how the company is
wooing customers with basic clothes and a marketing campaign that
proclaims Gap a brand "For Every Generation." Sweaters, sweatsuits
and other clothes are displayed in muted colors -- grays, blues and
black. A poster leaning against one wall shows an aging Willie
Nelson, the ageless Sissy Spacek, a collection of fresh-faced youths
and a grandmotherly, white-haired woman wearing a sleeveless vest.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar May Face U.S. Antitrust Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has threatened to file a lawsuit against
Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. for alleged antitrust violations
before the July 2000 merger that created the Pasadena-based company,
sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The department is investigating whether Gemstar International
Group Limited and TV Guide Inc. violated federal regulations
forbidding publicly traded merger partners from certain cooperative
activities before they combine, a source close to Gemstar said.</LD>
<LD>   The case could result in the biggest fine ever against a company
for "jumping the gun" before the completion of a merger, the source
said, adding that the Justice Department is looking to fine the
company between $4 million and $8 million. The current record in such
a case is less than $3 million, the source said.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosure is the latest embarrassment for Gemstar founder
Henry Yuen and News Corp., which recently ousted Yuen to gain control
of the Gemstar board. At the time of the merger, News Corp. was a
major shareholder of TV Guide Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide and sells on-screen television
program guides, is already under federal investigation for its
accounting practices and has lost 85% of its stock value this year,
forcing News Corp. to write down about $6 billion of its investment
in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar would not comment Thursday on the allegations. But in a
quarterly report filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Gemstar contended that its conduct before the merger was
lawful.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing, Gemstar said it received a letter from the Justice
Department on Nov. 7 alleging that its two predecessor companies had
engaged in "unlawful coordination of activities" before their merger
in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials have laid out the framework for a settlement,
sources said. The company noted in the filing that it would consider
settling if terms were reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   The development comes after News Corp. prevailed in a power
struggle that has helped buoy investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Effective last week, Yuen gave up control of the board and stepped
down, leaving Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in power. News Corp.
executive Jeff Shell took over as chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure was part of a quarterly filing made public Thursday
that restated financial results for the first two quarters of 2002.
The company Thursday also restated results for 2001 and reported a
third-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in accounting rules helped it narrow its loss in the third
quarter to $17.3 million, from a restated $140.3 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's loss in the third quarter narrowed to 4 cents a share,
compared with a loss of 34 cents a share in the year-ago period.
Revenue for the quarter fell 16%, to $253.4 million, from $299.9
million, partly because of a significant decline in licensing of its
on-screen software to the cable and satellite industries.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Gemstar said it would restate 2001 results after losing
a patent ruling on its program guide software that made it uncertain
of collecting revenue from rival Scientific-Atlanta Inc. that it
already had booked.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar warned investors that the quarterly results are unaudited
and could be subject to further revisions. Filing the third-quarter
results, however, satisfied one requirement for continued listing by
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Another requirement is that Gemstar file all amended financial
results for 2000, 2001 and 2002 by March. The company, which fired
KPMG and appointed Ernst &amp; Young as its auditor, said it expects to
be in full compliance by next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares rose 21 cents to close at $4.26 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>HSBC to Acquire Household in $14.2-Billion Deal</HD>
<DH>Acquisition by the London-based firm would expand its U.S.
presence but expose it to risker businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HSBC Holdings said Thursday that it will buy Household International
Inc., owner of the Beneficial and Household Finance brands and the
largest independent U.S. consumer finance company, in a deal valued
at about $14.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The all-stock deal puts London-based HSBC, one of the world's
biggest banks with long-standing U.S. ambitions -- including in
California -- in 46 states, adds millions of customers and makes
HSBC's credit card arm a global powerhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Although a larger U.S. presence cushions HSBC from a slump in Asia
and Latin America, it also exposes the conservative bank to
debt-ridden U.S. consumers and one of Household's riskier businesses
-- lending to people with patchy credit histories.</LD>
<TE>   Prospect Heights, Ill.-based Household, a leading credit card,
auto finance and mortgage lender focused on the so-called subprime
market, has found it increasingly costly to raise funds in capital
markets because of concerns about possible loan losses in the slack
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Household, which was started in a Minneapolis jewelry store in
1878, also has fought charges it duped low-income borrowers into
buying high-interest rate loans.</TE>
<TE>   Last month it agreed to pay back a record $484 million to
customers in a multi-state settlement of such charges. Executives
said the company was wrapping up the settlement issue and HSBC had no
major concerns about this.</TE>
<TE>   Household agreed in January to pay $8.9 million in penalties and
refund $3 million to California consumers, but California
Corporations Commissioner Demetrios Boutris said regulators "are not
satisfied" the refunds have been made in full, suggesting he might
pursue another enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   Household also faces a lawsuit filed in February in Alameda County
by the Assn. of Community Groups for Reform Now. The community group
-- known as ACORN -- accused Household of systematically cheating
thousands of California borrowers, which the company denied.</TE>
<TE>   A New York-based consumer group, Inner City Press/Community on the
Move, said Thursday that it will urge federal regulators to block the
transaction on the grounds Household overcharged some borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   HSBC's stock fell 3.9% in London trading Thursday, and slid $1.85
to $54.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will receive 2.68 ordinary HSBC shares, or 0.53 American
depositary share, for each Household share they own -- or about
$28.70 a share based on Thursday's closing price for HSBC.</TE>
<TE>   Household shares jumped $5.04, or 22.4%, to $27.50 in NYSE
trading. Its bond prices also soared. Even with Thursday's gain,
Household's stock is down 52.5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a cheap, opportunistic acquisition," said analyst David
Erskine of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The deal gives Household a stronger, well-capitalized parent with
international reach.</TE>
<TE>   "It solves the financing problem, so it's positive," said Matthew
Park, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in New York. Analysts said
the takeover makes strategic sense as HSBC seeks to diversify its
earnings to cope with a slump in the Hong Kong market, where it has
its roots, and competition in the British banking scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Over 75% of all return on equity is derived from the United
States, so it's where you have to be if you want to be a global
player," said Mark Durling of Brewin Dolphin Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts have said HSBC, which has a foothold in the
Northeast, is interested in acquiring a California bank to increase
its presence in the nation's largest banking market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very logical for them to come to the West Coast," said
Edward Carpenter, chairman of Carpenter &amp; Co., an Irvine-based
investment bank. "HSBC is in a unique position to facilitate trade
between Asian companies and companies on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Pending regulatory approvals, HSBC said it expects to complete the
acquisition of Household in the first quarter of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer E. Scott Reckard contributed to this report.

<HD>Nikkei Index Drops Again; Hits 19-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Falloff undermines value of Japanese bank assets and
threatens efforts for faster economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's best-known stock market gauge tumbled to 19-year lows for the
second day in a row Thursday amid mounting pessimism about the
economy's ability to make a quick comeback.</LD>
<LD>   The 225-issue Nikkei index lost 135.13 points, or 1.6%, to
8,303.39. It was the lowest close since March 25, 1983.</LD>
<LD>   At midday today, the Nikkei was rebounding, up 1.5% to 8,433.</LD>
<TE>   The sagging Tokyo market has become a focus of Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's economic comeback plan. The continued slide in
share prices is undermining the value of assets held by the nation's
teetering banks, making it more difficult for them to dispose of
billions of dollars in bad loans that have been on the books for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Shares were hammered again Thursday by new economic data that
showed a tapering off in Japanese exports. Japan's tenuous economic
growth largely depends on healthy sales overseas, so any dive in
exports could spark economic contraction.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks sank further after the Times of London reported that
Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. and head of Japan's
powerful industrial association Keidanren, said that at least one of
Japan's big four banks was likely to be nationalized as part of
government efforts to clean up bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Mizuho Holdings, the world's largest bank, fell 14%. UFJ
Holdings, Japan's fourth-largest bank, lost 15%.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole situation remains negative for the economy," said
Momoru Yamazaki, an economist with Barclays Capital in Tokyo. "It's
not just the news today, it's a lack of economic policies to turn
things around."</TE>

<HD>Comdex Operator Faces Crushing Debt Burden</HD>
<DH>A victim of tech industry's collapse and post-9/11 cuts in
travel, Key3Media weighs a sale or merger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just 72 hours before the opening of the huge computer trade show
Comdex, the Los Angeles-based company that runs the event said
Thursday that it probably faces a sale or merger because it is
plagued with losses and can't pay its debt.</LD>
<LD>   Key3Media Group Inc. is being crushed by a heavy debt burden at
the same time the technology industry's collapse and post-Sept. 11
cuts in business travel have eroded attendance at shows such as
Comdex, a four-day event that starts Sunday in Las Vegas. The company
also runs more than two dozen other shows worldwide that create
forums for buyers and sellers of electronic gear.</LD>
<LD>   After Comdex ends, Key3Media will explore a sale, merger or other
restructuring, perhaps using a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
to facilitate the overhaul, the company said while announcing another
quarterly loss. Pressure will intensify after Dec. 16, when the
company faces a debt payment of about $15 million that it can't
afford. Key3Media's stock, meanwhile, is nearly worthless.</LD>
<TE>   It all marks a rude setback for Chairman Fredric Rosen, a
controversial yet celebrated executive who was the architect behind
the meteoric rise of Ticketmaster. But after taking the reins at
Key3Media 2 1/2 years ago -- just as the tech sector's bubble was
starting to burst -- he's nearly out of options to keep Key3Media
independent.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a very brutal, painful environment," Rosen, 58,
said Thursday in an interview. "After 9/11, everything accelerated
into a downdraft."</TE>
<TE>   But Key3Media's woes also raise questions about Rosen's
management. Even as the technology industry was starting to crater
last year, the company spent more than $100 million to buy niche
trade shows focused on computer networking, the Internet and other
industries.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Key3Media has had to take charges totaling more than
$640 million to write down the value of those shows and other assets.
In effect, the write-downs indicate that Key3Media vastly overpaid
for the acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said it is easy, in retrospect, to conclude that he paid too
much, but the tech meltdown and post-Sept. 11 impact whipsawed the
company faster and harder than anyone could have imagined. At the
time, the prices paid appeared to be "reasonable values," he said.
"To the extent that I'm subject to criticism, OK. You make the best
decision you can at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen has been cutting operating costs and shrinking the business
to keep Key3Media afloat. The company postponed a Comdex show in
Chicago and pulled the plug on other tech shows in Atlanta, New York,
Canada and Australia. Key3Media's work force has been cut by nearly
half, to about 375 people.</TE>
<TE>   But it won't be enough. Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * The company Thursday posted a third-quarter loss of $315.7
million, which included a $300-million charge for the write-down of
assets. For the first nine months of 2002 it lost $686.2 million on
revenue of $111.6 million. In the same nine-month period a year ago,
it lost $20.2 million on revenue of $175.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Key3Media's debt, totaling $370 million, is rated as "junk" by
both Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service, meaning
the company has little chance of raising fresh cash from the credit
markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Key3Media's stock, which went public at $6 a share in mid-2000
and climbed as high as $13, now trades for less than a nickel a share
on the over-the-counter market. The loss has virtually wiped out the
investments of Key3Media's controlling stockholder, Japanese Internet
company Softbank Corp., and other shareholders such as U.S.
billionaire Kenneth Langone. Both declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Key3Media isn't the only one suffering from the malaise of
information technology, or IT, trade shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult environment for both trade shows in general
and technology shows in specific," said Moody's analyst Christina
Padgett.</TE>
<TE>   Although still popular, the shows mirror their industries, and
both IT exhibitors and the buyers who flock to the convention centers
to see the new gadgets have sharply cut spending. Fewer firms are
willing to pay to display their wares at shows, and potential buyers
of IT equipment are spending less to attend the shows and,
ultimately, less on exhibitors' products.</TE>
<TE>   But Key3Media's fall Comdex show has been particularly hardhit,
even though it's "still the best known IT event brand in the U.S.,"
said Michael Hughes, research director at the industry publication
Tradeshow Week. After drawing 211,625 people and 2,337 exhibitors two
years ago, Comdex garnered 124,613 visitors and 1,685 exhibitors last
fall, the publication said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as more exhibitors pull back for this year, about 125,000
people will attend next week's show, Rosen estimated. Key3Media was
created when the media firm Ziff-Davis Inc., then a unit of Softbank,
spun off its trade show assets in 2000. (Softbank also sold the rest
of Ziff-Davis that year to CNet Networks Inc.) Key3Media then sold a
minority stock interest to the public, with Softbank retaining a
controlling stake.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, with a net worth exceeding $70 million, is a blunt,
aggressive executive who gained wealth, fame and controversy at
Ticketmaster. A small ticketing outfit when he took control in 1982,
Ticketmaster grew into the dominant U.S. ticketing company and was
selling 70 million tickets annually when it was sold in 1998 to Barry
Diller's USA Networks. (Diller's current company, USA Interactive,
still controls Ticketmaster.)</TE>
<TE>   A key part of Ticketmaster's success was signing venue owners to
exclusive relationships by sharing ticket revenues. The growth of
Internet commerce also bolstered the firm. But Rosen's sharp elbows
gained him a fair number of enemies, and at one point the Justice
Department probed the company on antitrust grounds, though it
declined to take further action.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen now has to deal with salvaging Key3Media, and he might not
be around after it's sold or restructured. "Whether I stay in this
business or decide I want to do something else, time will tell," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And when asked if he's at all to blame for Key3Media's failure,
Rosen said of himself: "It happened during your watch." But given the
ferocity of the external forces that damaged Key3Media, he said, "I'm
not sure anybody else could have done anything different."</TE>

<CX>   Key3Media debt -- A Business section story Friday about Key3Media
Group Inc. and Chairman Fredric Rosen noted that the company took
more than $640 million in charges this year to write down the value
of its technology trade shows. A majority of the charges relate to
shows that Key3Media owned before Rosen became its chairman in 2000
-- including its largest show, Comdex -- and the rest relate to
properties the company acquired since then.</CX>

<HD>Retail Sales Gains Send Stocks Higher</HD>
<DH>Decline in new jobless benefit applications also buoys
market. Bond yields notch biggest daily rise in a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rallied Thursday and bond yields registered their biggest
one-day rise in a year after retail sales outside the auto sector
posted a surprising gain, spurring hopes that U.S. consumers will
continue spending and keep driving an economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 143.64 points, or
1.7%, to 8,542.13.</LD>
<LD>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 21.74 points, or
2.5%, to 904.27, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
jumped 50.18 points, or 3.7%, to 1,411.52.</LD>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales excluding autos gained 0.7% in October, their biggest
gain in six months and ahead of economists' forecasts. Consumer
spending accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's given new confidence to people that maybe the economy will
start turning around at a better pace than was expected," said James
Volk, director of trading at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales that included auto sales were flat, the Commerce
Department said, but better than the decline of 0.2 % forecast by
economists.</TE>
<TE>   In other good news for stocks, a Labor Department report showing a
second straight week of declines in new applications for jobless
benefits offered hopes that the job market may be struggling out of a
weak patch.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always nervous about fourth-quarter earnings and
Christmas, but so far it doesn't feel so bad," said Arnie Owen,
managing director of equities at Roth Capital Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying fundamentals are starting to come into play to
take this market higher," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic news sent bond yields soaring. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped to 4.06% from Wednesday's
close of 3.84%. Fixed-income traders, like many investors, had bet
heavily that the economic data would be so weak as to raise the
possibility of a double-dip recession and drag yields lower.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes that a possible attack on Iraq could be delayed or avoided
also spurred stocks higher after Iraq accepted a U.N. resolution on
disarmament Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraq situation has a big effect on stock prices and people's
sentiment as a whole," said Michael O'Hare, head of block trading at
Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "It has taken some of the fear away from the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Gold, a traditional safe haven, fell 80 cents to $317.90 an ounce
in New York, adding to Wednesday's steep losses. Oil inched up 10
cents a barrel to $25.29.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * HSBC's offer to acquire Household International  sent other
consumer financial stocks higher, as the S&amp;P consumer financial index
rose 8.3%. American Express climbed $1.75 to $36.95, Providian
Financial added 51 cents to $4.98, and Capital One Financial rose
$1.84 to $30. MBNA added 94 cents to $21.29. U.S.-traded shares of
HSBC fell $1.85 to $54.20 while Household climbed $5.04 to $27.50, a
22% gain.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel helped buoy Nasdaq, rising $1.09 to $19.21 after the chip
maker said it increased its stock buyback program by 480 million
shares. Intel helped spark a nearly 8% rise in the SOX semiconductor
index.</TE>
<TE>   * Other winners included No. 3 U.S. retailer Target, which jumped
$3.46 or 11.5% to $33.49 after the company reported a 50% rise in
quarterly earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * China Telecom shares fell $1.02 to $17.96 in their New York
trading debut. Weak demand forced the Beijing-based company to cut by
60% what would have been Asia's biggest initial public offering this
year.</TE>
<TE>   * Honeywell International fell $2.09 to $23.16 after the company
said it may contribute up to $900 million to its employee pension
plans after assets tumbled this year. The stock, a Dow component, was
the fifth-most actively traded issue on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Probes Hurting Martha Stewart's Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The insider trading scandal engulfing Martha Stewart is hurting
nearly every aspect of business at her namesake company, the firm
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia said in a regulatory filing that
investigations into Stewart's sale of stock in ImClone Systems are
hurting advertising revenue at the flagship Martha Stewart Living
magazine and television show.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot currently predict with any certainty the extent of the
impact these investigations will continue to have on our business,"
the company said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The only sizable segment of Martha Stewart Living's business that
has not been hurt by the scandal is its retail business with Kmart,
which sells the Martha Stewart Everyday line of housewares. But
because of Kmart's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and declining sales,
Martha Stewart Living said it expects "royalties earned under our
agreement with Kmart to be at approximately the minimum contractual
amount for the full year 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's sale of ImClone shares, which came a day before the drug
maker announced a damaging ruling from the Food and Drug
Administration on its key cancer drug, is being investigated by the
SEC and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has notified Stewart's legal team it has enough evidence
to file a civil suit against her, which could result in her being
forced to step down as chief executive and chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia rose 3 cents to close at
$8.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Economic Recovery Seen as Key to Reviving Merger Activity</HD>
<DH>This year is on track for the lowest dollar value of
announced deals since 1994.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Could the $14.2-billion takeover of Household International by
banking giant HSBC Holdings spark a resurgence in the moribund merger
market?</LD>
<LD>   Many analysts are doubtful, for a number of reasons -- including
the uncertain economic environment and the fact that the shares of
many would-be acquirers are depressed, making them reluctant to give
their stock away.</LD>
<LD>   "Because stock prices are beaten down, firms are still reluctant
to merge," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
in Minneapolis. "With cash, you are limited. It's hard to come up
with $14 billion in cash. The key is economic recovery that will lead
to an increase in stock prices. You need both for merger activity to
revive."</LD>
<TE>   That didn't stop HSBC from offering stock for Household, however.
Though HSBC shares are below their 2001 peak, Household's stock has
been far more depressed, apparently making it a bargain in HSBC's
view.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this year is on track for the lowest dollar-value of
announced merger deals since 1994, according to data-tracker Thomson
Financial.</TE>
<TE>   Through the third quarter, the number of announced mergers,
including those between U.S. companies and those between U.S. and
foreign companies, totaled 5,480, down from 6,647 in the same period
of 2001, according to Mergerstat.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar value of deals announced was $336 billion in the first
nine months of this year, down from $540 billion a year earlier and
$1.02 trillion in the same period of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to tell if this marks a resurgence," Richard
Peterson, analyst for Thomson, said of the Household deal.</TE>
<TE>   Other big deals this year have included Pfizer Inc.'s planned
purchase of Pharmacia Corp., announced in July, and Northrop Grumman
Corp.'s planned purchase of TRW Inc., announced in February.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers are telling their corporate clients that
because many companies can be bought for the lowest share prices in
years, more deals make sense. Also, the cost of money at banks, or to
borrow via high-quality bonds, is at generational lows.</TE>
<TE>   If economic growth remains subpar, industry consolidation should
accelerate because companies will need to gain market share, bankers
say.</TE>
<TE>   "In a slow-growth economy, the way to create shareholder value
could be through consolidation," said Bob Levitt, co-head of the
Western region for investment banker Lehman Bros. in Los Angeles.
"For a healthy company, access to capital is quite strong at low
rates. There are also some good businesses selling at very low
prices."</TE>
<TE>   "The HSBC transaction is one of the biggest we've seen in a long
time," said Mark Clemente, a corporate strategist and co-author of
"Winning at Mergers and Acquisitions" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998).
"Maybe it will remind CEOs that, when a deal makes sense --
especially one that will significantly bolster a company's market
standing and global capacities, as well as present substantive
cost-reduction opportunities -- it should be done."</TE>
<TE>   But for many CEOs, the bottom line is confidence in the business
outlook -- something many corporate chiefs lack.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a Business Roundtable survey of executives at
150 major companies showed that almost two-thirds expect the economy
to grow at a rate of less than 2% next year, far below the 3.2%
annual rate of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty percent of the CEOs said they expect to cut employment
levels in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "You need CEO confidence for mergers to recover," investment
banker Levitt said. "That's the hardest to measure, and the most
critical barometer."</TE>

<HD>Attempt to Develop Aircraft Plant in Long Beach Nose Dives</HD>
<DH>Mooney Aerospace had hoped to produce its now-scrubbed
Jetcruzer 500 at the factory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A salvage company moved into the sprawling Long Beach Airport hangar
of Mooney Aerospace Group this week, packing up tools and equipment
and a decade-old dream of creating a new aircraft manufacturer in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   At an adjacent office complex, a lone employee locked the doors
and drew his finger across his throat, signaling to a visitor that
Mooney's operations in Long Beach were dead.</LD>
<LD>   Formerly known as Advanced Aerodynamics &amp; Structures Inc., the
company was founded in a quest to develop from scratch a
futuristic-looking six-seat turboprop called the Jetcruzer 500.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of retired Southern California aerospace engineers rushed
to invest in the company's 1996 initial public offering, excited
about backing a new venture that would need to mine Southern
California's deep vein of aeronautical expertise.</TE>
<TE>   It was a chance to be a part of a long and storied history that
helped shape the region's economy since before World War II. Southern
Californians have designed and built everything from the space
shuttle to the stealth bomber to the DC-10 passenger jet. Factories
in Long Beach, Santa Monica, Burbank and Palmdale together formed the
center of the nation's aircraft industry, turning out tens of
thousands of commercial and military planes.</TE>
<TE>   The region remains a hub of aerospace research and development.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the Cold War, though, aircraft factory jobs in
Los Angeles County have plunged from a recent peak of 124,900 in 1987
to only 43,700 last month, according to state data.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it looked like Mooney might help raise those numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the company employed more than 130 aircraft
designers and other workers in Long Beach. Then-Chief Executive Carl
Chen boasted that the firm was close to winning certification from
the Federal Aviation Administration for the Jetcruzer. The company
had collected $10,000 deposits on 188 aircraft, each carrying a list
price of $1.5 million. The former Hughes Aircraft engineer talked of
putting a larger, 12-seat business jet in production and adding 1,000
workers to the factory floor.</TE>
<TE>   Funds for his plans came via private financing from Taiwanese
investors, a New York money management firm and from its IPO.
Although thinly traded, the shares rose nearly 50% from $4.50 at the
end of the first day of trading in April 1996 to a high of $6.56 in
May 1998. (They trade now for only pennies.)</TE>
<TE>   Chen spent heavily on plant and equipment, including a high-tech
autoclave used to cure the Jetcruzer's composite fuselage. But
despite his rosy predictions, the program suffered numerous technical
setbacks and the Jetcruzer 500 never received FAA approval.</TE>
<TE>   Designed to fly 345 mph at an altitude of up to 30,000 feet, the
plane had a small wing in the front and a large one in the rear and
an aft-mounted engine. But flight tests discovered that the prototype
was too heavy, too noisy and too ungainly to be viable. By one
company estimate, it could cost $30 million or more to fix the
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Chen was ousted from the company in January and the Jetcruzer
project was shelved. The company brought in Roy Norris, another
veteran general aviation executive who developed a new business plan:
The company would look to purchase the production rights for existing
lines of small aircraft from other manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   His first move was to purchase Kerrville, Texas-based Mooney
Aircraft Corp. out of bankruptcy for $9 million in cash and stock.
Although smaller than Piper and Cessna, Mooney once was a
well-regarded maker of small piston-driven planes but had stumbled
after a number of management miscues.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Aerodynamics pumped an additional $12 million into
resuming production of Mooney piston-driven airplanes at the
company's Texas factory.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Advanced Aerodynamics changed its name to Mooney
Aerospace Group. So far, it has sold 12 of the piston engine
aircraft, which cost $300,000 to $400,000. Though its designs are
about five decades old, about 10,000 Mooney aircraft still are
flying.</TE>
<TE>   Norris envisioned the Mooney purchase as just the first step, but
the board balked at his vision of quickly building a large aerospace
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "It just wasn't feasible for such a small company," remarked
another Mooney executive.</TE>
<TE>   Norris abruptly resigned in August and the company tapped former
Cessna executive L. Peter Larson to take over.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as two weeks ago, Larson was providing upbeat
assessments of the company's future. He told The Times that he
intended to keep the engineering and sales divisions headquartered in
Long Beach but leave manufacturing in Texas, where labor and other
expenses are cheaper. He said Mooney could be profitable with only 60
aircraft sales a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, though, the board fired Larson, other executives and
decided to shutter its 205,000-square-foot airplane factory and
office complex. What's left will be relocated to Texas, giving the
company breathing room to reduce expenses and recast itself as a
maker of more conventional piston-driven planes.</TE>
<TE>   One person familiar with the company's finances said it was
burning through as much as $700,000 a month in cash on salaries and
rent at its Long Beach complex.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Mooney's restructuring is expected be completed by today,
according to sources familiar with the situation. About 20 workers
are losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We just could not afford to have executives here and the
manufacturing in Texas," said J. Nelson Happy, who was named Mooney's
chief executive last week. "What we pay for people and the plant in
Texas is just a fraction of Long Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Larson nor Chen was available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Happy, a former chief executive of Flight International Group,
agrees with Larson's assessment that Mooney can become marginally
profitable by selling only 60 aircraft annually.</TE>
<TE>   "At 100 a year this is a home run," Happy said.</TE>
<TE>   But for that to work, the company still must shed the $150,000 to
$200,0000 a month it pays for its long-term lease on the factory and
associated expenses to become profitable. Mooney is negotiating with
its landlord and prospective sublease tenants to extricate itself
from its Long Beach facility, Happy said.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Mooney's survival remains a long shot, said Richard
Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys don't have a modern aircraft, they don't have much of
a logistics and sales network compared to a company like Cessna and
they don't have deep pockets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aboulafia said there is almost no money to be made selling
piston-driven aircraft such as Mooney's. But "at least they now have
an aircraft that they can fly and sell," he added. And that's "better
than what they had when the company was Advanced Aerodynamics."</TE>

<HD>Roxio Expected to Win Bid for Napster</HD>
<DH>The firm probably will acquire the technology in a sale
approved by a bankruptcy judge.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Song-swapping phenomenon Napster Inc. may return from the grave in a
form that allows digital songs to be burned onto compact discs and
sends payments to copyright holders.</LD>
<LD>   Roxio Inc., the top seller of CD-burning software, is expected to
be announced today as the favored bidder for Napster's technology,
the Napster.com domain name and the Napster brand, one of the most
widely recognized on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   It had not been known that Roxio was negotiating with Napster's
creditors and a court-appointed trustee overseeing its reorganization
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   The anticipated disclosure is remarkable because of the Silicon
Valley firm's good relations with Microsoft Corp., computer companies
and record labels, whose landmark lawsuit against Napster pushed it
into bankruptcy in June.</TE>
<TE>   Roxio's programs are included on many personal computers, allowing
users to burn both unencrypted and encrypted songs and other types of
files onto CDs. It also is included in Pressplay, a service backed by
major labels that lets consumers store digital music and put some of
the tracks on CDs in exchange for monthly fees.</TE>
<TE>   The labels have been offering more burnable content, which
analysts say is needed before consumers will pay money to authorized
online music services. Pirated music in the unrestricted MP3 format
became widely available through the Napster directory and is easily
obtainable on such successor peer-to-peer networks as Kazaa and
Morpheus.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on my relationships and general discussions with the
labels, I think they will be excited at this announcement," Roxio
Chief Executive Chris Gorog said Thursday. "They know that anything
that Roxio will do in this space will be respectful of artist rights
and will be working toward a commercial solution."</TE>
<TE>   Under sale procedures approved Thursday by a bankruptcy judge in
Wilmington, Del., rival suitors will have just one week to top the
bid of $5 million in cash and warrants to buy 100,000 shares of
Roxio, a publicly traded company based in Santa Clara, Calif. Roxio
shares closed Thursday at $3.38, up 31 cents in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   The judge permitted the bidding process to continue over the
last-minute objection of John Fanning, Napster's former chairman. His
lawyers said he was "the reputed owner" of Napster's popular cat logo
and the unused Napster.net domain name.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the sale is scheduled for Nov. 27. Much of the money
will go to pay administrative costs from the bankruptcy proceedings,
with the remainder to be sorted out as claims are settled in the
coming months. Napster's shareholders will get nothing, but its
unsecured creditors "should get something, whether it's 5 cents or 10
cents" on the dollar, said creditors' attorney Rick Antonoff.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming a bankruptcy reorganization plan is confirmed next year,
Roxio will emerge free of Napster's liabilities, including the
unresolved copyright claims.</TE>
<TE>   Gorog gave few details about how Napster's technology will be
used, and it was unclear whether Napster's peer-to-peer system will
be revived. Before the company's demise, it was testing a
second-generation system that allowed for payment streams, the
expiration of songs and other restrictions on their use. It folded
the initial version in July 2001 after a San Francisco federal
appeals court ruled that the system allowed tens of millions of users
to evade copyright laws.</TE>
<TE>   Gorog gave founder Shawn Fanning the news Thursday and said he
hopes to interest him in working with Roxio. Fanning, 21, had no
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always viewed Napster and the promise of Shawn's vision as
being the celestial jukebox, not free music," Gorog said. "One
teenager not only revolutionized the way music will be distributed,
but also movies and the spoken word. Whatever we do will flow from
that philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   Roxio was the most generous among a number of bidders that stepped
up after the Bankruptcy Court blocked Bertelsmann, owner of the BMG
label, from acquiring Napster's assets in September. The German media
conglomerate had loaned Napster tens of millions of dollars to keep
it afloat and also hoped to legitimize the technology, but the judge
found it was too close to Napster's management when the takeover was
negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent quarter, Roxio reported a loss of $1.8 million,
or 9 cents a share, on sales of $27.9 million. It had more than $42
million in cash and short-term investments on hand. Gorog became
Roxio's CEO in 2000, after jobs at Universal Studios Recreation
Group, Walt Disney Co. and ITC Entertainment Group.</TE>

<HD>Web Firm NextCard Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>The online credit card issuer is seeking to reorganize as a
financial services consultant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Liedtke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online credit card issuer NextCard Inc. sought bankruptcy protection
Thursday in a last-ditch attempt to come back as a financial services
consultant.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 filing, in a Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, had been
anticipated. Federal regulators seized San Francisco-based NextCard's
bank nine months ago and then cut off its credit card operations in
July.</LD>
<LD>   The company had been staying afloat under a service contract with
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The agency ended the arrangement
Oct. 31.</LD>
<TE>   A onetime darling of the dot-com boom, NextCard got into trouble
with regulators a year ago after issuing too many credit cards to
deadbeat borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard listed the taxpayer-backed FDIC as its largest creditor
with a debt of $140 million. In court papers, the company said the
FDIC last month agreed to waive the obligation in exchange for a
stake in NextCard's reorganized business or part of the proceeds if
the business is liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the FDIC figures to sustain a substantial loss on
NextCard's failure. The agency previously has estimated its losses on
NextCard could run as high as $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating NextCard's
downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its problems, NextCard says it can survive as a consultant
to other financial services firms. NextCard "believes that such
institutions can derive significant value from [the company's]
intellectual property," Robert Linderman, the company's general
counsel, said in a sworn declaration.</TE>
<TE>   If its reorganization plan doesn't pan out, NextCard said it will
liquidate. There doesn't appear to be much left for creditors. As of
Sept. 30, NextCard said it had $18 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the FDIC, NextCard's major creditors include Amazon.com
Inc., which is seeking $10.5 million for an alleged breach of
contract. NextCard disagrees with Amazon's claim.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing didn't elaborate on the nature of the
dispute. Seattle-based Amazon.com, which owns an 8% stake in
NextCard, had operated an incentive program that rewarded customers
who ran up big balances on NextCard's Visa cards.</TE>
<TE>   NextCard once promised to revolutionize the credit card business.
Its comedown has hurt shareholders, customers and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock, which peaked at $53.12 a share in late 1999,
is virtually worthless. About 800,000 NextCard customers abruptly
lost access to their credit lines in July when the FDIC shut down
their accounts. Only 19 employees remain on a NextCard payroll that
peaked at 925 employees in early 2001.</TE>

<HD>New Yorkers Take a Swing at L.A. Pitch</HD>
<DH>A local delegation of civic and business leaders tries to
sell Manhattan investors on the value of downtown real estate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- A crowd of about 75 New York real estate pros was happy
enough to hear that downtown Los Angeles has the Staples Center, a
glittering new cathedral, good freeway and rail links and a
soon-to-open Frank Gehry-designed concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   But what about schools and grocery stores, the New Yorkers wanted
to know.</LD>
<LD>   For a delegation of business and civic leaders who staged a
one-stop road show Thursday in Manhattan to boost investment in
downtown L.A., it was an encouraging line of inquiry.</LD>
<TE>   The questions, which came at the end of a 90-minute breakfast
meeting in the posh Plaza Hotel, showed that Gothamites were thinking
about amenities that would support the center city's residential life
rather than just its commercial and entertainment aspects.</TE>
<TE>   They understood that it was residential development -- not stock
brokerages, banks or law firms -- that finally brought nightlife to
downtown Manhattan not so many years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angelenos were glad to provide answers.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Broad, chairman of AIG SunAmerica Inc. and chief of the L.A.
delegation, said state and Los Angeles Unified School District bond
issues that passed in the Nov. 5 election would provide millions of
dollars for charter schools and public schools in the center city.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose 9th District includes most of
downtown, added that an Albertson's supermarket was about to open on
Flower Street to serve the growing residential population.</TE>
<TE>   In investment terms, the central message of Thursday's sales pitch
was that downtown L.A. is a value play -- overlooked,
underappreciated and, unlike some real estate hot spots on both
coasts today, not close to being a bubble.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation included John C. Cushman III, chairman of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield; Timothy J. Leiweke, president of Staples Center owner
Anschutz Entertainment Group; Bob Graziano, president of the Los
Angeles Dodgers; Carol Schatz, head of the Downtown Center Business
Improvement District; and Jonathan Kevles, deputy mayor of economic
development.</TE>
<TE>   A number of New Yorkers didn't need to be sold; they're already
invested in downtown L.A. The audience included, for example,
representatives of Praedium Group, which bought a Wilshire Boulevard
office building last spring; and TIAA-CREF, the big teachers pension
fund, which also has a commercial building on Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen M. Ross, chairman of Related Cos., developer of the
$1.8-billion AOL Time Warner Center off Central Park here, quipped in
an interview after the breakfast that Los Angeles probably has all
the developers it needs. He said, however, that his firm has two
residential projects in Little Tokyo and is well aware of the area's
progress.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hughes, a principal of Praedium, said he was impressed to
learn that architectural and engineering firms are moving downtown.
Such middle-market tenants often participate in the bargain-hunting
phase of a city's resurgence, to be followed later by bigger
corporate fish.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who heads an investment consulting firm in
Manhattan, said the meeting made her want to at least consider
downtown as a potential real estate bargain for some of her
commercial clients.</TE>

<HD>Study Shows an Increase in Overlap of Radio Playlists</HD>
<DH>The report by an artists' rights group says that more
stations with different formats play the same songs. Industry
officials disagree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the Clinton administration loosened restrictions on how
many radio stations a broadcaster could own, record label executives
have complained that media consolidation would lead to bland
playlists and homogenous programming.</LD>
<LD>   Now a coalition of musicians and independent record label
executives say they have statistical proof that the relaxation of
ownership rules has stifled recording artists and "damaged radio as a
public resource." The study was done by the Future of Music
Coalition, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that advocates
artists' rights.</LD>
<LD>   The study, to be released Monday, found that although radio
station chains have increased the number of music formats available
on the air, they are increasingly playing similar lists of songs. For
example, the study found that 76% of the 50 most-played songs on
stations labeling themselves as "contemporary hit radio/rhythmic"
also are among the 50 most-played songs on stations considering
themselves "urban." According to the study, the amount of overlap
between these two formats in the last four years has increased 18%.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the study says, radio companies that have grown the most
under deregulation are limiting the choice of music by operating two
or more stations in the same market with the same music format. The
report said that Clear Channel Communications Inc., the nation's
biggest radio conglomerate, has 143 stations with similar music
formats in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   The study contradicts the conclusions of a September report by the
Federal Communications Commission. That report found that song
diversity had remained about the same since 1996. But that study
looked at only the top 10 songs played at each station.</TE>
<TE>   In the Future of Music Coalition report, the authors say that
radio broadcasters may be developing similar playlists in response to
shifting consumer tastes. But the report also includes a public
opinion poll in which respondents said they were dissatisfied with
the state of radio programming.</TE>
<TE>   The report also echoed complaints from record labels and small
broadcasters, who say deregulation has handed too much control to a
handful of giant media companies, including Clear Channel and Viacom
Inc.'s Infinity Broadcasting, which operates more than 180 stations.</TE>
<TE>   Radio industry officials dismissed the study's conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "The big gap in the logic is that the authors don't believe radio
stations care about what consumers do," said Jodie Renk, general
manager of Core Callout Research, a firm that tests new songs with
radio listeners. "Stations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a
year finding out what their listeners care about. The concept of
these oligopolies agreeing that they're all going to not serve
listeners is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   Diane Warren, a spokeswoman for Clear Channel, agreed. "We spent a
lot of time and money finding out what our listeners want. If we
don't give it to them, they will go elsewhere."</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Unit's Rating Cut After Default</HD>

<LD>PG&amp;E Corp.'s troubled National Energy Group subsidiary failed to make
a $431-million debt payment Thursday and Standard &amp; Poor's cut the
unit's credit rating to D, its lowest rating.</LD>
<LD>   NEG is San Francisco-based PG&amp;E's unregulated arm, which builds
and operates power plants and trades energy. That segment of the
energy industry has been slammed by the collapse of Enron Corp., low
power prices and tight credit.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E Chief Executive Robert D. Glynn Jr. said Wednesday that NEG
did not have enough cash to pay several debts, including a
$431-million principal payment on a revolving credit line due
Thursday, a $52-million bond interest payment today and nearly $900
million in other debts due next year.</LD>

<HD>And the Winner Is ... Real Estate Mogul on the Prowl for
Location</HD>
<DH>Donald Trump has choices, but will he be welcome?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Los Angeles ready for more of The Donald?</LD>
<LD>   New York real estate mogul Donald Trump swept into town last
weekend to tout his purchase of the Ocean Trails Golf Course in
Rancho Palos Verdes, telling one and all that he hoped to soon change
the name to Trump National Golf Course.</LD>
<LD>   Yet his acquisition of the links is unlikely to sate his urge to
make a mark on the City of Angels, Trump himself admitted. Another
Trump Something-or-Other is bound to spring up on the L.A. horizon
before too long.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview, Trump noted that he likes to do more than one
real estate project in an area, and that he intends to get another
going here within 18 months. "I would not be surprised if I came to
Los Angeles and built Trump Tower," he said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, real estate industry veterans have been speculating
about where the flamboyant 56-year-old developer -- who ran into
serious financial trouble in the early 1990s, only to rise again --
may try to locate his next Los Angeles-area showpiece.</TE>
<TE>   In Manhattan, Trump Tower is a 58-story residential complex, where
units sell for as much as $13 million and a five-story atrium boasts
retailers such as Cartier &amp; Asprey and Salvatore Ferragamo.</TE>
<TE>   So, where might a West Coast version appear?</TE>
<TE>   Among the most logical locations in Southern California to build
large-scale luxury housing is downtown Los Angeles, which is enjoying
something of a residential renaissance after half a century of
stagnation. Yet many believe center-city L.A. may not meet Trump's
standards for sizzle.</TE>
<TE>   "He lives in Trump Tower, the eye of the hurricane," said John
Cushman, chairman of real estate services company Cushman &amp; Wakefield
and a friend of Trump's. "Restaurants, hotels, fancy people -- it's a
world that's full of pizazz and style."</TE>
<TE>   Trump raised some hackles when he told The Times earlier that
downtown Los Angeles "has heretofore been sort of a depressing
place."</TE>
<TE>   The qualifying "heretofore" may be significant, though.</TE>
<TE>   Trump made a point to say that downtown is not out of the
question, and he acknowledged that he recently took a look at a
possible remaking of Transamerica Center, three dowdy 1960s office
high-rises that sit southeast of L.A.'s financial district. The
signature 32-story tower on Olive Street and two smaller buildings
nearby, a source said, are being purchased from Dutch insurance
company Aegon for $85 million by New Pacific Realty, a Beverly Hills
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Trump said he was asked to consider whether he'd lend his name to
a project in which the property would be converted to residential and
retail space. But he said he decided not to get involved. "I didn't
like the location," Trump said.</TE>
<TE>   Location is, in fact, a critical part of Trump's glossy image,
which he shrewdly markets to investors and consumers. Ocean Trails, a
seaside golf course with stunning vistas, has the kind of wow factor
he demands. "If it were 200 yards off the ocean," he said, "I
wouldn't have bought it."</TE>
<TE>   Trump's flirtation with Los Angeles is not his first.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he took a run at creating a spectacular Los
Angeles development when a partnership of his tied up the site of the
shuttered Ambassador Hotel in Wilshire Center and announced plans to
build a 125-story high-rise. He ran into opposition, however, from
the Los Angeles Unified School District. Through legal proceedings,
the district seized the property to use as a school -- a setback for
Trump that he is still smarting over. At Ocean Trails, Trump
digressed from talking about golf to blast "these stupid people" at
the school district.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, some real estate industry insiders, including
Cushman, think Trump may be inclined to look farther west.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills, with its elite international reputation, is already
an address that appeals to Trump. When he comes to Los Angeles, he
likes to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel or the Four Seasons Beverly
Hills. But the city with the famous zip code -- 90210 -- also has a
height restriction on new multifamily buildings of a mere three
stories. That limits the grandness of any tower aspiring to be called
"Trump."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby Century City has some of the finest high-rise office and
residential buildings in the region, along with spectacular views of
Los Angeles, adjacent golf courses and Fox studios.</TE>
<TE>   However, area brokers say it also has some downsides for any
would-be Trump project: It is very nearly built-out, and the
neighbors have shown they are willing to fight hard to hold off
additional development. They've been known to make even the biggest
builders miserable.</TE>
<TE>   Farther west lies Wilshire Boulevard's residential high-rise
canyon, the region's largest cluster of expensive condominiums. Some
flats sell for millions of dollars. But there's a catch there, too:
One of the reasons prices are so high is that few, if any,
skyscraper-approved lots are available on the open market. What's
more, the area has practically no shops or restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   If Trump wants ocean views and urbanity, say local real estate
experts, Santa Monica would probably top the list of candidates. The
city is a vacation destination for sophisticated travelers from
around the world and also has a vibrant nightlife.</TE>
<TE>   Yet putting together a deal there wouldn't be easy either. It is
notoriously difficult to garner support for large-scale projects in
Santa Monica, and the swashbuckling Trump image may be at odds with
local sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Monica is very sensitive," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "If they won't
let in a Target store, will they let in a Trump? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Which may, in the end, bring Trump back to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's been regarded as a sleepy place, things have started
picking up. The rooftop bar at the Standard Hotel on Flower Street,
for example, is routinely packed. And several high-end restaurants,
such as the Palm and Zucca, have begun to do a brisk dinner business.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, downtown offers another big advantage: Civic leaders are
already working overtime to create sparks there, and they are likely
to embrace any developer who could bring some real heat.</TE>
<TE>   "Where would Trump be welcomed with open arms? Downtown," Kyser
said. "People would be falling and kissing the hem of his garment."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Announces Bond Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal announced plans to sell as much as $1 billion in
convertible bonds, raising funds that it may use to increase its
stake in France's second-largest phone company.</LD>
<LD>   The bonds will be priced at 21% to 26% over the shares' current
market value. The sale "strengthens [Vivendi's] capacity to
potentially act in the operations taking place around [French telecom
business] Cegetel," the company said in a note to the French stock
market regulator.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou weighs
whether to counter Vodafone Group's offer for Cegetel.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi is battling with Vodafone for control of Cegetel, which
owns France's No. 2 wireless operator.</TE>
<TE>   It has until Dec. 10 to accept Vodafone's offer for its 44% stake
in Cegetel or make a bid of its own for a controlling stake.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Thursday, Vivendi Universal's online
division, VU Net USA, disclosed that it would cut about 50 jobs from
the division to reduce expenses and streamline operations.</TE>
<TE>   The layoffs will affect employees at the division's offices in Los
Angeles, New York and Chicago, leaving the two groups with about 275
employees.</TE>

<HD>Congress Close to Approving Webcast Royalties Measure</HD>
<DH>The bill passed by the Senate would suspend fees online
broadcasters must pay to record labels and artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to rescue small Internet radio stations, Congress was close to
approving a last-minute compromise late Thursday night that would
temporarily suspend the royalty fees many Webcasters must pay to
record labels and artists.</LD>
<LD>   The main question was whether the House would pass the revised
version of H.R. 5469 before it adjourned for the year. The
compromise, which has broad support from broadcasters, labels and
artists, passed the Senate unanimously Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The new Webcasting bill does not solve most of the problems faced
by Internet radio stations, and many proponents of the compromise
urged Congress to try again next year to overhaul the way royalties
are set. But if passed, the measure would clear the way for small
Webcasters to obtain discounted rates that better reflect their
ability to pay, rather than simply the volume of music they play.</LD>
<TE>   The latest version of H.R. 5469 was the third attempt by lawmakers
to preserve at least some of the free-wheeling nature and diversity
of Internet radio, much of which is provided by small businesses,
community and college broadcasters and hobbyists. Many of those
Webcasters complained that they would be driven out of business if
they had to pay the royalty rates set by the Librarian of Congress in
July.</TE>
<TE>   Those rates -- .07 cent per song per listener for commercial
stations, .02 cent per song for noncommercial ones -- were based on a
deal that Yahoo Inc., one of the Internet's largest broadcasters,
negotiated with the Recording Industry Assn. of America. The
Librarian ordered Webcasters to pay four years' worth of back
royalties Oct. 20, prompting many stations to run to Congress for
relief.</TE>
<TE>   The House unanimously passed a version of H.R. 5469 in October
that would have let qualified small Webcasters pay royalties of
either 8% to 12% of their revenues or 5% to 7% of their expenses,
whichever was greater.</TE>
<TE>   But the quick passage in the House belied the growing opposition
to the bill among an array of over-the-air broadcasters and
Webcasters, who argued that the rates were unacceptably high. They
also feared that the measure would set a dangerous precedent, helping
record labels and even songwriters win higher royalties from
broadcasters in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to these complaints, Sen. Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
stopped the Senate from taking up the House bill last month. On
Thursday, Helms and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) offered a compromise version that the RIAA had negotiated
with a trade association of religious broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of enacting specific fees for small Webcasters, the
Helms-Leahy version gives SoundExchange -- the royalty-collecting arm
of the RIAA -- the right to negotiate retroactive discounts with
small Webcasting businesses and noncommercial stations. Any deals
with commercial Webcasters must be based on a percentage of their
revenues, their expenses, or both.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also suspends royalties for noncommercial, community and
college Webcasters until June 20, giving them time to negotiate a
deal with SoundExchange. And it would let Sound- Exchange delay
royalties for small commercial Webcasters until Dec. 15 so that they
can finalize their own discounts.</TE>
<TE>   The bill includes a provision calling for 50% of the royalties to
be paid directly to artists, as well as a more controversial section
allowing SoundExchange to deduct certain administrative costs before
paying royalties to labels and artists.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Roe of Radioio, a small Internet station involved in the
earlier deal with the RIAA, praised the bill but said it was just the
first step needed to help Webcasters. "Sure, we would love to see a
better rate," Roe said, "but that's certainly a manageable rate."</TE>

<HD>GE Seeks Refund From Enron Wind</HD>
<DH>Firm tells bankruptcy judge it overpaid for manufacturing
assets it bought in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Mumma</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. is seeking the refund of almost half the $358
million it paid to an Enron Corp. unit for wind-turbine manufacturing
assets, lawyers told a federal bankruptcy judge in New York on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   After its auditors analyzed the transaction, GE informed Enron
that it wanted $160 million back, Enron attorney Martin Sosland
disclosed in court Thursday. Sosland is representing Enron in its
bankruptcy reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   GE is the largest maker of power-generation equipment.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome might be of interest to other purchasers of Enron
assets, including UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, which bought the
trading business in 2001 for a share of future profits; and YTL
Corp., Malaysia's biggest construction company, which bought another
subsidiary, Wessex Water, for $1.77 billion in May.</TE>
<TE>   "It's standard procedure," said Dennis Murphy, a spokesman for GE
Power Systems, who confirmed the company's refund request.</TE>
<TE>   "Purchasers have certain protections built in. If the purchase
price didn't accurately reflect the value of the asset, we can
petition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy declined to comment on what GE auditors discovered in the
transaction to prompt the request.</TE>
<TE>   Sosland told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez that Enron
would fight the refund request.</TE>
<TE>   GE won a court-supervised auction April 2 after increasing its
offer to Enron Wind Corp. by $100 million, beating out Caterpillar
Inc., among other bidders.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez approved the sale to the GE Power Systems unit for $325
million in cash and about $33 million in assumed debt.</TE>
<TE>   The sale closed in May, and GE touted the transaction in its
second-quarter earnings report, saying the deal "established GE Wind
Energy as a leading presence in the renewable energy industry, which
is growing at nearly 20% a year."</TE>
<TE>   Although Enron Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
December, its Enron Wind unit was a profitable business.</TE>
<TE>   The Tehachapi, Calif.-based company, one of the world's largest
wind turbine operators, saw sales soar to more than $800 million last
year from $50 million in 1997, Chief Executive Adam Umanoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Wind filed for Chapter 11 protection before the court
auction so the sale would be overseen by a bankruptcy judge.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Wind was formed when Enron bought Zond Corp. in 1997 for
about $100 million in cash and stock as part of a plan to develop a
renewable energy unit using new technologies to generate electricity
from the sun, water power and wind. That plan was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the sale to GE, Enron Wind employed about 1,600 people
at 14 sites around the world, including manufacturing plants in
Germany and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had planned to spin off the unit in an initial public
offering, according to Umanoff.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Fairfield, Conn.-based GE gained 41 cents to close at
$24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Former WorldCom Execs, SEC Reach Pact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has approved a settlement between the Securities and
Exchange Commission and two former WorldCom Inc. executives in
connection with the company's multibillion-dollar accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Former WorldCom Controller David F. Myers and former accounting
executive Buford Yates Jr. agreed to settle the SEC's civil lawsuit
against them, according to papers signed Thursday by U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff.</LD>
<LD>   Both men had pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the case in
exchange for leniency, and their side agreements with the SEC were
expected.</LD>
<TE>   Financial penalties were to be determined later, according to
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, whose MCI unit is the No. 2 U.S. long-distance company
with 20 million customers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in July.</TE>
<TE>   Myers and Yates are cooperating with the probe by the Manhattan
U.S. attorney's office of the $9-billion accounting fraud at the
telecommunications giant.</TE>
<TE>   In their earlier pleas in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Myers
and Yates said the orders to falsify WorldCom's ledgers came from the
top levels of corporate management.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan has been indicted
but has maintained his innocence in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said at a hearing Wednesday that WorldCom was close to
settling "portions, though not the entirety" of the SEC's claims
against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, WorldCom was expected to name a new chief executive
today, and former Hewlett-Packard Co. President Michael Capellas is
the front-runner, sources familiar with the situation said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Capellas resigned as HP president Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Details of his compensation and contract were being hammered out
this week, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press and Reuters were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Aon Pulling Plug on Money Market Fund</HD>
<DH>Others in $2.3-trillion industry also may decide to
liquidate as interest rates slip closer to 1%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Insurance broker Aon Corp. is liquidating a money-market mutual fund
with $1.9 billion in assets as falling interest rates make it more
difficult for money funds, among the safest investments, to avoid
losses. And Aon may not be alone.</LD>
<LD>   "We've seen interest rates decline so sharply that there are
alternative investments providing better returns," said Michael
Conway, Aon's senior investment officer and president of Aon Funds
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Aon's Money Market Fund is yielding 1.28%, down from 2.06% a year
ago. Yields on such funds may continue to fall after the Federal
Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point last week to
1.25%, although bond yields jumped Thursday on better-than-expected
economic news.</LD>
<TE>   Money funds, which typically have investments with maturities of
13 months or less, are particularly sensitive to changes in the Fed's
target rate for overnight loans between banks. The 1.05% average
seven-day money fund yield is the lowest in the 31 years that money
funds have existed, said Peter Crane, managing editor of the Money
Fund Report, an industry newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "Two months from now, the average yield will be 0.71% as funds
pass through the entire effect of the rate cut," Crane said.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.3-trillion money fund industry is feeling the pinch. "The
threat of sub-1% returns will probably hasten some existing industry
trends such as consolidation, out-sourcing of fund management and
lower fee structures," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at
Wrightson Associates, a research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Money funds are considered among the safest investments because of
the premise that for every $1 invested, $1 is returned. The
portfolios are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which sets limits on fund exposure to any single corporate borrower.
The funds also have to keep at least 95% of assets in investments
with top credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Funds with high expense ratios, the percentage of assets that go
toward running the fund, may need to waive or lower fees to keep
investors from losing money as yields fall. The average expense ratio
for the industry is about 0.45% as of Oct. 31, according to the Money
Fund Report.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been reducing expenses ever since interest rates fell
below 1.75%," said Jesse Noel, who manages about $430 million at
Potomac Funds. There will be expense reductions because "with rates
as low as they are, we have to try to get as high a return as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Money funds have seen net cash outflows of $36.8 billion this
year, with $31 billion pulled out by individuals and small companies,
according to the Money Fund Report.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be a hundred other banks and insurance firms that are
now wondering why they're in the money fund business," Crane said.</TE>

<HD>Tech Firms to Reveal More About Options</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and 30 other companies that have
resisted treating stock options as an expense will disclose some
option information in quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission
filings.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the companies will begin reporting how many options have
been acquired or exercised by executives, and the portion of options
that go to executives and employees, in their next 10Q filings, trade
groups TechNet and the American Electronics Assn. said Thursday. U.S.
companies currently must include the details in two annual filings --
their 10K report and proxy statement.</LD>
<LD>   Technology companies are devising alternatives aimed at staving
off treating options as a cost, which they contend would slash profit
and hurt recruiting. Some investors and lawmakers say companies
should be required to expense options, and accounting rule makers
plan to decide within a year whether to mandate the switch.</LD>
<TE>   Intel proposed to TechNet earlier this year that computer firms
create a quarterly "equity impact sheet" that would reveal the number
of options grants, the timetable for exercise and the potential
effect on earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "If they think that this is any more than a supplement to
expensing, they're kidding themselves," said Patrick McGurn, director
of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholders Services.
"Everybody but the tech community can see the writing on the wall --
stock option expensing is going to be mandatory in 12 to 24 months."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Chief Wants 12,000 Officers</HD>
<DH>Bratton tells business leaders a 30% increase would be an
investment in better public safety.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said Thursday that the
city needs a minimum of 12,000 police officers -- an increase of more
than 30% over the size of the current force -- to properly patrol the
streets.</LD>
<LD>   "Shame on Los Angeles," Bratton told Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce board members gathered for a luncheon meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "You only have 9,000 cops and a lot of your issues have been a
reluctance to invest -- and I use that word strongly -- invest in
public safety."</LD>
<TE>   The hiring and training of each new LAPD officer costs about
$100,000, mayoral aides said, putting an initial price tag of more
than $300 million on Bratton's vision.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new chief has repeatedly said the force is too small,
he also said in taking the job that he could make major strides in
fighting crime without any additional hires.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after he was chosen for the chief's post last month,
Bratton said that the city's budget crunch made resources scarce and
that increasing the force, even to the already-authorized level of
10,000, would not be possible in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   His statement Thursday was the first in which Bratton has cited a
specific figure that he considers the appropriate number of officers
for the city.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mayor James K. Hahn said that the mayor agrees
"with the chief that we need more cops on the street."</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor also believes, and the chief clearly agrees with him,
that the city can do a much, much better job policing the streets
with the current force than we have been doing," said Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   Additional money for hiring may be found through cuts in existing
programs, Middlebrook said. He said city officials also plan to turn
to Sacramento and Washington for crime-fighting assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the chief's comments prompted incredulity among some City
Council staffers, who emphasized that the city's serious budget
shortfall would make any mass hiring unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton told the business leaders Thursday that a major investment
in local policing would more than pay for itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us a couple of hundred of million more for the nuts and
bolts and it won't be a couple of hundred million back -- it will be
billions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who served as New York City's police commissioner in the
mid-1990s, compared the potential of downtown Los Angeles with the
renaissance of Lower Manhattan neighborhoods, such as Wall Street and
Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   "New York's investment in police -- look at how that paid off,"
Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   When he was sworn in to head the LAPD, Bratton said staffing of
the police force -- which at about one officer per 400 residents has
one of the lowest ratios among the nation's big cities -- needed to
evaluated.</TE>
<TE>   Only recently has the department reversed a trend that had more
sworn officers leaving the department than joining.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he needs as many officers on the street as possible
to implement the brand of community policing that tries to reduce
serious crimes by stopping petty offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for him to do what he wants to do [12,000] is a
reasonable number," said Joe Domanick, a senior fellow at USC's
Annenberg School Institute and author of a history of the LAPD. "He
doesn't just want to do the old -- relying on patrol cars and
reacting to things."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton told the several dozen business leaders that he plans to
"reduce crime, reduce disorder and reduce fear."</TE>
<TE>   He warned that the perception of danger "is as bad as the
reality."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we will end this year with the most murders of any
city in the nation," he said. "New York City will probably have fewer
murders, despite having twice as many residents."</TE>
<TE>   While overall murders are down significantly nationwide from peaks
in the early 1990s, Los Angeles in recent years has failed to match
the declines seen in many other major cities.</TE>
<TE>   Through late October, the NYPD reported 451 homicides in a city of
more than 8 million, down about 10% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD reported 556 homicides as of Nov. 2 in a city of about
3.7 million, up about 10% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing gang violence in Los Angeles to a cancer, Bratton said
it may take some time to determine the appropriate dose of radiation
and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wouldn't beef this department up in times of crisis,"
Bratton said, "maybe you will do it with a success story."</TE>

<HD>Grim Report Sees Huge State Deficit</HD>
<DH>Legislative analyst projects $21-billion gap for 2003-04
and more shortfalls in later years. Showdowns loom over tax hikes,
service cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones and Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California faces a staggering $21.1-billion budget shortfall next
year, the nonpartisan legislative analyst projected Thursday, raising
the specter of reduced government services and higher taxes for the
state's 34 million residents.</LD>
<LD>   The grim report, which launches the debate over the 2003-04
spending plan, sets the stage for a showdown pitting newly reelected
Gov. Gray Davis against the Legislature's weakened Democratic
majority and a rebellious Republican minority that is already vowing
to vote against any budget that raises taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The size of the projected shortfall exceeds even the most
pessimistic predictions of Republicans and independent experts. An
already gaping budget hole could grow by several billion dollars if
the California economy doesn't show marked improvement by mid-2003,
said Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill.</LD>
<TE>   "California policymakers are going to face an enormous challenge
in putting together a general fund budget for 2003-04," Hill said.
"The current shortfall, in our view, is going to be much more
difficult to resolve than last year's fiscal challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Legislature struggled to fill a $23.6-billion
shortfall in the $98.9-billion budget for 2002-03. They ultimately
approved the budget after cobbling together cuts, tax increases and
onetime loans, transfers and fund shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and many independent experts accused Davis and the
Legislature's Democrats of fiscal witchcraft, delaying politically
risky program cuts and other unpopular decisions until after the Nov.
5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Republican legislators and losing GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill
Simon Jr. suggested several billion dollars worth of cuts. But their
proposals fell far short of filling the $23.6-billion budget hole
without raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In the looming debate on the 2003-04 budget, Hill urged the
Legislature to "put everything on the table in terms of all programs
as well as all revenue sources," including tax increases. She also
called on legislators to address the $6.1-billion shortfall now
projected for the 2002-03 budget because of lower tax collections and
higher spending than projected.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis and Democratic legislators face a difficult task in
trying to craft a budget that will fill a huge shortfall while
winning the support of enough Republicans to achieve the required
two-thirds support in the Senate and the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans succeeded in blocking this year's budget for more than
two months. The spending plan won the required two-thirds support in
the Legislature only after Democrats abandoned proposed general tax
increases and agreed to cut spending further. Davis signed the
2002-03 budget on Sept. 5, a record 67 days late.</TE>
<TE>   In this year's budget battle, Davis largely ignored Republican
legislators. But last week, the day after his shaky 5 percentage
point win over Simon, the governor spoke of his desire for greater
bipartisanship in his second term.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Invitation</TE>
<TE>   Davis on Thursday invited Senate and Assembly leaders from both
parties to sit down with him in a "Big 5" meeting next week to
discuss the 2003-04 budget, said Davis Press Secretary Steven
Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who will begin his second term Jan. 6, is required to
propose a balanced budget to the Legislature by Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   He and legislators of both parties face difficult choices.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and some like-minded experts say the state should
avoid tax increases at all costs. They contend that the state could
save billions of dollars by attacking fraud and inefficiency in
various departments and programs.</TE>
<TE>   But many experts say those projections are unproven and overly
optimistic. Those experts -- and most Democrats -- say the solution
has to be a mix of cuts and tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle sounded anything
but conciliatory in comments Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any Republican votes for [higher taxes]," said Senate
Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "I don't feel we
should punish California taxpayers simply because Gov. Davis and
big-spending liberals in Sacramento have ignored what I've been
saying for three years, which was the state was overspending."</TE>
<TE>   Burton Combative</TE>
<TE>   Brulte called on Davis to immediately convene a special session of
the Legislature to conduct a thorough examination of government
spending and possible cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But powerful Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco), a frequent Davis critic, criticized Republicans for
drawing a line in the sand on new taxes and insisting that the budget
should be balanced solely through cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "They have this program of read my lips, 'No new taxes.' Let them
put it out there and see how the people like it," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he would oppose any reductions in aid programs for the
elderly, blind and disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget is not going to be balanced solely on the backs of the
sick and the poor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With a few legislative races still undecided, Republicans have
gained two Assembly seats and appear to have gained one in the
Senate. Democrats dominate both houses -- 26-14 in the current Senate
and 50-30 in the Assembly -- but the budget requires two-thirds
approval, which amounts to 27 votes in the Senate and 54 in the
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer size of the looming shortfall "makes it imperative that
a substantive revenue increase be part of the solution," said Jean
Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an
independent research group that advocates for poorer Californians.
"You can't bridge a gap of that magnitude solely on the spending side
of the budget."</TE>
<TE>   She pointedly challenged Republicans to offer the specifics of how
they propose to fill a massive budget shortfall without raising
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But Larry McCarthy, president of the conservative California
Taxpayers Assn., said the problem was too much state spending.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be adjustments in state spending," he said. "It's
unfortunate that one of the first efforts is to look at revenue."</TE>
<TE>   The analyst's office blamed the looming shortfall in large part on
the gap between state spending and revenue collections caused by the
stock market decline and the corresponding reduction in state tax
receipts. The office now projects that general fund revenue
collections in 2002-03 will fall $4.1 billion short of projections
and $6.5 billion short of projections in 2003-04 -- largely because
of projected declines in personal income tax receipts, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fiscal condition facing the state of California has
deteriorated substantially, particularly because of the performance
of California's economy," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the legislative analyst's projection, Davis issued a
press release announcing that he was eliminating 6,100 state jobs
retroactive to July 1, saving $300 million and fulfilling his 2002-03
budget commitment to eliminate 6,000 vacant positions, a key
Republican demand. Davis pledged "more cuts in both programs and
positions in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Hill's projections are based on the assumption that the California
economy will continue "muddling along" through the first half of 2003
before showing modest improvement in the second half, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Future Shortfall</TE>
<TE>   In a sobering look beyond the immediate crisis, the analyst also
projected operating shortfalls of between $12 billion and $16 billion
until 2007-08.</TE>
<TE>   "What that means is the state cannot grow out of this
predicament," said Hill. "Instead the Legislature and the governor
will have to take actions in order to get those expenditure and
revenue lines into balance."</TE>

<LD>Shots fired from somewhere on the campus of a Carson elementary
school Thursday wounded a 12-year-old boy and a man across the street
and forced authorities to lock down the school for nearly two hours.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies who responded shortly before 5:30 p.m. to
Ambler Avenue Elementary School found the boy, an Ambler student, and
a 23-year-old man across the street with wounds to their upper
torsos, said Det. Faye Bugarin. They had been standing near a
driveway.</LD>
<LD>   The shots "originated on school grounds," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of schoolchildren and employees who were on campus for an
after-school event were corralled in an auditorium as deputies
searched for the shooter, who was not found.</TE>
<TE>   No one else was hurt and everyone was released by 7:30 p.m.,
Bugarin said. The shooting victims were hospitalized and reported in
stable condition.</TE>

<HD>6 Citizens Honored for Heroic Deeds</HD>
<DH>Their actions, taken despite risk to themselves, helped
solve two homicides and two other violent crimes.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney honored six citizens
Thursday for risking their lives to help solve violent crimes,
including a Canoga Park hairstylist who confronted and chased two men
beating a jewelry store owner.</LD>
<LD>   Rooney Regalado of Canoga Park; Enrique and Mialagro Zuniga, Todd
Gunzelman and Chad Robinson, all of North Hollywood; and Lara De Ann,
formerly of Agoura, received Courageous Citizens Awards at a luncheon
in Granada Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "The awards are given to commend those individuals who have acted
at considerable personal risk to help a victim of crime, assist in
the capture of a suspect or testify in the face of extraordinary
pressures," said Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, addressing the honorees
and Northridge Kiwanis Club members, who sponsored the ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   Regalado was honored for an incident in which he saw two men
beating a jewelry store owner next door to his Northridge salon and
chased the suspects as they ran away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every day that a hairstylist helps apprehend dangerous
criminals, but Rooney, a former bouncer, is not your typical
hairstylist," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Regalado saw one of the men toss what appeared to be a gun into
the bushes but continued to chase them, Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   He flagged down a police car and pointed out one of the suspects,
who was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Regalado's testimony, Allen said, Gaik Papazyan
was convicted of murder and sentenced in July to 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   "I only found out afterward that he had a gun and a knife,"
Regalado said after receiving his award.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a scary afterthought."</TE>
<TE>   The Zunigas were honored for stopping their car and rushing to
help a 19-year-old woman being beaten by a male attacker in
September, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Zuniga, a former high school wrestler, chased the man into
a nearby parking lot, placed him in a headlock and held him until
police arrived, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mialagro escorted the woman to where Enrique Zuniga was
holding the attacker so she could identify him for police.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Kevin Lopez, has been charged with attempted rape,
sexual battery and false imprisonment and is awaiting trial, Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   De Ann helped solve a gruesome slaying when she informed Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies that she had seen a man throw an
object down a deep ravine as she walked along Mulholland Highway in
October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators later discovered a man's decapitated body in the
rugged terrain, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The quick recovery of the body enabled investigators to establish
the victim's identity and follow evidence that led to the murder
conviction of Jeffrey Fecht, who was sentenced in March 2001 to life
in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing a loud noise coming from a unit in their North
Hollywood apartment building last January, Gunzelman and Robinson
confronted a man who had broken into their 88-year-old neighbor's
apartment, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Marie Wise.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson wrestled the man to the ground while Gunzelman called
911. They held the suspect until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetrator, Ronald James Sallee, was convicted of residential
robbery and burglary, Wise said. A repeat offender, Sallee faces 40
years to life in prison under California's three-strikes law when he
is sentenced next month.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like a hero because it didn't feel like a big deal
at the time," Robinson said, holding an oversized certificate.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're making me feel like a hero."</TE>

including a Canoga Park hairstylist who confronted and chased two men
beating a jewelry store owner.</LD>
<LD>   Rooney Regalado of Canoga Park; Enrique and Mialagro Zuniga, Todd
Gunzelman and Chad Robinson, all of North Hollywood; and Lara De Ann,
formerly of Agoura, received Courageous Citizens Awards at a luncheon
in Granada Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "The awards are given to commend those individuals who have acted
at considerable personal risk to help a victim of crime, assist in
the capture of a suspect or testify in the face of extraordinary
pressures," said Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, addressing the honorees
and Northridge Kiwanis Club members, who sponsored the ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   Regalado was honored for an incident in which he saw two men
beating a jewelry store owner next door to his Northridge salon and
chased the suspects as they ran away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every day that a hairstylist helps apprehend dangerous
criminals, but Rooney, a former bouncer, is not your typical
hairstylist," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Regalado saw one of the men toss what appeared to be a gun into
the bushes but continued to chase them, Allen said. He flagged down a
police car and pointed out one of the suspects, who was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Regalado's testimony, Allen said Gaik Papazyan
was convicted of murder and sentenced in July to 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   "I only found out afterward that he had a gun and a knife,"
Regalado said after receiving his award. "It's a scary afterthought."</TE>
<TE>   The Zunigas were honored for stopping their car and rushing to
help a 19-year-old woman being beaten by a male attacker in
September, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Zuniga, a former high school wrestler, chased the man into
a nearby parking lot, placed him in a headlock and held him until
police arrived, Thompson said. Meanwhile, Mialagro escorted the woman
to where Enrique Zuniga was holding the attacker so she could
identify him for police.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Kevin Lopez, has been charged with attempted rape,
sexual battery and false imprisonment and is awaiting trial, Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   De Ann helped solve a gruesome slaying when she informed Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies that she had seen a man throw an
object down a deep ravine as she walked along Mulholland Highway in
October 1998. Investigators later discovered a man's decapitated body
in the rugged terrain, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The quick recovery of the body enabled investigators to establish
the victim's identity and follow evidence that led to the murder
conviction of Jeffrey Fecht, who was sentenced in March 2001 to life
in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing a loud noise coming from a unit in their North
Hollywood apartment building last January, Gunzelman and Robinson
confronted a man who had broken into their 88-year-old neighbor's
apartment, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Marie Wise. Robinson wrestled
the man to the ground while Gunzelman called 911. They held the
suspect until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetrator, Ronald James Sallee, was convicted of residential
robbery and burglary, Wise said. A third-striker, Sallee faces 40
years to life in prison when he is sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like a hero because it didn't feel like a big deal
at the time," Robinson said, holding an oversized certificate. "Now
they're making me feel like a hero."</TE>

<HD>Advocates Accuse DWP of High Pollution Levels</HD>
<DH>Consumer group says the utility relies on sources that foul
air and water. Council begins hearings on increasing use of renewable
energy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer group on Thursday branded the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power "the dirtiest municipal utility west of the
Mississippi," citing its reliance on coal and nuclear power to
provide customers with electricity.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Interest Research Group, a statewide
organization, compared the DWP's energy portfolio with those of other
public and private utilities, and found that the DWP's is heavily
stacked with electricity from power plants that produce high levels
of pollution or that burn fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases
linked to global warming.</LD>
<LD>   Only 2% of the city utility's electricity came from so-called
renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, compared with
an average of 12% statewide, the group said in its report. Roughly
50% came from coal power and 12% from nuclear plants.</LD>
<TE>   "The dirty secret here in Los Angeles is that our energy is very
polluting," Martin Schlageter of the Coalition for Clean Air said
during a press conference on the steps of City Hall. "It pollutes our
skies, and it pollutes our water."</TE>
<TE>   The issuing of the report, titled "Clean Energy at the
Crossroads," coincided with the start of hearings by the Los Angeles
City Council on the city's power supplies and with discussion of a
critical audit of the DWP's Green Power program.</TE>
<TE>   The program is intended to offer customers who volunteer to pay
slightly higher utility rates for clean energy, and to use the extra
proceeds to enlarge the city's renewable power portfolio. But the
audit by City Controller Laura Chick found that, while the program
has spent millions marketing itself, it has failed to invest in any
actual new sources of green power.</TE>
<TE>   "An excessive amount of money has been spent on marketing and
promotions without any new proceeds in renewable energy," Chick told
a council committee Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members have been discussing ways to bolster the
city's renewable energy sources, including a proposal by Council
President Alex Padilla to use $95 million from the sale of the city's
share in a coal-burning power plant to purchase cleaner energy.</TE>
<TE>   David H. Wiggs, the general manager of the DWP, told council
members that the municipal utility was doing its own review of the
complaints over the Green Power program and that he was personally
"taking this to heart." He said the agency is developing standards
for expanding renewable energy sources, but with an eye to fiscal
moderation.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla countered that he understood Wiggs' perspective. But he
said that the job of elected officials "is to push the envelope."</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't putting our money where our mouth is on green power,"
Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new state law passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov.
Gray Davis this fall, the state's private utilities are required to
boost their renewable energy supplies to 20% of their overall
portfolio by 2017. But the DWP and other municipal utilities lobbied
behind the scenes to be exempted from the new law. Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford) wrote the energy requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is not required to meet the new state standards, DWP
could easily increase its wind, solar and geothermal power sources to
20% of its overall supplies by 2012, the consumer group argued.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would not only lower pollution, said Eli Richlin of
the California research group, but it would also help the city avoid
the volatile price spikes that California experienced during last
year's energy crisis. Renewable power is considered less susceptible
to cost fluctuations than electricity made from natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has a choice: We can continue to use dirty energy
that is unreliable, or we can use more renewable energy," Richlin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs told the council committee that the DWP will try to move as
close as possible to the state's new 20% renewable energy standard
for private utilities. But he did not commit to any timeline, saying
the agency would try to do so at a reasonable pace.</TE>

<HD>Panel Rejects Secessionists' Claim Hahn Misused Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a letter made public Thursday, the city Ethics Commission
dismissed a complaint filed months ago by San Fernando Valley
separatists over Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaigning.</LD>
<LD>   Secession backers had alleged in an Aug. 3 complaint that Hahn was
using city resources to fight the Valley and Hollywood measures on
the Nov. 5 ballot. State law prohibits elected officials from using
public funds to contest ballot measures.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the mayor's office conceded it had tapped city
resources to lobby against secession and mail press releases, but
said it stopped doing so as soon as the county Board of Supervisors
approved the cityhood measures for the ballot in late July.</LD>
<TE>   "Prior to that time ... no ballot measure existed," Deena Ghaly,
the Ethics Commission's director of enforcement, wrote in a Nov. 4
letter to the secessionists. "Consequently ... [the law] would not
apply."</TE>
<TE>   But Ghaly noted that in 1998 the ethics panel had urged the state
Fair Political Practices Commission to broaden the scope of the law
to include "all activities aimed at voters to initiate and advocate
for or against a [secession] effort." The FPPC declined to change the
policy.</TE>

<HD>Councilwoman Gets Jail for Lying About Address</HD>
<DH>Suspended Huntington Park official lives in Downey. Her
council seat will be vacated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A suspended Huntington Park city councilwoman was sentenced Thursday
to 180 days in County Jail and put on five years' probation after
being convicted last month of falsely stating where she really lived.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Luz Guevara, who was convicted on four felony counts, had
claimed that she lived in Huntington Park when she actually lives in
nearby Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Guevara, 45, is the first elected officeholder to be convicted
because of a prosecution by Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's newly formed
public integrity unit, which was created to fight public corruption.
A council candidate in South Gate was convicted last year of lying
about where he lived.</LD>
<TE>   Although Guevara was silent in court, six supporters and friends,
including her husband, asked Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
David Mintz for lenience while also maintaining her innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known a lot of politicians.... I've never seen a straighter
arrow than my wife. Never," said husband Cipriano Terrazas, who cried
as he spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done anything wrong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, he brusquely turned aside a reporter's request for
a comment from Guevara, who was wearing a white sweater with an
embroidered American flag on its front. "Get out of our face!"
Terrazas yelled.</TE>
<TE>   In asking for lenience, her attorney, Deputy Public Defender
Francis Bennett, told Mintz that Guevara had been humiliated by her
suspension from office after her conviction on two felony counts of
perjury and two of filing false declarations of candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "She has already paid a heavy price," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Once formal notice of her sentence is received by the city, her
seat will be declared vacant, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing from Guevara's supporters, Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott
Goodwin said the case against her wasn't about her worthiness as an
official.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a referendum about her service as a City Council
member," he said. "She doesn't live in Huntington Park."</TE>
<TE>   During a two-week trial, Guevara testified that she lived during
the week with her mother and brother in a three-bedroom house in
Huntington Park. On weekends, she said, she lived in Downey with her
husband and son.</TE>
<TE>   In early morning raids at both homes in May 2001, investigators
found Guevara at the Downey residence. During their surveillance of
her daily routine, they said, they saw Guevara return regularly to
the Downey home.</TE>
<TE>   In imposing a sentence of five years' probation and 180 days in
jail and a $200 fine, Mintz said Huntington Park residents have a
right to expect that she and other elected officials live in the city
they represent.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that she hadn't expressed any remorse.</TE>
<TE>   The judge rejected a prosecution request that, as a condition of
probation, she be prohibited from participating in political
campaigns or related activities. Such a ban, he said, was
unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't anything wrong in her service" as a councilwoman,
Mintz said.</TE>
<TE>   However, since she was convicted of perjury, a felony, she is
prohibited by state law from holding public office. Guevara was
ordered to surrender on Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, county probation officials may file a report that
could allow her to participate in work furlough or a monitoring
program instead of going to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Park officials said the case has taken its toll on the
city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hell for everybody," Mayor Ric Loya said. "The city can
now focus more easily on serving its residents."</TE>

<CX>   Guevara trial -- A story in the California section Nov. 15
incorrectly reported evidence presented by prosecutors during the
trial of Huntington Park Councilwoman Linda Guevara, who was
convicted of falsely claiming she lived in Huntington Park when she
actually lived in Downey. The story said investigators from the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office observed Guevara return
regularly to a house in Downey. In fact, prosecutors presented
evidence showing that she had returned one time to the Downey home.</CX>

<HD>HMO Found Responsible in Man's Death</HD>
<DH>L.A. County jury decides Aetna U.S. Healthcare unreasonably
withheld benefits. But the ruling does not permit punitive awards to
survivors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County jury decided Thursday that Aetna U.S. Healthcare
of California unreasonably withheld promised benefits from an HMO
member and is legally responsible for the 79-year-old man's death on
New Year's Day 2000.</LD>
<LD>   But in a victory for Aetna, the Superior Court jury ruled that the
health insurer had not acted with malice, fraud or oppression. That
means that the survivors of Murray Rosenberg cannot receive punitive
damages. The insurance company was ordered to pay $426,000 for
economic damages and pain and suffering, an award that was made
irrelevant by a secret settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was watched by the industry and consumer groups
because it challenged the HMOs' contention that they should not be
liable for mistakes made by doctors, hospitals and nursing homes in
their contracted networks. Aetna does not provide direct care.</LD>
<TE>   Health care experts said that large punitive awards often spook
investors and lead them to question their faith in the HMO industry.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Rosenberg family's lawyer, Michael Bidart, made
national news when he won $120.5 million in a separate lawsuit
against Aetna. Then, he represented a widow who claimed that Aetna
had unfairly denied her husband treatment before he died of cancer.
The San Bernardino case was settled for an undisclosed amount.</TE>
<TE>   The $426,000 award in the Rosenberg case is unlikely to rattle the
industry. And it was rendered moot because both sides settled the
case amicably before the jury finished deliberating and both refused
to disclose details. Lawyers said they still wanted to hear the
jury's decision after the seven-week trial to gauge whether their
arguments had resonated with jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "Aetna is obviously sympathetic to the Rosenbergs for their loss,
but we are very, very pleased that the jury rejected almost
unanimously that Aetna did something wrong and should be punished,"
said Aetna's outside counsel, John Swenson.</TE>
<TE>   The insurer's legal team maintained that it had never denied any
test, referral or treatment for Rosenberg, who suffered from multiple
myeloma, or cancer of the bone marrow.</TE>
<TE>   Bidart argued that Rosenberg was discharged from a West Covina
hospital too soon after his chemotherapy treatments ended in December
1999, and that his primary care physician wasn't even told where he
was sent. The family's lawyer also claimed that the man had not
received adequate care at the Covina nursing home where he was sent
after his discharge.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg returned to the hospital and died there on Jan. 1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bidart alleged that Aetna acted in bad faith because it failed to
ensure proper coordination of Rosenberg's care by the medical
providers. The jury concluded that Aetna's "unreasonable failure" to
provide promised benefits was a "substantial factor" in Rosenberg's
death.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict "has the possibility of benefiting a lot of senior
citizens in the future" by pushing HMOs to act more responsibly,
Bidart said. He acknowledged that punitive damages would have made a
stronger statement.</TE>
<TE>   The nursing home operator, Sun Healthcare Group, also was sued but
settled its part of the case for $250,000 before the start of the
Aetna trial; it did not acknowledge wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   After announcing their verdict Thursday, several jurors said that
Aetna should have more carefully monitored the actions of its medical
providers, particularly the nursing home. "If I'm the contractor, I
need to make sure that you do your job," said juror Esperanza Bango.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Autry Walters said Aetna failed to provide the benefits that
it had promised Rosenberg, and as a result, he received disjointed
care. "They just dropped the ball," Walters said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman David Carter said Aetna was disappointed that the jury
had awarded any damages. "Aetna fulfilled the promise that it made to
Mr. Rosenberg and his family to provide access to care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg was covered through the federal Medicare program for the
elderly. About 5 million people are enrolled in Medicare HMOs, which
offer fewer choices for care but additional benefits, such as
prescription drug coverage.</TE>

<HD>Actor Arrested on Suspicion of Abusing Teen</HD>
<DH>Jeffrey Jones is accused of using the boy in a sexually

<LD>Actor Jeffrey Jones, whose roles have included the principal in
''Ferris Bueller's Day Off," was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
abusing a teenage boy, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   He was freed on $20,000 bail and scheduled for arraignment
Thursday on charges of using a minor in a sexually oriented film, a
felony, and possessing child pornography, a misdemeanor, said
district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation began last November when police in Hollywood
received a complaint from a minor alleging ''criminal acts of a
sexual nature,'' said LAPD spokesman Don Cox. Police searched Jones'
home in Los Angeles and "seized numerous items of evidence," Cox
said. Detectives obtained an arrest warrant Wednesday, and Jones, 56,
surrendered on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Daniel Mulrenin of the LAPD's Sexually Exploited Child Unit
said the incident took place last year in the Hollywood area.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' attorney, Jeff Brodey, said his client has been cooperating
with police and prosecutors since the investigation began.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is all about photos. There's not allegations of any
touching or any improper acts with a minor,'' Brodey said. ''This
will be resolved very quickly so he can get on with his life and get
back to work.''</TE>
<TE>   Brodey said Jones ''is a very decent guy, and his life shouldn't
be ruined.''</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said that, as part of the same
investigation, search warrants were served last year at the Hollywood
Hills home of actor Paul Reubens and that police seized a large
erotic art collection and personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Reubens said none of the items seized was anything
more than erotic art. The attorney was present at the time of the
search.</TE>
<TE>   Reubens, a friend of Jones, is best known for his role as
''Pee-wee Herman.''</TE>
<TE>   Jones has more than 50 television and movie credits, including the
role of the music-loving Emperor Joseph II in "Amadeus," the
mentalist Criswell in "Ed Wood" and the father in "Beetlejuice."</TE>

<HD>No Shame, No Sense in 'I See White People' Political Attack</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Antonio Villaraigosa, who is under attack for hanging out with too
many white people, was seen in a downtown Los Angeles restaurant
Wednesday night with yet another paleface -- me.</LD>
<LD>   My father's parents are from Spain, so some people might count me
as Hispanic. But I guess I look pretty white, and Villaraigosa is
being called a traitor to his people for hanging out with too many
Caucasians.</LD>
<LD>   The former Assembly speaker and mayoral candidate has been
bludgeoned in two fliers since he decided to run against Nick Pacheco
in the 14th City Council District. One goes after him for listening
to "the white puppets pulling his strings," referring to them as his
"consultantes gringos."</LD>
<TE>   And that's the highbrow stuff. Villaraigosa, who has admitted past
infidelity, is savaged in the mailers, which were sent out by Pacheco
supporter Ricardo Torres.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you allow the 14th Council District to become another one of
Antonio Villaraigosa's one-night stands?" asks a flier.</TE>
<TE>   Torres has backed off for now. But I'm hoping a third mailer goes
out soon, so I can mount a drive to add dirty campaign tricks to the
three-strikes law. Life in the slam might be the only way to protect
society from habitual political hacks.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, in a bottom-feeding expedition that explored new depths,
even went after Villaraigosa's family.</TE>
<TE>   His father took a hit.</TE>
<TE>   His eldest daughter took a hit.</TE>
<TE>   The family pets are running for cover.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a family meeting Monday to talk about it," Villaraigosa
said of his wife and six children.</TE>
<TE>   His wife is stricken, Villaraigosa said. But his eldest daughter
is taking it even harder, and she spoke up at the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, it's not worth it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That daughter, who was attacked in one flier for having been a
teenage mother, is married to the father of that child, owns a house,
and is doing quite well by her father's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of her," Villaraigosa said, his eyes narrowing. He
expected to get roughed up, he said. But his family?</TE>
<TE>   "This is more personal, vitriolic, and venomous than I expected."</TE>
<TE>   And it may get worse. Villaraigosa said he's received phone
messages warning that in the next round, he's going to be accused of
"a serious crime."</TE>
<TE>   Another alleged paramour? Something from his wild years on the
streets of East L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   He won't repeat the telephone threat, but says the charge is
hogwash.</TE>
<TE>   I called Nick Pacheco to see if he might know about it, but he
didn't call back. I guess if your people are accusing an opponent of
chatting with gringos, it's best not to commit the same crime, even
by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco has said he wanted his buddy Torres to stop the mailers,
and he encouraged Villaraigosa to press for legal action.
"Unfortunately," Pacheco added, "when you send out facts, it's tough
to mount a legal challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Facts, indeed, can bite you where it hurts. Take the time last
year when Pacheco suffered the humiliation of having to shut down his
nonprofit organization amid allegations that he was squeezing City
Hall lobbyists to contribute to it.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco denied any wrongdoing and no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   But that very nonprofit figured in a plot to torpedo
Villaraigosa's mayoral campaign, a plot in which Villaraigosa was
bushwhacked in telephone calls by a woman impersonating Supervisor
Gloria Molina.</TE>
<TE>   This gave me an idea. Maybe I could call Pacheco again, and get
through this time by impersonating Henry Lozano, Xavier Becerra or
one of the other toads in that cabal.</TE>
<TE>   "They have this political strategy of playing the Boy Scout on
top, but under the table, being more ruthless than anyone," says
David Ayon, a political analyst at Loyola Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe that's the way to do it. Beat them at their own game.</TE>
<TE>   I worked on the voices, trying to get the gringo out of me, but
unfortunately Pacheco's office was closed when I called back.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad. I also wanted to ask Pacheco a strategy question.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th District includes Boyle Heights, Eagle Rock, and Mt.
Washington, and if I remember correctly, I've seen white people on
the streets in those places. So I'm not sure how smart it is to
suggest that by virtue of his association with Gov. Davis and other
white people, Villaraigosa has alienated "our community."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the Latino community has been a sleeping giant in this
city for too many decades. It's been sneered at, belittled,
discriminated against.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it's on the verge of grabbing its fair share of power,
does it want its mudslinging leaders to mug its brightest
representatives, blow a chance to air real issues, and commit the
same acts of bigotry that have kept it down for more than a century?</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Villaraigosa is flawed, no doubt. I don't know many people
who aren't. But these attacks might only strengthen him.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of ancestry, he said: "I'm proud of who I am. But
it's not all that I'm about."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, I sat with my back to the restaurant entrance and tossed
out a few words in Spanish when anyone approached. Wouldn't want
anyone to think he was with another of his consultantes gringos.</TE>

<HD>High-Profile Suit Over Treatment by PacifiCare Doctor Is
Settled</HD>
<DH>Costa Mesa family had accused the HMO of using cost
consideration to delay lung transplant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of trial, the family of a Costa Mesa man has agreed to
settle a case accusing a health maintenance organization and a doctor
of not recommending a lung transplant because it would have cost them
too much.</LD>
<LD>   George McCall was 58 when he died in 1999, three hours after
having the transplant. The family contended he would have had a
better chance of survival had surgery been done earlier, when he was
in better health.</LD>
<LD>   "I just hope the next time a doctor sees someone who needs
treatment that perhaps he'll look at his heart and not at his
pocketbook," said his widow, Barbara McCall, whose suit was being
closely monitored by the health-care industry.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement reached in the case was confidential, a condition
insisted upon by the defendants, Carol Jimenez, an attorney for the
McCall family, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A jury was chosen last week, and opening arguments were scheduled
to start Tuesday in Santa Ana Superior Court. The settlement was
reached Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen and attorneys for the defendants, PacifiCare of
California, Dr. Lakshmi Shukla and Greater Newport Physicians Inc.,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case highlighted the conflicts doctors face in deciding
whether to use an expensive treatment on an HMO patient when much of
the cost would come out of their pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Even before going to trial, the McCall suit had caused problems
for the managed care industry. The state Supreme Court ruled in the
case that Medicare patients may sue HMOs when they are denied
treatment Medicare will not pay for. Before the ruling, those
complaints were heard in an administrative proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   McCall, who owned a furniture manufacturing firm, suffered from
the genetic lung disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which causes
severe emphysema. Also, he was a long-term smoker.</TE>
<TE>   McCall enrolled in an HMO that PacifiCare offered for Medicare
patients. Pulmonologist Shukla and his medical group, Greater Newport
Physicians Inc., were part of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare paid PacifiCare a monthly fee for every patient in the
program, regardless of how much care they required. The McCalls
argued that they didn't know he was a candidate for a lung transplant
until 1997, when a nurse happened to ask him where he stood on the
transplant list. The operation would have cost about $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   In court briefs, lawyers for PacifiCare and Shukla argued that
McCall made the decision not to have the transplant. The family's
attorneys said there was no mention in his medical records that his
doctor had ever recommended it.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that McCall was forced to drop out of the HMO so
Medicare would pay for the entire procedure. His lawyers said it is
illegal to force a patient to leave an HMO to get treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez said that the McCall family would have preferred the terms
of the settlement be made public, but that the defendants did not. If
Shukla's portion of the settlement is more than $30,000, the amount
must be reported to the Medical Board of California.</TE>
<TE>   By not going to trial, the McCalls' lawyers don't get the chance
to ask the judge for an injunction to require PacifiCare and other
HMOs to disclose to patients how treatment options affect their
doctors' profits.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it didn't go to trial, the McCall case leaves behind
an important legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a major breakthrough so elderly people have access to the
court system when abused by an HMO," said Mark Hiepler, an Oxnard
attorney who won an $89-million jury verdict in 1993 against
HealthNet for denying a bone marrow transplant to his sister, a
breast cancer patient who died that year.</TE>

<HD>County Will Hire Recruiter to Help Find New Mental Health
Director</HD>
<DH>Only 14 candidates have applied for the job in the troubled
department. Several possible factors, including personality
conflicts, are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County is expanding its efforts to find a new director for
its troubled mental health department after only 14 candidates
applied for the $114,000-a-year post.</LD>
<LD>   The county will soon hire a recruiting firm to help widen the pool
of candidates, said Human Services Director Barbara Journet.</LD>
<LD>   A decision not to use a professional recruiter earlier in the
process probably accounts for the weak response, Journet said. County
officials were hoping to save money by advertising for applicants
themselves, she said.</LD>
<TE>   However, she acknowledged that personality conflicts and a turf
war that has roiled the Behavioral Health Department for nearly five
years also played a role.</TE>
<TE>   Former mental health chief Stephen Kaplan resigned in 1999 after
battling with his boss, Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand.
His replacement, Dr. David Gudeman, was fired by supervisors in April
after repeatedly clashing with other department managers.</TE>
<TE>   "That has had an impact, definitely" Journet said.</TE>
<TE>   But she said many would-be candidates are also put off by the high
cost of housing in Ventura County. The median price of a home in
September was $330,000.</TE>
<TE>   Acting mental health chief Linda Shulman, a candidate for the
position, said she is upbeat about the decision to extend the
recruitment period to early January.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it's been explained to me is that the quantity of
candidates wasn't sufficient enough," said Shulman, 41. "I'm going to
trust that [the second recruitment] will lead to a good result and
everyone's confidence in me if I am chosen."</TE>
<TE>   There are at least two other in-house candidates, but officials
declined to identify them or other applicants.</TE>
<TE>   No one has yet been screened out, Journet said. County Executive
Officer Johnny Johnston, when asked about Shulman's chances of
getting the post, said the decision to try again "should not reflect
poorly on the candidates who are already in the process."</TE>
<TE>   Durand, Shulman's boss, said he has been satisfied with her
performance over the past six months. Employees in the mental health
agency have been demoralized by the turmoil, but that appears to have
settled down since Shulman took over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She has stabilized the department and that says something," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shulman is a psychologist and earned a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 1996.
Before coming to the county, she worked as a consultant on mental
health issues.</TE>
<TE>   California requires that mental health directors have an academic
background and/or a license in social work, psychology or counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Journet said that limits applicants. It is also a tough job that
requires one to be both an expert in administrative matters and
diplomatic with superiors, employees and well-organized advocacy
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Under any circumstances, running a mental health agency is
difficult," Journet said. "And with the funding cuts that all the
departments are facing, it certainly doesn't make it attractive to
want to move."</TE>
<TE>   County officials sent information about the job to every mental
health department in California, Journet said. They also put the
position on a government job listing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   This time they will expand the search across the nation. They will
also discuss raising the salary range if the recruiter recommends
that, Journet said.</TE>

<LD>The police log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise carried this
bulletin: "Marlin Avenue, 3:42 p.m. A man was talking to a resident's
trash can in front of his residence."</LD>
<LD>   Hmmm. I've heard of athletes talking trash, but they usually do
that to each other.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, as I grow older, I find myself conversing more
and more with inanimate objects. I like the fact that they never
interrupt me or yawn. True, they don't laugh at my jokes, but then
neither do my children.</LD>
<TE>   Don't follow me -- I'm lost: Bob Lloyd of Burbank noticed a sort
of boastful sign on an out-of-commission bus -- a bus, in other
words, that wasn't at all difficult to keep up with (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   The market in teachers: An Arcadia reader came upon an ad labeled
"Kdgn Tchr Sale," while across town Mathis Abrams of Beverly Hills
saw an opening for a preschool teacher -- though an extremely young
one (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Would a hang glider be the national bird? Alan Simon tipped me to
the AlterNet.org Web site, where comedian Will Durst proposes that
California secede from the union -- and, yes, the San Fernando Valley
can come along too (see illustration).</TE>
<TE>   Durst reasons that it's the logical next step, since California
seems so out of step with the rest of the country, having elected all
those Democrats the other day.</TE>
<TE>   Durst's selling points on the Republic of California:</TE>
<TE>   * "We got the food. We got the wine country to wash it down with."</TE>
<TE>   * "We can charge a fee on" every visitor from the United States
"trying out as a contestant on 'Wheel of Fortune.' Call it a stupid
tax."</TE>
<TE>   * "Our own armed services. Eastwood, Schwarzenegger, Stallone or
Willis in charge?"</TE>
<TE>   * We "can extradite and convict Enron CEO, Ken Lay, at our own war
crimes tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   Only in L.A. on exhibit: I felt proud when my nephew Nick Gannon

<LD>A few years ago, Wal-Mart wanted to open up on the north end of town.
No thanks, said San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Home Depot asked to open up on the south end of town.
It would have handed the city several million dollars and future
sales-tax revenue. Last week, in a 69%-to-31% vote, San Juan
Capistrano said no thanks.</LD>
<LD>   I'd love to string out the story line that this little town of
aging cowboys and their descendants is clinging to its heritage and
fighting off the Big Box stores that practically define the rest of
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   After all, this is the historic town with the historic mission
that dates to 1776 and the historic swallows that are supposed to
return every spring.</TE>
<TE>   It's the city with California's oldest residential street (Los
Rios). It's a town where future heavyweight champ Jack Dempsey liked
to stop on his way to gamble in Mexico before the inn he stayed at
burned down in 1918.</TE>
<TE>   It's a town where, a stone's throw from the main drag, the public
can still talk to barnyard animals on a family farm and kids can ride
a pony around a corral for a mere two bucks.</TE>
<TE>   So, yes, there's plenty of character left in the old town.</TE>
<TE>   And if the story line from last week's election is that a desire
to hang on to that character was what killed off Home Depot, I'm not
going to fight it.</TE>
<TE>   But is it true? The town isn't Irvine, but it isn't Mayberry,
either.</TE>
<TE>   I spent an afternoon in town this week, talking to people about
the Home Depot rejection. Some evoked the desire to ward off the Big
Boxers; others said the vote was the result of nuts-and-bolts issues
like traffic or a preferred alternate use for the property or the
fear that smaller, home-grown merchants would be run out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Even those practical reasons sort of work their way back to
preserving something they fear is slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things that have happened to San Juan
Capistrano," says a grandmother who first moved to town in the 1970s.
"There's the auto row on Camino Capistrano, those silly fast-food
things on Del Obispo. These are the kind of things we don't want our
town to have. They're commercial, and they're cheapening our town. We
want to keep it quaint."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not like the town is in a time warp. It has upscale
coffeehouses and restaurants that compete for customers with
establishments that harken to the old days.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Black, a waitress at a restaurant on Ortega Highway
leading into town, says the Home Depot issue gave the regulars plenty
to talk about. "People want to keep it this picturesque town," she
says, "but the way Orange County is growing, I don't know how long
that'll be possible."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Axford runs a gift shop on Camino Capistrano. He lived for
years in Dana Point and was upset when development systematically
altered that town's character. He thinks that prospect united the San
Juan Capistrano interests that rejected Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Kogerman, a Laguna Hills resident who ran the losing
effort to persuade San Juan Capistrano voters last week to approve a
housing-and-school project, says the traffic concerns define a local
problem. "They're conflicted," Kogerman says while clearing out a
temporary office on Camino Capistrano. "They want to be a tourist
town and have people come here, but they want everybody to walk."</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot was shot down by the last vestiges of the city's cowboy
past.</TE>
<TE>   That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.</TE>
<TE>   That's also why I saved this myth-buster for last: Within walking
distance of the Home Depot site stands a Costco. It's been there
since 1987.</TE>

<HD>$123-Million Crenshaw Project Goes to Council</HD>
<DH>Vote on Marlton Square is likely to be positive despite
questions about subsidy, political ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billed as the linchpin for revitalizing southwest Los Angeles, the
Marlton Square commercial and housing development is likely to be
approved by the City Council today despite questions about its
$38-million public subsidy and the close political ties between the
developer and its City Hall supporters.</LD>
<LD>   The project is being pushed by outgoing City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas and Mayor James K. Hahn, who has made it his top
economic development priority.</LD>
<LD>   The development firm Capital Vision Equities, its employees and
family members contributed $30,000 to Ridley-Thomas' recent Assembly
campaign. Those involved in the project also gave $25,000 to Hahn's
anti-secession campaign, although Hahn later returned $15,000. The
firm's chief executive, Christopher Hammond, said the money was
returned to avoid the perception of a conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Hammond is married to an executive with the Community
Redevelopment Agency, one of the main sources of financing for the
project, although officials said his wife has not been involved.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond's firm also has hired former CRA chief John Molloy, who
left the agency three years ago, to press its case at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   To some critics and City Hall observers, the mayor's support is
seen in part as designed to win back standing in the African American
community that he lost when he refused to give former LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Development 'Overdue'</TE>
<TE>   Hahn rejected that description of his motivations, saying the
development is long overdue and that the community deserves to be a
priority in city government.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the funding for the $123.1-million project is
unconventional mainly because it relies heavily on committing
anti-poverty funds from the city's federal Community Development
Block Grants for the next 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of [project], though unusual, is a way to demonstrate a
commitment by the city to this community," Hahn said in a recent
interview. "I can't think of a better use for these CDBG funds. This
is my top priority for economic development."</TE>
<TE>   Formerly known as Santa Barbara Plaza, the project is the swan
song for Ridley-Thomas, who leaves office in two weeks to join the
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the steep public subsidy, the project has been on the fast
track; it bypassed two council committees as well as other normal
processes so it can be approved before Ridley-Thomas leaves office.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that is because it is not known whether Parks, a
front-runner to replace Ridley-Thomas, would be as enthusiastic about
the development. Parks did not return calls for comment, but others
seeking the council seat have raised questions about the project,
even though they support it.</TE>
<TE>   Although the concept of Marlton Square has broad support in the
community, 8th District council candidate Robert Cole, a public
relations executive, said the size of the public subsidy is a
concern. "It does seem high," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another council candidate, businessman Kevin Melton, said he is
troubled by the way the city chose the developer for the project and
by that firm's ties to city politicians, including Ridley-Thomas.
"The concern is that it's a good-old-boys network and we're not
giving businesspeople in the community a share," Melton said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said that Hammond's firm is headquartered in the 8th
Council District and that he received the job through a competitive
process.</TE>
<TE>   Although seven firms submitted proposals, only Hammond's company
proposed developing the whole site, city records show. Others dealt
with smaller portions.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas predicted that the council will approve the
development and the public subsidies, saying it is an important
investment needed to replace the dilapidated Santa Barbara Plaza
shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be the catalytic project for the Baldwin Hills,
Crenshaw communities," Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the 22 acres include 140 detached, single-family homes;
180 rental units for low-income senior citizens and 140,000 square
feet of retail space that would complement the nearby Baldwin Hills
Shopping Center and the Magic Johnson Theaters in the area. It would
also include a 40,000-square-foot community facility.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Hammond's firm on the project is Keyshawn Capital
Development, headed by pro football player Keyshawn Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The project has been in the works for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   'Magic' Touch?</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker star Earvin "Magic" Johnson was originally interested
in developing Santa Barbara Plaza several years ago. But he was
unsuccessful in getting Ridley-Thomas to endorse the project, which
also would have required substantial public subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lombard, president of the Magic Johnson development company,
said he is pleased the project is finally moving forward. Magic
Johnson has provided a letter of interest indicating he may want to
put a 24-Hour Fitness health club in the new development, according
to Hammond.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond said the size of the subsidy has precedent, including the
$43-million public subsidy approved last year by the city for the
NoHo Commons project in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the financing has raised some eyebrows in and out of City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm suspicious any time they say they need public subsidies for
projects that otherwise wouldn't be funded by the public sector,"
said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In a report to the council, City Administrative Officer William
Fujioka and Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton singled out for
special attention the fact that the project will take $1.1 million
annually from the block grant funds even though there are not enough
anti-poverty dollars to meet the needs already identified by the
city. Other funds would come from the Housing Authority, a federal
economic initiative grant and taxes generated by the project.</TE>
<TE>   "The project requires the use of significant CDBG funds over 20
years," the two said in a report to the council, calling it a
"significant policy decision."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said the funds being tapped are supposed to help
blighted communities, so the project is justified.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn agrees. The mayor grew up in the Crenshaw area and said he
recalls going to Santa Barbara Plaza with his parents. He said it has
been run-down for too long.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's really stuck out as a sore thumb there," Hahn said.
"I'm very excited that in a year and a half, we've been able to get
this moving."</TE>

<HD>Veteran Educator to Head County's Preschool Effort</HD>
<DH>Using $100 million in tobacco taxes, 10-year plan would
offer free, full-day schooling for all 3- and 4-year-olds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A veteran educator was appointed Thursday to head an ambitious plan
to spend $100 million in tobacco taxes to provide universal preschool
in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Karen Hill-Scott, co-founder of the Los Angeles child care agency
Crystal Stairs, will be charged with implementing a 10-year project
to provide free, full-day preschool to more than 100,000 3- and
4-year-olds in the county.</LD>
<LD>   She was unanimously chosen by the county's First 5 Commission,
which controls local funds generated by the statewide Proposition 10
for early-childhood programs.</LD>
<TE>   Hill-Scott, 55, will be seeking to unite an often fractious
assortment of community leaders, child care advocates, educators and
parents to complete the project. Many experts said Scott has the
political savvy and vision to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   She is a member of the statewide First 5 Commission, named for its
emphasis on children's first five years of life.</TE>
<TE>   Hill-Scott is an ally of that commission's chairman, Rob Reiner,
the filmmaker and children's advocate who first championed universal
preschool in Los Angeles County and led the state campaign for
Proposition 10.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County receives about $164 million each year from
Proposition 10, although the money is expected to shrink as smoking
declines.</TE>
<TE>   The preschool initiative "will affect the life of every child in
Los Angeles County," said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who is
the county commission's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a model for the country, and I can think of no one
better to design this program than Karen Hill-Scott, who has long
been an innovator in the field of early education."</TE>
<TE>   Hill-Scott has taught at UCLA, has been co-chairwoman of the
California Department of Education's Universal Preschool Task Force
and runs a consulting firm that helps corporations design child
development programs.</TE>
<TE>   She said her goal over the next 10 months is to create a
high-quality system that will be easy for parents to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping to put a lot of focus on how the end users -- parents
and children -- experience the system," said Hill-Scott, who has four
grown children and five grandchildren younger than 4 and who
experienced the difficulties of finding preschools for them.</TE>
<TE>   "This planning process is a big part of that. Most people see
implementation as the kids going to school, but they don't want to
see chaos when they get there."</TE>
<TE>   Under the commission's initial plans, existing preschool programs
such as Head Start would be expanded from half days to full days,
child care providers would be trained to become preschool
instructors, new centers would be built and needy families could
receive other social services. The program would be free, regardless
of family income, and eventually younger children would be included.</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the county's First 5 Commission chose the L.A.
Care Health Plan to administer its equally ambitious $100-million
Healthy Kids program, a health insurance plan targeting low-income
children who do not qualify for Medi-Cal, Healthy Families or other
forms of government health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy Kids will provide outpatient, hospital, dental, vision and
prescription coverage to children whose families earn as much as 300%
of the federal poverty level and will accept children regardless of
immigration status. Earnings at 300% of the poverty level amount to
about $54,000 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   The county's First 5 Commission has committed $100 million over
five years to help enroll children to age 5, and hopes to find
additional partners to insure children 6 to 18 years old.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Care is a nonprofit, publicly governed HMO that already
serves more than 800,000 Los Angeles County residents who receive
Medi-Cal and Healthy Families coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The new insurance program hopes to begin enrolling children by
spring, and patients will be able to use an existing network of
county clinics and private community clinics, said Chief Executive
Howard A. Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, if you're low-income or poor and you've got
young kids, we'll figure out with you which health programs your kids
are eligible for -- not if your kids are eligible," he said. "That's
the big change -- to be able to provide some continuity."</TE>

<LD>The YWCA of Central Orange County, unable to cover the costs of child
care and other services, will close next year.</LD>
<LD>   The demise of the 81-year-old institution leaves Orange County
with only one YWCA, down from five at the organization's height.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the central branch's programs have lost too much
money. For example, the infant-care program lost more than $5,000 a
month for years.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a heartbreaker," said YWCA board member Arianna Barrios.</TE>

<LD>Irv Rubin, the militant chief of the Jewish Defense League, died in a
hospital nine days after authorities say he attempted suicide while
awaiting trial for allegedly planning to bomb a mosque.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours of Rubin's death late Wednesday, his widow threatened
to sue unless federal authorities turned over more information.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have so far rejected Shelley Rubin's request for an
independent investigation, attorney Peter Morris said Thursday.
Unless they do so, the lawyer said, he will sue the federal
government to gain access to records regarding Rubin's imprisonment
and death.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin, 57, was pronounced dead at 11:49 p.m. Wednesday at
County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. His organs
began to fail, he was resuscitated, and then his heart failed,
according to his lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Rubin intended to kill himself in the
Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles by slitting his
throat with a razor and then jumping 18 feet to a concrete floor,
where he suffered the injuries that led to his death. He never
regained consciousness after his Nov. 4 fall.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, 57, had been in federal custody without bail since his
arrest in December for allegedly plotting to blow up the King Fahd
Mosque in Culver City and the office of a Lebanese American
congressman, Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista). Rubin and Earl Krugel,
his co-defendant and chief lieutenant in the JDL, pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin had lost 60 pounds during his incarceration and had seen a
prison psychologist at least once, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said no one -- guard or inmate -- was within
15 feet of Rubin when he went over the balcony. Federal officials
have repeatedly said, and reiterated Thursday, that they have no
evidence that Rubin's injuries were anything but self-inflicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin was born in Montreal and moved to the San Fernando Valley
when he was 15. He later became a U.S. citizen and enlisted in the
Air Force. In 1971, he joined the JDL, and had led the organization
since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Rubin gained notoriety for offering a $500 reward
to anyone who killed a member of the American Nazi Party. He fought
with Ku Klux Klan members on television and publicly celebrated the
murder of a prominent Arab American. Rubin's extreme views led to his
denunciation by mainstream Jewish leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He was no stranger to the courtroom. Most recently, he had sued
the city of Burbank and won an appellate court decision banning
sectarian prayers at the opening of weekly City Council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   On the criminal side, he once said he had been arrested 40 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think that he would be remembered for standing up
for Jews.... But unfortunately this indictment and what appears to be
a suicide detract from some of the positive things he had done," said
attorney James E. Blatt, who defended Rubin against other criminal
charges over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was extremely patriotic. He loved this country. And he was
proud to be a Jew," Blatt said. "A lot of Jewish people wouldn't
admit it, but they liked what he did in rooting out Nazis.... He
stood for something. It's a shame that it has ended this way."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's lawyers said his widow and her two sons, Ari, 21, and
Kelly, 12, were called to the hospital by a federal marshal about 8
p.m. Wednesday when it appeared that Rubin's condition was worsening.
They spent nearly two hours at his bedside, but were not present when
he died.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the county coroner's office said the official
cause of death has not yet been determined. Funeral arrangements are
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Rubin had previously rejected the contention that her
husband tried to kill himself. But Morris said Thursday that she now
just wants the truth, even if all the evidence points to suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said he wants to determine whether, if Rubin was depressed,
he received proper medical treatment behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "If they didn't meet the standard of care and Irv was not
adequately treated, that would be the basis for a lawsuit," the
attorneys said. "Or if he was in the general population and was
thrown over the railing by a neo-Nazi or a member of the Aryan
Brotherhood and if the government could have prevented that, then
that is the basis for a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the FBI, which investigated Rubin repeatedly, should
not be relied upon to objectively examine the circumstances of his
death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the federal government's best interest to come to the
conclusion that they did nothing wrong," he said, urging federal
officials to release all information they have on the death. "Unless
the government has something to hide, it should turn over the
information without a fight," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin was facing at least 35 years in prison if convicted of the
bombing plot charges.</TE>

<HD>Activist Refuses to Bough to Pressure</HD>
<DH>Environmentalist vows to save 400-year-old oak near Santa
Clarita slated to be chopped down for road-widening project. Protest
began Nov. 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset and Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undeterred by the sight of tree-cutting equipment and mounting
pressure from Los Angeles County officials, activist John Quigley
remained high in the boughs of an ancient oak near Santa Clarita
Thursday night, determined to save it.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to have to come up here and literally drag us out
if they want to remove us," said Quigley, who was joined by another
activist in his 50-foot-high perch, while supporters rallied at the
base of the tree.</LD>
<LD>   A rotating group of citizens, led by Quigley, has maintained a
24-hour vigil atop the 400-year-old oak, nicknamed Old Glory, since
Nov. 1, shortly after they learned it might be cut down.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, officials from John Laing Homes, the
developer of a neighboring subdivision, said the county was forcing
them to remove the tree in order to widen two-lane Pico Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The road, located on the west side of the Santa Clarita Valley,
will one day extend north through the proposed Newhall Ranch
subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   Though the developer recently met with county officials in an
attempt to save the tree, negotiations were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Public works spokesman Ken Pullman said the road must be widened
to accommodate traffic generated by new development. And Laing
officials said there is no way to save a tree that is yards from the
street.</TE>
<TE>   "They need a four-lane highway here," said Laing president William
Rattazzi. "My company is required to build the road."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, the developer erected a chain-link fence
around the tree and posted "no trespassing" signs. But sheriff's
officials said they could only arrest the protesters at the request
of Laing officials, who have so far declined to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he had no intention of coming down until he is
certain the tree can be saved. "It's criminal to cut down a piece of
our heritage," said Quigley, a Pacific Palisades resident who said he
makes his living doing contract work as an environmental educator.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign has won the support of numerous residents here who
don't typically get involved in this fast-growing region's debates
over sprawl and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread quickly when tree-removal trucks were spotted in the
neighborhood Thursday morning, and about 20 residents rushed to the
tree to help protect it.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Kelly Sorensen, a 15-year-old high school student
who ditched class when she heard the towering oak was threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing whatever it takes to keep it," Sorensen said, standing
underneath the tree's wide canopy. "They say another [tree] won't
matter. Well, it does."</TE>
<TE>   Before noon, Rattazzi joined sheriff's deputies in asking Sorensen
and a handful of other activists to leave or face possible arrest.</TE>
<TE>   A tense showdown followed. As TV news crews jostled for space,
local environmentalist Lynne Plambeck -- flanked by several children
and their mothers -- invoked the spirits of Gandhi and Thoreau, then
attempted in vain to contact County Supervisor Michael Antonovich by
cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Tony Bell, an Antonovich spokesman, issued a
statement supporting the tree's removal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the supervisor's position, that to ensure public safety and
mitigate future traffic congestion, this action -- the removal of the
tree -- must be taken," Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Clarita Councilwoman Laurene Weste, who was among those
who gathered around the tree Thursday afternoon, said the issue
should have been dealt with sooner. She said she wished she could do
more, but that the tree is not within her city's jurisdiction. "This
is kind of like our Alamo," she said. "Remember the Pico oak."</TE>
<TE>   As the sun went down, dozens of youths from a neighboring
subdivision turned up to show their support by chanting, "Save our
oak," and, "May the trees be with you."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in the neighborhood shared their enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid," said resident Byron Wainie as he walked his dogs.
"God knows there's people that'll fight for anything."</TE>

<HD>Ban on Taking Bocaccio Denied</HD>
<DH>U.S. says strict new rules should save the rockfish, sold
as red snapper, from extinction.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration rejected a petition Thursday to place a
severely depleted rockfish on the list of endangered species, saying
that new fishing restrictions should protect the fish from extinction
"within the foreseeable future."</LD>
<LD>   In its 23-page decision, the National Marine Fisheries Service
blamed itself and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which it
oversees, for failing to prevent the collapse of the bocaccio
rockfish, whose numbers have plunged by 96.4% since 1969 from
overfishing.</LD>
<LD>   But the fisheries service said tough new rules -- including
closing much of California's continental shelf to bottom fishing --
should save the fish commonly sold as Pacific red snapper from demise
and promote its eventual recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, even under the new restrictions that will go into effect Jan.
1, the slow-growing, slow-to-reproduce rockfish is not expected to
recover for 170 years, according to the fishery service.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be monitoring the population closely to make sure we are
right," said Rodney R. McInnis, acting regional director of the
fisheries service. Bocaccio, he said, will remain a candidate for
listing as an endangered species, should it be warranted in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that current protections won't save the fish,
environmental groups want the government to put the southern
bocaccio, which are found from Baja California to Northern
California, on the endangered species list.</TE>
<TE>   "This fish may go the way of other species hunted to extinction,"
said Karen Garrison, co-director of the Natural Resources Defense
Council's oceans initiative. She expressed little confidence that the
tighter federal fishing rules could adequately protect the bocaccio.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Powell, fish conservation director for the Ocean Conservancy,
said the latest array of closures is "too little, too late."</TE>
<TE>   "Had they done this 10 years ago, it would have been OK," he said.
"There are too many loopholes in rockfish regulations. They are
allowing too many kinds of bottom trawling, for halibut and pink
shrimp. Those fishermen are all going to catch bocaccio. The catch
limit should be zero."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, bocaccio was a staple of fish markets in California.
It is one of several homely, bug-eyed, bottom-dwelling rockfish sold
as red snapper or rock cod and is prized for its delicate white
flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Species Can Live to 40</TE>
<TE>   The fish, which commonly live on rocky reefs at depths of 165 to
825 feet, often take five years or more before they reproduce. They
can live to be more than 40 years old. Larger females produce far
more eggs than smaller, younger fish.</TE>
<TE>   Their numbers have plunged dramatically in recent decades due to
commercial fishing pressures, and more recently because of
recreational anglers, who have removed nearly all of the older fish.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the remaining bocaccio off Southern California are 3 years
old -- born in 1999, which was the last time a combination of cold
water and rich plankton growth created ideal conditions for a
successful bocaccio spawn, said Milton Love, a rockfish researcher at
UC Santa Barbara. If the class of 1999 is fished out, he said, the
species would have a very difficult time recovering.</TE>
<TE>   Since July, neither commercial nor recreational fishermen have
been allowed to target or keep bocaccio. The problem is that the
bocaccio, like many other rockfish, usually die when pulled up from
the ocean's crushing depths where they live. As they surface, an
internal bladder expands, crushing organs and causing their eyes to
bulge from their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial and recreational fishermen will be allowed to take 20
metric tons next year, but only as by-catch -- fish caught in the
process of going after other species.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of the bocaccio is the principal reason that federal
officials earlier this year closed most of the rocky reefs on the
continental shelf along the Southern and Central California coastline
to bottom fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists generally agree that bocaccio and other rockfish can
survive if pulled from depths of 60 feet or less. In a compromise
with fishermen, federal officials banned bottom fishing for rockfish
at depths of 120 feet to 900 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California,
disputed the need for the closures and other restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The fishermen who are my members tell me that they haven't seen
this many bocaccio in years," Fletcher said. Although federal
officials don't have very good data on fish counts, he said, "they
have enough data to know the fish aren't in the kind of trouble that
needs the Endangered Species Act."</TE>
<TE>   But the push by conservationists to list bocaccio may not be over.
Drew Caputo, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council
who has sued federal officials over rockfish regulations, said
activists may take Thursday's decision to federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups, he said, have a tough time accepting the word
of federal regulators, who have a history of bowing to pressure from
fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like a reckless driver who has been exceeding the
speed limit for years and years and he gets pulled over and says,
'I'll never speed again,' " Caputo said. "Every time they make
promises, they never follow through."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis, the regional administrator of the fisheries service,
defends his agency's track record. Under federal law, regulators must
base their decision on the best available science, he said. As the
information changes, so do the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that there were huge mistakes" in the past, he said. "We
did the best thing we knew how at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Reserves May Expand</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials are now considering one additional restriction:
extending California's 135-square-mile marine reserves around the
Santa Barbara Channel Islands into federal waters.</TE>
<TE>   If federal officials follow the same plan, the network of reserves
would swell to 426 square miles -- the largest in the continental
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision against listing bocaccio as threatened will
play a role in the federal decision on marine reserves, McInnis said.
As big as they are, he said, the largest reserves in the Channel
Islands won't provide the sanctuary that bocaccio need to recover.</TE>

<HD>Wards Wash Their Hands of the Past</HD>
<DH>Six women making fragrant soap at a Camarillo correctional
facility are part of a program offering wages and hope for the
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making soap has given Desiree Campbell a chance to clean up her life.</LD>
<LD>   Six years into a prison sentence for the robbery and killing of a
store clerk when she was a teenager, the 20-year-old now has a job
that pays her to make fragrant, brightly colored glycerin bars with
plastic toys inside.</LD>
<LD>   "You guys hate paying taxes," she told a crowd of workaday adults
Thursday, "but I like it. I'm proud to do that."</LD>
<TE>   Campbell is one of six female wards at the Ventura Youth
Correctional Facility in Camarillo who work for Soap Vision. Started
in 1998 by a Santa Barbara couple, the novelty soap company moved its
operations in August to a large shed on the Camarillo campus. A
ceremony there Thursday celebrated a new partnership involving the
company and the youth facility's wards.</TE>
<TE>   Soap Vision is the latest private company to participate in the
California Youth Authority's Free Venture program. At the CYA's 11
institutions around the state, wards have worked for 20 businesses
and two state agencies since 1985. They have cut awnings for motor
homes, refurbished computers and sewn underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Since these partnerships began, the state's young offenders have
earned nearly $9 million in gross wages, according to the CYA. They
have paid $1.3 million in restitution to crime victims and
contributed slightly more to their own room and board.</TE>
<TE>   When paroled, the wards leave with savings accounts to begin their
new lives.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a steppingstone for the house that I plan on
building," said Janelle Graves, 21, in prison for first-degree
murder. Graves said she wants to enter fashion merchandising and
start an organization for youths.</TE>
<TE>   The young women working for Soap Vision earn minimum wage mixing
glycerin soap liquid in large kettles, pouring it into molds and
dropping in color, scents, figurines and corporate logos. They also
do the packing and shipping.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bargain for Mario and Marie Tafarella, the owners of Soap
Vision. The couple, who started their company from their kitchen, can
pay their employees a third of what they would pay workers "on the
outside," and the wards are more productive, Mario said. The couple's
rent is low and they receive reimbursements and tax credits from the
government for hiring incarcerated workers.</TE>
<TE>   Soap Vision manufactures about 3,000 bars a day. Within the next
year, Tafarella said, the company hopes to hire up to 50 more wards,
increasing capacity to 10,000 bars daily.</TE>
<TE>   There are risks to hiring workers with violent histories, and Soap
Vision's factory floor hints of them. Scissors, razor blades and
screwdrivers are kept under padlock. When Trans World Airlines
operated a reservation line from the Camarillo facility, one of the
wards stole credit card numbers for his own use.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of abuse almost never occurs today, CYA officials said,
and the wards who work for Soap Vision do not handle customers'
financial information.</TE>
<TE>   Tafarella, 50, said he wanted to take a chance on the young
convicts because he ran with the wrong crowd when he was a teenager
and got into plenty of trouble. Nothing violent, he said, but he
spent a week in jail for drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   "It allowed me to understand how strong peer pressure can be," he
said. "I can relate."</TE>

<HD>Cox Bill May Be Blessing for Mission's Great Stone Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legislation that would pump $10 million into repairing and preserving
California's missions might provide enough cash to help complete the
restoration of the 196-year-old Great Stone Church in San Juan
Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   The historic church, part of Mission San Juan Capistrano, was all
but destroyed in an 1812 earthquake. Restoration efforts began in
1994, though funding has been a challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly half of the estimated $7 million it will take to put the
Great Stone Church back together -- a job that includes seismic
stabilization -- has been pieced together from federal and county
grants and private donations.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the mission was awarded a $487,000 state grant.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach),
would allocate money for all 21 missions, although it was unclear
Thursday how the funds would be divided.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the final push to get this done," said Sandy Wheeler,
mission spokeswoman. "It's admirable that Chris Cox is recognizing
our mission and all the others around the state. What are we going to
tell our grandkids if we can't show them what life was like in the
old days?"</TE>
<TE>   Designed more than 200 years ago by Isidro Aguilar, the Great
Stone Church has been placed on the 2002 list of the 100 most
endangered historical sites by the World Monuments Watch program.</TE>
<TE>   The church is five stories high at the sanctuary, topped with
seven stone domes and surrounded by 50-foot walls.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctuary dome has already been seismically stabilized, the
art has been preserved, and all scaffolding in the central and east
portions of the church has been removed. But the vestment room and
its dome need to be shored up, Wheeler said.</TE>

<LD>More than 1,000 nurses from Long Beach Memorial Medical Center,
supported by allies from the Teamsters and other unions, held a
daylong strike Thursday for better staffing, pay and pensions.
Another one-day strike was held Oct. 23.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital bused in replacement nurses to provide patient care
while pickets chanted and waved signs outside.</LD>
<LD>   The daylong strikes have been the largest job actions at a
California hospital in more than four years, and they come as nurses
statewide are taking tough negotiating stances in response to changes
in the health-care industry in the last decade.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of registered nurses represented by the California Nurses
Assn. are expected to converge on downtown Los Angeles today for a
public hearing on California's new staffing ratios to provide more
nurses.</TE>

<HD>Fight for Human Rights Ranges the World</HD>
<DH>Paul Hoffman's activism on behalf of victims results in a
key post with Amnesty International.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Paul Hoffman enrolled at New York's City College in 1968, he
decided to major in international relations "because everyone who
grew up in the '60s was interested" in the role of the U.S. in the
world because of the war in Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   That interest led to activism, and this fall -- in the culmination
of more than two decades of human rights work -- the Los Angeles
lawyer was elected chairman of the International Executive Committee
of Amnesty International. The volunteer panel of nine, with
representatives from the Netherlands to New Zealand, governs the
1.2-million-member organization.</LD>
<LD>   Based in London, Amnesty is perhaps best known for its Prisoner of
Conscience campaigns, which seek to free -- or at least ameliorate
the treatment of -- people around the world jailed for purely
political reasons.</LD>
<TE>   The principle is simple, Hoffman said: "People in one part of the
world helping people in another part of the world. Human rights
victims are not abstractions."</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Abdullah A'n Na'im, now a professor at Emory Law
School in Atlanta. Hoffman worked on Amnesty's 18-month campaign to
free Na'im, who was imprisoned in the early 1980s for advocating
legal reform in his country of Sudan. The two are now friends and
teach at a human rights seminar at Oxford University each summer.</TE>
<TE>   During his two decades as an Amnesty volunteer, Hoffman, 52, also
has represented torture victims in Ethiopia and Bosnia-Herzegovina
and farmers in Myanmar who allege that they were raped or enslaved by
that nation's military while Unocal turned a blind eye. The company
has denied the allegations, saying it did not aid or abet the
violation of anyone's human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman has also served as legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California, where he worked on behalf of
people spied on by the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, board chairman of Amnesty's U.S. chapter in 1988-89 and
1997-99, has been something of a pied piper in bringing together
people concerned with international human rights and domestic civil
liberties issues.</TE>
<TE>   As long ago as 1982, while teaching at Southwestern Law School,
Hoffman founded and served as national coordinator of Amnesty USA's
legal support network, which recruited volunteer lawyers to assist
U.S. residents who had human rights problems before immigrating.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the 1980s, while at the ACLU, he persuaded the
organization to create an international human rights project.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Hoffman played a key role in the creation and
initial funding of the Center for Justice &amp; Accountability, a San
Francisco-based Amnesty offshoot that specializes in representing
victims of torture. He has traveled to nearly two dozen countries on
such matters.</TE>
<TE>   "One could say Paul is a Johnny Appleseed of human rights
organizations," said Sandra Coliver, the center's executive director.
"He is so prolific and dynamic, and he is a mobilizer."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman's complementary interests came together while he studied
at New York University Law School, where he did volunteer legal work
for welfare recipients in East Harlem and for an international-law
professor.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles when he graduated in 1976 because partners
at Loeb and Loeb said they would give him time to do pro bono work
for the ACLU while handling commercial cases for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman spent five years at Loeb before moving on to Southwestern
for three years and the ACLU for a decade. He then joined a
Venice-based law firm now called Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris
&amp; Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman still does pro bono work while representing paying clients
such as actor Robert Blake, for whom he recently filed a
constitutional appeal for bail pending the actor's murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have worked with Hoffman say that in addition to being a
tenacious advocate, he utilizes a deft sense of humor to defuse tense
situations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he was presiding over a large Amnesty meeting in Boston,
which like many such gatherings was simultaneously translated into
French, Spanish and Arabic. The organization was facing a budget
shortfall, which meant projects had to be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "It got grim pretty quick. People were a bit testy," Hoffman said.
The board decided to take a break. Hoffman and a few others went to a
nearby restaurant. As he slid into a booth, Hoffman noticed a
multicolored wooden chicken for sale.</TE>
<TE>   He bought the chicken, named it Barbara and took it back to the
meeting. From that point on, whenever he decided a speaker had gone
on too long, Hoffman walked toward the person, waving the chicken,
drawing laughter from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wonderful, cross-cultural way to tell someone to shut
up," said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty
International USA. "You did not have to understand English to know
that when Paul picked up the chicken, it was time to shut up."</TE>
<TE>   In some situations though, Hoffman's primary task is to get
someone to start talking. One such client was Elizabeth Demissie, an
Ethiopian woman whom Hoffman represented in a 1993 civil trial.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, Edgegayehu Taye, a friend of Demissie working
in an Atlanta hotel, saw a bellman who looked like a former Ethiopian
official who had tortured her and two friends at an Addis Ababa jail
in the late 1970s. Taye called Demissie, who was living in Los
Angeles, and the other friend, who was living in Canada. The two went
to Atlanta and confirmed that the bellman was Kelbesso Negewo.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Los Angeles, Demissie received a call saying
that a Los Angeles lawyer -- Hoffman -- might be able to help her.
She made an appointment but was not sure what to say, because she had
never before described what had happened to her.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I could not put it together in words," Demissie said,
"but he just looked at me and said, 'Tell me what happened.' He has
very kind eyes. Somehow, I took my time and opened up.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat together and cried," she said as she recalled how as a
teenager she had been abducted, imprisoned for six months and
tortured. Her sister died in the prison and her father, a judge, was
found shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the three women sued under the Alien Tort Claims Act
of 1789. Before trial, Hoffman went to Ethiopia, "to see, to
understand what I was telling him," Demissie said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the women testified about how they had been tied up,
gagged and hung upside down while being interrogated and beaten at
the direction of Negewo.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge awarded $500,000 in damages to each of the women.
They have not collected, but the U.S. government is now trying to
denaturalize Negewo, who has been convicted in absentia in Ethiopia
of torture and murder.</TE>
<TE>   The experience, said Hoffman, "really gave me a deep understanding
of the lasting pain that human rights violations cause. And when you
think of the millions of Elizabeths in the world, it is a scary
thought."</TE>

<HD>Activist Won't Budge From His Lofty Perch</HD>
<DH>Tree sitter vows to save 400-year-old oak near Santa
Clarita slated to be cut for road project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset and Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undeterred by the sight of tree-cutting equipment and mounting
pressure from Los Angeles County officials, activist John Quigley
remained high in the boughs of an ancient oak near Santa Clarita
Thursday night, determined to save it.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to have to come up here and literally drag us out
if they want to remove us," said Quigley, who was joined by another
activist in his 50-foot-high perch, while supporters rallied at the
base of the tree.</LD>
<LD>   A rotating group of tree huggers, led by Quigley, has maintained a
24-hour vigil atop the 400-year-old oak, nicknamed Old Glory, since
Nov. 1, shortly after they learned it might be cut down.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, officials from John Laing Homes, the
developer of a neighboring subdivision, said the county was forcing
them to remove the tree in order to widen two-lane Pico Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The road, located on the west side of the Santa Clarita Valley,
will one day extend north through the proposed 20,000-home Newhall
Ranch subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   "They need a four-lane highway here," said Laing president William
Rattazzi. "My company is required to build the road."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday afternoon, the developer erected a chain-link fence
around the tree and posted "no trespassing" signs. But sheriff's
officials said they could only arrest the tree sitters at the request
of Laing officials, who have so far declined to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he had no intention of coming down until he is
certain the tree can be saved. "It's criminal to cut down a piece of
our heritage," said Quigley, a Pacific Palisades resident who said he
makes his living doing contract work as an environmental educator.</TE>
<TE>   As the sun went down, dozens of youths from a neighboring
subdivision turned up to show their support by chanting, "Save our
oak," and, "May the trees be with you."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in the neighborhood shared their enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid," said resident Byron Wainie as he took his dogs for
a stroll. "God knows there's people that'll fight for anything."</TE>

<HD>Strategy to Boost Housing Outlined</HD>
<DH>Expansion of rental units and assistance to low-income,
first-time home buyers are top concerns of advisory panel to city
trust fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing outside a newly renovated house in the Watts area Thursday,
Mayor James K. Hahn accepted a report that may provide the first
glimpse at how the city will spend and sustain a $100-million trust
fund created to improve housing.</LD>
<LD>   The report offers "a real strategy ... on how we can turn this
$100 million into hundreds millions more, and, more importantly, into
homes for people in Los Angeles," Hahn said to a gathering of housing
advocates.</LD>
<LD>   Created after a years-long campaign waged by local housing
advocates, the housing trust fund is viewed as key weapon in the
city's battle with its housing shortage. In the 2002-03 budget, the
mayor and City Council approved $42 million for the fund, which,
under the mayor's plan, will reach $100 million over the next few
years.</LD>
<TE>   In May, the mayor appointed an advisory committee to recommend
policies that will govern the fund; ultimately the measures must be
approved by the mayor and the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Mike Feuer, who chaired the Housing Trust
Fund Advisory Committee, applauded the mayor's vision for supporting
the fund -- and his tenacity for continuing to do so in a tough
budget year. "The next step is distributing these funds in the most
effective way possible.... Getting the money into the pipeline is
critical," Feuer said.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee report culminates a five-month effort. The
committee says the fund's key priority should be the expansion and
preservation of rental units affordable to households with combined
incomes of about $32,700. That's about 60% of the area's median
income, which for a family of four is $54,500.</TE>
<TE>   According to estimates from the Southern California Assn. of
Governments, the city needs 60,000 units by 2005 to meet its housing
needs. A lack of building, combined with a booming population, has
created a critical shortage that leaves many in the city paying more
than half their income on rent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the burden it places on the city's residents, the
lack of housing has economic ramifications, Hahn said. Some
businesses have avoided Los Angeles, or abandoned it, for cities
where housing is more affordable and plentiful, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's secondary priority, the report said, should be to offer
assistance to first-time home buyers with low-incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Homeownership creates the kind of a pride that can transform a
community, said Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, chairwoman of the
council's Housing and Community Development Committee. The committee
will hold hearings on the recommendations offered Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, she said, the difference between renting and owning is
being able to raise the down payment, and the trust fund could help
meet that goal.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee also recommended that the fund be used to
prevent homelessness by providing one-time grants to very-low-income
tenants on the verge of eviction or relocation.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee members ranged from housing advocates to
developers to a tenant organizer.</TE>
<TE>   Feuer said the diverse group was able to reach a consensus on
nearly every point.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Breidenbach, who headed Housing LA, the campaign that led to
the creation of the trust fund, said the recommendations do not stray
from the original intent of the fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very close to what we proposed," said Breidenbach, who also
was a member of the Housing Trust Fund Advisory Committee. "This is
going to be a model for the rest of the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The event Thursday was held at a house being bought by Jorge and
Ana Rodriguez through the Enterprise Foundation, which purchases
HUD-foreclosed homes and sells them to low-income, first-time buyers.
A loan from the city's Housing Department also helped the family.</TE>

<HD>10% Drop in Median Income in County Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The median income of Los Angeles County households diminished by a
"startling" 10% in inflation-adjusted dollars between 1990 and 2000,
according to a report issued Thursday by United Way.</LD>
<LD>   The figure went from $45,266 at the beginning of the decade to
$42,189 at the end of it, a decrease of about 7% without adjusting
for inflation.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-page report, "A Tale of Two Cities," contrasts rich and
poor in the county and is an updated version of a United Way study
three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Citing a variety of government and private sources, Marge Nichols,
who wrote the new report, said that 18% of all the county's
residents, or about 1.7 million, are living below the poverty level,
currently defined as $18,100 a year for a family of four. But this
represents a considerable improvement from 1995, during a severe
recession, when 24% of the residents were below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   The report says 23% of the county's households have incomes of
less than $20,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, 3% have annual incomes of $200,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting called by United Way at USC on Thursday, a panel of
experts discussed the meaning of the study. Panelist Arianna
Huffington, a syndicated columnist, said she has figures indicating
that although household income has been losing ground in Los Angeles,
chief executives nationwide earned 571% more in 2000 on average than
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found that Los Angeles County's demographics are
changing so quickly that by 2010 it is expected to have a majority
Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-four percent of county residents speak a language other than
English at home, and 36% of them are foreign-born, Nichols said.
Legal immigration added 1.2 million people to the county's population
during the decade. The largest group of immigrants was from Latin
America, 62%, followed by 30% from Asian countries. By 2000, 38% of
the foreign-born had become U.S. citizens, compared with only 27% in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Although 48% of high school graduates in the county entered
college in 2000, 30% of adults age 25 and over had not graduated from
high school.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found that:</TE>
<TE>   * The county leads the nation in the number of Latino- and
Asian-owned businesses, but is third in the number of African
American-owned businesses.</TE>
<TE>   * Minority businesses employ a total of 476,000 workers in the
county.</TE>
<TE>   * Only 32% of former welfare recipients who have been working for
five years earn incomes above the poverty level.</TE>
<TE>   * The greatest job growth in recent years has occurred within
lower-wage occupations.</TE>

<HD>1st West Nile Case in County Found</HD>
<DH>Health officials believe the Oxnard man contracted the
virus in Florida or the Caribbean. He has since made a full recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man has contracted West Nile virus, but county health
officials said Thursday they believe he became infected while working
in Florida or the Caribbean.</LD>
<LD>   The case is the first in Ventura County and the sixth in
California, officials said. Five victims acquired the virus east of
the Rocky Mountains, while the origin of one Los Angeles case remains
a mystery.</LD>
<LD>   Although health and environmental officials said they assumed the
local case was "imported," they warned that the virus -- which is
harbored by birds and transmitted by mosquitoes -- will arrive in the
area within the next year or so.</LD>
<TE>   "This stuff is coming here," said Dr. Robert M. Levin, the
county's top health officer. "It's only a matter of time. One of
these days I will be responsible for saying someone has the West Nile
virus and that they got it in our county."</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard man, whom officials declined to identify to protect his
privacy, has fully recovered since first showing symptoms in
mid-October. He was never hospitalized, and officials emphasized that
the virus cannot be transmitted from human to human.</TE>
<TE>   "This case was surprising but not unexpected," said William
Stratton of the county's Environmental Health division.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton said that for several years, his office has been
regularly testing mosquitoes and chickens throughout the area and
that no evidence of the virus has appeared so far. The heavy mosquito
season runs from May through October.</TE>
<TE>   According to officials, the Oxnard man returned home Oct. 8 after
working in Florida and the Caribbean. He began to feel ill Oct. 14,
and two days later he went to a local emergency room for treatment of
flu-like symptoms, including a headache, fever and nausea.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, some astute clinician, thinking this person could
have the West Nile virus, ordered the correct panel of tests," Levin
said.</TE>
<TE>   The man left the hospital the same day and recovered within a few
days. The blood sample he provided doctors was shipped to a state
biologist, who notified county officials Wednesday of the positive
test.</TE>
<TE>   The first case of the virus in the state was detected in early
September when a 31-year-old Los Angeles County woman was treated for
meningitis caused by the West Nile infection. She has fully
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In that case -- unlike the others in the state -- health officials
don't know how she acquired the virus. The woman had not traveled
outside the region and did not remember being bitten by a mosquito.</TE>
<TE>   A second case also occurred in Los Angeles County, and the others
were reported in Orange and Contra Costa counties and San Francisco.
In those cases, the patients had traveled outside the state prior to
being infected.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials said that people experience mild symptoms in
about one in five cases, and about one in 150 of those infected need
hospitalization. A vast majority of patients display no symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The virus, in its most serious form, can cause death.</TE>

<HD>Central YWCA to Close in June 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The YWCA of Central Orange County, unable to cover the costs of child
care, after-school programs and other services, will close its doors
next year.</LD>
<LD>   The demise of the 81-year-old institution leaves Orange County
with only one YWCA, down from five at the organization's height.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a heartbreaker," said Arianna Barrios, a YWCA board member.
"Everyone worked very, very hard and did their very, very best, but
sometimes you do your best and it's just not enough."</LD>
<TE>   Officials said that while fund-raising in recent years was mostly
successful, its programs were simply losing too much money. For
example, the YWCA's infant-care program lost more than $5,000 a month
for years. In 2001, the club spent $73,000 more than its $836,000
budget.</TE>
<TE>   A recent downturn in contributions to nonprofits across the nation
only worsened the financial picture, pushing the YWCA of Central
Orange County over the brink.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is you need to look at programs with a strict eye on
the bottom line," Barrios said. "If you are not funding programs, you
need to cut that program. [But] in the history of the YWCA, we have
not done that.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is in negotiation with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of
Santa Ana and Tustin to take over facilities and programs at the YWCA
in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Both Boys &amp; Girls Clubs were already planning to expand into
Orange, where there are 7,000 children who need afternoon programs
and services, said John Brewster, president and chief operating
officer of the Santa Ana club.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we were going to do anyway," he said. "This
just seems to be an opportunity to do it quicker and to access a
population that needs us now."</TE>
<TE>   All YWCA programs will continue through June 2003. The Boys &amp;
Girls Club is expected to take over after-school care starting Dec.
2, though it will no longer be a licensed program. The First
Presbyterian Church in Orange will pay for a costly busing program
that takes motel children to school.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA will look to other nonprofits to take over other
programs, such as a housing program for women leaving foster families
at age 18.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA will hold a public meeting to discuss the closure at 6
p.m. Monday at 146 N. Grand Ave., Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The YWCA's only remaining Orange County chapter is the YWCA of
North Orange County in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really saddened that one of my sister organizations has to
close their doors," said Diane Masseth-Jones, executive director.
"The YWCA of North Orange County is ready to meet the challenge and
provide programs and services on behalf of the YWCA."</TE>
<TE>   Masseth-Jones said her chapter has taken several steps to ensure
that it does not meet a similar fate, including a diversified funding
base and requiring programs to fund themselves. Two years ago, the
chapter ended a licensed day-care center because the cost of
compliance with state codes was too high.</TE>

<HD>Time Isn't on America's Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Graham Allison</AU>
<BD>Graham Allison is director of the Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three-way bargaining game that pits the United States against
Iraq -- with the United Nations in the middle -- has not ended but
rather intensified with Saddam Hussein's early acceptance of the
intrusive U.N. inspection regime. We should expect further bold moves
by Hussein in an effort to delay and deter an American-led war on
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake: Time is on Hussein's side. If he succeeds in
pushing off U.S. military action beyond the "winter window" for war,
U.N. resolve could weaken (for instance, when Germany assumes the
presidency of the Security Council in February); U.S. attention could
shift (with another major Al Qaeda terrorist attack in the U.S.); or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could explode into war (after the
January Israeli election).</LD>
<LD>   Like Mr. Micawber, the Charles Dickens character in "David
Copperfield," Hussein's hope is that "something will turn up."</LD>
<TE>   As recently as two weeks ago, Washington insiders predicted an 80%
chance of war against Iraq by next spring. After the Bush
administration's victory in the Security Council and Iraq's response,
those odds now drop to 50-50.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council specified a precise timetable against which
Hussein's mice will seek to elude the U.N. cats as an ominous
American presence hovers over both.</TE>
<TE>   By Dec. 8, Hussein must declare all weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq. At that point, chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix should have
"immediate, unimpeded, unconditional and unrestricted" access to any
site in the country.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspection teams must begin work by Dec. 23 and report their
findings to the Security Council no later than Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   No one in Washington or Baghdad can say with certainty how this
deadly game will end. If Hussein concludes that his only hope of
survival in power is to surrender his weapons of mass destruction, he
could yield to the U.N. inspection regime, to the amazement and
indeed consternation of hawks in the Bush administration. Or Hussein
could stiff U.N. inspectors so blatantly that even his strongest
supporters in the Arab world would abandon him. More likely, however,
is a fuzzy middle road in which Hussein seeks to do as little as he
can get away with in an attempt to postpone war beyond the current
season.</TE>
<TE>   Should he prove sufficiently cooperative by declaring some weapons
facilities that inspectors could confirm and dismantle, U.N.
inspection teams could extend their work into next summer.</TE>
<TE>   If war is postponed, how should the parties use this unexpected
hiatus? Surely Hussein will not change his spots. We should expect
him to accelerate his plans to unleash a plague of horrors if and
when we do attack.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to fight a war that could start in January or be delayed
until the following winter would stress American military services,
requiring them to keep substantial forces and equipment at a high
level of readiness.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, this credible threat of war is the essential
prerequisite for any peaceful disarmament of Iraq. As National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice put it, "We have to keep ... a gun
pointed to the head of the Iraqi regime because that's the only way
that they cooperate." This hiatus also offers an opportunity for the
U.S. and our allies to get real about defending ourselves against the
retaliatory vengeance Hussein is planning.</TE>
<TE>   Only last week, officials made public a highly classified report
revealing the intelligence community's judgment that Iraq possesses
the smallpox virus. Another recently declassified estimate concluded
that Hussein would be "likely" to retaliate against an American
attack by using chemical and biological weapons against us.</TE>
<TE>   We are not prepared for such an attack. On current timetables, the
Department of Health and Human Services will not have enough approved
smallpox vaccine for the entire population until late 2003. More
important, preparations to vaccinate the population during the
four-day window after an initial smallpox attack have hardly begun.</TE>
<TE>   If war against Iraq is postponed, most Americans will breathe a
sigh of relief. Unfortunately, such relief is more likely to
encourage complacency than vigilant preparation. If the Bush
administration finds itself with an unexpected delay in military
action, it should seize the opportunity to bolster America's defense
against Hussein's probable designs.</TE>

<LD>JERUSALEM -- On Nov. 19, 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat flew to
Tel Aviv and told Israelis what they had waited decades to hear from
an Arab leader: We welcome you into the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   At that moment, Sadat -- who only four years earlier had led
Egyptian troops in a surprise attack against the Jewish state on Yom
Kippur -- became an Israeli hero. Yielding to domestic pressure, the
right-wing Israeli government of then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin
withdrew to the 1967 borders, handing the Sinai in its entirety back
to Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   As the 25th anniversary of Sadat's initiative approaches, it is
worth examining what so far remains the only successful
land-for-peace exchange in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Sadat understood that the key to peace was reassuring Israelis
that it was safe to withdraw and that at the end of the "land for
peace" process there would indeed be peace for Israel. In effect, the
Egyptian president reversed that formula and offered "peace for land"
-- a meaningful Arab gesture of reconciliation that convinced
Israelis to take a chance on withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Sadat's psychological overture acknowledged Israel's
precariousness as the only non-Arab state in the Middle East. Israel
may be Goliath in its confrontation with the Palestinians, but in its
confrontation with the vast Arab world, it is forced into the role of
David.</TE>
<TE>   Just compare Sadat's wisdom with the approach of Arab leaders
today.</TE>
<TE>   Following this week's terrorist atrocity at Kibbutz Metzer, in
which a mother and two children were murdered in their home by a
gunman from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade -- which is linked to Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction -- the Palestinian Authority's official radio
station, Voice of Palestine, noted that the assault occurred "in the
so-called kibbutz, or farm community, which is a colony north of
Tulkarm." By referring to a kibbutz within Israel's pre-1967 borders
as a "colony," the station was declaring that there is no difference
between a West Bank settlement and any Jewish community in Israel
proper.</TE>
<TE>   For Palestinian leaders, the Jewish state is inherently an illegal
settlement, a foreign implant in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   That brutal moment of candor is a reminder that this war isn't
about settlements or occupation but about the Palestinian
leadership's refusal to accept Israel's right to exist in any
borders.</TE>
<TE>   The radio broadcast was a classic example of Palestinian
doublespeak: Even as Arafat was denouncing the kibbutz attack in
English to the international media, his own Arabic medium was
broadcasting an opposite message, justifying the attack as
retaliation for the Israeli army's shooting of two terrorists on
their way to a suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   That doublespeak is routine for many Arab leaders, who promise
reconciliation in English and war and hatred in Arabic. Consider the
much-touted Saudi peace plan, released last spring, that offered
recognition of Israel by the Arab world in exchange for full
territorial withdrawal and a "just solution" to the refugee problem
-- a code phrase for inundating the Jewish state with Palestinian
refugees hostile to Israel's existence, rather than resettling them
in a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The very day that the Arab League released the plan in Beirut, a
Saudi government newspaper published an article reviving a medieval
blood libel, claiming that Jews use Gentile blood for their ritual
devotions. And that same week, the Saudi government's
English-language Web site ran a long piece by former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke alleging a Zionist effort to dominate the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi plan was nothing more than a public relations gimmick
aimed at post-9/11 damage control.</TE>
<TE>   Sadat, by contrast, understood that the key to resolving the
conflict was psychological. Throughout the often difficult peace
process between Israel and Egypt, Sadat was never caught speaking
peace in English and holy war in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   No conqueror ever feared, as Israel does, that by withdrawing from
occupied territory it would risk not merely diminishment but
destruction. Indeed, no country other than Israel faces enemies who
refuse to acknowledge its simple right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than address the fears of Israelis, as Sadat did, Arab
leaders today tend to incite them. That includes Sadat's unworthy
successor, Hosni Mubarak, whose state television is currently
broadcasting a 41-part drama centered on "The Protocols of the Elders
of Zion," a century-old forgery that became the Nazis' favorite
anti-Jewish text.</TE>
<TE>   Today there are streets in Israel named for Anwar Sadat. Whatever
happens next in the Middle East, there will be no Israeli streets
named for Mubarak or Arafat.</TE>

<HD>Tape Exposes Man Behind Al Qaeda Curtain</HD>
<DH>Bin Laden's latest mutterings sound like a pathetic bid to
regain relevancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Avigdor Haselkorn</AU>
<BD>Avigdor Haselkorn is the author of "The Continuing
Storm: Iraq, Poisonous Weapons and Deterrence" (Yale University
Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest Osama bin Laden tape may actually be good news. But a
powerful combination of divergent interests seems to be conspiring to
keep us from realizing that.</LD>
<LD>   By implicitly claiming ownership for such outrages as the attack
on the synagogue in Tunisia; the killing of the French engineers in
Karachi, Pakistan; the bombing of the French tanker off Yemen; the
attack on the U.S. Marines in Kuwait; the Moscow theater takeover;
and the Bali nightclub bombing, Bin Laden confirms that Al Qaeda's
ability to conduct a catastrophic attack on the scale of Sept. 11 may
have been severely degraded.</LD>
<LD>   It is possible to argue that the tape is a pathetic attempt to
claim relevancy. After all, some of the attacks, like Moscow and
Bali, have had little to do operationally with Al Qaeda except
perhaps in terms of a shared anti-Western ideology. Moreover, some of
the incidents that Bin Laden praised were clear-cut failures. The
Moscow theater takeover must be seen as a botched operation, and
neither the 2,000-year-old synagogue nor the French tanker was
destroyed as planned.</LD>
<TE>   Most telling, the Indonesians arrested for the Bali attack have
expressed disappointment that their attempts to target Americans
largely failed. Yet in the tape, Bin Laden alleges that Australia was
the target because of its support for the U.S.-led war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, instead of these interpretations of Bin Laden's tape,
the American public has been hearing the opposite message.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda, it is said, is still very much in business. President
Bush lamented that the message indicated "yet again that we're at
war." In fact, some have gone as far as warning that the tape may
herald new devastating attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Why would the U.S. help Bin Laden's effort to intimidate and
frighten?</TE>
<TE>   First, the Bush administration is understandably playing it safe.
Because of the secretive nature of the enemy and the great
uncertainties the U.S. faces, Washington prefers to err on the side
of safety. After the Sept. 11 attacks, worst-case thinking has become
the only rule in town.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also is worried that any claim of victory would
undermine public alertness. And claiming success could weaken support
for the administration's robust foreign policy at a time when war
with Iraq is on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the counter-terrorism "industry" in the West has a vested
interest in blocking a message that the organization has been
crippled.</TE>
<TE>   Various experts were announcing as late as last week that the
question of Bin Laden's survival was irrelevant given that Al Qaeda
is a terrorist network powered by a common ideology and deployed
around the globe in readiness to act. These same experts are now
claiming that the tape may portend a new offensive.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion that operatives are waiting for a green light from
Bin Laden to strike is ludicrous. Terrorism has been at full throttle
ever since Bin Laden issued his fatwa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are the opponents of a U.S. attack on Iraq who tout
the tape as proof that Bush is going after the wrong enemy and would
divert the nation from the war on terrorism. These same critics,
however, have long maintained that an attack on Iraq would serve Al
Qaeda and bring it multitudes of new recruits. If the removal of
Saddam Hussein would work so clearly in his favor, why would Bin
Laden go out of his way to warn the U.S. against invading Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   The answer could be that Bin Laden has reached the conclusion that
an American offensive would quickly topple the Iraqi leader. He has
no interest in another demonstration of overwhelming American
superiority. Worse yet, the establishment of a pro-Western regime in
Iraq would vividly illustrate Bin Laden's disastrous record. Despite
his best efforts, the U.S. was not destroyed. Moreover, it is still
well entrenched in the areas that he has claimed for the new Islamic
caliphate.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the downfall of Hussein would be the best evidence yet
that, despite Bin Laden's bluster, his Sept. 11 attacks were
instrumental in a new American "empire" gradually taking shape in
Central and South Asia as well as in the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>The Polling Results Are In: You're a Liar</HD>
<DH>Who's to blame for survey errors? Voters, of course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a rule, pollsters come equipped with more excuses than a married
man with lipstick on his collar. And this year was no different. Whom
did they point the finger of blame at most frequently? Why you and
me, naturally.</LD>
<LD>   It seems we just didn't turn out at the polls in exactly the
configurations the pollsters thought we would. The problems aren't
polls, so say the pulse takers, it's those voters who say one thing
then do another. Like show up on election day.</LD>
<LD>   The problem isn't with us, dear voters -- or even with you, dear
nonvoters. The problem is with the pollsters' inability to account
for an increasingly uncooperative public.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to cell phones, answering machines, caller ID, a surfeit of
polls and a growing distaste for telephonic intrusions into our
homes, it's getting harder and harder for pollsters to find Americans
willing to answer their questions. Twenty years ago, polling response
rates were over 60%; now they are closer to 30% -- and in some cases
even lower. It's pretty tough to get an accurate reading of the
public's opinion when the most frequent response you receive is a
click followed by a dial tone.</TE>
<TE>   So here we are in the middle of a vicious vortex. Pollsters
conduct their increasingly inaccurate polls; the media then report
the results as if Moses has just brought them down from the
mountaintop; and our politicians tailor their messages to suit
phantom voters. All the players involved in this charade understand
they are acting on the flimsiest of pretenses -- it's just that
relying on polls is so much easier than actually reporting or
leading.</TE>
<TE>   Even President Bush, who charged into office trumpeting his
disdain for polls -- don't they all? -- has proved to be a chronic
poll watcher and poll taker. In fact, this stance has actually become
something of an in-joke at the White House: Bush brags about not
looking at polls and everyone laughs, knowing the president doesn't
have to look because Karl Rove has already whispered the results in
his ear.</TE>
<TE>   But allowing polling data to become a substitute for thinking has
become a very wobbly crutch indeed. Just ask the Democrats who, after
consulting their pollsters' tea leaves, decided not to take on the
president on tax cuts or on invading Iraq. They were forced to pay
for their slavish devotion to the numbers with their political lives.
Pollsters, on the other hand, are allowed to tiptoe away from the
carnage their handiwork has wrought and still keep their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   As Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute wryly puts
it: "It's the sin of broadcasting in the modern age. No matter how
wrong you are, the punishment is you get your own show on cable
television."</TE>
<TE>   I think it's time to attach some downside to the political
prognosticators' game. Perhaps we should fine pollsters $100,000 for
every percentage point they are off. Or attach a large letter I (for
Inaccurate) to the lapels of those who are wrong more than they are
right. Or perhaps we can follow the lead of British soccer leagues,
which regularly consign teams with losing records to second-tier
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   And, if all else fails, there is always the option of a little
reverse Pavlovian training; let's say, by attaching electrodes to
pollsters on election night and sending a charge through them any
time a poll-based prediction proves erroneous. It would give a whole
new meaning to the term "political buzz."</TE>
<TE>   If you, like me, are one of the many millions who hang up on
callers wanting to know what kind of toothpaste I prefer, what TV
shows I watch or what candidates I'm going to vote for, you'll be
proud to know that you are part of a rapidly expanding segment of the
population known as the "margin of error." And if you're not, now is
the perfect time to join us and make anti-democratic polling a thing
of the past.</TE>

<HD>A Failing School Perks Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Designated one of the 10 worst schools in Los Angeles, John C.
Fremont High School had nowhere to go but further down. At least that
seemed to be everyone's expectation when it came to this and other
failing schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Test
scores in the basement today? Wait until next year -- they'll be
lower. Then along came a real leader and genuine help from the
district. It's no miracle, but the rate of change has state and local
officials breathless.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, state officials gave the 4,600-student high school 18
months to improve and assigned a team of monitors. In a Times profile
of the audit in July, even the state monitors described themselves as
"blown away" by the school's failings, from widespread class ditching
to the two weeks of firecrackers set off near a girls restroom.</LD>
<LD>   Today they are amazed by its fledgling turnaround. A dynamic new
principal, LaVerne Brunt, arrived in August, kicked off her high
heels and sprinted into action. First she went after the slackers who
milled about in the hallways during class time. A year ago, the state
auditors noted that hundreds of loiterers never even budged when the
class bell rang. They do now.</LD>
<TE>   It's still a leap from getting students into classrooms to making
sure they learn. But Brunt knows that one can't happen without the
other. And she sends a message that teenagers -- and teachers -- need
to hear: Someone is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The state auditors are seeing other dramatic changes too.
Once-unfocused classes are livelier and more engaging, due in part to
teachers' willingness to follow Brunt into weekend coaching sessions.
It's too early for new test scores, and there's no sugarcoating the
challenge at a school where last year one-third of incoming freshmen
tested at third-grade reading levels or lower. Still, the early
reports are dazzling.</TE>
<TE>   Brunt isn't doing this alone, of course. With the state
threatening to take over Fremont if test scores don't go up, the
LAUSD has temporarily reassigned administrators (who typically mill
about in district offices) to help keep students in line. UCLA and
the nonprofit Los Angeles Educational Partnership are helping coach
teachers. And Fremont teachers and students themselves seem to be
embracing the changes, happy, as Brunt put it, "to be on a winning
team."</TE>
<TE>   Students at this South-Central high school start with few
advantages. About 80% are poor and many of their families don't speak
English at home. Few have parents who graduated from high school. No
one lacked excuses for failure -- until a dynamic leader came along
to raise expectations and bring the right resources to meet them.
Every principal and administrator who has blamed failure on the
shortcomings of students had better be paying attention.</TE>

<LD>Iraq announced its acceptance of United Nations weapons inspectors in
a few lines of a nine-page letter. The rest was filled with
vituperation against the United States and hints that it might make
the inspectors' jobs as difficult as in the past. That's not what the
U.N. Security Council unanimously authorized last week, and the
council should not allow Iraq anything less than full compliance.
Inspections are not themselves the goal, but a means of removing
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Much of Foreign Minister Naji Sabri's letter might be bluster, but
given Baghdad's resistance to inspections from 1991 through the last
one in 1998, wholehearted cooperation is extremely unlikely. Past
inspectors told of Iraqis keeping them standing in the sun for hours
while supposedly searching for keys to suspected weapons laboratories
and of loaded trucks going out the back door of a building while they
waited at the front.</LD>
<LD>   Thus when Sabri says Iraq will "take into consideration [the
inspectors'] way of conduct" and let them do their jobs if they do so
"professionally and lawfully," red flags should fly. The U.N. advance
party due to arrive next week should remind Iraq that the Security
Council has demanded "immediate, unimpeded, unconditional and
unrestricted access" to all sites, including Saddam Hussein's
presidential compounds.</LD>
<TE>   A first key deadline comes Dec. 8, when Iraq must supply a list of
materials it can use for chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The
United States and other nations will compare that list with their
own, compiled from intelligence sources and Iraqi defectors.
Washington should not be in a rush to publicize individual
discrepancies or obstructions of inspectors. By waiting, and building
a solid case to present to the Security Council, it would win support
from more nations.</TE>
<TE>   Even with good satellite photography and intelligence, it will not
be easy to find weapons of mass destruction. Four years without
inspections allowed Iraq time to conceal, even bury, laboratories
across a country larger than California.</TE>
<TE>   However, if inspectors do visit suspect sites without tipping off
Iraqis first and take advantage of new sensors and radars not
available to past sleuths, they may be able to pinpoint weapons the
U.N. has barred Iraq from possessing since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. These include chemical, biological and nuclear arms. The
stakes are high because of Iraq's history of using chemical weapons
against Iran and the Kurds in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush proclaimed "zero tolerance" for Iraqi cheating on
inspections, and the threat of military action remains. Yes,
Washington is pushing to keep the Security Council focused and
unyielding and some members are pushing back, as they have all along.
But inspections will be a reality. It's up to Hussein to accept this
"final opportunity" to disarm.</TE>

<LD>Labor strife that closed West Coast ports for 10 days in October took
a painful bite out of the national economy. So those with livelihoods
tied to the waterfront breathed easier Nov. 1 when shipping companies
and West Coast dockworkers reached tentative agreement on their
toughest issue, the introduction of new labor-saving technology.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing is easy on the waterfront.</LD>
<LD>   Hopes for a quick end to the dispute evaporated when the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime
Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, said
they were miles apart on a pension proposal. After a weeklong break,
federally sanctioned mediation sessions resumed Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government's push to get both sides talking faltered
Oct. 2 when management brass inexplicably showed up with armed
bodyguards and union negotiators left in a huff. The maritime
association began lobbing allegations of an illegal slowdown by union
members. A cooler atmosphere was in evidence a month later when
closed-door sessions conducted by the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service produced a tentative agreement on the
introduction of electronic scanners and other devices already used
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   New technology will eliminate hundreds of union-represented jobs,
so each remaining job triggers a bigger fight over pay and benefits.
The Wal-Marts of the world are pressing shipping lines to use
technology to trim costs. Longshore workers are pushing equally hard
for a piece of those savings. That's part of what is fueling the
pension dispute; past negotiations have taught the union to demand
something in return when jobs are cut.</TE>
<TE>   These aren't new issues. Negotiating teams answered equally thorny
questions that arose as powerful cranes and cargo containers reshaped
the waterfront years ago. And labor peace prevailed for three decades
because both sides were willing to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   The economic effect of the last port strike, in 1971, was
relatively minor. But 43% of the country's oceangoing shipping
containers now pass through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
In a "just in time" manufacturing world, containers serve as
oceangoing warehouses, so waterfront labor strife quickly causes pain
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration used the Taft-Hartley Act to win a court
order to keep the ports operating until late December. Management and
labor must use the remaining window to work with federal mediators
toward a settlement. The alternative is to drive business away from
Southern California ports and further damage the national economy.
Neither side wants the blame for that.</TE>

<LD>Republicans blame Gov. Gray Davis (and rightly so) for the state's
budget deficit. Conversely, the huge budget deficit incurred by the
Bush administration is ignored, free of any criticism. By what
sleight of hand does Bush plan to cut taxes while increasing
spending, thus incurring an even greater deficit, which our children
and our children's children will have to repay? With our ongoing and
necessary war against terrorism and our probable war against Iraq,
our defense budget will soar.</LD>
<LD>   Cutting taxes is strictly a political ploy devoid of any economic
logic. Polls indicate the majority of Americans support a tax cut and
a war against Iraq. We can't have it both ways. Bush senior was
roundly criticized for increasing taxes, yet it was necessary to pay
for the Gulf War. Increased spending and taxing less is akin to a
person suffering a cut in pay and then buying a more expensive house
and luxury car.</LD>

<HD>Schwarzenegger Has Long Helped Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What does Steve Lopez have against Arnold Schwarzenegger? In his Nov.
8 column, "Will Conan the Republican Come to the State's Rescue?" he
describes Schwarzenegger as having "no experience and no known
political positions." With a minimum of research one can discover
that, since 1979, Schwarzenegger has served as the weight-training
coach for the Special Olympics; he served as chairman of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness (his mission being to improve
fitness for American children, to increase parental involvement in
their children's fitness and to promote community-based fitness
programs); and, since 1991, he has been executive commissioner of the
Hollenbeck Inner-City Games in Los Angeles, a mini-Olympics designed
to help kids say no to drugs and violence and yes to fitness as a way
of life.</LD>
<LD>   Schwarzenegger has been involved in helping make children's lives
better for many years. He may very well run for political office, and
I can't understand how that would not be a positive event. I happened
to meet Schwarzenegger on a number of random occasions and found him
to be friendly and charming (warm and fuzzy), not at all the
"puffed-up immigrant" that Lopez portrays him as. In light of recent
political scandals, how refreshing to have a possible candidate who
really does care about making life better for young Americans and has
the conviction to do just that.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Will 'Terminator' Be Back ... in Politics?" Nov. 7: Please
take note of the way Schwarzenegger uses voodoo economics to pay for
his Proposition 49. If this is the way he can take a good idea and
force it into an inflexible, moronically conceived measure, imagine
what he would do as governor? It will take the courts to sort out
this mess. Please keep him in the movies, where reality doesn't count
and budgets are always ignored. California doesn't need the
Terminator.</TE>

<LD>We now understand, according to the CIA's interpretation of a new
audiotape, that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive ("Bin Laden
'Could Be' on Tape," Nov. 13). Well, chalk this up as another
"success" by the Bush administration, which postures like a
gunslinger but generally fires blanks. As Jackie Mason points out in
his new Broadway comedy show, the endless and futile bombing of the
Tora Bora caves in Afghanistan to get Bin Laden basically created a
lot of new caves -- and the Afghans should thank us for providing
them with "a lot of beautiful new apartments."</LD>
<LD>   Too bad the Bushies can't seem to bring themselves to put that
same manic energy into providing some housing for those in need right
here at home rather than devoting themselves to the endless pursuit
of snowmobiling right over the country's last pristine environments,
our national parks ("Parks Proposal Alarms Activists," Nov. 13).</LD>

<LD>I think Winona Ryder got a bum rap. Ernest Heyneman, who stole more
than $10,000 worth of public library books and tapes, was ordered by
the court to return the books, stay away from all local libraries and
turn over his library card ("Judge Bans Book Thief, 85, From
Libraries," Nov. 13). If justice were equal, Ryder would have been
asked to return the stolen goods, stay away from Saks Fifth Avenue
stores in the future and turn over her charge card.</LD>

as I might sympathize with Bobby Seale and David Hilliard over their
complaint that their trademarked Black Panther was usurped by
anti-Semites, I wonder if they, and the general public, know that the
name and logo were not original to them. That in fact, during World
War II, the all-African American 761st tank battalion (a courageous
and unsung group if there ever was one) had an identical logo and the
same name. They called themselves the Black Panthers and were
instrumental in helping win the Battle of the Bulge.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Sin of Media Ignorance," Commentary, Nov. 13: I believe
Andrew Greeley's anger is misdirected. Do not kill the messenger. His
anger should be directed toward the hierarchy of his church and not
the media. The church's hierarchy has hidden sexual abuse by its
employees, protected them and destroyed many lives with cover-ups and
denials of these crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Father Greeley, these are crimes. In fact, in my opinion, the
hierarchy has been an accessory to these crimes in many dioceses.</LD>
<LD>   The media have done a fine job of informing not only Catholics but
all of our society. I believe that this exposure is doing more good
than we know. I am sure that many children will not be abused because
of this exposure in the media.</LD>
<TE>   It is time for the hierarchy of the Catholic Church to tell us all
the truth, and in doing so maybe we can help to mend the lives of
those who have been so brutally abused by the clergy and their
superiors.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Bishops Change Tone on Abuse," Nov. 12: It seems to me that
the Catholic bishops are uninterested in searching out the root cause
for why such an alarming number of priests have abused children.
Their resistance to further discussion of this issue suggests to me
that they are not planning to, and do not care to, look within the
organization and discover what may have contributed to this
outrageous problem.</TE>
<TE>   The people who are accused by bishops of "advancing their own
agendas" are people who are simply asking the difficult questions
that need to be asked. Yet again I am left to conclude that child
abuse is not an issue of importance and validity to the leaders of
the Catholic Church, but rather is viewed as a public relations
nightmare that they have grown tired of. Only when the church agrees
to openly, honestly and thoroughly examine the problem can meaningful
change occur.</TE>

<HD>State Will Be a Footnote in the 2004 Elections</HD>

<LD>The recent elections represent a disaster for California. We will
have no senators in the majority party. We will have no committee
chairmanships and no committee majority members. Likewise, the
overwhelming portion of our members of Congress also will be in the
minority. Voters of California have moved us to the left, away from
the rest of the nation. We will be left to stew in our own "deficit
juices" with no expectations of help from the federal government.
What is just as alarming is that Republicans outpolled Democrats in
the congressional races around the nation.</LD>
<LD>   This means that in 2004, California will be a footnote in the
national elections. Republicans do not need us. As a Republican, I am
alarmed by what is happening in our state, by how far and how fast we
are distancing ourselves from the rest of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   We are faced with either growing deficits, higher taxes or both.
Over-regulation is causing businesses to leave for greener pastures,
across state lines. We need to seriously think about whether we are
drifting in the right direction.</LD>

<TE>   Ross Baker must be talking about a different Democratic Party from
the one I abandoned five years ago (Commentary, Nov. 12). The
Democrats of the last few decades have become less and less, not
more, liberal -- gutting the social safety net, doing the bidding of
multinational corporations, increasing military spending every year,
refusing to stand up for gay and lesbian rights to marry and serve in
the military, going along on the failed, immoral war on drugs and in
so many other ways doing a darn good imitation of Republicans. If
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt is a liberal, what's the Green Party?
Stalinist?</TE>

<TE>   It puzzles me why any thinking person would vote Republican. When
you consider the GOP position on the environment, health care,
unionization of working people and corporate welfare, it seems to me
that support of Republican principles is simply anti-Earth and
anti-humankind. The Democrats in Congress are not nearly the kind of
leaders we need to create a cleaner world and peace and social
justice, but at least the Democratic Party hasn't been hijacked by
Christian fundamentalists whose philosophy is first cousin to the
Taliban's.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has refused to reconsider a ruling that could
force the city to tear down a cross atop Mt. Soledad overlooking La
Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   But the City Council has instructed its city attorney to continue
the decade-long fight to protect the 43-foot-tall cross that the ACLU
insists violates the constitutional separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June that the
city's stratagem to preserve the cross by selling the property
beneath it to a private, nonprofit group was unconstitutional because
the auction favored groups pledged to keeping the cross intact. In a
decision revealed Wednesday, the same court refused to reconsider its
earlier order.</LD>
<TE>   "The taxpayers might want to ask their city leaders how much of
their money they intend to spend resisting the court's rulings," said
San Diego attorney James McElroy, representing plaintiff Philip
Paulson, an atheist and Vietnam veteran.</TE>
<TE>   But City Atty. Casey Gwinn said the City Council, in closed
session, instructed him to fight it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gwinn
noted that the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
considered by many legal scholars to be the most liberal in the
country, is often overturned by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Gwinn said the Mt. Soledad Memorial Assn., which bought the land
from the city, has spent $1 million improving the site, which is
maintained as a war memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Gwinn said, 6,000 families have bought individual plaques
honoring family members who died during military service.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not just the cross," Gwinn said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is the 1st Amendment rights of 6,000 families who are
honoring their loved ones," Gwinn said. "This fight is not over."</TE>
<TE>   Erected in 1952, the cross enjoys enormous political support in
this military city.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the ACLU has claimed that the cross is not simply a war
memorial but a Christian symbol and thus inappropriate for public
land.</TE>

<HD>Delay Sought on Sentencing of Westerfield</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for David Westerfield, who was convicted Aug. 21 of killing
Danielle van Dam, filed a request Thursday to have their client's
sentencing postponed so they can explore the possibility that he
killed the 7-year-old before taking her body from her home.</LD>
<LD>   If it can be proved that Westerfield killed the girl in her home,
not as part of a kidnapping, it could help him escape the death
penalty.</LD>
<LD>   A jury sentenced Westerfield to death after earlier deciding that
he killed Danielle while kidnapping her, a "special circumstance"
under state law that permits imposition of the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd has set a hearing for next
Friday to announce whether he will impose the death penalty or
sentence Westerfield to life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers Steven Feldman and Robert Boyce based their
request on a story in the October edition of San Diego Magazine that
includes a quote from an unnamed source who indicated that police
believe Danielle was killed in her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys said they need time to determine the source of the
quote and whether prosecutors withheld information from them.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, prosecutors did not pinpoint when they felt
Westerfield killed the girl, who lived with her family in the same
upscale neighborhood as Westerfield. The 50-year-old design engineer,
alleged by prosecutors to have been harboring sexual fantasies about
small girls, did not testify during the trial.</TE>

<HD>Environmental Health Hazards to Be Studied</HD>
<DH>Researchers at UCLA and UC Berkeley will look for links
between disease and pollutants and will track problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica M. Scully</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>A new center run by UC Berkeley and UCLA will study associations
between disease and environmental pollutants, including air pollution
and pesticides.</LD>
<LD>   It will also help state and county health departments better
monitor these links.</LD>
<LD>   "For the first time in this state, we have both the northern
university and UCLA in the south working to develop better approaches
to tracking environmental health hazards," said John Froines, head of
the UCLA scientists and a professor of toxicology in the university's
School of Public Health.</LD>
<TE>   The center, run by 10 researchers from UC Berkeley and four from
UCLA, will be funded by a three-year grant from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   The new center has received $741,000 for the first year, and
university researchers expect a similar amount for the next two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The grant is part of a $14.2-million program funded by the CDC to
start a nationwide tracking system for health problems related to
chemicals, toxins and other substances in the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers, who will work out of facilities at both
universities' schools of public health, plan to focus first on links
between air pollution and asthma, looking at data on asthma from a
statewide survey and air pollution levels in the San Francisco Bay
Area, San Joaquin Valley, and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers think they will find more cases of asthma with
complications in areas with higher pollution, said Dr. John Balmes,
the director of the new center and a professor of environmental
health sciences at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of research that suggests environmental factors may
play a role [in asthma], but we don't have really good numbers on
what percent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers will use projects they are already working on,
including an air pollution study in Fresno and an asthma diagnosis
program in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The project was prompted by a September 2000 report by the Pew
Environmental Health Commission, which found that most states fail to
track many health conditions possibly linked to environmental
pollutants even when rates of these diseases are dramatically
increasing.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California center will be one of three new
federally funded university-based centers, called Centers of
Excellence for Environmental Public Health Tracking, and the only one
on the West Coast. The other two are at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore and Tulane University in New Orleans. The CDC also funded
20 state and local health departments, including California's.</TE>
<TE>   "For us it represents an excellent opportunity to collaborate with
university researchers," said Paul English, chief of the
epidemiologic investigations unit in the California Department of
Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the center's work will be deciding which substances in the
air have the strongest links to health problems and merit the most
attention, Balmes said. These could include a class of pesticides
called organophosphates, which have been linked in some studies to
neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, he said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to growth, Californians appear somewhat mixed up.</LD>
<LD>   A new survey shows that a majority believe that their regions are
experiencing problems with traffic congestion, air pollution,
affordable housing and population growth. Yet a majority also express
satisfaction with their daily commutes to work as well as their
housing situations, and they remain largely wedded to a suburban way
of life.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, they think that growth is generally a problem, but
not in their lives. And many don't want to change their lives to
lessen growth's impacts.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't find a lot of evidence that things are at critical stage
in their personal lives," said Mark Baldassare, who directed the
survey for the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are open to the idea of alternatives but are not
willing to jump on the bandwagon of smart growth at this point,"
Baldassare said. "But they clearly recognize there are some serious
problems in the regions in which they live, particularly in the Bay
Area and Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he added, "people are really ambivalent about
making major changes in public policy or their personal lives."</TE>
<TE>   The findings, based on a statewide telephone survey of 2,010 adult
Californians conducted last month, suggest that sprawl has not yet
lost its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if they would choose to live in a low-density neighborhood
where driving is a necessity, 66% said yes. Eighty-six percent said
that ideally they would like to live in a single-family detached
home.</TE>
<TE>   They were more evenly split on two other questions. Given the
choice of living in a mixed-use neighborhood, where they could walk
to schools and stores, versus a residential-only neighborhood where
they would have to drive to services, 50% picked the residential-only
area.</TE>
<TE>   In that vein, 47% said they would choose to live in a large house
with a large yard, even if that meant a long commute. Forty-nine
percent said they would pick a small house and yard if that gave them
a short commute; 4% said they didn't know which they would pick.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, Californians don't seem to be rushing to embrace the
tenets of sprawl-busting: in-fill construction in developed areas,
higher density and public transit. "I think people are open to the
idea of alternatives but are not willing to jump on the bandwagon of
smart growth at this point," Baldassare said.</TE>
<TE>   That, he added, "means more of the same until someone comes up
with a better vision of how things could work."</TE>
<TE>   Central Valley residents showed the strongest preference for the
big-house, big-yard, long-commute option; those living in the San
Francisco Bay Area showed the least.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area residents used public transit to the greatest extent; 12%
rely on it to get to work, followed by Angelenos, at 7%. Overall,
half of those surveyed said local government should steer growth to
already developed areas, while 44% said growth should be allowed in
undeveloped areas to avoid high density and traffic congestion.</TE>
<TE>   One thing they were sure of was that they like ballot-box
planning. A hefty 77% said local voters should make local land-use
and development decisions at the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really a fundamental polar split on how people see growth
in this state," said Christopher Williamson, a senior analyst with
Solimar Research group, a land-use and growth consulting firm in
Ventura. "For over 50 years Americans and Californians have -- with
complete government and social encouragement -- bought into a
suburban lifestyle with the car and the kid and the yard. [Now] they
see the government coming along ... saying, 'We want to change the
rules and get you to buy another lifestyle.' "</TE>

<HD>Henry Howard, 70; Father of Home Satellite TV Dish</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Taylor Howard, a radio engineer who was considered the father
of the satellite television industry, died Wednesday when the plane
he was piloting crashed after takeoff from Calaveras County Airport.
He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   A former NASA scientist and Stanford University professor, Howard
created the first known home satellite television system in 1976, a
prototype that he put on display at his ranch in San Andreas, where
it has remained. He also wrote a manual to help home hobbyists build
their own systems.</LD>
<LD>   Howard's stepson, Brian Files, was also killed in the plane crash.
A third man on board, Dean Hollingsworth, is hospitalized in Modesto.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Illinois whose father was an engineer, Howard ventured
into the uncharted world of home satellite systems as a professional
scientist who maintained a full complement of electronic hobbies.</TE>
<TE>   "He applied his love of science to satellites," said Margaret
Parone, spokeswoman for the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications
Assn., a national trade organization based in Virginia that Howard
helped found. "Howard was a tinkerer and ham radio operator."</TE>
<TE>   Howard explained in a 1985 interview with Atlantic magazine how he
had made his prototype. Many of the parts cost less than $20, he
said. But for one of them, he splurged. "I used a microwave source
that I bought at a surplus store and had to order a crystal for it.
That cost 100 bucks, which was the major cost of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Four years after he built his prototype, Howard co-founded
Chaparral Communications, a manufacturing company that produces parts
for the system he continued to improve.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, about 5,000 U.S. households owned satellite
television dishes. Today there are nearly 20 million. It its first
six years, Chaparral Communications grew to a $50-million company.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Howard's career as a scientist was well advanced. After
graduating from Stanford University in 1955, he joined the faculty as
a professor of electrical engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the 1960s, he worked on a series of NASA space
projects through the university. He was the principal investigator on
several Apollo lunar flight experiments and was later a team leader
on the Mariner 10 radio science investigations of Venus and Mercury.
He helped launch radio satellites to Jupiter as part of NASA's
Galileo project. For his achievements, he was awarded a NASA medal
for exceptional scientific achievement in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard's experiments were of two kinds," said Dawn Levy, a
science writer with the Stanford University media office. "He bounced
radio signals from Earth to the moon as a way to map the planet. And
he bounced radio signals to spacecraft circling the moon as a way to
test the atmosphere around the planet."</TE>
<TE>   It was his how-to booklet, "The Howard Terminal Manual," published
in 1979, that launched the industry he helped create. With the book,
people were able to build satellite systems in their garages or home
welding shops, said Chuck Hewitt, a close friend and colleague.
Hewitt said Howard is now compared with Alexander Graham Bell, the
inventor of the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days of satellite television, Hewitt said, there were
no systems to block access to cable company programming, so Howard
could access HBO -- the only U.S. service regularly carried by
satellite -- for free.</TE>
<TE>   "He wrote to HBO and let them know," Hewitt said. "He asked what
he owed them, but he never got a reply."</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1980s, free access was one of several heated issues
surrounding the cable television industry, and Howard became a
spokesman for private satellite system owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Access to programming, fair pricing, the right to private
ownership of a satellite system, these were all issues Howard had to
deal with," said Hewitt, a Maryland lawyer and former president of
the Satellite Broadcasting and Communication Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Howard continued to work at Chaparral Communications, most
recently as director of research, until the late 1990s. He continued
to tinker in his free time. Recently, he built a turbo-powered
helicopter from a kit he bought in Italy. As another hobby, Hewitt
said, "he was bouncing signals off the moon to talk with people in
China."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor is survived by his wife, Ann, four children and a brother.</TE>

<CX>   Howard obituary -- The obituary of Henry Taylor Howard in the
California section Friday contained an inaccurate description of his
research using radio signals. Dawn Levy, a science writer with
Stanford University's media office, said the correct way to describe
his work is to say it involved bouncing radio signals from Earth to
the moon as a way to map the moon, and bouncing radio signals to
spacecraft exploring planets as a way to study planet atmospheres.</CX>

<HD>James Miller, 86; Educator, Psychiatrist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. James Grier Miller, a visionary educator and psychiatrist who
coined the term "behavioral science" and founded a field devoted to
analyzing living systems, died Nov. 7 at his La Jolla home. He was
86.</LD>
<LD>   During a wide-ranging career over six decades, Miller also headed
a university, founded a virtual university, invented an information
clearinghouse linking 500 institutions of higher education and
launched a scholarly journal, which is still in print after 46 years.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues described him as an intellectual dynamo in the worlds
of education and research.</LD>
<TE>   "He did research at the level of the cell and at the level of the
organization, at the same time. Not many people can do that," said
UCLA sociology professor Kenneth D. Bailey, who is also
president-elect of an international society devoted to the
living-systems theory Miller propounded.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pittsburgh, Miller was headed for the ministry when he
convinced his father that he was better suited for a career in
science. Miller studied briefly at Columbia Bible College in South
Carolina before switching to Harvard University, where he earned his
bachelor's, master's, doctoral and medical degrees between 1937 and
1943.</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a psychiatrist, he entered the Army Medical Corps in
1943, later transferring to a unit that conducted psychological
evaluations of candidates for agents in the Office of Strategic
Services, the precursor to the CIA. At Harvard, he was a student of
Alfred North Whitehead, the eminent philosopher. Whitehead encouraged
him to develop a theoretical framework combining the biological and
social sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Miller was teaching psychiatry at the University of
Chicago, Enrico Fermi, the physicist who had a leading role in the
creation of the atomic bomb, prodded him in the same direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Fermi was so concerned that his invention would destroy mankind
that he told Jim if the biological and social sciences do not make
advances commensurate with the natural sciences, we will destroy
ourselves as the human race," said G.A. Swanson, a professor at
Tennessee Technological University and longtime colleague and friend
of Miller's. Fermi "believed we needed general theories in the social
sciences in order get the advances necessary to avoid calamity."</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by Fermi's idea, and with his considerable support,
Miller formed a research group of senior professors -- each of whom
studied life from a different perspective -- to integrate their
disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, after years of searching for a term that would describe
the end product of their endeavor, Miller came up with "behavioral
science" -- the first use of the term in its current sense, according
to Swanson. The Ford Foundation later offered grants for studies in
behavioral science, which gave wide currency to the term.</TE>
<TE>   The behavioral science approach, Miller later said, "makes it
possible to recognize real, precise similarities between a single
person as a system, a behaving group like a jury, a large company ...
a government or even the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Miller synthesized two decades of thinking about the field in
"Living Systems," an encyclopedic volume published by McGraw-Hill in
1975, which identified the common principles linking biological and
social systems, from a single human cell to multinational
corporations and nations. Systems as different as a heart cell or a
jury, for instance, have similarities in their needs for a flow of
information or energy, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, he wrote, was to demonstrate "the elegant unity of the
world's living and nonliving systems, as well as the feasibility of a
unified science to study them."</TE>
<TE>   Miller began to formulate his thoughts on integrating the sciences
in the late 1940s and early '50s while at the University of Chicago,
where he headed the psychology department. Later, at the University
of Michigan, he was the founding director of the school's Institute
of Behavioral Science, later renamed the Mental Health Research
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   With his psychologist-wife he launched the journal Behavioral
Science in 1956 and was its editor for the next 30 years. The journal
later merged with another publication and was renamed Systems
Research and Behavioral Science. It publishes original articles on
new theories, experimental research and applications relating to all
levels of living and nonliving systems.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Miller was named president of the University of
Louisville in Kentucky and presided over its transition from a
private to a public institution.</TE>
<TE>   He also helped found the information network known as EDUCOM,
which later spawned the electronic exchange called EDUNET.</TE>
<TE>   Miller moved to California in the early 1980s, where he was
co-chairman of the Robert Maynard Hutchins Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara and held adjunct
professorships at UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara. He also taught
courses at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, he founded the University of the World, an attempt
to promote distance education internationally.</TE>
<TE>   His collaborator and wife of 64 years, the former Jessie Louise
Luthi, died earlier this year. Miller is survived by two sons, Thomas
of San Clemente and John of Indianapolis, and three grandchildren.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judy Sam Trejo, a northern Nevada Paiute who was instrumental in
preserving the tribe's native language through education,
storytelling and song, died of natural causes Nov. 9 in Reno. She was
62.</LD>
<LD>   Trejo, who was born in Alturas, Calif., was a member of the Walker
River Paiute tribe. In 1997, she recorded "Circle Songs of the Paiute
and Shoshone," a collection of circle dance, flag and pine-nut songs
that she and her daughters, Delgadina and Christina, sang in the
traditional manner, in unison, with either simple drum accompaniment
or a cappella.</LD>
<LD>   According to Whispering Wind magazine, which reviewed the
collection, Trejo's voice on the recording was "strong and powerful;
full of expression and emotion." Songs of particular interest were
tunes about the ghost dance of 1890 and a switch song, in which the
dancers switch back and forth when the tempo changes.</LD>
<TE>   Her second album, "Stick Game Songs of the Paiute," was named best
historical recording at the 2000 Native American Music Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Trejo received her bachelor's degree in elementary education and a
master's degree in counseling from the College of Idaho, which is now
Albertson College of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   She taught first- and second-graders on the Walker River
Reservation in Schurz, Nev., for more than 20 years. She also was the
author of a book on medicinal and edible plants and taught Paiute at
local colleges.</TE>

<HD>Mark Chavunduka, 37; Zimbabwe Journalist, Publisher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zimbabwean journalist and publisher Mark Chavunduka, whose arrest and
subsequent torture helped expose his government's increasing
repression of dissent, died Monday in Harare. His father, Dexter
Chavunduka, said his son, who was 37, died after being hospitalized
for chest and side pains.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of his death was believed to be unrelated to the effects
of his weeklong detention and torture in 1999, according to
Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   Chavunduka often complained to friends and colleagues of recurring
nightmares of the beatings and electric shocks he received at a
military intelligence facility outside Harare.</LD>
<TE>   Chavunduka and a colleague, Ray Choto, were detained after
reporting in the independent Zimbabwe Standard newspaper about
disaffection in the military and a possible coup plot against
President Robert Mugabe's government.</TE>
<TE>   The government denied the report and ignored court orders to
either free Chavunduka or press charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   After the men were released, authorities refused to prosecute the
torturers whom Chavunduka identified. His torture brought the world's
attention to the government's human rights violations and its efforts
to suppress criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Charges against Chavunduka and Choto for allegedly publishing a
false report liable to create alarm and despondency were later
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Chavunduka, who is survived by his wife and three children,
received several international awards for courageous reporting. In
April, he took over a controlling share in an independent magazine
publishing business.</TE>

<HD>UC May Raise Fees, Cut Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>University of California regents were warned Thursday that they must
consider unpalatable options for next year, including raising student
fees for California residents for the first time since 1994, if the
state's fiscal picture does not improve.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of a 6.5% fee increase set off debate at the
regents meeting. Stephen Klass, chairman of the UC Student Assn.,
urged the university not to "balance the budget on the backs of
students."</LD>
<LD>   The regents began preliminary discussions of the university's
2003-04 budget amid warnings from Sacramento that the state faces a
budget shortfall of more than $20 billion for the second straight
year.</LD>
<TE>   UC officials said the university and its leaders must face the
likelihood that fee increases or cuts in research, student services
or other support programs may prove necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we don't know how deep the cuts are going to be,
but I have to say it looks pretty scary," Larry Hershman, UC's vice
president for budget, told the university's governing board.</TE>
<TE>   UC President Richard C. Atkinson, who announced on Wednesday that
he will retire in October, said his last UC budget cycle would be
"very challenging."</TE>
<TE>   The regents approved what all acknowledged was a relatively rosy
preliminary budget for next year, asking for about $3.4 billion from
the state to cover its share of the university's annual funding. But
Hershman and others said the university was likely to get far less
when Gov. Gray Davis sends legislators his budget proposal in
January.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary proposal includes a request for state funding for
8,000 more students next year and a 4% average increase in faculty
and staff salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Most controversially, it also includes an option for a 6.5% fee
increase for students who are California residents, unless the state
steps in with $33 million to offset the proposed increase.</TE>
<TE>   Although fees for in-state students have been steady since 1994,
UC regents have increased fees almost every year for nonresident
students. If the fee increase is adopted, undergraduate students will
pay an average of about $225 more a year.</TE>

<HD>Courts Caught in Dilemma on Opening Police Reports</HD>
<DH>Making them public is practicing open government, but
victim and witness safety is an issue. Orange County is a stormy test
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a showdown that pits open government against privacy concerns,
courts throughout California are grappling over whether to open
police reports to the public after prosecutors file them in court.</LD>
<LD>   News outlets and open-government advocates argue that once a judge
sees a police report, the document should become public, available to
anyone.</LD>
<LD>   Police and prosecutors, wanting the reports kept under wraps, say
opening them to public view would jeopardize the safety of crime
victims and witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   The debate has occurred in courthouses from Los Angeles to Oakland
and is now the subject of a heated dispute in Orange County. In a
victory for the news media, Orange County's presiding judge,
Frederick P. Horn, ruled recently that any police report submitted to
the court will be available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas responded to the new
policy by vowing to stop filing police reports with all criminal
cases -- thereby keeping them from the public.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers in Orange County predict that the district
attorney's actions will bring plea bargains to a halt and force some
defendants to spend unwarranted time in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Until Horn's policy took effect Nov. 1, Orange County court clerks
had placed all police reports in sealed envelopes and refused to
allow the public to view them. Only judges, defense lawyers and
prosecutors were given access.</TE>
<TE>   News outlets have argued for several years that courts are
required to make police reports public once they are submitted in
court. Horn agreed to change the policy after an opinion he requested
from the state Judicial Council concluded that the reports should be
public, said Alan Slater, executive officer for the Orange County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials in Alameda County made a similar change to open up
police records after they received a similar opinion from the
Judicial Council.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions have won applause from open-government advocates,
who say case law is clear that court records are public documents.
They argue that making the reports available to all won't increase
the risks to witnesses or victims because defendants already have
access to the documents through the discovery process before trials.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you give somebody [who is] charged with a crime
information that's not being given to the public? Who is being
protected?" said Richard McKee, president of the California 1st
Amendment Coalition. "We rely on checks and balances. How can the
people make a determination that the system is operating fairly if
they have no information?"</TE>
<TE>   But law enforcement officials respond that opening up the police
files, which contain the statements and addresses of witnesses and
victims, isn't worth the risks.</TE>
<TE>   "It would create a lot of problems for a lot of innocent people,"
said Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley. "It's a delicate
balance, the right of society to know and the right of privacy. We're
struggling with that all the time."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, court officials so far have refused to make
the reports public. But officials are in the process of reconsidering
the policy and will soon be inviting comment from prosecutors and
others, said Robert A. Dukes, assistant presiding judge for Los
Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials in Alameda County make police reports public when
prosecutors file them. In San Diego County, the practice varies from
court to court. Some judges review the reports, then return them to
prosecutors, who do not make them available to the public. In other
courts, the reports are kept out of case files.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, Orange County's district attorney, said in a letter to
Judge Horn that he hopes the state Legislature will enact a law
keeping police reports private.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Rackauckas said, his prosecutors will now send
judges a recommended sentence in writing but not a police report.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' plan does not sit well with some Orange County defense
attorneys. Because defense attorneys have traditionally relied on
police reports to help determine plea offers, critics say Rackauckas'
new system will cause big delays.</TE>
<TE>   "No lawyer is going to plead a client guilty without the police
report, or rely on the recommendation of the prosecution," said
attorney John Barnett, a prominent criminal defense lawyer. "I think
it's going to be challenged, and it's going to create a huge backlog
and a mess unnecessarily, and I don't know for what good goal. The
reasoning escapes me."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials are anxiously waiting to see how things go, with
Horn's decision and Rackauckas' response.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ready to push the panic button," Slater said. "Any
change, it takes a while to get used to it. So the first few days can
be ragged."</TE>

<LD>Legislation that would pump $10 million into repairing and preserving
California's missions might provide enough cash to help complete the
restoration of the 196-year-old Great Stone Church at Mission San
Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   The historic church was all but destroyed in an 1812 earthquake.
Restoration efforts began in 1994, though funding has been a
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly half of the estimated $7 million it will take to put the
Great Stone Church back together -- a job that includes seismic
stabilization -- has been pieced together from federal and county
grants and private donations. Last year, the mission was awarded a
$487,000 state grant.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach),
would allocate money for all 21 missions, although it was unclear
Thursday how the funds would be divided.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the final push to get this done," said Sandy Wheeler,
mission spokeswoman. "It's admirable that Chris Cox is recognizing
our mission and all the others around the state. What are we going to
tell our grandkids if we can't show them what life was like in the
old days?"</TE>
<TE>   If the legislation passes, the nonprofit California Missions
Foundation, based in San Francisco, would receive the money.</TE>
<TE>   The funds are intended to cover the costs of cleaning and
repairing art and artifacts, improving pathways and preserving
historical books, manuscripts, hymnals and Bibles.</TE>
<TE>   Designed more than 200 years ago by Isidro Aguilar, the Great
Stone Church has been placed on the 2002 list of the 100 most
endangered historical sites by the World Monuments Watch program.</TE>
<TE>   The church is five stories high at the sanctuary, topped with
seven stone domes and surrounded by 50-foot walls.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctuary dome has already been seismically stabilized, the
art has been preserved, and all scaffolding in the central and east
portions of the church has been removed.</TE>
<TE>   But the vestment room and its dome need to be shored up, Wheeler
said.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH JOE NAMATH</KH>
<HD>He Is Off-Broadway but Still Outspoken</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Namath, who led the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III,
was in Los Angeles this week speaking to groups of arthritis
sufferers about his battles with the disease. He has formed Joe
Namath's Arthritis Huddle and travels around the country touting a
drug called Mobic.</LD>
<LD>   Football took its toll. He can't close his hands. Ten years ago,
he had both knees replaced. He has suffered torn ligaments in both
shoulders and a broken wrist, ankle, ribs and cheekbone. He once lost
feeling in his left foot for four years.</LD>
<LD>   His opinions are as strong as ever, though, and he shared a few:</LD>
<TE>   Question: Considering you've had arthritis since 1965, is it hard
to get out of bed in the morning?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I only have it in my hands and my neck, and I've been able
to deal with that through exercise and medication. But there were
times as an athlete I couldn't get out of bed the day after a game. I
used to say, 'Holy cow, I'm just a quarterback. What happens to the
running backs who get hit every play?' But there are folks that are
debilitated certainly, especially when it gets into the back and the
neck.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did the death of Johnny Unitas affect you?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was a shock. I had just seen Johnny a couple of months
before, and he was as mellow and happy and good looking as I've ever
seen him. He was in good shape. This was a real shocker.... It was
unexpected and we lost him. It was really scary. When someone that's
a peer and a friend leaves this earth, it's another eye-opener of how
fragile this life is.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There are so many parallels between you and Unitas. You both
grew up in Western Pennsylvania, both went to college in the South,
both had hall-of-fame careers, and both finished your careers with
West Coast teams -- you with the Rams, Unitas with the Chargers. Were
you kindred spirits?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. We both came from blue-collar families, and if it wasn't
for athletics, we'd probably both still be working in the steel
mills. But athletics was a way to get a scholarship, and our parents,
being old country people, couldn't afford to send us to school. They
helped us with athletics because it was a way out of the steel mills.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You lived in Los Angeles for a decade. Is this place lacking
without an NFL team?</TE>
<TE>   A: Absolutely. I think it's one of the most confounding things. I
just don't understand how it's not been able to be worked out. I know
money's a problem from somewhere. I think everyone in sports would
love to see Los Angeles have its own football team -- including the
people in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Vinny Testaverde is out, and Chad Pennington is in as
quarterback of the New York Jets. What do you think of Pennington?</TE>
<TE>   A: Pennington I've known since he's come to the Jets. I knew of
him certainly before that. He has continued to improve. He is
certainly the quarterback of the Jets now. And then the team just
didn't play well -- including Vinny -- in the early part of the year.
And Pennington's got a shot, and there's new enthusiasm there. He's a
real winner, and that carries a lot of weight. I like his attitude. I
really like his passing accuracy and his decision making. He's a
smart kid. He knows where to go with the ball in a fast amount of
time. I think only with more work he'll become better oiled and more
efficient. He's the quarterback of the Jets right now, and will be in
the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some people have called him the best Jet quarterback since
Namath. How can he prove he isn't a flash-in-the-pan success?</TE>
<TE>   A: He's going to need to worry about what's going to be shoulder
to shoulder with him. The quarterback's success is going to be
predicated on the success of the rest of the team. Very rarely do you
see a losing team with a quarterback that's done a great job. Without
the kind of team you'd like to have to win a championship, there's
not a quarterback that's going to reach his potential, or continue to
improve without being surrounded by a high quality of player.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is he surrounded by high-quality players?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. I was absolutely stunned a couple weeks ago when I heard
the New York Jets have the highest payroll ($87.3 million) in the
league. I said, 'How? Why? What have they done to get in that
position?' The one thing I know is that the new owner, Woody Johnson,
has gone out of his way. To pay as much money as he did for the
franchise is pretty remarkable. And then to try and keep the nucleus
of players he has there by paying them a good buck, he's really gone
out of his way to show that he wants to win. I know he wants to win.
But the players are just not playing up to the caliber of high-paid
guys. It's ridiculous. For the Jets to have the highest-paid team in
the league ... boy, those players ought to thank Mr. Johnson every
day of the week a few times.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think of the league's changing rules to enhance
scoring?</TE>
<TE>   A: I like it. As a player, up until 1977, we had rules that made
it very difficult on an offense. Can you imagine being a pass blocker
or run blocker and not being able to extend your arms? That's all you
see out there today is shoving and pushing when it comes to blocking.
The rules changes have helped football, and I've always been in favor
of that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about the crackdown on helmet-to-helmet hits?</TE>
<TE>   A: Quarterback has always been a very dangerous position, standing
there with people falling all around you and throwing you down. If
you're going to play football you're going to get hurt. But this
helmet-to-helmet stuff? We know that can cause very serious injuries.
Now the players are balking at that because they say, 'This is the
way we've been shown over the years, this is the way we play, and
we're not going to change.' Well, I've got news for you: They have to
change. If the rules change, they have to change. We're looking to
knock somebody down and out every play, but we're not looking to maim
them. We're not looking to cripple them.</TE>

<LD>ARIZONA AT PHILADELPHIA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Philadelphia by 11</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: The root of all evil.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Eagles were looking quite the juggernaut in September,
coming off 37-7 and 44-13 wins over Washington and Dallas, when owner
Jeffrey Lurie had to ruin it all and give quarterback Donovan McNabb
his 12-year, $115-million deal. Before the contract, McNabb was
completing 61.2% of his passes for 263 yards a game. Post-windfall,
McNabb's numbers are 54.6% and 207 yards a game -- and there have
been losses to Jacksonville and Indianapolis, dropping the Eagles to
1-3 against AFC South teams. Which is bad news for both the Eagles
and the Cardinals, who play in the NFC West.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The loudest Horn in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Saints have only lost two games this year, but one was
to Atlanta, 37-35, three weeks ago. Saint receiver Joe Horn wasn't
impressed then, saying the Falcons "ain't good enough to be no
rival." And he hasn't changed his mind, telling reporters this week,
"This isn't like the St. Louis Rams or anything ... Everybody on that
team and organization is riding on Michael Vick. Michael Vick can't
make them a Super Bowl contender. Maybe down the road, yeah. But not
right now." Vick and the Falcons haven't lost since Week 6. One way
or another, this will be an interesting stop along that road.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: DEE-fense! DEE ... aw, let's not kid ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The NFL's two greatest half-teams meet in Arrowhead Sunday.
It's the Buffalo Bills and Drew Bledsoe against the 32nd-ranked
defense in the league -- Kansas City's bend-and-usually-break
backpedal brigade, yielding an average of 425 yards a game. And it's
Trent Green, Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs against a
defense that has surrendered more points than any other team in the
league in 2002. Buffalo allows 29.9 points a game. Kansas City allows
28.6. This one should be fun to watch, provided you don't draw your
paycheck drawing up "defensive schemes" for the Bills and Chiefs.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York Giants by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: More postgraduate study for Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Since Jim Fassel took over his team's play-calling chores,
the Giants are actually moving the ball on the ground again, even
producing a modern-day miracle: a 30-yard touchdown run last week by
Ron Dayne. Spurrier might not have noticed, as he was busy abandoning
the ground game that produced consecutive Redskin victories and
ordering up 50 passes and 16 running plays in last Sunday's 26-7 loss
to Jacksonville. "Obviously, we passed too much," Spurrier said
afterward. What's this, a sign of personal growth by the Ball Coach?
Nah. The doctors just cleared Stephen Davis to play.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Weekend undercard for Ohio State-Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Ohio is football country. At least on Friday nights and
Saturdays. Sunday is a reminder that Ohio is known for other things,
such as exciting Columbus Blue Jacket ice hockey and the Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, at Paul Brown Stadium, the Browns try
to figure out what happened to their running game, along with their
season, and the Bengals do what they do, which is provide a bedrock
foundation to an otherwise recklessly unpredictable league. This is a
rare home sellout for the Bengals, thanks to a rush of tickets
purchased by Brown fans hopeful of witnessing a rare road victory.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: A pretty good matchup, 31 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Cowboys and the Colts once played for the NFL
championship, in early 1971, in Super Bowl V. (The preceding
announcement was sponsored by the Coalition of Dallas Cowboy Fans
Demanding Something Positive to Read in the Newspaper This Season.)
More recently, the Cowboys have lost 28 of 41 games under Coach Dave
Campo, who has noted that his next opponent is coming off a 35-13
victory in Philadelphia. Says Campo, "It's a tough business. It's a
tough business for tough people." The Cowboys have seven games left,
and already Campo has written off the season.</TE>

<TE>   PITTSBURGH AT TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: There is life after being in the tank.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Old AFC Central rivals Pittsburgh and Tennessee now hold
down first place in the new AFC North and South divisions, a
remarkable development considering where they were in early October.
The Steelers were 1-3, their only victory coming in overtime over
Cleveland, and the Titans were 1-4. Then the Steelers benched Kordell
Stewart and the Titans hit the soft part of their schedule and here
they are, Pittsburgh at 5-3-1, Tennessee at 5-4 . In his sixth start,
Tommy Maddox broke the Steeler single-game passing record with 473
yards. If he belonged to a fantasy league, Maddox says, "I would have
myself."</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 6 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Dome and dumber.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: With a victory over the Vikings and a loss by Detroit, Green
Bay can clinch the NFC North title Sunday -- 10 days before
Thanksgiving. This isn't supposed to happen in Parity Paul
Tagliabue's NFL, so the pundits are scrambling for reasons why the
Packers could lose this one. Best they can come up with: The Packers
don't much care for the Metrodome. Green Bay is 3-10 inside the dome
since 1989, including last season's 35-13 loss. Interesting. So is
this: The Vikings are 7-21 in their last 28 games and Daunte
Culpepper has more turnovers (19) than Brett Favre has touchdown
passes (17).</TE>

<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: San Francisco team ventures to SoCal again. Uh-oh.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Chargers have lost two in a row, can't hold a
fourth-quarter lead and return home, where they lost by 31 points to
the Jets two weeks ago. The 49ers have won six of their last seven,
own a three-game lead in the NFC West and ... hey, wasn't that Edison
Field we just flew over, guys? Don't look now, 49ers, but San Diego
and Orange counties share a border, and the curse of Darren Baker is
powerful. During a season in which the only halfway reliable
predictor is "Whichever team is the most desperate usually wins," the
Chargers desperately need to win this game. And the 49ers do not.</TE>

<TE>   CAROLINA AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:05 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 8 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The defenses rest on their laurels.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tampa Bay and Carolina have the top-ranked defenses in the
league, which explains the final score from their Oct. 27 meeting in
Carolina: Buccaneers 12, Panthers 9. So what happened in their last
games? Tampa Bay gave up 24 points to a demoralized Viking team and
Carolina lost to New Orleans, 34-24, after failing to stop a late
95-yard scoring drive. To put it another way, six quarterbacks passed
for more than 300 yards last Sunday -- and the only one who lost was
Carolina's Rodney Peete. One difference: Tampa Bay had a bye week to
sort things out. Carolina still doesn't know what hit it.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Ray Lucas, meet Ray Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: On the injured-keys-to-the-season front, the Ravens received
better news than the Dolphins this week. Baltimore all-pro linebacker
Ray Lewis practiced Wednesday and is hopeful of returning to the
lineup Sunday. Miami quarterback Jay Fiedler, looking better and
better with every snap Ray Lucas takes, had the cast removed from his
broken thumb Tuesday, but the Dolphins don't expect him back before
Dec. 9. By then, the Dolphins, 0-3 and averaging 10 points a game
without Fiedler, could be out of the playoff race. In a wild-card
game last season, Miami lost to Baltimore, 20-3 ... with Fiedler.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Denver by 5</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Broncos, Seahawks try to figure out what just
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It's not every week the Broncos lose at home to Oakland by
24 points a day after Matt Hasselbeck passes for 260 yards in a 27-6
Seahawk victory. But that's the way this season has been going.
Researchers have unearthed some startling facts: Since replacing
Trent Dilfer midway through the Dallas game in Week 8, Hasselbeck has
completed 67% of his passes for 655 yards. Almost as strange, the
Broncos are 6-0 in day games and 0-3 at night. It would be nice to
report that Hasselbeck finally has turned the corner, but please note
the kickoff time for this one. Sorry about that, Seahawks.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jets by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Pennington vs. Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Evidently, it doesn't take much to make Sports Illustrated's
cover anymore. Joey Harrington was there last week after, what,
winning three games in his NFL career? After throwing for six
touchdowns? The jinx is still as healthy as ever -- Harrington was 20
for 44 with two interceptions in a 40-14 loss to Green Bay, dropping
his quarterback rating to a league-low 59.7. His young gun/debate
club counterpart, Chad Pennington, has a rating of 94.3, has thrown
82 consecutive passes without an interception and won last week,
13-10, over Miami. But then, Pennington masterfully avoided the
cover.</TE>

<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: A silver lining at the bottom of the pile.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Despite a 38-3 loss to 1-8 Cincinnati and a 17-10 setback at
Tennessee in recent weeks, things are starting to look up for
Houston's rookie quarterback, David Carr. On the downside: Carr has
been sacked 49 times this season, on pace for 87. On the upside: The
nosebleeds have been dwindling, somewhat; in the last three weeks,
Carr has been sacked 10 times. In a 2-7 expansion season, you take
good news wherever you find it, because the next crushing defeat is
always a few hours away. Especially with Jacksonville still in the
running in the everyone-but-Houston AFC South.</TE>

<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Tuck this.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Although Oakland Coach Bill Callahan has ordered his team
not to talk about it -- a Raider media blackout, imagine that -- his
players have been waiting for this game for 10 months. The Raiders
believe they had a playoff victory stolen from them in snowy New
England when referee Walt Coleman nullified an apparent Raider
recovery of a Tom Brady fumble by citing the obscure, and now
infamous, "tuck rule." Hoping for the best, Patriot Coach Bill
Belichick is now grasping for straws: "I don't think there will be
much carryover from that game. I don't think snow's going to be a
factor this time."</TE>

<TE>   The line: Off the board.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: And you think you have problems?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Some problems are more problematic than others. Consider the
Rams, who have a burgeoning quarterback controversy on their hands,
with Coach Mike Martz delaying the return of two-time MVP Kurt Warner
to the lineup because his understudy, Marc Bulger, is 4-0 and coming
off a 453-yard performance last Sunday. Then consider the Bears, who
have lost seven games in a row and are down to this choice at
quarterback: Jim Miller's shoulder-and-arm tendinitis or Chris
Chandler's sprained neck? Then consider ABC, which thought this would
be an interesting matchup in July.</TE>

<HD>Angels Make Argument for Selig's Perfect Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>As they continued to sort out the new, more restrictive bargaining
agreement, and cautiously continued to feel out trade and free-agent
possibilities, major league general managers ended their annual
meeting Thursday by listening to a state-of-the-game talk by
Commissioner Bud Selig, who later said he considered the Angels to be
the first, true manifestation of the revenue-sharing plan that began
six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Selig also said he expected ownership approval soon -- possibly
even at an owners' meeting Wednesday in Dallas -- of a plan that
would permit the Montreal Expos to play 20 games in Puerto Rico in
2003, and that he was satisfied with baseball's minority hiring
progress.</LD>
<LD>   With the appointment of Felipe Alou to manage the San Francisco
Giants and the expected hiring of Dusty Baker to manage the Chicago
Cubs, there will be seven minority managers, the same number as at
the start of last season, although at one point during the year that
number went up to nine.</LD>
<TE>   There are only two minority general managers -- Kenny Williams
with the Chicago White Sox and Omar Minaya with the Expos -- but
Selig said, "I'm proud of what we've done and comfortable where we
are with minority hiring at all levels. We've matured to a point with
minority hiring that we don't have to talk about it all the time. The
clubs have followed the [interviewing] memorandum to a T. I have no
complaints."</TE>
<TE>   In reflecting on postseason play -- the Angels beat the Giants in
the World Series in a battle of mid-level payrolls, and the
small-market Oakland A's and Minnesota Twins gave additional
representation to what Selig has called aberrations in a playoff
pattern dominated by high-payroll teams -- he said that he "liked to
think the Angels are the first manifestation" of the revenue-sharing
plan initiated to assist the smaller-revenue teams in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I think revenue sharing at least helped [the Angels] develop
players and keep players," Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   While claiming losses of $10-$20 million a year, the Angels,
according to baseball's labor relations department, have received
about $40 million in revenue sharing over the last six years and
could be getting another $10 million or more in the first year of the
new agreement. Increased attendance and improved media and
merchandising contracts should enhance their revenue position,
however, reducing the amount they receive from other clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it wasn't an incongruity for a team that plays in a
booming population market with a healthy economic base to have been a
recipient club for so many years, Selig said:</TE>
<TE>   "That's a whole other issue. Given their revenues over the last 41
years, and given where they have been in [baseball's] economic order
of producing and receiving revenue, I do believe that the one thing
that has sort of gone unnoticed about [their World Series victory] is
that without revenue sharing, I doubt they'd have been in the
[championship] position they are.</TE>
<TE>   "The debate over whether they should be [only a mid-revenue club,
given their market location] is a whole other issue that I don't want
to discuss right now."</TE>
<TE>   Selig probably didn't care to discuss it because it would have
meant criticizing the ownership approach of Gene and Jackie Autry, as
well as the Walt Disney Co. -- the failure to market and take
advantage of the population base until the Angels caught fire on the
field this year.</TE>
<TE>   He did say he was hopeful that the postseason emergence of the
Angels, A's and Twins, in particular, represented a change in the
landscape and that he considered it "a good thing" that would become
representative of improved balance and parity under the new
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the objective," he said. "Let management take over. Let
the skill of the front office take over, as opposed to just money."</TE>
<TE>   An overall belt tightening and the reluctance of clubs to surpass
the $117-million tax threshold in the new agreement -- even the New
York Yankees are cutting payroll -- were expected to produce a
difficult winter for free agents while compounding trade
complexities. Those expectations began to surface at the general
managers' meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Towers of the San Diego Padres called it "the slowest
meeting" of the eight he has attended, and Dodger General Manager Dan
Evans agreed, saying, "It looks like it's going to take clubs even
longer to sort out where they are and what they can do financially
than we thought it would."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were $3 million over the new tax threshold in 2002 and
are determined not to exceed it when implemented in 2003. Evans, who
would like to make an early and aggressive stab at free-agent
left-hander Mike Remlinger, reiterated he can do nothing until he
determines whether he can create some flexibility by moving the
seemingly immovable Eric Karros and/or Mark Grudzielanek.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Phillies, borrowing against improved revenue when
they move into a new ballpark in 2004, are the only team to have
attacked the free-agent market aggressively, having made almost $115
million in offers to Jim Thome, Tom Glavine and David Bell, with
General Manager Ed Wade on his way from Tucson to Seattle today to
meet with free-agent pitcher Jamie Moyer.</TE>
<TE>   There was only one official trade at the meeting. The Arizona
Diamondbacks sent catcher Damian Miller to the Cubs for two
prospects, freeing up dollars for the possible acquisition of Larry
Walker in a deal that would send Matt Williams to the Colorado
Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies and Florida Marlins, however, did reach an agreement
in principle on a six-player trade that hinges on the waiving of
no-trade clauses by Colorado pitcher Mike Hampton and Florida catcher
Charles Johnson. The trade would send the over-salaried and
underachieving Hampton, along with center fielder Juan Pierre, to the
Marlins for Johnson, center fielder Preston Wilson, left-handed
reliever Vic Darensbourg and second base prospect Pablo Osuna.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton and Johnson have until 2 p.m. EST Saturday to decide.</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman did little more at the meeting
than accept congratulations on his World Series triumph. A
$77.1-million payroll -- based on the tax formula -- will take a
major hit because of the successful season, but the Angels' only
needs are outfield depth if free agents Alex Ochoa and Orlando

<HD>De La Hoya Wants to Organize a Tournament</HD>
<DH>Boxer's promotional company would be involved with Arum in
four-person event for junior-middleweights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to build up the credentials of upcoming opponents and eager to
build up his own promotional company, Oscar De La Hoya is forming a
junior-middleweight tournament, which would consist of himself and
three other fighters.</LD>
<LD>   De La Hoya will select the participants from a group that includes
Shane Mosley, Fernando Vargas, Vernon Forrest, Winky Wright, Javier
Castillejo and Daniel Santos.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament, which could stretch over the next year, would
consist of three fights, two semifinals and the championship. The
fights would be shown on HBO and staged in either Las Vegas or at
Staples Center, the selection to be based on highest site fee.</LD>
<TE>   "They are all invited," De La Hoya said. "We are not excluding
anybody. Before we decide who is in, we have to see who wants to be
in. In a couple of weeks, we should have all the details. It's
exciting. Things are happening.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the defining moments of my career. There is all this
talk about who I should fight. Let's give these guys credibility and
name recognition. This tournament is the way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, of course, already has the name recognition. He also has a
problem that could keep him out of the tournament. After losing to De
La Hoya in September, Vargas tested positive for steroids. He will
have a hearing Wednesday in front of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission. The commissioners are expected to suspend Vargas for six
months to a year.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' relationship with De La Hoya is no longer a problem.
Although Vargas has been badmouthing De La Hoya for years, part of
his campaign to land a fight with the biggest moneymaker outside the
heavyweight division, the two met earlier this week at a Pasadena
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Who paid for dinner?</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even eat," De La Hoya said. "We just hung out and tried
to patch things up. We are cool with each other now."</TE>
<TE>   The fights involving De La Hoya would be a co-promotion between De
La Hoya's growing company, Golden Boy Promotions, and promoter Bob
Arum. The semifinal fight not involving De La Hoya would be promoted
solely by Golden Boy, which already has plans to promote about 50
shows next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to see Golden Boy become among the best of the promotional
organizations," De La Hoya said.</TE>
<TE>   So will this tournament become a reality? Not if a certain retired
fighter in Puerto Rico decides to make a comeback. Felix Trinidad
remains De La Hoya's first choice as an opponent. Trinidad has name
recognition and credibility and he doesn't need a tournament to prove
it. In the unlikely event he signs with De La Hoya, the tournament
will be history before a punch is thrown.</TE>

<LD>Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, on the competition
for the Heisman Trophy: "If nothing else, the college football season
has proven this: No one deserves this year's Heisman.</LD>
<LD>   "No one. There is no best college football player in the country.
There is only a 500-way tie for second."</LD>
<LD>   We wonder if Shelton is aware of the impressive statistics
compiled by USC quarterback Carson Palmer. It's a school on the West
Coast, Gary.</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for consecutive games
scoring touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stop him if you can: Utah Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan commenting on
productive 40-year-old veteran guard John Stockton to Jay Greenberg
of the New York Post: "He doesn't play off the floor. He's not flying
through the air. He does not dunk the ball. I've always felt he's
been underrated because people look at him as a guy who isn't
supposed to do what he does."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEC is clean, of course: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel:
"Did you see where the Michigan basketball program has announced it
would forfeit more than 100 victories and take down championship
banners because of illicit money funneled from boosters to players?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing SEC football programs haven't taken the same
approach or Vanderbilt would be retroactively awarded about 10
conference titles."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Glenn Dobbs, the All-American tailback from Tulsa, who died
Tuesday at 82, was also a tailback for the Los Angeles Dons of the
All-America Football Conference (1946-49).</TE>
<TE>   The Dons shared the Coliseum with the Rams. Three original AAFC
teams, the Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Colts and San Francisco 49ers,
joined the NFL when the AAFC folded.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bragging: Retired wrestling great Dan Gable of Iowa, when asked on

<TE>   Casual cook: John Mobley, Denver Bronco linebacker, on how much
time Raider quarterback Rich Gannon had to throw on Monday night: "He
was sitting back there roasting weenies."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1952, an NBA-record 13 players, five
Baltimore Bullets and eight Syracuse Nationals, fouled out in an
overtime game won by the Bullets, 97-91. So many Syracuse players
fouled out that the officials let some of the players back into the
game so the Nationals could keep five men on the court.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lenny Moore of the Baltimore Colts, 18, 1963-65.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "Judging by the
infantile behavior after Tuesday night's 36-34 loss to Marshall --
one assistant coach suspended for allegedly hitting a fan, another

another reason to call itself the 'Cradle of Coaches.' "</TE>

<HD>McGrady Tires Out Clippers</HD>
<DH>Orlando star has 35 points and leads a big third-quarter
surge in Magic's 101-80 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too many tired legs?</LD>
<LD>   Too many weary eyes?</LD>
<LD>   Definitely too much Tracy McGrady.</LD>
<TE>   Flying cross-country after playing the Miami Heat on Tuesday night
at the end of a four-game trip and arriving around 4 in the morning,
the Clippers dragged their bodies into Staples Center on Thursday
night to find the Orlando Magic ready, willing and eager to avenge
Sunday's loss to the Clippers in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   And avenge it the Magic did, with a 101-80 victory in front of a
crowd of 17,654.</TE>
<TE>   Although the subject of travel is no defense for a loss, because
every team does it, the Clippers' biggest problem was finding a
defense for McGrady.</TE>
<TE>   They tried a zone on McGrady. They tried Corey Maggette. They
tried Keyon Dooling. But nothing stopped the 6-8 guard with the soft
hands, the quick moves and the high-flying legs. McGrady scored 35
points, making 14 of 26 from the field, including three of six from
the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   And when it wasn't McGrady, it was Grant Hill (17 points) driving
for layups or Pat Garrity (14) bombing away from the outside, where
he made four of eight from beyond the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   Dooling has been watching McGrady since the two played AAU ball
together. He has seen it all, but McGrady still leaves Dooling
shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I admit I am biased," Dooling said. "But in my opinion, Tracy
McGrady is the second-best player in the league behind Shaq [O'Neal].
He's just amazing. The game is effortless for him. Effortless."</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite all of McGrady's heroics, the Magic (6-3) and
Clippers (3-5) were locked in a reasonably close game at the half,
49-43.</TE>
<TE>   Then the two teams came out for the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least the Magic came out.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers seemed to leave their game in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi's free throw brought the Clippers to within
three at 50-47. And then, like Magic, it was 69-49, Orlando going on
a 19-2 run led by Garrity's three three-pointers and McGrady's eight
points.</TE>
<TE>   Included in those eight points was a spectacular McGrady dunk over
both Olowokandi and Andre Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that we didn't defend him," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry
said of McGrady. "It wasn't that we didn't have a hand in his face.
But there is a reason that he makes $12 million a year and it's not
just because he is a great guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers shot only 39.7% and turned the ball over 19 times
leading to 26 Magic points. The Magic also dominated on the
backboards, 52-33, and particularly on the offensive boards, where
the difference was 16-5.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were trying," Gentry said. "We missed some easy shots
and that takes a little away from you. I thought our effort was fine.
We were just not very productive."</TE>
<TE>   Maggette and Olowokandi shared the Clipper team high in scoring
with 16 points apiece. Elton Brand had the usual double-double with a
game-high 12 rebounds and 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't get any easier for the Clippers, who were back in the
air Thursday night headed for Portland and their third game in four
nights tonight.</TE>
<TE>   But Gentry wasn't about to fall back on the schedule as an excuse
for Thursday night. After all, The Magic also had to fly
cross-country, coming from Orlando after a home game Tuesday night.
But they at least had been home for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team does that [rough travel] at some stage," he said.
"Teams have to do that. It doesn't matter what the environment or the
atmosphere is. We just have to fight through the travel part. It's
tough to regroup, but I will not use that as an excuse. They [the
Magic] played some very good basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Especially in that third-quarter run when the Clippers suddenly
looked like those Clippers, the one who have been laughingstocks of
the league for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   But there were no boos from the crowd as was usually the case in
the old, dismal days, no mass exit in the fourth quarter. This
Clipper team has amassed talent and shown enough heart to have an off
night without causing panic that the bad old days have returned.</TE>

<LD>It's no secret. Whatever success the Clippers have had this season, a
large share of the credit has to go to their zone defense.</LD>
<LD>   It's also no secret that Coach Alvin Gentry is no fan of the zone.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm old school," he said. "I like man-to-man. But I'm not dumb
enough to not use it."</LD>
<TE>   When it came to man-to-man defense, one of its master
practitioners was Dennis Johnson, who regularly stymied, stifled and
sometimes completely stopped the offensive stars of his day while
playing for the Phoenix Suns, Seattle SuperSonics and Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   So does Johnson, now a Clipper assistant coaching the zone, wish
he could have used it?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I would have liked it," he said. "I liked to play a
guy straight up. If he beat me, he beat me. But he would have had a
hell of a time trying to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Would the Celtics of the '80s, his era, have had the same success
if they had been allowed to use a zone?</TE>
<TE>   "We were too slow to use it," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck in convincing any of the Celtics' opponents of the '80s
of that opinion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Clipper owner Donald Sterling should look into playing
Sunday doubleheaders. Having won both of their Sunday games this
season, the Clippers are 10-1 on Sundays over the last two seasons.</TE>

<TE>   at Portland, 7</TE>
<TE>   Site -- The Rose Garden</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150)</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Clippers have spent many horrible nights on the road
in their many seasons of ineptness. They have to look long and far to
find cities that offer pleasant memories. They need not spend much
time looking in Portland. The Clippers have won only 12 of 81 games
in that city. They have lost six in a row there, their last victory
in Portland coming in 1999. And they once lost a game in Portland by
48 points, a 121-73 defeat in 1994.</TE>

<HD>Karros Comes to Bat With Adjusted Deal</HD>
<DH>Plate appearances no longer figure into whether Dodgers
pick up his $9-million option for 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers moved Thursday to create payroll flexibility and avert a
potential showdown with longtime first baseman Eric Karros, altering
a contract clause that could have affected his role in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Bob Daly, at the request of agent Jeff Moorad, modified a
clause that would have guaranteed Karros $9 million in 2004 if he had
at least 500 plate appearances next season, enabling the Dodgers to
decline the option, for a $1-million buyout, regardless of Karros'
time in the lineup. The clause would be reinserted if Karros is
traded during the season, and he could decline the option if it
vested or was exercised by another club, becoming a free agent. The
commissioner's office is expected to approve the changes within the
next few days, baseball sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers eagerly accepted Moorad's proposal because Karros,
rehabilitating from arthroscopic shoulder surgery, is coming off
consecutive poor seasons and they did not want the option to vest,
sources said, considering their high payroll. In 573 plate
appearances, the right-handed batter hit .271 with a career-low 13
home runs and 73 runs batted in last season. In 2001, he had a
career-worst .235 batting average in 487 plate appearances while
playing with a torn lower-back muscle.</LD>
<TE>   "It gives him more flexibility after the 2003 season," General
Manager Dan Evans said. "We felt it gave us some added flexibility,
so we agreed."</TE>
<TE>   Moorad said the move "removes any pressure from the issue of
Eric's playing time."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, still a commanding presence in the clubhouse, probably
would not have gone quietly had he believed the clause was affecting
his playing time. And despite their concerns about Karros, the
Dodgers would rather avoid a public feud with the all-time L.A.
franchise leader in home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, 35, has a salary of $8 million in 2003, the final
guaranteed year of a four-year, $29-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt this was in Eric's best interests and the best interests
of the team," Moorad said.</TE>
<TE>   Moorad declined comment on how the sides would have handled
Karros' situation had the clause remained in effect, but Evans
intimated in October that Karros' 11-year run as the everyday first
baseman had ended, saying the Dodgers are considering acquiring
"someone to share time with" Karros. The Dodgers are still seeking a
left-handed batter to provide depth and possibly platoon at first
base, sources said, but Moorad believes Karros' working environment
improved with Thursday's move.</TE>
<TE>   "By taking away the trigger mechanism ... it makes it easier for
everyone to move forward on the coming season," said Moorad, who
received the approval of the Major League Baseball Players Assn.
before approaching Daly.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric and I have always had a good relationship with the Dodgers,
and in the spirit of that relationship I went to Bob Daly. Now, Eric
can just focus on rehabilitating and getting ready for the season."</TE>

<HD>Victory Is Latest Graze for Ducks</HD>
<DH>Kariya gets just enough of puck to set up Rucchin's
decisive goal and Anaheim finally wins at Columbus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks outshot, out-battled and outplayed the Columbus Blue
Jackets Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Kariya had a goal and an assist. Steve Rucchin did the same.
Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 26 of 28 shots. All the
ingredients for a game worth framing.</LD>
<LD>   And then the Ducks talked about luck after their 3-2 victory in
front of 17,398. That's how tough playing at Nationwide Arena has
been for the Ducks since the Blue Jackets came into the league two
seasons ago.</LD>
<TE>   That frustration came to an end when Mike Leclerc forced a
turnover behind the Blue Jacket net and centered a pass in front.
Kariya waved at the puck with his stick and managed to graze it. That
was enough, as it rolled over to Rucchin, who chipped the puck into
an open net with 32 seconds left to give the Ducks a hard-earned two
points.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of took a half shot and it went right to Rooch," Kariya
said. "Lucky play on my part."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rucchin: "I wasn't quite sure it was going in when it went
off my stick, but it got up just enough. I'll take a few of those."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks needed two goals in the final two minutes to get their
first victory in Columbus after four losses. Jason Krog put a rebound
shot past goalie Marc Denis. Then Rucchin found a puck at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   So call it luck.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Ducks also dominated the game from the second period on.</TE>
<TE>   So call it justice.</TE>
<TE>   "Hockey is a pretty fair game," Coach Mike Babcock said. "The ice
usually tilts to the team who plays better. This was a character win
for us."</TE>
<TE>   More so since it followed a difficult overtime loss at New Jersey,
where the Ducks let a two-goal lead slip away in the third period. It
wasn't the first time this season the Ducks had squandered a late
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be on the receiving end of one of those," Rucchin
said. "We got fortunate. Look at my goal. It was just a lucky break
there. A lot of times that's what it takes."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have had nothing but hard luck in Columbus. Another in a
serious of Ohio misadventures seemed to be unfolding.</TE>
<TE>   Denis, who faced 51 shots Tuesday in a 5-4 loss to Colorado, saw
44 more Thursday. Yet, the Ducks were baffled by Denis much of the
game, even when they beat him. Leclerc and Stanislav Chistov had a
two-on-none breakaway in the first period. Chistov hit the post.</TE>
<TE>   Only one puck got past Denis in 58 minutes and that was on a power
play. Rucchin fired a shot that Kariya managed to redirect into the
net to tie the score, 1-1, 19:14 into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we dominated tonight, we deserved the win," Giguere
said. "But sometimes a goalie will steal you a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   That seemed to be the case when Tyler Wright scored midway though
the third period for a 2-1 Blue Jacket lead, and later when Denis
stopped Rucchin's point-blank try with a little more than two minutes
left.</TE>
<TE>   But moments later Matt Cullen flipped a shot that bounced off
Denis and right to Krog, who scored his first NHL goal since Feb. 17,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You just got to give yourself a chance, keep working hard,"
defenseman Ruslan Salei said. "Sometimes you're not going to win
those games. At least you can walk out of the arena saying you gave
yourself a chance to win. Of course, it's always better to walk out
with two points."</TE>

<LD>Center Adam Oates' broken left hand was examined Thursday and deemed
to be healing on schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Oates will rejoin the Mighty Ducks on their trip and begin
practicing with the team.</LD>
<LD>   Oates was injured Oct. 24 against Vancouver and had surgery to
place screws in his hand. He said last week that once cleared by
doctors to practice he would return as soon as the pain allowed him
to play.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Pavel Trnka was activated from injured reserve and
played his first game of the season Thursday in a 3-2 victory over
Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Trnka, who took Fredrik Olausson's place in the lineup, had been
sidelined because of a strained groin. He assisted on Jason Krog's
third-period goal Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock said that the plan was to rest Olausson, 37, on
Thursday when the Ducks played the second game of the five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus' Geoff Sanderson scored off an Andrew Cassels pass in the
first period. It was Sanderson's sixth goal in the last five games,
tying the team record for goals in consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   It also gave Cassels a seven-game point streak, tying a team
record. He has four goals and 12 points in the seven games.</TE>

<HD>Big Sky Confronts Slippery Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Players from Sacramento State greased their jerseys with nonstick
cooking spray on the sidelines during their loss at top-ranked
Montana last weekend, the Big Sky Conference said Thursday at Helena,
Mont.</LD>
<LD>   The league and Sacramento State are trying to figure out how many
players applied PAM -- a cooking spray -- to their uniforms and if
the coaches knew about it.</LD>
<LD>   "We've confirmed that an incident occurred that involved putting a
foreign substance on the uniform," Big Sky Commissioner Doug
Fullerton said. "The athletic director at Sacramento State [Terry
Wanless] confirmed that it occurred."</LD>
<TE>   Wanless said he was still investigating, but believed three
players were involved. He said he had not decided yet what punishment
the players might face. The school also could face punishment from
the conference if it's determined that coaches knew what was going
on.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll decide the penalty, depending upon who we find at the
bottom of the pile," Fullerton said. "I think it's a serious ethical
breach."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton said applying cooking spray to a football jersey could
make it more difficult for opposing linemen to block and tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "It actually does work, to a certain extent," he said. "That's why
there's rules against it."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento State's Coach John Volek said, "I have no knowledge of
Sacramento State players using PAM."</TE>
<TE>   However, Volek was not on the sideline during the game. He was
serving a one-game suspension after having complained about the
officiating in his team's 31-30 loss to Montana State a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Defending national champion Montana rallied from a 21-14 deficit
to beat Sacramento State, 31-24, and tie an NCAA Division I-AA record
with a 24-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Goodrich, a University of Montana photographer, said he
noticed two players spraying each other near the end of the first
half. During the second half, Goodrich said, he saw two more players
spraying each other with a can of PAM and snapped several photos.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pretty blatant about it," Goodrich said. "Right there
on the sidelines." The photos were being turned over to the league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Louisville's Nate Smith kicked a 27-yard field goal in the second
overtime and Southern Mississippi's Kurt Jones missed his fourth kick
of the night, this one from 32 yards, as Louisville defeated Southern
Mississippi, 20-17, in a Conference USA game at Hattiesburg, Miss.
Southern Mississippi had a chance to take the lead with 2:02 left in
regulation, but Kerry Rhodes leaped high to block a 37-yard attempt
by Jones.... Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker apologized for
the substance abuse problems that led to his suspension and he
shouldered some of the blame for the firing of Coach Bobby
Williams.... Virginia defensive coordinator Al Golden violated an
NCAA rule when he attended the Penn State-Nebraska game in September,
but the NCAA won't punish the Cavaliers because it was a secondary
violation.... Former Ohio State linebacker Marco Cooper was sentenced
to five years' probation on drug and weapons charges.... Antonio
Wilkerson, a wide receiver at Methodist (N.C) College, has been
charged with sodomizing a teammate with a pen, and six other players
were charged with misdemeanor hazing.</TE>

<LD>Nick Davila controlled the first half and La Verne Damien's defense
took care of the second, as the Spartans easily defeated host Chino
Hills Ayala, 28-12, Thursday night, forcing a three-way tie for the
championship in the Sierra League.</LD>
<LD>   Damien (8-2, 3-1), Ayala and Chino each finished league play with
one loss -- to each other. A three-way coin flip this morning will
determine the top-seeded team for the Southern Section Division II
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Davila, a senior, completed 10 of 13 passes for 192 yards and one
touchdown in the first half, taking The Times' No. 22-ranked team 80
yards in six plays on its first possession for a 6-0 lead it would
never relinquish.</LD>
<TE>   Ayala, ranked No. 10 by The Times and No. 3 in the Southern
Section Division II poll, was looking to win its second consecutive
league title. But the Bulldogs were unable to get anything going on
offense, despite 109 yards passing by Colin McNeil in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Damien, No. 4 in Division II, held Ayala to only 26 yards for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   -- Melanie Neff</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure 28, Ventura Buena 6 -- Whitney Lewis
scored three touchdowns and Brian Stevens completed 24 of 41 passes
for 243 yards to help the No. 12 Seraphs win the Channel League title
in their first season of Division IV competition.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure (9-1, 5-0) dominated defensively, keeping Buena
(8-2, 4-1) from establishing a consistent running game. Buena running
back Alex Garfio, who entered the game with 1,772 yards rushing,
finished with 62 yards in 22 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis scored two touchdowns in the second half. He had a 35-yard
touchdown reception from Stevens and also had a nine-yard run. Lewis
had six receptions for 96 yards.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   La Habra 35, Fullerton Troy 6 --  The Highlanders (9-1, 5-0)
followed the lead of quarterback Daniel Morales, who passed for 313
yards and touchdowns of nine and 13 yards, to win the Freeway League
title showdown at Fullerton High.</TE>
<TE>   Troy (6-4, 3-2) got a 21-yard touchdown pass from Jonathan Salazar
to Matt Resquer late in the third quarter to avoid the shutout.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill 45, Newport Harbor 21 -- Senior running back
Mike Liti rushed for 260 yards and two touchdowns and caught two
passes for 91 yards and two more touchdowns for the Knights (8-2,
4-1), who clinched the Sea View League title at Tustin High.</TE>
<TE>   Liti scored on runs of 77 and four yards and on pass plays of 78
and 13 yards from quarterback Dan Poole, who completed 12 of 16
passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Kresal</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills 33, Irvine 6 --  Dane Endly caught three passes --
for touchdowns of 15, 88 and 59 yards -- to lead the Hawks past the
host Vaqueros and into a second-place tie in the Sea View League.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills (6-4, 3-2) finished tied with Irvine (6-4, 3-2) and
Newport Harbor (7-3, 3-2) behind Foothill.</TE>

<HD>St. John Bosco Wins Title</HD>

<LD>One miscue will remain embedded in the minds of the Bellflower St.
John Bosco High Braves long after highlights accompanying their
historic Serra League game Thursday are forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately for the Braves, the blunder was committed by Santa Ana
Mater Dei.</LD>
<LD>   Monarch kicker Jerry Corona pulled an extra-point attempt wide
left in overtime, giving the Braves a 28-27 triumph over the Monarchs
before about 6,000 at Santa Ana Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   While Corona stood in disbelief, St. John Bosco players stormed
the field to celebrate their first Serra League title and first
victory over Mater Dei since the league was formed in 1999. The
Braves (8-2, 5-0), No. 8 in The Times' rankings, will be the top
entrant from the Serra League and will likely be seeded third in the
Southern Section Division I playoffs next week.</TE>
<TE>   "No one gave St. John Bosco a chance," Brave Coach Kiki Mendoza
said defiantly. "We're a three or a four seed, worst-case scenario."</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Mater Dei (7-3, 3-2) will be the No. 2 entrant from the
Serra League.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs looked as though they were going to send the game
into a second overtime when Rafael Rice scored his fourth touchdown
of the game on a three-yard run to pull them within a point.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco scored first in overtime when Albert Butler cut
right around the end of the line from five yards and tumbled into the
end zone. Brian Sabian kicked what turned out to be the winning extra
point. Butler and Terrance King took over the rushing load for
starter Derrick Williams, who left the game with 8 minutes 47 seconds
left in the third quarter because of a bruised abdomen. Butler
injured his knee on the touchdown and was carried off the field by
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Brave receiver Joe Cowan had three touchdown catches, the last on
a 43-yard play down the sideline midway through the fourth quarter
that put St. John Bosco ahead, 21-14. Cowan finished with five
catches for 99 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei tied the score with 2:24 left when Rice spun into the
end zone from one yard. Rice gained 90 of his 132 yards in the second
half and overtime.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco drove to the Monarch 33-yard line with two seconds
left, butJose Guzman's 50-yard field-goal attempt was short and to
the left.</TE>

<LD>One way to ease suspicions among rival coaches about sinister motives
is to put them together in a room and let them talk. Inevitably,
they'll become friends instead of enemies, supporters instead of
adversaries.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy is working for a group of high school football
coaches from Ventura County. For the second consecutive year, Mike
Sanders of Thousand Oaks, Bill Redell of Westlake Village Oaks
Christian, Jim Benkert of Westlake Village Westlake and George Hurley
of Newbury Park meet each Friday for breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   While sipping coffee and between bites of scrambled eggs, they
calmly discuss the latest transfer rumors, review controversial
official calls, exchange stories of coaching problems and crack jokes
that even Jay Leno could use.</LD>
<TE>   "What's the best kid you've ever coached?" Benkert said. "It's the
one who came from an orphanage."</TE>
<TE>   See, football coaches do have something in common: They all have
to deal with crazy parents.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings have been successful in reviving the relationship
between Redell and Benkert, who coached together at Encino Crespi in
the 1980s. When Redell was selected coach at Oaks Christian, only a
few blocks from Westlake, their relationship deteriorated over
concerns of player movement.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the meetings, their lines of communication are open and
misunderstandings are quickly resolved. But their competition for the
best players in Westlake Village remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to play?" Redell keeps asking Benkert.</TE>
<TE>   "They're never going to play," Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches have learned to like each other and appreciate the
challenges each faces.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have the same headaches and commiserate," Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   "Or we find out their problems are worse," Benkert said.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the coaches gang up on Redell, the senior citizen of the
group.</TE>
<TE>   "I went deaf in one ear and they're picking on a guy with a
disability," Redell said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, who was an assistant to Redell at La Canada St. Francis,
believes similar gatherings would be helpful elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to sit with guys that deal with the same things," he
said. "The challenges are numerous, like being in an emergency room
on your lunch hour. I think everybody looks forward to this. If there
is a misunderstanding that arises, it gets squashed. You just realize
sometimes things happen. It's not intentional. Ninety percent of
human conflict is misunderstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Added Benkert: "All of us realize winning football games is not
above this camaraderie."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, humor is frequently used to strengthen friendships, and
these coaches know how to tease each other.</TE>
<TE>   Redell has been on the receiving end of stories about how much
money he's getting paid to coach at Oaks Christian. The rumor has
been as high as $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the guys who started that rumor is at this table," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Each coach takes a turn picking up the restaurant check. It was
Redell's turn this particular morning, but he got the last laugh.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have to pay. The sportswriter picked up the check. The
other coaches suddenly realized the reason Redell invited the guest
to breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Sinister motives die hard.</TE>

<LD>Unchain The Stars will try to break her maiden for a second time when
she takes on eight other fillies and mares in tonight's final race at
Hollywood Park, a six-furlong dash for $25,000 claimers.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old daughter of Fastness, Unchain The Stars crossed the
wire first on Aug. 11 at Del Mar, but the win was taken away due to a
technicality -- the gray filly wasn't bumped up enough in price after
being claimed for $25,000 three weeks earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Dorothy Boone and trained by Rafael Becerra, Unchain The
Stars will be favored as Hollywood Park has its second and final
Friday night card of the fall meet.</LD>
<TE>   Albert G -- who broke his maiden in a highly rated race at Santa
Anita on Oct. 5 -- runs in the sixth, a $43,000 allowance at seven
furlongs. Owned by Frankfurt Stable and trained by Neil Drysdale, the
3-year-old Devil's Bag colt won by a head. Corey Nakatani will ride
the $120,000 yearling purchase.</TE>
<TE>   His seven rivals include Big Apple -- a $2-million yearling buy
who has a win in five starts for the Thoroughbred Corp. and trainer
Bob Baffert -- Primerica, Spacelink and Smile N Wildcat.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Hollywood Park is a wide-open turf
affair for older California breds. Onetrickphoney is one of the main
contenders and he has improved since being switched to the grass by
trainer Pat Gallagher.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Tom Roberts. The trainer won with four of his first 10
runners at Golden Gate Fields. He has five starters on today's card.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Roberto Gonzalez and Ryan Morris. The two jockeys began
Golden Gate a combined 0 for 30.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Pavlosk and Severo in the
second, Prime Candidate and Manly Valentine in the third and Kelli's
Ransom, Chez La Femme and Laker Girl in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/11. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.20/$57.60. Total money bet: $114.</TE>

<LD>   Murray's lifelong friend, Garry Davidson, won $1 million Canadian,
tax free, in the British Columbia lottery two years ago. He and
Murray then partnered with a Salmon Arm businessman, Don Gervais, and
paid $150,000 for an expansion team in the British Columbia Hockey
League.</LD>
<LD>   Davidson, who grew up with Murray in the tiny Canadian town of
Souris, about 2 1/2 hours southwest of Winnipeg, is the coach and
general manager of the Salmon Arm Silverbacks, who wear the same
colors as the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   Murray's 18-year-old son, Brady, is the team's No. 2 scorer in his
first season in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Already committed to the University of North Dakota next season,
Brady Murray is projected as a second- to fourth-round pick in the
2003 NHL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor will be on hand to scout Brady and other prospects in
tonight's game against the Vernon Vipers at Vernon, Murray to check
on his son -- and his investment.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a little money last year," the King coach said. "It's
been a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh sat out Thursday night's game against the Vancouver
Canucks because of "an accumulation of things," Murray said,
mentioning wrist and neck injuries. With Mikko Eloranta on injured
reserve because his left knee is still on the mend, defenseman Brad
Norton was used as a forward.</TE>

<HD>Power Surge Shocks Kings</HD>
<DH>Naslund scores two goals 34 seconds apart with L.A. players
in penalty box to lead the Canucks to 3-2 victory.</DH>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>This time, there was no miracle comeback by the Kings, no
spirit-raising rally, no point on the road.</LD>
<LD>   This time, there were only frustration and lament about squandered
opportunities Thursday night after the Kings lost to the Vancouver
Canucks, 3-2, in front of a sellout crowd of 18,422 at General Motors
Place.</LD>
<LD>   "We deserved better tonight," Coach Andy Murray said.</LD>
<TE>   Playing on the road for the 10th time in 12 games, the Kings lost
for the fifth time in six games, the sixth in eight since Jason
Allison was sidelined. They gave up three goals in a period for the
sixth time in seven games, the Canucks scoring theirs in the second
period and making them stand up for their fifth victory in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Tuesday night, when the Kings overcame a 3-0 deficit in a
4-3 overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs, they fell behind and
stayed behind, though their determined effort was reason for
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give them a little credit," King defenseman Mattias
Norstrom said of the Canucks, who scored two power-play goals 34
seconds apart. "They had some good scoring chances and they put the
puck in the net.</TE>
<TE>   "From our standpoint, we've got to do a little bit more of the
same because if we keep playing the way we played tonight we're going
to win more games than we're going to lose. There's no satisfaction
in losing, but you've got to look at the game and evaluate it. We did
a lot of good things, but not good enough."</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings' travel schedule was ever going to catch up to them,
this figured to be the night, especially with injured scoring leader
Adam Deadmarsh sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, whose eight-game trip started Nov. 5 at San Jose before
taking them to Eastern Canada for three games, arrived at their hotel
at about 4 a.m. Wednesday after flying all night from Toronto,
including a refueling stop in Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   They are reluctant, though, to blame the schedule for their woes,
and they called this their best game of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "The schedule's done," winger Ian Laperriere said before the game.
"They tell us to play somewhere, we just have to go and play. We've
been complaining about it, but if we keep complaining, it doesn't do
us any good. It won't win us any games."</TE>
<TE>   Only 2 minutes 45 seconds into the game, Canuck center Matt Cooke
was slapped with a double minor for high-sticking Norstrom. But the
slumping Kings were unable to capitalize during a four-minute power
play.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks, limited to three shots on goal in the first period
and one in the third, didn't put a shot on goal in the first 12 1/2
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   At 1:05 of the second period, the Kings took the lead thanks to a
great individual effort by rookie Alexander Frolov, who carried the
puck from the right corner behind the net to the other side before
slipping it past goaltender Dan Cloutier.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Letowski pulled the Canucks even less than three minutes
later, scoring from the slot by redirecting a pass from Cooke at
3:54.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the period, Markus Naslund scored two power-play goals,
the first on a blind backhand shot from the goal line at 10:17 with
King defensemen Aaron Miller and Mathieu Schneider in the penalty box
for holding.</TE>
<TE>   Only one second remained in the five-on-three situation when
Naslund scored. With Schneider still in the penalty box, Naslund
scored again at 10:51, his 10th goal of the season, on a shot from
the left faceoff circle.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Armstrong brought the Kings to within 3-2 at 9:27 of the
third period, carrying the puck from the left corner to the slot
before slapping it past Cloutier, but that was as close as the Kings
would get.</TE>

<HD>Shaq Starting to Feel Bullish About Return</HD>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal said Thursday afternoon that he hoped to return to
the Lakers on Nov. 22 against the Chicago Bulls at Staples Center,
with or without the pain that lingers from his toe surgery.</LD>
<LD>   He is scheduled to meet with his surgeon late next week, and could
be cleared to play then. O'Neal said he would "probably not" play in
any of the four games before that, but that he probably would
accompany the team on a two-game trip to Texas early next week,
perhaps keeping open that option.</LD>
<LD>   "All of this will be over soon," O'Neal said.</LD>
<TE>   After a day off for most of the Lakers on Wednesday, O'Neal
returned to the practice floor Thursday and performed better than he
had in recent practices, inspiring optimism among his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Rick Fox said, "Any practice Shaq participates in is a
joyous one."</TE>
<TE>   If he does return against the Bulls, O'Neal will have sat out 12
games.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds plausible," Coach Phil Jackson said. "I felt like today
he had the best practice that he's had."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker suffered a mild sprain of his left ankle in
Thursday's practice. He is probable for tonight's game against the
Golden State Warriors.... Devean George is doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Golden State</TE>
<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330, Spanish).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 2-6, Warriors 2-7.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Warriors (2001-02) -- 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Warriors are 1-5 on the road, but the Lakers are
vulnerable no matter where they are; they've won one of three home
games. Gilbert Arenas (16.4 points, 7.4 assists) is showing potential
as a point guard for the Warriors, and Antawn Jamison is averaging
26.3 points.</TE>

<LD>Tony Stewart has an 89-point lead over Mark Martin for NASCAR's
Winston Cup championship going into Sunday's final race at
Homestead-Miami Speedway. It sounds formidable, but no one knows
better than Stewart that it might not be enough.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Stewart was much further behind than that in the U.S.
Auto Club's Silver Crown series and came out the champion, making him
the only driver to win all three USAC series -- midget, sprint car
and Silver Crown -- in the same year.</LD>
<LD>   To win, in the final race at Sacramento, Dave Darland and Jack
Hewitt had to drop out early and Stewart had to finish second or
better to make up the 155 points by which he trailed Darland and the
147 by which he trailed Hewitt.</LD>
<TE>   "No one even thought about Tony, all the talk was who would win,
Dave or Jack," said Dick Jordan, USAC communications director. "It
was unbelievable, the way things conspired to make Tony the
champion."</TE>
<TE>   Darland's engine blew on Lap 11, and his was the first car out of
the 100-lap race. He got three points to total 892.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt hit the wall on Lap 33. He got four points to total 885.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who'd started 12th, still needed to finish second and
that appeared improbable as Jimmy Sills, who had won the three
previous Sacramento races, led the first 75 laps, with Donnie
Beechler running a strong second.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was third and seemingly still out of it when Sills
inexplicably slowed with an ailing engine, finally dropping out on
Lap 91.</TE>
<TE>   When Beechler won and Stewart collected 160 points for finishing
second, he had 894, two more than Darland.</TE>
<TE>   "Now maybe you can understand me when I say I haven't won the
title yet this year," Stewart said Wednesday in a conference call.
"Yeah, I'm very close, but at the same time I could lose it, the way
Darland did in '95. That's what I've been trying to tell all of you
[reporters] all along, that this isn't done yet.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys, six weeks ago, started talking about something that was
so far off that I couldn't believe I was answering questions about
it, and to be honest, I still don't. I want to wait until after
Sunday's race is over to talk about how I feel about this year."</TE>
<TE>   To put Sunday's finale in perspective, all Stewart needs to become
champion is a 22nd-place finish even if Martin wins the race.</TE>
<TE>   How About Kinser?</TE>
<TE>   It's time for auto racing's driver of the year balloting and the
question is, which driver in American racing deserves it most?</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup drivers from NASCAR have dominated recently, having
won seven times in the last eight years. Only drag racing's John
Force broke the string in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is the likely champion this year, but he has won only
three races. He has been more a survivor than a dominator as first
one driver and then another took shots at leading, only to fall back,
leaving Stewart on top.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the year Force broke the NASCAR streak, the champion
was Stewart's teammate, Bobby Labonte.</TE>
<TE>   This may be time to look for another worthy candidate out of the
mainstream, the way the 16-person panel did in naming Force.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kinser, sprint car racing's greatest driver, gets this
panelist's vote.</TE>
<TE>   The 47-year-old "King of the Outlaws" earned his 18th World of
Outlaws championship by winning 20 of 67 races. The former wrestling
champion from Bloomington, Ind., won a series-record $577,385. He
finished 48 times in the top five in the fiercely competitive world
of winged sprint cars.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the award to Kinser would be akin to the way John Wayne won
his Oscar in 1969, not so much for the film "True Grit," but for the
accumulative strength of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Kinser's best year was in 1987 when he won 46 Outlaws main events
and had 57 overall short-track victories. Dale Earnhardt was driver
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In his career, Kinser has won 471 Outlaws events, dwarfing the
NASCAR record of 200 by Richard Petty.</TE>
<TE>   Champions Cristiano da Matta of Championship Auto Racing Teams and
Sam Hornish Jr. of the Indy Racing League deserve notice, as does
Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves, but their achievements
pale when compared to Kinser's.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta won seven races and could make it eight Sunday in Mexico
City, but Alex Zanardi and Juan Montoya both won seven in their CART
championship years and were not selected. And Da Matta faced a
weakened field after Roger Penske took his drivers, Gil de Ferran and
Castroneves, out of CART.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish won seven IRL races and Castroneves won six, Hornish
retaining his championship with a dramatic win in the final race at
Texas. However, since Tony George formed the IRL and split from CART,
no open-wheel driver has gained racing's top honor.</TE>
<TE>   Nigel Mansell, in 1993, was CART's last driver of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will close its season Saturday night
at Perris Auto Speedway with the Jack Kindoll Classic, a 50-lap main
event.</TE>
<TE>   Richard "The Gas Man" Griffin clinched his fourth championship
earlier in the season and last week the veteran from Silver City,
N.M., won his third straight Non-Wing World Championship. Driving for
car owner Ron Chaffin, he will be looking for his first win in the
Kindoll since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Drag Racing</TE>
<TE>   Three-time top-fuel champion Gary Scelzi will return to National
Hot Rod Assn. competition next year as teammate of Scotty Cannon in a
pair of Oakley-sponsored funny cars owned by Don Schumacher.... Pro
stock driver Gene Wilson received $20,000 from the Auto Club at the
NHRA banquet as the season's rookie of the year.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 junior dragsters from all over the southwestern
United States will converge Saturday on the eighth-mile Irwindale
Dragstrip for the Del Cox Classic, NHRA's junior championships for
youngsters 7 to 17. Racing starts at 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Injured driver John Lingenfelter, in a racing accident during the
Mazda Sport Compact Finals on Oct. 27 at Pomona Raceway, continues to
show improvement but remains in the intensive care unit at Pomona
Valley Hospital. Doctors are weaning Lingenfelter off a respirator.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey Night</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lewis, Laguna Beach entrepreneur and midget car racing
enthusiast, has entered five Ford Beasts in the 62nd annual Turkey
Night Grand Prix at Irwindale Speedway on Nov. 28.</TE>
<TE>   One of the five, however, is for Stewart, who says that the hoopla
surrounding his winning -- or not winning -- the Winston Cup will
probably prevent him from competing. Stewart won the 100-lap race in
2000 and was second in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Porter, two-time NASCAR West Coast short-track champion and
for many years vice president and general manager of Parnelli Jones
Enterprises, died at his home in San Felipe, Baja California. Porter
was recently inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame. His
ashes have been scattered on the Sea of Cortez near his home.
Remembrances can be sent to Saint James Infirmary, c/o Curt Porter,
P.O. Box 1000, El Centro, Calif. 92244.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Has Answer in Fourth for 76ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson didn't let an ankle injury affect his shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson scored 37 points, including a go-ahead basket in the final
minute after coming back from a brief exit, to lead the 76ers past
the San Antonio Spurs, 99-94, Thursday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "I was scared," Iverson said. "I came down on it the wrong way and
I knew an ankle isn't supposed to move that way. But I was able to
walk it off, get more tape on it and fortunately it didn't bother
me."</LD>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had 21 points and nine rebounds for the 76ers, but
it was Iverson who delivered down the stretch, scoring 13 of
Philadelphia's final 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson left after hurting his left ankle with 8:08 remaining. He
got his ankle taped, returned two minutes later and made a driving
layup and a three-point basket to give the 76ers an 87-83 lead. Later
in the game, he banked in a shot with 43 seconds left for a 95-93
lead, then iced the victory with two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 29 points for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 105, Utah 102 -- Michael Jordan scored 19 points,
including back-to-back layups that gave his team the lead for good
late in the fourth quarter, and Jerry Stackhouse scored 25 points and
went 14 for 14 from the free-throw line as the Wizards won at
Washington, despite blowing a 21-point first-half lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz had a chance to tie on its final possession, but Charles
Oakley, playing for the first time since a brief appearance in the
season opener, twice knocked the ball out of DeShawn Stevenson's
hands at the three-point line and Stevenson never got off the shot.</TE>

<HD>Peppers Receives Four-Game Suspension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolina Panther rookie defensive end Julius Peppers was suspended
for four games by the NFL on Thursday for violating the league's
substance-abuse policy, his agent said.</LD>
<LD>   Agent Marvin Demoff said the league office told him that Peppers
had tested positive for a banned substance in a dietary supplement. A
source close to Peppers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Peppers did not test positive for steroids</LD>
<LD>   Demoff said Peppers would appeal the suspension, meaning he can
play in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. In a statement released with
one from his agent, Peppers said he couldn't discuss the suspension
until there's a ruling on his appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Peppers, 22, was the No. 2 overall pick in the draft and leads the
NFL with 10 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   If Peppers is suspended for all four games, he would lose $235,000
in salary. He signed a seven-year, $62-million contract in July, the
richest deal in team history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Bengal wide receiver Chad Johnson is at it again.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals (1-8) play the Cleveland Browns (4-5) in Cincinnati on
Sunday, and Johnson made another prediction.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with Cleveland at all," Johnson said. "They
just happen to be the team we're playing. We're going to win. I'm
guaranteeing it."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Johnson guaranteed Cincinnati would get its first
win of the season against expansion Houston, a prediction first made
by Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau. The Texans cooperated by playing their
worst game, and the Bengals rolled to a 38-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington running back Stephen Davis, sidelined the last two
games with a knee injury, is expected to return for Sunday's game
against the New York Giants. He returned to practice Wednesday and
showed no setbacks Thursday as he ran agility drills with a brace on
his knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully by Sunday, I'll be running full, full, full, full, full
speed," said Davis, who had 528 yards in 123 carries before
re-injuring the knee Oct. 27 against Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coach Steve Spurrier said he might split playing time
between Davis and Kenny Watson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Faulk might practice today, raising the St. Louis Rams'
hopes that he'll be able to play in Monday night's game against
Chicago. Faulk sprained his right ankle and strained a tendon in his
left foot in Sunday's 28-24 win over San Diego. Rookie Lamar Gordon
will start if Faulk isn't able to play.... The Chargers signed wide
receiver Dondre Gilliam from the practice squad to the active roster
Thursday to fill the spot created when returner Tamarick Vanover was
cut. The Chargers also re-signed center Luke Butkus, the nephew of
Hall of Famer Dick Butkus, to the practice squad.</TE>

<HD>Penguins Salvage Tie With Wild</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A short time ago, a tie with Mario Lemieux and the Pittsburgh
Penguins would have been just fine with the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<LD>   But Thursday night at St. Paul, Minn., was, well, a little
disappointing.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Park scored his second goal of the season to lift the Wild
to a 1-1 tie with the Penguins, but Minnesota couldn't convert an
overtime power play after Pittsburgh was penalized for too many men
on the ice with 1:38 remaining.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought at a time in the third period, because of a lack of
energy, if we get a point we'll be fine," said Wild Coach Jacques
Lemaire, whose team ended its first two-game losing streak and
remains on top of the Northwest Division with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   "But after what I saw at the end, well, you're disappointed,"
Lemaire said. "A power play at the end, you expect to get chances --
maybe score a goal."</TE>
<TE>   Johan Hedberg, who gave up seven goals in his last two starts,
stopped 30 of Minnesota's shots. Marc Bergevin scored for the first
time in two seasons for Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild is unbeaten in six overtime games this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins, using NHL scoring leader Lemieux on a new line with
Alexandre Daigle and Martin Straka, weren't able to generate any more
offense against Manny Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, New York Islanders 1 -- Glen Murray had a goal and an
assist as the Bruins won at Boston in a game in which the Islanders
lost captain Michael Peca to a knee injury in his first meaningful
action of the season. Peca was forced out in the second period after
he sprained his right knee behind the Boston net when he got tripped
up by P.J. Axelsson. Peca's status is day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Florida 2 -- Todd White scored three minutes into
overtime off an assist from Daniel Alfredsson to lift the Senators at
Ottawa. Alfredsson and Jason Spezza scored power-play goals for the
Senators, who have a power-play goal in 13 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, Nashville 1 -- Peter Forsberg had a goal and two
assists to lead the Avalanche at Nashville, Tenn. Colorado defenseman
Rob Blake left the ice 22 seconds into the game after he sustained a
bruised knee when he was hit by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 2, Calgary 1 -- Mikael Samuelsson scored the
go-ahead goal and Dan Blackburn made 35 saves to help the Rangers win
at Calgary, Alberta. Petr Nedved scored a short-handed goal at 4:09
of the second period for New York.</TE>

<LD>Rumors of the demise of the Romanian women's gymnastics program
appear to have been premature.</LD>
<LD>   Injuries kept the senior women home from the European
championships, but they're expected to be in top form next week at
the World Championships in Debrecen, Hungary.</LD>
<LD>   However, injuries led the U.S. to send a women's team of four
16-year-olds who have no world championship experience.</LD>
<TE>   At the Massilia Cup competition last week in France, Romania's
Oana Ban won the all-around title and compatriots Andreea Raducan and
Sabina Cojocar won gold on the balance beam and floor exercise,
respectively. They're contenders at the world meet, which begins with
qualifying rounds on Wednesday. Only individual event titles will be
contested; no team or all-around titles are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation is Ashley Postell, Terin Humphrey, Courtney
Kupets and Samantha Sheehan, who were third, seventh, eighth and 11th
in the all-around this year at the U.S. competition. Tasha Schwikert,
Tabitha Yim, Katie Heenan and Mohini Bhardwaj, who won team bronze
medals last year at the world meet, were hobbled by assorted injuries
during the selection camp and were left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men, who won a team silver last year, lost Morgan Hamm to
an injured ankle. But Sydney Olympian Paul Hamm will compete in floor
exercise, pommel horse and high bar and Sean Townsend will defend his
world title in the parallel bars. Brett McClure (pommel horse,
parallel bars and high bars) and Jeff Johnson (rings) will also
compete.</TE>
<TE>   Next year's World Championships, to be held Aug. 18-24 in Anaheim,
will be the qualifying meet for the 2004 Athens Olympics and will
decide team, all-around and individual titles.</TE>
<TE>   Not Just Talk</TE>
<TE>   Sprinter Jon Drummond thought he was going to San Diego last
weekend to lobby U.S. Olympic Committee officials for more funding
for track and field.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he found himself at a USOC athletes' summit. The theme
was "Riding the Wave to Athens," and it brought together 60 summer
sports athletes to discuss their trials and tribulations as they
train for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   After trying a Navy SEALS obstacle course, listening to swimmer
Janet Evans and gymnast Peter Vidmar discuss life after sports and
rooming with volleyball star Karch Kiraly, Drummond was in awe of
everyone -- even the synchronized swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to eat crow," said Drummond, who won gold in Sydney as a
member of the 400-meter relay team. "I was one of those guys who
thought synchronized swimming is not a sport. After trying their
workout, I have new respect for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish more athletes who have achieved things in their sports
would participate in the summits, because they get to share their
experiences. I talked to divers. It's a beautiful thing, but now I
understand what they do when they jump off a platform at 35 mph and
smack into the water.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go to the Olympics in 2004, I'm going to have a lot of
people to root for. These athletes are inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   According to the USOC, 49% of the athletes who attended pre-Winter
Games summits won a medal. Vidmar said he can't prove a link between
the summit and success, but it's good preparation on many levels.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not teaching anybody new techniques. That's between them
and their coaches," Vidmar said. "We just want them to know there are
people in the same boat as they are, suffering with them, physically
or financially. I wish they had these before I was an Olympian."</TE>
<TE>   Pooling Resources</TE>
<TE>   The Thetis Cup tournament this weekend in Crete, Greece, is a
World Cup warmup for the U.S. women's national water polo team. Seven
of the eight teams in Crete will compete at the World Cup in Perth,
Australia, in December.</TE>
<TE>   "This year has been a little easier than last year," said U.S.
Coach Guy Baker, who coached the U.S. women to silver at Sydney. "The
year after the Olympics is hard. We've got nine people from our
Sydney team. Last year was a transition year. This year, with the
Olympics getting closer, our focus is more toward the future."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women, minus some of their top college players, lost the
tournament opener, 5-4, to Greece on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little younger than we were at Sydney," Baker said.
"Physically, we're a much better team.... We'll be a little off
tactically and team chemistry-wise, but we have time between now and
Athens to get where we need to be."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Erik Schlopy, entered in two slalom races this weekend in Loveland
Basin, Colo., said he had "post-Olympic hangover" after Salt Lake
City. The lure of World Cup racing, which starts next week in Park
City, jolted him out of it. "For us, the World Cup is just as
important as the Olympics," he said. "The field is even more
difficult than the Olympics, and World Cup titles are more of an
athlete's Holy Grail than Olympic gold because it's proven over the
whole season.... We're skiing our hearts out every weekend, just like
NFL players play their hearts out every week.''</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen Southern California youngsters ages 10 to 14 were invited
to a USA Luge screening camp at Lake Placid, N.Y., in January. They
were chosen based on their participation in a luge clinic in Long
Beach in August. If they do well at the screening camp, they could
win spots on the U.S. development team.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Prix figure skating series continues with the Trophee
Lalique this weekend in Paris. Skate Canada winner Sasha Cohen is the
lone U.S. women's entry; the only U.S. man is Michael Weiss, who was
fifth at Skate America and fourth last weekend at the Bofrost Cup in
Germany. At the Bofrost Cup, Santa Monica pair Rena Inoue and John
Baldwin finished a commendable fifth in their Grand Prix debut. Amber
Corwin of Hermosa Beach moved up from sixth to fifth among the

<LD>With no team or coach yet selected, no site or date yet designated
for the American qualifying tournament in which they must
participate, and the good name of their country to reclaim, USA
Basketball's Senior National Team Committee meets today in New York
to start picking up the pieces.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first meeting since the summer disaster in Indianapolis,
when the U.S. men suffered their first international loss since NBA
players started representing the country, falling to Argentina,
followed by losses to Yugoslavia and Spain, and finishing sixth in
the World Championship.</LD>
<LD>   This renewed calls for the best U.S. players, such as the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, to play. Bryant has indicated an
interest and O'Neal, who has been in one Olympics and a World
Championship, has said he might return.</LD>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson has also suggested his interest. Jackson
has never been associated with USA Basketball, which traditionally
gives the Olympic job to people who have coached its other teams.
However, because O'Neal and Bryant would be pleased by Jackson's
appointment, committee sources don't pooh-pooh Phil's candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak, a member of the committee, is
attending but says he is bearing no messages or conditions from
O'Neal, Bryant or Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   An Olympic gold medalist at Montreal in 1976, Kupchak has
suggested that Bryant and O'Neal think about going to Athens in 2004
but says they haven't discussed it recently.</TE>
<TE>   "I read the papers," Kupchak said from New York. "I see Kobe is
interested in playing and Shaq is considering it, but we've had no
discussions recently....</TE>
<TE>   "Phil and I did talk about it a little bit. I think it's something
that's intriguing to him. I think it's something that he'd consider.
I think at one point in time, he was adamantly against it, but I
think it's intriguing today.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, it's kind of a silver lining to the fact
that we lost in Indianapolis. It has renewed interest, patriotic
interest in this country's status in international basketball,
something that seems to have been lost. You've got some very
established people saying they're interested in coming, including our
coach. Clearly, it's something people care about."</TE>
<TE>   The qualifying tournament will be sometime next summer. Finalists
for the site are Rio de Janeiro; Mexico City; Toronto; Caracas,
Venezuela, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. last had to qualify in 1999. That time a "core group" of
nine players was selected, and those players were promised places on
the 2000 Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   With such stars as Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd and Gary
Payton, the U.S. went 10-0 and qualified. Then the team was augmented
in the Sydney Olympics by Vince Carter and Antonio McDyess and won
the gold medal, although not without scares from Lithuania and
France.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has expressed less interest in playing on a qualifying team
too, but if he or O'Neal said they'd go to the Olympics, the
committee probably would give them next summer off.</TE>

<DH>Totoaba, once a valued commodity in the Sea of Cortez, are
making a slow comeback thanks to scientists in Ensenada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pete Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA</DL>
<LD>On the eastern side of the Baja California peninsula, beyond the
sun-baked shores of San Felipe, lives a fish called the totoaba.</LD>
<LD>   This large member of the croaker family, found only in the
northern Sea of Cortez, has a past as colorful as a Mexican sunrise.</LD>
<LD>   It also has a questionable future, having been fished to
near-extinction. But because of an effort underway in Ensenada, the
first on its behalf, it's a future that seems to be getting at least
a little brighter.</LD>
<TE>   The mere presence of totoaba -- also commonly called totuava --
spawned the beginnings of San Felipe, as a fish camp, in the early
1900s. The fish was the city's reason for being, the spur to its
early growth.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath its flesh and fins was an unusually large and delicate
swim-bladder, which became prized as a key ingredient for fish-belly
soup. Consumers in Asia, particularly China, couldn't get enough. The
bladders sold for $5 a pound, which was a lot in those days, when
totoaba's tender meat sold for 2 cents a pound.</TE>
<TE>   The slaughter of totoaba, as they gathered to spawn in the
brackish waters at the mouth of the then-mighty Colorado River, was
methodical. Fishermen used not only hand-lines and harpoons, but
gill-nets and even dynamite. The bladders were removed and the
carcasses -- thousands every day -- were left to rot on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   News of such waste, in the early 1920s, reached the border town of
Calexico. Two melon haulers, carrying barrels of drinking water,
bounced their truck more than 100 miles over a road-less desert and
through vast mud plains and found not only San Felipe, but the very
bonanza they were looking for.</TE>
<TE>   They became the first real dealers of totoaba flesh, which was
comparable, or superior, to the finest fish sold north of the border.
A steady stream of refrigeration trucks followed and the San Pedro fish
houses distributed totoaba under various labels, from Mexican bass to
white seabass and, simply, seabass.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, adventurous anglers made their way to San Felipe and
sank their hooks into a mighty game fish that looked and fought like
the white seabass so prevalent back then off Southern California. But
they were three times the size, measuring up to seven feet and
weighing as much as 300 pounds. A sport fishery began to develop
alongside the commercial fishery.</TE>
<TE>   Things were going swimmingly in San Felipe. Commercial catches in
1962 reached a whopping 2,000 tons. More anglers were coming every
year.</TE>
<TE>   But things were not going nearly as well for the totoaba, which
were not being managed to any degree as a sustainable resource. The
collapse -- brought about also by the damming of the Colorado and the
subsequent reduction, to a trickle, of water entering the sea -- hit
like a thud.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial catches plummeted annually after 1962 and reached a
meager 50 tons in 1974. A year later, Mexico put totoaba on its list
of federally endangered species, banning its catch and sale. More
recently, Mexico declared the upper reaches of the gulf a biosphere
reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with tourism having replaced fishing as the primary
economic base, there is only anecdotal evidence of a modest comeback:
The totoaba is still referred to mostly in the past tense.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to the western side of the peninsula. Here,
on the wind-swept shores of Ensenada, a small staff of university
scientists and students has dived headfirst into a project aimed at
restoring the species and bringing it back into the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Conal David True, a marine biologist at the University of Baja
California, is in charge of the project, which is moving forward
despite funding that seems to ebb more than it flows. He and his
staff, for the last eight years, have been raising totoaba, trucking
them across the peninsula, and releasing them off San Felipe.</TE>
<TE>   Their ultimate goal -- an ambitious and, some might say,
unrealistic one -- is to have the captive-breeding program blossom
into a full-scale aquaculture operation that can be moved to San
Felipe. There, with the help of the beleaguered fishermen, totoaba
will be farmed-raised, with perhaps 30% going toward enhancement of
the wild fishery and the rest sent to various markets.</TE>
<TE>   "In the northern Sea of Cortez, there's just so much for the
people to do," True said. "There's some fishing, a few maquiladoras
[foreign-owned assembly plants], some drug trafficking and, I think,
a mine. And of course tourism. That's about all they have to do for a
living, so if they can get totoaba back, it'll be a big plus for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   A big plus? Totoaba bladders today fetch about $100 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This is a busier day than most at the hatchery. Children on field
trips are being led from tank to tank, shown the algae that feed the
microscopic rotifers, which feed the smaller totoaba until they're
large enough to eat brine shrimp and, ultimately, specially
formulated food pellets.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller totoaba were produced by the sleek and silver giants
housed in two large tanks outside the complex, not far from the
lapping surf. These broodstock -- captured years ago on hook and line
by the scientists -- have produced thousands of totoaba, long since
released.</TE>
<TE>   The twice-yearly releases have gotten progressively bigger -- the
first was only 400 fish and the most recent was 1,700 -- and the goal
is to someday put 20,000 fish each year back into the natural fold.
It's a drop in the bucket, really, since a high percentage of those
fish will be gobbled up by predators or caught in the nets of
poachers long before they reach adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they're doing here is beautiful," says Paul Curtis,
hatchery manager at Hubbs-Sea World white seabass hatchery in
Carlsbad. "Doing this with white seabass is one thing. They're
somewhat endangered, or at least they were. But we have tons of
broodstock available to us. Poor Conal, trying to get broodstock for
him is like pulling teeth from a killer whale."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis has come to Ensenada to assist True and his staff as they
implant devices beneath the skin of the broodstock that will release
hormones designed to boost the ovulation process. With luck, True
will soon have millions of eggs to nurture in hopes of growing about
8,000 fish to releasable size.</TE>
<TE>   Such a process, as any hatchery manager will attest, requires all
sorts of trickery to be effective.</TE>
<TE>   The children here are taught, for example, that the broodstock in
one tank has spent the last several weeks in a simulated summer, with
14 hours of sunlight every day and warm water; while those in the
other tank have been living in a simulated winter, with only eight
hours of sunlight and much colder water. Thus, it is hoped, there
will be two spawns each year, one each in the fall and spring.</TE>
<TE>   They are taught that totoaba are found throughout the northern
gulf but rarely south of the Midriff Islands, or about 400 miles
south of San Felipe. At the Midriff, an abrupt change in water
temperature serves as a barrier. Such confinement has made the fish
extremely vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   This proved true not long after they were discovered as a viable
fishery off Guaymas on the mainland coast. According to a 1928
California Department of Fish and Game report on the totoaba fishery,
some of the Chinese within the community "discovered that the sound
or swim-bladder of the fish was of unusual character and not
dissimilar to that of fishes in the Orient which, when properly
pressed and dried, sold for astonishing prices."</TE>
<TE>   When the waters off Guaymas were fished out, the search expanded
northward and the discovery was made, by German explorers looking for
gold, of perhaps millions of spawning totoaba at the mouth of the
Colorado. In a rush, the Guaymas fishermen migrated north.</TE>
<TE>   "The first season men only went," the DFG report continued. "But
on the second, wives and children were brought, and in this way the
town sprang up, growing from an original five white men to many
hundreds of Indians and Mexicans."</TE>
<TE>   The rest, it can safely be said, is history.</TE>

<LD>Last week, Michigan State fired Coach Bobby Williams in large part
because he answered "I don't know" to the question of whether he had
lost control of his team.</LD>
<LD>   This week, 55 Arizona players marched into the school president's
office to complain about John Mackovic's coaching style.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-five.</LD>
<TE>   Mackovic has not only lost his players, he might not be able to
find them with sonar.</TE>
<TE>   So, Williams loses his job, yet Mackovic keeps his?</TE>
<TE>   Reading between the (offensive and defensive) lines, it sounds as
though Mackovic's public apology for his brusque treatment of players
only postponed the inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's gone," senior linebacker Lance Briggs told the
Arizona Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Michael Jolivette called Mackovic's apology "a
joke."</TE>
<TE>   So, everybody ready for Saturday's big game at California?</TE>
<TE>   Uh, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   There are rumors some players might not board the team's flight
today to the Bay Area, which would turn this saga into "Mutiny on the
Bounty."</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic was a strange choice from the get-go. In December 2000,
Arizona replaced an aging but successful coach, Dick Tomey, with
another aging but successful coach -- a "retread" hire, as it's known
in the business.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic had been out of coaching since Texas fired him after
going 4-7 in 1997, after which he deftly transitioned into an
articulate ESPN analyst before Arizona so rudely interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   At least when Arizona State ousted veteran Bruce Snyder after the
2000 season, it took a fresh-look approach in hiring Dirk Koetter,
one of the game's bright young offensive minds, from Boise State.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona went "old school" with the now 59-year-old Mackovic, and
apparently has ended up with an "old act."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona is 2-12 in Pac-10 play since Mackovic arrived, 0-6 this
year. His tough-coach tactics are better suited for the Frank Kush
era.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic apologized for remarks made to players, most notably for
telling one he was "a disgrace to his family."</TE>
<TE>   Too late, some say.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic stories have been making the rounds all season. After a
tough loss at Washington, Mackovic reportedly verbally ripped into
one of his players in the hallway.</TE>
<TE>   "Say what you want about [Washington Coach] Rick Neuheisel," one
observer to the incident said, "but Rick would never do something
like that."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Mackovic last year granted ESPN, his former
employer, unlimited access to his program for a supposedly
no-holds-barred series called "The Season."</TE>
<TE>   Boy, did ESPN pick the wrong season to go undercover.</TE>
<TE>   So why didn't Mackovic get sacked?</TE>
<TE>   The real-world timing couldn't be worse, as the school is still
reeling from a recent on-campus tragedy in which a student killed
three nursing professors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, change could come should Arizona lose its final two games,
against Cal and Arizona State, to finish 0-8 in conference for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Mackovic's toughest job appears to be getting his team on
board ... the team plane.</TE>
<TE>   Duck and Cover</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry week gets a head start Saturday when Washington (5-5, 1-4)
plays at Oregon (7-3, 3-2). While the schools missed each other last
year and do not qualify for annual schedule protection like UCLA-USC,
Washington-Washington State, Cal-Stanford, Oregon-Oregon State and
Arizona-Arizona State, Washington-Oregon might rank as the
conference's most bitter feud.</TE>
<TE>   For years, it was a status thing, Washington basically looking
down on Oregon, even on the map. Washington had the program, the
facilities, the view and the Pac-10 pedigree, while Oregon served as
backdrop for the movie "Animal House."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, though, Oregon has become the conference's dominant
program thanks to state-of-the-art facilities partially funded by
Nike boss Phil Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, this week, it was Washington Coach Neuheisel who
sounded a bit envious, calling Oregon football a "propaganda
machine."</TE>
<TE>   "They've got billboards in New York City, they've got billboards
in Los Angeles," Neuheisel said. "They seemingly have an endless
budget to do so and more power to them. Until the rules change, who
is going to keep them from doing it?"</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret Neuheisel and Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti are not
friends, yet Bellotti says the rivalry is not really about players
and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most of the players from both schools are from
California.</TE>
<TE>   "The depth of emotion is felt more by the fans and the boosters
and those people who want to compare notes on the Internet," Bellotti
said</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   With two games left, UCLA's bowl options could not be more
diverse. There is a scenario in which the Bruins could go to the Rose
Bowl and one in which they could fall to the Silicon Valley Bowl, if
that Dec. 31 even gets played. As of this week, the San Jose-area
bowl was looking for a cable agreement after Fox pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   Several Pac-10 bowl scenarios are on hold as the conference
watches the season play out for Washington State, which could be
headed for the Fiesta Bowl if it finishes No. 1 or 2 in the bowl
championships series standings. California (6-4) is serving a
one-year bowl ban as part of NCAA sanctions. School officials made
their ban-reversal plea before the NCAA Appeals committee last week
in Chicago and expect a ruling before next week's showdown against
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Cal officials had no idea this appeal would be so important with
the school coming off a 1-10 season. However, if the Bears beat
Arizona and Stanford to finish 8-4 it would mark the fifth-best
record improvement in NCAA history.</TE>

<HD>Paterno Won't Like the Official Version</HD>
<DH>Referees seek sanctions against Penn State coach, whose
criticism, one says, has 'gotten out of hand.'</DH>

<LD>The effigy, a football official holding a yellow flag, has been
removed from Joe Paterno's front door, but the season-long
controversy between the Penn State football coach and Big Ten
Conference officials remains on his doorstep.</LD>
<LD>   A Big Ten game official said Thursday that the 57-member Big Ten
Football Officials Assn. had asked supervisor Dave Parry to urge
conference Commissioner Jim Delany to discipline Paterno for a string
of acts and comments critical of officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I like Joe, but there is a concern among the officials about him,
[that] he's never been so abusive or critical in public," said the
official, who requested anonymity. "The concern with him is that we
don't want to see him end up like Woody Hayes. I'd hate to see that,
especially for a guy who's accomplished so much."</LD>
<TE>   Hayes, the legendary Ohio State coach, was fired after he'd
punched a Clemson player during the 1978 Gator Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that although no one in his association believed
it was Paterno who'd strung up the doll from the front door knocker
of the Paterno home, he did express disappointment at how the
75-year-old Paterno ducked the issue during his Tuesday news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   After first telling reporters at Penn State, "Let's not get into
it," Paterno was pressed about the matter and said, "I don't even
know if I have a door knocker. I never use the front door. I go in
through the garage."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Mano, president of the board of directors of the National
Assn. of Sports Officials and publisher of Referee magazine, said,
"[Paterno's] reaction has added some fuel to this situation. This was
an opportunity for Paterno to disavow what happened. There are
respectful relationships between Paterno and some officials in the
Big Ten. Among those who respect him, their previous image of him is
gone."</TE>
<TE>   The tension between Paterno and officials began during Penn
State's 42-35 overtime loss to Iowa on Sept. 28. Disputing two calls
he contended were bad, Paterno ran to grab the back of official Dick
Honig's shirt after the game and pointed out the alleged miscues.</TE>
<TE>   "In reality, it wasn't all that much," said the Big Ten official.
"In perception, it became a national issue, because you just can't do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Paterno's uncharacteristic behavior has resulted in criticism
nationally by college football observers who have described his
actions as beneath a man with 334 victories, two national
championships and 37 seasons at a respected institution.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were also subjected to Paterno's public criticism after
Penn State's losses at Michigan on Oct. 12, 27-24 in overtime, and at
Ohio State on Oct. 26, 13-7. He argued that a call had deprived the
Nittany Lions of trying a potential winning field goal against
Michigan, and that a final drive against Ohio State had stalled when
an official missed calling an obvious pass-interference violation.
Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley has requested a review of Big
Ten officiating procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being in the national championship chase, Penn State
(7-3) is tied for fourth in the Big Ten and is ranked 16th in the
Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls.</TE>
<TE>   What is driving Paterno's complaints is a source of debate. Is he
too defensive, in the wake of speculation that he had "lost it" as a
coach after consecutive losing seasons in 2000 and 2001? Does he
believe he has carte blanche to criticize, especially after Delany
acknowledged that a coach of Paterno's stature merits preferential
treatment? Is the officiating truly bad?</TE>
<TE>   "Things have gotten out of hand with Joe," the Big Ten official
said. "When you don't issue a statement on these things, even though
the things he's done have been shown and reported all over the
country, that silence doesn't help a thing. They're now having a
harder time with other coaches being critical because they haven't
done anything with Joe."</TE>
<TE>   Delany was not available for comment Thursday and a conference
spokesman said he had no comment about the hanging doll. A source
familiar with the conference said the doll episode had led Delany to
take possible discipline of Paterno "under advisement."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Nelson, a Penn State football spokesman, said neither Paterno
nor others in the football offices had expressed concern about
receiving punishment from the Big Ten. Nelson added that Paterno
hadn't mentioned when, or if, he intended to identify the person who
hung the doll.</TE>
<TE>   Paterno's situation has caught the attention of those in other
conferences. The Mountain West Conference, for instance, ordered Utah
Coach Ron McBride to apologize to a Pacific 10 Conference official
after McBride had criticized the officiating when his team lost to
Arizona in September.</TE>
<TE>   McBride said Thursday, "It's no good to criticize officials, you
should just go play."</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, "I don't think Paterno would be a guy to
complain unless he had a legitimate complaint. Maybe they'll listen
to him. Maybe they'll get it squared away."</TE>
<TE>   Big Sky Conference Commissioner Doug Fullerton said his conference
had written, unyielding rules on public criticism of officials that
have resulted in two one-game suspensions for coaches, most recently
Sacramento State's John Volek last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak for the Big Ten, but I know what the Big Sky would
have done with this," Fullerton said.</TE>

<HD>Making a Trophy Case</HD>
<DH>USC's Palmer has numbers and momentum, but is anyone east
of Vegas paying attention?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than six decades, college football's immortal award has been
accompanied by an eternal question.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly who is that little bronze guy stiff-arming, anyway?</LD>
<LD>   For 21 years, it has appeared to be the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, it definitely is Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   The leader in the Heisman Trophy race should be college football's
hottest quarterback directing one of its hottest teams through the
sport's toughest schedule.</TE>
<TE>   But Eastern bias is shoving him to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five games, no quarterback has been better, no running
back has had as much impact, no other player has stepped to the front
of the Heisman race with such grit and grace.</TE>
<TE>   But to hundreds of the 1,050 voters, he is little more than the
guy flickering above them on a muted TV screen as they chow their
postgame tri-tip.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer is not discussed by the old-timers sitting at Bobby
Bowden's feet, not examined by the young bards hanging around Mack
Brown's office, not understood by the bundled masses waiting to
forgive Joe Paterno's next referee rant.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer is not touted by an ESPN network that does not
televise Pac-10 games, and rarely touches the radar screen of Web
site guys who never leave the couch.</TE>
<TE>   And he is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   Since Marcus Allen became the last West Coast player to win one in
1981, the Heisman Trophy has become the most regionally biased and
unfair award in sports.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, every other major sport has awarded its top
honors to West Coast athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Even the skating-rink-sized NHL is less parochial than a sport
whose major award is based not on how you play, but where you play,
and what time, and will the Ann Arbor cable company be showing it?</TE>
<TE>   "My shot of winning a Heisman Trophy is so slim, I don't even
think about it," Palmer said earlier this week. "It's very, very rare
that I would have a chance. That's just how it works."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981, here's precisely how it has worked:</TE>
<TE>   * Herschel Walker has beaten John Elway.</TE>
<TE>   * Gino Torretta has beaten Marshall Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   * Eric Crouch has beaten Joey Harrington and David Carr.</TE>
<TE>   And so on.</TE>
<TE>   When individual excellence occurs on the West Coast in any other
sport, even if Shaquille O'Neal doesn't sometimes agree, it is
generally recognized.</TE>
<TE>   When it occurs out here in college football, it's Happy Hour in
Tuscaloosa and nobody is paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't believe me, then listen to college football's patron
saint:</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been very tender on the point that, I think the
West Coast guys get screwed," Keith Jackson said. "I still do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Dorsey of Miami? Carson Palmer has thrown for nearly 500 more
yards than Dorsey, and has a much higher completion percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Willis McGahee of Miami? He wouldn't even be leading the Pac-10 in
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Banks of Iowa? Palmer has completed 71 more passes and thrown
for 477 more yards.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brown of Colorado? In the Buffaloes' two losses, he averaged
3.8 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Leftwich of Marshall? He has been injured.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the top Heisman candidates in most polls, yet Palmer has
better numbers than any of them.</TE>
<TE>   "And nobody has played a tougher schedule since Germany in World
War II," said college football expert Beano Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Jason Gesser of Washington State, Palmer's West Coast
rival. In the last five games, Palmer has thrown for 369 more yards
and four more touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest number hurting Palmer is the Trojans' two losses.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not an MVP award, right?</TE>
<TE>   "That's not how it was designed," Jackson said. "When it first
started, it was for the best player. Because everybody played both
ways, it was easy."</TE>
<TE>   But today?</TE>
<TE>   "Specialization has made it just about impossible to say who is
the best player in the country," Jackson said. "But Carson Palmer is
as good as any player I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the country, Cook agreed that Palmer should
have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "If he beats UCLA and has a good game against Notre Dame, he can
win it," Cook said. "I get the impression that voters just don't want
to vote for Dorsey, and they are looking for any reason to vote for
somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer certainly can win it.</TE>
<TE>   If indeed the Trojans go 10-2 and he plays well against Notre Dame
on national television, he should win it.</TE>
<TE>   But will he win it?</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledged Cook, "I don't think anybody gets up in the morning
and says they're not going to vote for the West Coast guy. But I do
think people would rather vote for people closer to home."</TE>
<TE>   Sighed Jackson, "College athletics are the only endeavor in the
world where provincialism is a strength."</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, to appreciate the Nebraska sea of red, and Florida
swamp, and the Columbus High Street party, one must accept that the
same boosterism can also taint.</TE>
<TE>   This column may appear to be born of the same boosterism. But
those around town know that this space has consistently been tough on
Palmer and the rebuilding USC program, even as recently as the loss
to Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Then, suddenly, the quarterback who wasn't even touted on his
team's media guide cover began playing like the potential No. 1 draft
pick in the nation. And his teammates followed.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Jackson said, "This hasn't always been true in times past,
but right now, Carson is as good as anybody I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't about favoritism. It's about fairness.</TE>
<TE>   And it would be yet another chapter in a history of Heisman
hilarity if Palmer weren't given a fair chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The record speaks for itself," said Tom Hansen, Pac-10
commissioner whose league traditionally produces more NFL players
than any other. "Looking at the pro rosters, there's a good deal of
evidence that we've had great football players out here. That none of
them has won a Heisman since 1981, there's something very
dysfunctional in that."</TE>
<TE>   The problems begin with the actual balloting, 175 voters each in
six regional sections, writers and broadcasters and former Heisman
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Three of those sections are in the Eastern time zone, only one is
in the Pacific time zone.</TE>
<TE>   And, although the identity of the voters is kept quiet, it seems
to be based on an old-boy network that has somehow, incredibly,
excluded folks such as Chris Dufresne, The Times' nationally
acclaimed college football writer.</TE>
<TE>   If a guy who sees as many games as anybody in the country while
working for the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily newspaper
does not vote ... who does?</TE>
<TE>   (Actually, our sports editor, Bill Dwyre, has a vote, but I'm not
going there ... )</TE>
<TE>   With so many of those voters on the East Coast, and perhaps many
of them out of touch with weekly games, television is now essential
for fairness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Pac-10 televises its games on a network -- Fox Sports --
that does not reach as many East Coast homes as college football's
most important network.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one could correlate the disappearance of West Coast
Heisman winners with the emergence of ESPN as a Saturday afternoon
monster.</TE>
<TE>   The ESPN announcers can make a Heisman candidate with their
"College GameDay" patter. Yet they don't visit the Pac-10 schools and
don't televise Pac-10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's preposterous to think that we are hurt by Fox," Hansen
countered. "We get great national coverage from them."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "Every time we talked to ESPN about a contract,
they could not offer us good time slots, and therefore not as much
income."</TE>
<TE>   So the Pac-10 is huge in Seattle and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But in Atlanta a couple of years ago, the lack of TV exposure led
to a typical Heisman bias story.</TE>
<TE>   Several Heisman voters, accompanied by Dufresne, had finished
covering an SEC game and were relaxing at an Atlanta hotel bar,
watching a late UCLA game featuring Cade McNown.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were trailing, and McNown was struggling, when the bar
closed at 1 a.m. EST.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the voters had returned to their rooms and prepared
for bed, McNown had led the Bruins on an amazing comeback.</TE>
<TE>   But because the room televisions did not pick up the Fox feed --
few hotels do -- the voters never saw it.</TE>
<TE>   Later that fall, McNown was voted the nation's top quarterback by
a couple of organizations but finished third in the Heisman voting
behind Ricky Williams and Michael Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bishop?</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent, when it comes to the Heisman Trophy, we have to
just say we are never a factor and can never get our hopes up,"
Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has USC Coach Pete Carroll, still relatively new to
this funky college stuff, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson Palmer is the best player, playing against the toughest
schedule," he said. "What more do you have to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Four things, actually.</TE>
<TE>   Beat Arizona State. Beat UCLA. Beat Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Then hope folks look up from their deep-fried provincialism long
enough to notice.</TE>

<LD>Former Bulgaria national team midfielder Stoicho Stoilov was shot and
wounded Thursday after becoming engaged in a heated argument with
another driver after a traffic accident in the southwestern Bulgarian
town of Blagoevgrad.</LD>
<LD>   Stoilov, 31, was fired at four times and hit in the stomach and
leg. A hospital spokesman declined to reveal his condition. The other
driver, Simeon Mechev, 43, turned himself in to police and was being
held for questioning.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in Sofia, Bulgaria, photographer Ivaylo Donchev was
hospitalized with head wounds that were not considered
life-threatening after being injured when an unidentified fan tossed
a homemade bomb onto the field during Thursday's UEFA Cup match
between Levski Sofia and Sturm Graz of Austria.</LD>
<TE>   Several arrests were made, but the culprit was not immediately
identified.</TE>
<TE>   That 149-0 Game</TE>
<TE>   The sports ministry of the island nation of Madagascar dissolved
the country's soccer federation, apparently because the government is
unhappy with the appointment of Switzerland's Hans Heineger as
national coach and unhappier still that the federation has not acted
in wake of the 149 own goals scored in protest during a recent league
match that drew worldwide attention.</TE>
<TE>   If FIFA follows precedent in such matters, the move is almost
certain to cause world soccer's governing body to suspend Madagascar
from all international competition because FIFA opposes any
government interference in the administration of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   A Very Red Card</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified amateur player has been banned for eight games by
the Dutch soccer federation (KNVB) for kissing a referee who had
tossed him out of a game last month.</TE>
<TE>   "First, the player got a yellow card, then he made remarks to the
referee," KNVB spokesman Joris Gieske said. "The second yellow was
also for talking [dissent], and then the player got angry.</TE>
<TE>   "He took the referee by the head and kissed him on the mouth."</TE>
<TE>   ... And in Germany</TE>
<TE>   A lack of respect for referees was the subject of some angry
comments from Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the German soccer
federation (DFB).</TE>
<TE>   "The current situation in the Bundesliga is no longer acceptable,"
he said in Berlin. "It cannot be tolerated that every refereeing
decision is heavily discussed and criticized."</TE>
<TE>   Mayer-Vorfelder has the backing of Bayern Munich President Franz
Beckenbauer, head of the 2006 World Cup Organizing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only the [starting] players who don't behave well, but
also the substitutes and the coaches and their assistants," he said.
"It's been that way for years and it must stop. It's not like that in
other leagues, and it hurts the image of the Bundesliga."</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2006</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer could not resist a dig at the Netherlands, Germany's
longtime soccer rival, when the Dutch electronics giant Philips
agreed to become the 10th official sponsor of the 2006 World Cup in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know for sure that the Dutch will be here [in 2006],"
Beckenbauer joked. "They were not there in 2002. We naturally hope
that the Dutch team will be here too."</TE>
<TE>   The other nine official sponsors are Adidas, Avaya,
Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Telekom, Gillette, McDonald's,
Toshiba and Yahoo.</TE>

<HD>Stark's Answer Is Good Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wonder if Andy Rooney has been paying attention to the job sideline
reporter Melissa Stark has been doing this season?</LD>
<LD>   It was a little over a month ago that CBS' Rooney, when he was a
guest on Boomer Esiason's New York cable television show, said, "The
only thing that really bugs me about television's [football] coverage
is those damn women they have down on the sidelines who don't know
what the hell they're talking about."</LD>
<LD>   A few female sideline reporters responded at the time. "Obviously,
it's silly to lump all women reporters into one group," said ESPN's
Suzy Kolber. CBS' Lesley Visser said something similar.</LD>
<TE>   But Stark, in her third season on ABC's "Monday Night Football,"
chose not to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one man's opinion," she said Thursday. "I was not going
to play into it and give it more life than it deserved."</TE>
<TE>   Stark, instead, has been letting her work do her talking.</TE>
<TE>   Before this week's game between the Oakland Raiders and Denver
Broncos, she picked the right guy to interview -- Jerry Rice -- and
asked all the right questions.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who had touchdown receptions Nos. 200 and 201 in the 34-10
Raider victory, laid out exactly what was going to take place. He
said that the Raiders were going to start fast and take the crowd out
of the game. However, Rice may have chosen a better way to word it
than saying, "We're going to come ... out and take this."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 14, a few days after Rooney made his comments, Stark was
sharp in reporting the Terrell Owens Sharpie incident. She informed
viewers that the person who got the ball Owens autographed with the
Sharpie pen he had in his sock was the financial advisor for both San
Francisco's Owens and Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 16, when a police officer at FedEx Field in Landover,
Md., sprayed some unruly spectators with pepper spray, Stark was
overcome by the fumes when she went over to find out what was going
on.</TE>
<TE>   Her report eased everyone's anxiety because it was initially
feared that it could be some kind of terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   There are two reasons Stark, who turned 29 Monday, is excelling
this season. One is that she is now the only sideline reporter,
giving her more room. Eric Dickerson was not invited back after two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The other reason is the addition of John Madden, who has taken
Stark under his wing. One thing he did was suggest she come to
Saturday practices with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to fly in on Saturday nights," Stark said. "Now I fly in
on Friday nights and go to the Saturday practices with John."</TE>
<TE>   Madden, who never really saw a need for sideline reporters, has
changed his thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very impressed with Melissa's work ethic," he said. "She is
an outstanding reporter with a very inquisitive mind. She also has
the ability to elicit great responses from the people she interviews,
as we saw this week when she spoke with Jerry Rice."</TE>
<TE>   NFL Ratings</TE>
<TE>   Although Monday night's game was decided by 24 points and the
season average is 16 points, ABC's "Monday Night Football" national
average rating for the season is up 3%, from an 11.3 at this juncture
last year to an 11.6 this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders' lopsided victory, which had been promoted as ABC's
500th Monday night game, got a 12.4 Nielsen rating and drew 19.6
million viewers, the largest audience since the opening game in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' NFL average national rating is up 4%, 9.0 to 9.4, and Fox's
is up 3%, 9.8 to 10.1.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, "Monday Night Football" is up 2%, 12.6 to 12.8;
Fox is up 7%, 8.2 to 8.8, and CBS is even at 7.4.</TE>
<TE>   Sunny Outlook</TE>
<TE>   Keith Jackson learned this week that he and Dan Fouts will be
calling the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl, this season's bowl championship
series national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, not one to get excited about anything, said, "It just
means I drive to Phoenix rather than driving to the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix is a considerably longer drive from Jackson's home in
Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, but it has better golf weather," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he's planning to return next season.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Musburger and Gary Danielson were supposed to work the
Fiesta Bowl -- it was their turn -- but ABC brass decided those two
instead will work the Rose Bowl and then a Jan. 4 NFL wild-card
playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Ticket Update</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations for the NFL Sunday Ticket are continuing. The
consensus is still that DirecTV will end up with an exclusive deal,
even though the company and the NFL are far apart on terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that always the case?" said an NFL insider.</TE>
<TE>   The chances of the package ending up on both DirecTV and digital
cable are slim because neither side would be willing to pay enough
for a non-exclusive deal to properly compensate Fox and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., Fox's parent company, raised about $1.3 billion
through a secondary stock offering in its Fox Entertainment Group.
The move could be a signal that Murdoch may be laying groundwork for
a second run at purchasing DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Golf Beat</TE>
<TE>   ABC will televise the $1.2-million Hyundai Team Matches from the
Golf Links at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point on
Saturday and Sunday. The event features two-person teams from the PGA
Tour, Senior PGA Tour and LPGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The Golf Channel plans to devote 52 hours of worldwide coverage
today through Sunday to the second UBS Warburg Cup, a $3-million,
Ryder Cup-style event sanctioned by the European Seniors Tour that
will feature 12-man teams from the U.S. and the rest of the world.
The event takes place on St. Simons Island, Ga. The team captains are
Arnold Palmer (U.S.) and Gary Player (rest of the world).</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Hubie Brown's move from TNT to coach of the Memphis Grizzlies
caught everyone at Turner Sports by surprise. He hasn't coached in 15
years. He's trying to pull a Dick Vermeil, who went from broadcasting
to Super Bowl champion coach after a 14-year absence. Brown, a studio
contributor early in the season, wasn't scheduled to be a commentator
on a game until January. TNT doesn't have to replace him until then.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's "College GameDay" pregame show Saturday will originate from
a Division I-AA site for the first time in its 10-year history. Chris
Fowler, Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit will be at Franklin Field in
Philadelphia, site of the Harvard-Penn game. A feature on Franklin
Field, which opened in 1895, will be part of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net's Lisa Guerrero has been named one of the country's
100 most influential Hispanics by the Hispanic Business Magazine.
This list of U.S. citizens of Hispanic origin is dominated by
government officials and men. She is the only woman from the sports
world on the list.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Laker fans seem to be accepting of Paul Sunderland in his new role
as the team's full-time play-by-play announcer. But one thing he
should keep in mind is his radio audience.</TE>
<TE>   He needs to give the score, the quarter and time remaining more
often, not just say the Lakers trail or lead by whatever. This is
particularly important when the team is in the East and listeners
aren't sure at what point the game is.</TE>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ARIZONA STATE (7-4)</LD>
<LD>   AT NO. 8 USC (7-2)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 15.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State update: Andrew Walter passed for 477 yards last week
against California -- and lost. Walter has four 400-yard passing
games and a school-record 2,992 yards.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: With 10,622 yards, Palmer needs only 290 to pass
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom as the Pacific 10 Conference career
passing leader. In his last three games, he has 1,113 yards and 13
touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Trojans still have a whiff of the Rose Bowl, but they
must finish the Pac-10 season without another loss -- and hope
Washington State either loses twice or makes it to the Fiesta Bowl to
play for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. But maybe not by as big a margin as predicted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 2 OHIO STATE (11-0)</TE>
<TE>   AT ILLINOIS (4-6)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN GamePlan</TE>
<TE>   Line: Ohio State by 8 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State update: No. 1 in the BCS rankings, and still trying to
wrap up the Big Ten. The Buckeyes have been shaky lately, but star
tailback Maurice Clarett is expected to return to the starting lineup
after playing sparingly the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois update: The Illini were awful early, losing five of their
first six. But they've won three of their last four with an offense
ranked ninth in the nation and first in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: For once, BCS seems simple: Beat Illinois and
Michigan, and Buckeyes can pack for the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Ohio State. Buckeyes might not be the best team in the
country, but they ought to be able to avoid a loss to Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 6 IOWA (10-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT MINNESOTA (7-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Iowa by 10 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa update: An upset of Ohio State by Illinois or Michigan in the
final two weeks sure would make Iowa feel better about its Rose Bowl
chances. But the Hawkeyes first must take care of their final
regular-season game against the Gophers.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota update: The Gophers haven't lost to Iowa at home since
1996, and own a 35-12-1 lead at home in the series. But quarterback
Asad Abdul-Khaliq has been vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The Hawkeyes and quarterback Brad Banks, an outside
Heisman contender, try to make sure if they're closed out of the Rose
Bowl, it's through no fault of their own.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Iowa. But we might never know if this really is the Big
Ten's best team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 7 GEORGIA (9-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 24 AUBURN (7-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update: The Bulldogs can clinch a spot in the Southeastern
Conference title game with a victory. But if they lose a second game
in a row, then Florida can win the SEC East by beating South Carolina
at home Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn update: The Tigers have won three in a row. More trouble:
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution figures over the years Auburn has
cost Georgia seven conference titles and possibly three national
championships with late-season victories over the Bulldogs.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Georgia's season rests on this game: It's time to
clinch.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia. But without much conviction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 10 ALABAMA (8-2)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 14 LOUISIANA STATE (7-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Alabama by 1 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama update: Already on NCAA probation, the Crimson Tide could
face further sanctions after a former high school coach pleaded
guilty to racketeering charges in accepting $150,000 from a booster
to steer Albert Means toward Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   LSU update: People are still talking about the deflected Hail Mary
pass that beat Kentucky as time ran out last week. Coach Nick Saban
is trying to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: LSU's defense, ranked first in the nation, and
Alabama's defense, ranked third, meet in a game with big implications
for SEC West.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Alabama. The story gets more interesting the more the
team on probation wins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEBRASKA (7-4)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 11 KANSAS STATE (8-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Kansas State by 10 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska update:  Since the dire days when Nebraska's streaks of
winning seasons and bowl appearances were on the line, the
Cornhuskers have won two of three.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State update: The defense has given up only 17 points over
the last three weeks. But the Wildcats need to win their last two
games and hope Colorado loses its last two to reach the Big 12 title
game.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Kansas State is playing very well, but it's probably
too late to salvage the Big 12 North title.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Kansas State. Nice story if Nebraska wins, but the
Cornhuskers have done well enough to salvage as much of the season as
they have.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Excitement Building for Raymo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruin safety Jibril Raymo made like Angel closer Troy Percival,
thrusting his arm to the sky in jubilation after UCLA blocked a punt
against California four weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   But Raymo dislocated his shoulder in the process, and his
teammates came up with another comparison.</LD>
<LD>   "They called me 'Gramatica,' " he said.</LD>
<TE>   Any link to Bill Gramatica, the Arizona Cardinal kicker who
injured a knee last season celebrating a field goal, would make most
guys sheepish. But Raymo is one of the most outgoing and upbeat
Bruins. Even though he missed three games because of the injury, he
never became depressed.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened, I learned from it, so I can't be too hard on
myself," he said. "I actually hurt it earlier in the game, and I got
so pumped when we blocked the punt that it came out of the socket."</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult for him to watch road games against Washington
and Arizona from home.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was racing and I was jumping out of my seat," he said.
"I was going crazy watching my team play and not being able to help."</TE>
<TE>   Raymo, a sophomore, will return against USC on Nov. 23. He is a
valuable special-teams performer as well as the first safety off the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reports that the career of former Bruin running back DeShaun
Foster might be in jeopardy because of complications from knee
surgery weighs heavily on the mind of Kelly Skipper, UCLA's offensive
coordinator and running backs coach.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, a Carolina Panther rookie, had surgery to remove torn
cartilage from his left knee a week ago in Birmingham, Ala., and has
missed the entire season. He initially suffered the injury in an
exhibition game. He tried to come back three weeks ago but
encountered more problems.</TE>
<TE>   Skipper was Foster's position coach at UCLA and Skipper's father,
Jim, is a Panther assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad. He had really worked hard and was looking forward
to a good season," Skipper said. "It was a freak injury."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo and coordinators Phil Snow and Skipper were the
only coaches at practice because the others are on the road
recruiting. That left Toledo to become more vocal than usual.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are anxious to go home and I wanted to make sure we
had a good practice," he said. "It's the scout-team guys, the guys
who aren't getting to play in games. They are the hardest to
motivate."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will not practice until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA gave injured receiver Ryan Smith permission to be examined by
Dr. Richard Ferkel, a Van Nuys-based foot and ankle specialist....
Senior tackle Bryce Bohlander has been selected to the Academic
All-District 8 team.</TE>

<HD>Byrd Is Enjoying New Role</HD>

<LD>Sunny Byrd expects to play a lot against Arizona State on Saturday,
though his role will be markedly different than it was last season
against the Sun Devils.</LD>
<LD>   That's fine with Byrd, a 24-year old fullback and special teams
player.</LD>
<LD>   Byrd became the injury-depleted Trojans' tailback last season
after Sultan McCullough suffered a strained abdominal muscle late in
the first quarter against Arizona State at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   Byrd scored on a three-yard touchdown run in the first carry of
his career. He finished with 63 yards in 20 carries as the Trojans
ended a four-game losing streak with a 48-17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd started the Trojans' final six games and finished the season
with 336 yards and four touchdowns in 123 carries.</TE>
<TE>   But with McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie healthy and Justin
Fargas and Hershel Dennis also on the roster, Byrd returned to
fullback this season. He has not carried the ball, but caught two
passes for 15 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We're winning and connected -- that's more important than playing
a lot," Byrd said. "I'm on all the special teams so I'm out there
quite a bit. Every time we score, which lately has been a lot, I go
right back out there on kickoff coverage and get to hit someone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman cornerback Justin Wyatt played almost the entire second
half of the season opener against Auburn when starter Ronald Nunn
suffered a bruised hip.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt's role has been limited since, but that will change on
Saturday when he becomes the first cornerback off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to make sure I'm where I'm supposed to be," Wyatt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman William Buchanon, who started three games before
he was supplanted by junior Marcell Allmond, did not practice all
week because of a neck strain and is listed as doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Mike Williams, who sprained his left ankle against
Stanford, will play against Arizona State.... Coach Pete Carroll said
he was unsure if freshman lineman Fred Matua would play on Saturday.
"He's on the verge of being ready," Carroll said. "If everybody else
looks healthy and it looks like we can make it through, we won't do
it." ... Offensive lineman Lenny Vandermade had surgery for a torn
tendon in his right biceps and redshirt linebacker Lofa Tatupu had
arthroscopic knee surgery Wednesday. Carroll said Tatupu had the
procedure so that he would be ready for practices that will precede a
bowl game.... Tim Salmon and Brad Fullmer of the Angels, Robert Horry
of the Lakers, Pete Vagenas of the Galaxy and Lisa Leslie of the
Sparks will take part in a halftime ceremony honoring Los Angeles'
championship teams.</TE>

<HD>Friends of the Court Are Rivals Tonight</HD>
<DH>Summertime beach volleyball partners Zartman, Lindquist are
on opposite sides of net when UCLA, USC meet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tracy Lindquist and Chrissie Zartman are longtime friends and, during
the summer, frequent beach volleyball partners. But when USC plays
UCLA in volleyball tonight, they'll have opposite goals.</LD>
<LD>   Lindquist's primary job as a setter for second-ranked USC is to
make sure the team's offense is running smoothly.</LD>
<LD>   Over at UCLA, Chrissie Zartman, a defensive specialist, is
responsible for thwarting the plans of opposing offenses.</LD>
<TE>   So far this season, Lindquist and the Trojans have the upper hand.
USC is 21-1 overall and leads the Pacific 10 Conference with a 14-1
mark. UCLA is 15-11, 8-7 and in fourth place in conference.</TE>
<TE>   When the teams met last month, USC won in three games and
Lindquist and Zartman shared a hug outside the dressing rooms at
USC's Lyon Center.</TE>
<TE>   Any personal matchup isn't taken personally.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going against the school," Lindquist said. "It's a UCLA-SC
rivalry. I'm not going up against her. There's more to it than me
playing against Chrissie."</TE>
<TE>   Lindquist, a senior, splits setting duties with junior Toni
Anderson, but USC Coach Mick Haley said she is more valuable than a
typical part-time player. "If I could find a way to have her in all
six rotations, I would," he said. "She's a consummate player. She
plays every point as if it's her last."</TE>
<TE>   Zartman, a sophomore, is a defensive star for the Bruins,
averaging 4.48 digs after averaging 1.86 last season. She had a
career-high 28 digs in a four-game victory over California on Oct. 4
and matched that figure against Washington State on Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski said Zartman's ball-control skills
make her tailor-made for the non-attacking libero position, which
allows a defensive player to remain in a match for extended time
because it does not count toward the number of substitutions in each
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Zartman was a setter and outside hitter when she was Southern
Section Division III co-player of the year for Torrance Bishop
Montgomery High, but she likes her new position because it has led to
more playing time. "[I] can stay in there and get into the groove of
a match," she said. "I feel I can contribute more."</TE>
<TE>   But for all the prestige of playing important roles for a major
college program, there is also the allure of the beach game: Two
people instead of six. A common bond instead of a synchronous unit.
The freedom to do anything and everything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun when we get back outdoors," Lindquist said. "You get to
hit. You're not just secluded to one spot on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Together, Lindquist and Zartman form a successful team -- no
surprise considering volleyball is a tradition in both families.</TE>
<TE>   Charlene "Sharkie" Zartman, Chrissie's mother, played on UCLA's
first national championship team in 1972 and coached El Camino
College to two state community college titles. Chrissie's father,
Pat, was coach of the U.S. women's team in the mid-1970s and was
coach in 1996 for Olympic gold medalists Jackie Silva and Sandra
Pires of Brazil. Older sister Teri played at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's father, Dave, played volleyball, basketball and baseball
at USC. Her sister, Katie, played at the University of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   As youths, Tracy and Chrissie were the best junior beach team in
the U.S. and in 1997 they were the youngest players to earn a AAA
beach rating -- the top rating for an amateur player and roughly the
equivalent of being one notch below professional caliber. Lindquist
was 16, Zartman only 13, and they'd already been partners for years.</TE>
<TE>   A chance meeting between the families brought Zartman and
Lindquist together. They were on different club teams, but their
parents -- not knowing that Lindquist was three years older --
thought they'd make a good beach team.</TE>
<TE>   And right they were. Over the years, they won five AAU Junior
Olympic age-group championships and five USA Junior Volleyball
titles.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Lindquist and Zartman bested 15 other teams to win
the inaugural World University Beach Championships in the French
Antilles. While Lindquist was too old to qualify for the FIVB
under-21 World Beach Volleyball Championships, Zartman teamed with
USC's Keao Burdine to finish second.</TE>
<TE>   On the beach, familiarity is often the winning component.
Lindquist and Zartman usually have the advantage there.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing beach volleyball has a lot to do with knowing where your
partner is going to be on the court and understanding the game,"
Lindquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Zartman: "We always know where each other is. I know that if
I'm in the wrong spot, she's always there to back me up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This Week</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount, which earned its first berth in the NCAA women's
soccer tournament, will play UCLA and USC faces San Diego in
first-round matches at UCLA's Drake Stadium tonight at 6 and 8:30.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions, overlooked in past years despite posting strong
records, finished the regular season 10-6-3 overall and 3-3-1 in the
rugged West Coast Conference. Loyola Marymount finished in a
three-way tie for fourth place as five conference teams made the
64-team field.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (16-3-0) finished the regular season ranked third nationally.
On Oct. 6, the Bruins defeated Loyola Marymount, 3-2, in a
nonconference match.</TE>
<TE>   USC (10-7-3) and San Diego (11-6-3) played to a scoreless tie on
Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-ranked Pepperdine (16-1-2) plays Wisconsin Milwaukee
(11-5-5) today at Marquette University. Second-round matches are
Sunday at 1 p.m.</TE>

<KH>WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW</KH>
<HD>Waves, Trojans Aiming High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he watched the final seconds of his team's first-round loss to
Villanova in the NCAA tournament last March, Pepperdine Coach Mark
Trakh's mind was working ahead.</LD>
<LD>   He would have 10 players back from a 23-8 squad that posted the
school's fifth consecutive 20-win season, won its first West Coast
Conference tournament championship and made its fourth consecutive
appearance in postseason play.</LD>
<LD>   Add an ambitious schedule -- UCLA and USC at home, Connecticut and
Stanford on the road -- that, with a little luck, could get the
program more national exposure.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a chance to be good," Trakh said.</TE>
<TE>   That was before the injury bug that bit Pepperdine last year got
hungry again.</TE>
<TE>   Shot-blocking junior center Shannon Mayberry will miss the season
because of a stress fracture. Senior point guard Damaris Hinojosa is
recovering from a back injury. Sophomore forward Jennifer Lacy, who
could start or come off the bench, is out until January after
undergoing ankle surgery.</TE>
<TE>   So, has Pepperdine missed its shot at greatness?</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily. The 2002-03 Waves have depth and experience.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hinojosa, senior Tamara McDonald and junior Shandrika Lee
are in the backcourt. Fifth-year senior forward Anna Lembke has
recovered from a knee injury. Among the newcomers expected to perform
are junior guard-forward Nicole Funn, a transfer from Oregon State,
and freshman forward Kelsey Ball.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa, the Waves' leading returning scorer with a 13.6-point
average, said last season "was a breakthrough after several years of
underachieving." But she made it clear the disappointment of losing
in the first round has stayed with Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back very hungry," Hinojosa said.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves aren't the only Southland team with high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gobrecht believes she has her best team since taking over at
USC six years ago. Most of the players, who include All-Pacific 10
selections Ebony Hoffman and Aisha Hollans, were inconsistent as
freshmen and sophomores. Now they are juniors eager to return the
Trojans to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We just needed to grow up," Gobrecht said. "There was a lot of
pressure on these young players to carry the load. They're much more
relaxed and much more confident."</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons for USC, coming off a 16-14 season and a
second-round game in the WNIT, to be optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hoffman, who won a gold medal with the USA qualifying team
over host Brazil in July, and Hollans, there is Rachel Woodward, who
made the Pac-10 all-freshman team. Rometra Craig, a junior transfer
from Duke and daughter of former NFL running back Roger Craig, gives
USC another outside threat when she becomes eligible on Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   But then you view the Trojans' schedule, which must have been
scripted by "Survivor" writers. How about consecutive games against
New Mexico, Notre Dame, Pepperdine, Connecticut and Tennessee before
starting conference play? And that doesn't include the preseason
WNIT, where Kansas State and Penn State are potential opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman (14.9 points, 8.9 rebounds) can't wait.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come here to play rootiepoots," she said, using her
personal term for average teams. "Will we win? Time will tell. But
the chemistry is there; you can feel the difference [from last year]
in practice."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is not ready to think about the postseason beyond the
conference tournament. Reaching .500 is a reasonable -- and necessary
-- goal for the Bruins, who have gone 15-43 the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Kathy Olivier isn't under the same level of pressure that
men's Coach Steve Lavin is to win. But there is pressure, especially
with new Athletic Director Dan Guerrero overseeing UCLA sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone who knows basketball knows we have been beat up
the last two years," Olivier said. "Last year, I don't have my
leading scorer, my second-leading scorer and my leading rebounder.
We're not going to win a lot of games that way."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, 9-20 last season, is enhanced by the return of fifth-year
senior Michelle Greco, who averaged 23.6 points in the first five
games before sitting out the rest of the season because of recurring
concussions.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have 10 players returning -- sophomore guard Brianna
Winn transferred -- and welcome a potentially strong freshman class
led by heralded guard Nikki Blue, a high school All-American from
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount must replace Bryn Britton, its all-time leading
scorer. And if the Lions plan to build on last year's 15-13 record,
they will need senior guard-forward Kate Taylor to have an even
bigger output offensively than last season's 13.8 points average.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally ranked Santa Barbara, with 6-8 junior center Lindsay
Taylor and senior guard Jess Hansen -- whose last-second jumper beat
Louisiana Tech in the NCAA tournament -- is heavily favored to run
over the Big West for a seventh straight year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite seven new players, Long Beach State is as well equipped as
any conference challenger Santa Barbara will face. The 49ers have
frontcourt height in 6-5 center Sarah Stout, 6-2 Glory Johnson and
6-3 Jayme Connors.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton and Irvine probably need at least another year to move
into the top half of the Big West. Riverside was a surprise
second-place finisher in the conference but must replace four of its
top six scorers. Northridge, under first-year Coach Tammy Holder, is
trying to recover from a 2-24 season.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Arms Pipeline Flows to Gulf Arabs</HD>
<DH>Bush administration policy for securing allies in the
region ahead of a possible war on Iraq includes facilitating
high-tech weapons sales, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MUSCAT, Oman</DL>
<LD>A strong if silent supporter of the United States for three decades,
the sultan who rules this Persian Gulf nation has become a major
beneficiary of a Bush administration policy to let friendly nations
in the region buy billions of dollars of high-tech American weaponry.</LD>
<LD>   As the U.S. shops for allies willing to assist in its war on
terrorism -- including a possible attack on Iraq -- the
administration is employing a time-honored strategy of using weapons
sales as an inducement, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia -- all countries where the U.S. has military forces -- have
been given approval for major arms purchases. In some cases, the
purchase requests had been stalled for years.</LD>
<TE>   Qatar, where the U.S. bases refueling and transport planes and has
built a command-and-control center for a possible air war against
Iraq, is developing a "shopping list."</TE>
<TE>   As an unspoken quid pro quo, Persian Gulf "host" nations are
expected by most analysts -- and many U.S. officials -- to permit the
American military continued use of bases within their boundaries even
if the U.S. strikes a fellow Arab country such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In Oman, a Kansas-sized nation of 2.5 million people wedged into
the Arabian Peninsula, Sultan Kaboos ibn Said has long allowed the
U.S. to base P-3 surveillance planes and AC-130 gunships at three
airfields. The U.S. Air Force stores tons of gear at bases here,
ready to be immediately sent into a war zone.</TE>
<TE>   One thing the sultan does not do is speak publicly of his long and
close ties to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The sultan's reticence, while more extreme than most, is in
keeping with a general policy among Gulf nations to barely
acknowledge the presence of U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   "The higher the profile of U.S. troops, the easier it is for
domestic Islamic activists, as well as Iran and Iraq, to challenge
local governments by exploiting nationalistic and religious
resentments over what is interpreted by some as foreign
encroachment," said Joseph Moynihan, formerly a Middle East expert at
the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research in Abu Dhabi,
the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has been U.S. policy since the 1991 Persian Gulf War
to help countries in the region upgrade their military, the program
kicked into high gear after the Sept. 11 attacks. A fast-track
process has been established to consider such purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is buying upgraded
radar and advanced missiles. Bush has declared the island nation a
"major non-NATO ally," which will speed further purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait, from which the U.S. could launch a ground offensive
against Iraq, is buying 400 Hellfire missiles and 16 Apache Longbow
attack helicopters. The Apache purchase has been pending since 1994
amid concern in Washington about whether the Kuwaitis needed such
advanced firepower. Now it is expected to be completed around year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   The United Arab Emirates, which allows U.S. warplanes to use its
airfields, is buying 80 Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon jet
fighters to be fitted with electronic gear to jam enemy radar.</TE>
<TE>   Oman is buying 12 Fighting Falcons for its small air force;
laser-guided bombs; Harpoon, Maverick and HARM missiles; and
technology that can turn a "dumb" bomb into a precision-guided
weapon. The deal is expected to top $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Stohl, senior analyst with the Washington-based Center for
Defense Information, which is often critical of military spending,
has warned that "these sales are just the tip of the iceberg. After
the Gulf War, arms sales to the Middle East skyrocketed."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars who study such sales and their impact on regional
conflicts are divided about whether the U.S. policy will increase
stability in the Gulf or make future wars virtually inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Neu, executive director of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for
Peace and Justice at the University of San Diego, said the policy is
shortsighted and makes the U.S. vulnerable to wars in which it could
face an adversary armed with American weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason Iraq has the ability to fight us now is because we
furnished weapons to it to fight Iran in the 1980s," Neu said. "We
need to reward coalition partners, but there are other, more benign
ways to do it: trade partnerships, economic enticements and such
things as educational, cultural and technical exchanges."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Cowhey, dean of the graduate school of international
relations and Pacific studies at UC San Diego, disagrees. Arms sales
give the U.S. more influence over the purchaser's foreign policy
because modern military hardware requires upgrades, repairs and
maintenance, and that means continued contact with the sellers, he
argues.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of international security relations is that benefits
rarely come without risks," Cowhey said. "Of course, one could say
that we should simply encourage regions to abstain from new
armaments. But the problem here is that there are other major
suppliers of military technology" from which Gulf nations could buy.</TE>
<TE>   Sultan Kaboos is known in diplomatic and military planning circles
as one of the United States' strongest and least demanding friends.</TE>
<TE>   After deposing his father in 1970, the sultan launched a slow but
steady modernization drive with U.S. backing aimed at erasing his
father's legacy of isolation and bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Kaboos backed the 1979 Camp David accord between Egypt and Israel,
brokered by President Carter. The sultan has spoken of the need for
rapprochement with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Grateful for his support, the U.S. has an informal agreement to
protect Oman.</TE>
<TE>   With Washington urging Gulf nations to think cooperatively about
security matters and drop their go-it-alone approach, the sultan took
a lead in urging the 1981 formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
He pressed the council to form a joint military unit to help rein in
Iran and Iraq. Oman stares at Iran across the Strait of Hormuz,
through which tankers carrying much of the world's oil must pass.</TE>
<TE>   Although treaties and diplomacy have brought it peace, Oman has
had past conflicts with most of its neighbors and fought a war with
Marxist rebels in a remote province.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about security runs deep in Omani society. The nation
built hundreds of forts to repel invaders from the sea during
centuries of trade wars with European powers.</TE>
<TE>   "The sultan is wise times 1,000," said one Omani when asked about
the purchase of advanced U.S. military hardware. "His majesty knows
that Oman will have security only if we are strong."</TE>
<TE>   But this is also a nation attempting to fund social programs to
avoid political unrest among the poor. Although it is trying to
diversify its economy, Oman is still dependent on its relatively
small reserves of oil and natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   After watching U.S. success in Afghanistan, the Omani shopping
list was clear. Reluctant to increase the size of its 45,000-member
armed forces, it wanted only the best weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a philosophy by his majesty that it is not important the
quantity, but rather the quality that matters," said Abdullah ibn
Shuwain al Hosni, undersecretary in the Ministry of Information. "It
does not matter how many thousands are in your army, but the quality
of those armies."</TE>

<LD>A Mexican drug lord has been cleared in the 1993 slaying of a Roman
Catholic cardinal, a federal judge said.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Humberto Venancio Pineda upheld the ruling of a previous
court, which threw out charges that Benjamin Arellano Felix ordered
the killing of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo due to lack of
evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Posadas Ocampo was killed in May 1993 at Guadalajara's airport.
Investigators concluded that a gang of drug traffickers confused his
luxury car with that of a rival they were trying to ambush.</LD>

<HD>Suspect in Kibbutz Shooting Arrested</HD>

<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- After a three-day manhunt, Israeli troops descended on a
West Bank village Thursday and seized a Palestinian man they accused
of orchestrating an attack on an Israeli kibbutz that left five
people dead, including a mother and her two small sons.</LD>
<LD>   As Israel pressed ahead with large-scale military operations in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed -- one a
teenage stone-thrower in the northern West Bank town of Nablus, the
other a 37-year-old man who Palestinian witnesses said was shot dead
by troops in the town of Rafah, at Gaza's southern tip.</LD>
<LD>   The capture of Mohammed Naifeh, a leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, came after soldiers cornered him in a hide-out in the
village of Shweike, outside the northern West Bank town of Tulkarm.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli human rights activists helped broker Naifeh's surrender
after he called them and said he wanted to give himself up but feared
he would be shot as he emerged.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis took no chances. Naifeh was ordered to strip to his
underwear to prove he was not wearing an explosives belt. Israeli
authorities believe that Naifeh masterminded Sunday night's attack in
Kibbutz Metzer, just across the border from the northern West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Such infiltration attacks have become common in Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza since the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian
fighting more than two years ago, but have been almost unheard of on
collective farms inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Two alleged accomplices of Naifeh also were arrested Thursday, but
the alleged gunman, identified by Israel as 19-year-old Sirhan
Sirhan, remained at large.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has launched a concerted campaign to capture militants it
believes have carried out or planned attacks against Israelis. In
recent days, it has sent large contingents of troops and armor into
the heart of crowded Palestinian cities and refugee camps to pluck
out wanted men.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual incursion deep into Gaza City, the largest in the
Gaza Strip, tanks and troops arrested four Palestinian men before
dawn Thursday, then swiftly withdrew. The four were accused of
manufacturing weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli troops came within a few hundred yards of the home of
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic
group Hamas. The neighborhood is home to many other Hamas leaders as
well. The Israeli push was interpreted as a warning to the radical
group that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government would not
hesitate to send troops into areas that had been largely off limits.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli sweep comes at a time when Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction has been trying -- with mixed
success, according to various Israeli media reports -- to persuade
Hamas to consider abandoning suicide attacks inside Israel. But Fatah
is linked to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which has carried out many
attacks in the latest uprising and claimed responsibility for this
week's kibbutz shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has been saying in recent days that it will maintain a
heavy military presence in Palestinian cities for as long as it deems
necessary to stave off a new wave of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, fighting to maintain the leadership of his conservative
Likud Party in advance of general elections early next year, visited
Israeli troops in Nablus and stressed the open-ended nature of their
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "No limits have been imposed on our operations," he said. "We are
under no pressure, nor has anyone the right to bring any. It is
Israel's full right to defend the lives of its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops have encountered far less resistance in cities such
as Nablus and Jenin than they did during an offensive last spring,
and the casualty toll has been lower.</TE>

<HD>China Names Its New Leaders</HD>
<DH>Hu Jintao inherits Communist Party mantle from Jiang Zemin.
Old guard has allies on nine-man ruling committee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- After months of intense speculation, China made a sweeping
overhaul of its leadership today, replacing an aging crop of
officials with slightly younger ones who will rule a dynamic but
troubled nation beset by unemployment, corruption and political
stagnation.</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Hu Jintao was named general secretary of the
Communist Party, a promotion to the top job that seals his rapid rise
in the world's sole remaining Communist giant. He succeeds the
outgoing party chief, President Jiang Zemin, in the first orderly
transfer of power in the 53-year history of the People's Republic,
one not brought on by death, purge or bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   Hu, 59, will run the world's most populous country together with
eight other men -- the new members of the party's inner sanctum, the
Politburo Standing Committee -- who were unveiled this morning in a
nationally televised ceremony after secret deliberations by the
Communist elite.</LD>
<TE>   It was the Chinese public's first glimpse of the collective of
nine men who will steer their nation through these early years of the
21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Since the summer, rumors had persisted that Jiang, China's No. 1
leader since 1989, would try to hang on to formal power. That
speculation finally ended when Hu and the other newly appointed
standing committee members filed onto the stage in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People before a crowd of reporters and Chinese officials.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, in a Soviet-style political ritual at odds with
China's recent economic and social liberalization, the men were
introduced in descending order of rank: Hu, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao,
Jia Qinglin, Zeng Qinghong, Huang Ju, Wu Guanzheng, Li Changchun and
Luo Gan.</TE>
<TE>   The nine replace the previous seven-member standing committee, a
gerontocracy led by Jiang, 76, and other party stalwarts such as No.
2 leader Li Peng, 74, and Premier Zhu Rongji, 74, No. 3 in the
hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   However, Jiang, Li and Zhu all have allies on the new slate who
can represent their views and safeguard their interests.</TE>
<TE>   With five proteges in the inner circle, Jiang especially is well
positioned to wield influence from behind the scenes, at least in the
near term, before Hu builds up a more solid power base and emerges
into his own. It was also announced today that Jiang will continue to
serve as chairman of the party's powerful Central Military
Commission, which oversees the world's largest standing army. Jiang
is expected to hand over China's presidency to Hu in March.</TE>
<TE>   As the audience applauded, China's new crew of leaders smiled and
waved for the cameras -- some stiffly, some with the look of marathon
winners -- then filed off stage without fielding a single question.</TE>
<TE>   Only Hu, as first among equals, spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "On behalf of the newly elected central leadership, I would like
to thank all the party members for their trust. We must live up to
the trust of all party members and the expectations of all Chinese
people," he said, smiling amiably.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to build unity and continue developing China's
burgeoning market economy -- "socialism with Chinese
characteristics," in the official lingo.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-minute ceremony was the culmination of an aggressive
behind-the-scenes political derby conducted over the last several
months. The final lineup was a heavily guarded secret, partly because
of eleventh-hour dealing and partly to preserve the fiction that the
new leaders were selected after a democratic process involving the
2,114 delegates to the 16th party congress and the 356 members of the
Central Committee who met this week.</TE>
<TE>   Back-Room Democracy</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the outcome was determined through jockeying and
horse-trading among Jiang and other members of the old guard.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hu was anointed years ago for the top job by the late
Deng Xiaoping, his prestige and seniority on the standing committee
will be checked by the ambition and power of the other eight men --
and their patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Jia, Huang, Zeng, Li and Wu Bangguo are all proteges of Jiang.
Zeng, who has a reputation as a wily political operator, is
particularly close to his mentor, having served as the outgoing party
leader's assistant for years.</TE>
<TE>   The wider Politburo, too, contains other Jiang allies, a
significant victory for a man once mocked as a political lightweight.
After Deng plucked Jiang out of relative obscurity to lead China in
the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, many analysts had
predicted that his tenure would be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Jiang's continued influence, China will most likely
stick to the agenda he formulated in conjunction with the other top
leaders. That includes further liberalization of Asia's
fastest-growing economy; good relations with the U.S., the
centerpiece of Jiang's foreign policy; attempts to bring Taiwan,
which China considers a rogue province, back under Beijing's control;
the continued lock on political power by the Communist Party; and an
effort to broaden the party's appeal by allowing its former enemies,
private business owners, to join.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't anticipate fundamental departures from Hu Jintao, or
anyone else for that matter," said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese
politics at the University of Chicago. "The ideological spectrum
among the elite is much narrower now. These people are not that
divergent or different from each other in their goals."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of recruiting entrepreneurs into the fold, one of Jiang's
pet ideas, was written into the party charter Thursday by the
congress. The party inspired by Karl Marx and Mao Tse-tung, once
radically committed to empowering peasants and workers, now
represents China's "advanced productive forces," including avowed
capitalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Private entrepreneurs are an important force in China's economic
construction," said Jiang Xipei, a delegate to the party congress and
head of Far East Group, one of southern Jiangsu province's largest
private companies. The firm, specializing in electric cables, cleared
$242 million in sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese Communist Party is a party that changes with the
times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the evolution of the 66-million-member organization is
evident in the biographies of the new top nine leaders.</TE>
<TE>   No Workers at Top</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in Communist Chinese history, not one of the
inner circle is a farmer or worker, although some of the men come
from humble backgrounds. Among those retiring with Jiang is No. 4
leader Li Ruihuan, a carpenter who helped build Mao's imposing
mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. Li's departure severs the leadership's
last direct link with the party's peasant and proletarian roots.</TE>
<TE>   His exit from the scene was another victory for Jiang. At 68, the
reform-minded Li, one of Jiang's key rivals and considered by many
the most liberal of the old leaders, was technically not bound to
step down according to the informal cutoff age of 70 for standing
committee membership. Observers say Li was either ousted through
Jiang's maneuvering or finally consented to leave because Jiang had
agreed to step down as well.</TE>
<TE>   The new lineup consists entirely of technocrats, starting with Hu,
a hydroelectric engineer. They will need to bring all their
problem-solving abilities to bear on the host of challenges facing
China as it tries to catch up with the developed world.</TE>
<TE>   China's astonishing economic development of the last two decades
has brought unprecedented prosperity to a significant portion of
society, especially urbanites who lead increasingly sophisticated,
consumer-oriented lives.</TE>
<TE>   But millions of state workers and peasant farmers have been left
behind in the rush to riches. Labor unrest by laid-off workers and
protests by overtaxed farmers in the vast Chinese countryside are
common.</TE>
<TE>   China's entry last year into the World Trade Organization is
expected to deepen its market-oriented reforms but is also liable to
throw even more people out of work as unprotected state enterprises
go belly up.</TE>
<TE>   The new regime must also deal with a looming crisis over unpaid
bank loans, outstanding pensions and rising public debt.</TE>
<TE>   And it has to rein in the rampant corruption that has done more
than anything else to undermine faith in the Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   At this week's congress, Jiang made a point of calling for clean
government and better-quality cadres. But he unveiled no reforms that
would make China's rulers more accountable to the country's 1.3
billion people.</TE>
<TE>   As the new leader, Hu will be a lightning rod for these concerns
and will have to reconcile such demands with the political interests
and ambitions of his colleagues and rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "He apparently is very good in terms of coordinating and
interacting with colleagues. That will be to his advantage," said
Yang of the University of Chicago. "He's younger; he'll be very
hands-on in terms of the policy agenda."</TE>
<TE>   The semi-generational shift at the pinnacle of Chinese politics
was reflected in the party's newly named elite Central Committee. The
average age of its 356 members is about 55, according to the New
China News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The party's military commission, too, has jettisoned members over
70, with the notable exception of Jiang.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Probes Claims of Violence Against Afghan Witnesses</HD>
<DH>Reports of torture and killings are tied to case of dead
Taliban fighters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The United Nations said Thursday that it is looking into claims of
torture and execution of witnesses to the deaths last year of as many
as 1,000 Taliban fighters whose bodies have reportedly been found in
a mass grave.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N., which is running an assistance program in this
devastated country, also condemned the shooting deaths by police of
two students in a protest this week at Kabul University. The deaths
were "in no way justified by self-defense or public safety concerns,"
it said.</LD>
<LD>   At a briefing, U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said that
a United Nations agency had received credible reports of war crimes
in Dasht-i-Leili committed by forces commanded by Uzbek Gen. Abdul
Rashid Dostum. The fighters, who reportedly suffocated after being
piled into shipping containers when the Taliban government fell late
last year, were buried in a mass grave near Dostum's base in
Sheberghan in northern Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Dostum has acknowledged that about 200 Taliban fighters may have
died while being transported to a prison but contends that most were
sick or badly wounded in fighting.</TE>
<TE>   De Almeida e Silva said that the U.N. had raised its concerns to
Dostum about witness intimidation and persecution and that the
warlord had pledged to cooperate in the review.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in the north have urged the U.N. to also investigate
mass graves of those reportedly killed by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. had initiated an investigation into the mass graves in
April and concluded that a full-scale review was needed. But De
Almeida e Silva said further reviews were difficult without a
witness-protection program. He noted the lack of security in a "weak
state, with weak institutions that can't enforce law and order."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. also urged Afghan authorities to launch an investigation
into the shootings at the university and "take appropriate sanctions
against those responsible." In addition to the deaths, about 15
students were injured.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that the demonstrations have taken place against the
background of the very difficult conditions prevailing at Kabul
University today," the U.N.'s statement said, referring to lack of
power and water and delays in food distribution that prompted the
student protest. "We trust that student grievances can be addressed
through dialogue between the students, the government and academic
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Said De Almeida e Silva: "There is a lot to be learned by police
about training, discipline and equipment."</TE>

<HD>Hu Took a Rural Path to Summit of Chinese Power</HD>
<DH>The onetime engineer, who emphasizes his family's storied
roots, built his political career in the nation's poor inland
regions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAKENGKOU VILLAGE, China</DL>
<LD>DAKENGKOU VILLAGE, China -- The most famous descendant of the Hu
family has never visited the hall his ancestors built during the Ming
Dynasty. But Fang Min has high hopes that the new leader of the
world's most populous country will come home soon.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe the timing hasn't been right, but he'll visit us after he
becomes emperor," said Fang, a staffer at the hall's entrance.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese consider hometowns and family origins important in
explaining someone's personality and potential. Throughout much of
the last decade, Hu Jintao has been an unknown, but to villagers here
in Jixi county, Hu's ascent to the post of Communist Party general
secretary is a tribute to his political skills and his interesting
family background.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Shanghai, the 59-year-old vice president prefers to
emphasize his family's roots in this rural corner of Anhui province,
less than an hour's flight from China's most cosmopolitan city. He
rarely draws attention to his urban connection and has always written
under family origins, Jixi Ren -- man from Jixi.</TE>
<TE>   Jixi county is tucked into the foot of the famous Yellow Mountains
in a region traditionally known as Huizhou. Its elegant and ornate
architecture was the backdrop for the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon."</TE>
<TE>   The area has long been a cradle for ambitious scholars seeking
their fortune in Beijing's imperial courts. The dream of ascending
the dragon throne too ran in the Hu family blood.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 years ago, ancestor Hu Zongxian fought Japanese pirates
who terrorized the Chinese coast. It pleased the emperor so much that
he promoted him all the way up to defense minister.</TE>
<TE>   When Hu Zongxian built the family's ancestral hall, he chose a
spot surrounded by mountains to symbolize a person sitting on a
dragon's chair. But in Chinese culture, only the emperor has that
right.</TE>
<TE>   Hu Zongxian displayed even more audacity by carving nine dragons
on the door's wooden pillar, albeit facing the inside courtyard for
the viewing pleasure of fellow clan members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually 8 1/2 dragons," said a guide here. "The ninth one
is smaller than the rest, because only the emperor could display nine
dragons."</TE>
<TE>   Hu Zongxian's flagrant ambition eventually led to a humiliating
death by the hands of a jealous rival.</TE>
<TE>   Another emperor later rehabilitated the former hero. But the moral
of the story lived on: Practice discretion to avoid political
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Hu Jintao did during his muted but meteoric
rise from engineer to the inner sanctum of the Chinese Communist
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Hu remained so low-key that few Chinese know much about this
well-hidden dragon. But a careful reading of his resume reveals a
shrewd politician's cautious and calculated ascent.</TE>
<TE>   His predecessors, Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping, had
revolutionary credentials as China's founding fathers to legitimize
their rule. President Jiang Zemin's power base comes from urban
Shanghai, China's financial capital.</TE>
<TE>   Educated in Beijing, Hu stayed away from the comfort of the big
cities. Instead, he devoted most of his political career to the
poorest regions of inland China. That experience set him apart from
members of Beijing's infamous Shanghai gang, who rose almost
exclusively through the ranks of that wealthy coastal city. By
choosing the inland path, Hu avoided becoming the target of
resentment from cadres concerned about an unfair coastal-inland
divide.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed them that he was willing to take the hard jobs, to be
tested, to show devotion and loyalty to the party," said Cheng Li, a
China expert at Hamilton College in New York state. "This can be a
model to other mainland leaders, especially those who are not
princelings."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of three children, Hu grew up in coastal Jiangsu
province's Taizhou county, where his great-grandparents ran a
prosperous tea business. By the time his schoolteacher father moved
there in the 1940s from Shanghai to take over the family store, it
couldn't even afford hired help.</TE>
<TE>   His father's poor business skills proved to be a blessing. When
the Communist government took over in 1949, it classified the senior
Hu a mere shop owner. Had he been cast as a capitalist, it would have
ruined his son's chances of going to college and joining the
Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   At the prestigious Qinghua University in Beijing, Hu picked
hydroelectric engineering, a career that requires long stints in the
most hardscrabble and far-flung corridors of rural China. He probably
believed the son of a shop owner had more to prove than children of
peasants or factory workers.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a career-saving move. A decade in the remote
power stations of Gansu province shielded him from the life-and-death
struggles of the Cultural Revolution, which destroyed the lives of
many. It was also in this dirt poor remote province that he married
his college sweetheart and fellow hydroelectric power major, Liu
Yongqing. They have a son and a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The other important person in his life during that time was Song
Ping, a party elder and Qinghua alumnus. Song saw in Hu the potential
to make an even better politician.</TE>
<TE>   Song helped him return to Beijing, where he established a
beachhead as the youngest chief of the Communist Youth League. Then
Hu returned to cut his political teeth in the Chinese heartland,
first in Guizhou province, then in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Again, impeccable timing enabled him to escape the tumult of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.</TE>
<TE>   As party boss in Tibet at the time, Hu impressed Deng with his
clean and decisive crackdown on pro-independence demonstrators there.
It earned him a spot in 1992 as the youngest member of the powerful
seven-person Politburo Standing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hu has taken his most important step in fulfilling his
ancestor's forsaken dream. But although he has become the youngest
general secretary of the Communist Party, Hu still has to wait for
Jiang to relinquish control of the military and the presidency to
cement his hold on power.</TE>
<TE>   The people in his ancestral village believe he will prevail by
keeping his eye on the prize and checking his real ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "Hu makes a good figurehead," said one villager who didn't want to
give his name. "He is nice and moderate, good for maintaining
stability. Someone too strong will be smashed down."</TE>

<LD>   "After Iraq's positive stance, the Security Council members --
especially Russia, France and China -- should be aware that our
problem and crisis with the United States is not over yet and may
have just started," Babel said in a front-page editorial.</LD>
<TE>   France, China and Russia, along with the U.S. and Britain, are
veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council. In the past,
France, China and Russia have differed with the United States on how
best to deal with Baghdad. If Iraq fails to fully cooperate with
inspectors, the U.S. and Britain have made it clear they will attack
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Babel urged Paris, Beijing and Moscow to differentiate between
Iraq, "which adopts a policy of peace, and a country [the United
States] that adopts a cowboy policy."</TE>
<TE>   "Our problem and crisis with the United States is not over yet and
may have just begun," the paper said, adding that Baghdad's
acceptance of the "unjust resolution shows Iraq's good intentions and
reaffirmed that the country is clear of weapons of mass destruction."</TE>

<LD>A fugitive Mafia boss facing more than 30 years in prison for murder
surrendered Thursday, saying he was inspired by Pope John Paul II's
historic speech to Italy's Parliament, the suspect's lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Benedetto Marciante was particularly taken by the pope's comments
on family values, lawyer Roberto Tricoli said. Marciante surrendered
at a Rome prison.</LD>
<LD>   "In 30 years of practice, I've never experienced anything like
this," Tricoli said from his office in Palermo, Sicily. "It's a
miracle."</LD>
<TE>   Tricoli quoted his client as saying the pope's comments, broadcast
live on state television, awakened his own religious beliefs despite
the "adversity" facing him.</TE>
<TE>   "He decided spontaneously," Tricoli said.</TE>
<TE>   Marciante, 50, was convicted in absentia in September of Mafia
association and murder, Tricoli said. Lawyers are appealing the
30-year sentence for murder, but a seven-year sentence for Mafia
association has been upheld.</TE>

<HD>Poor Philippine Muslims See 'Rebel' as a Good Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KASANANGAN, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Abdul Mohammed Katar picked up a rifle and joined the rebels when he
was 15. He says he had little choice because economic prospects for
young Muslim men in the Asian nation with the most Christians are so
bleak that the best job offers often came from the guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   Much the same thinking led him to switch sides when a peace
agreement with the government opened the door for some former rebels
to join the Philippine army. Katar jumped at the opportunity, which
he said didn't feel so much like a betrayal as doing the right thing
for his family.</LD>
<LD>   "Most Muslims are discriminated against and they can't find work,"
said Katar, 28, a sniper who admits killing former comrades in his
new role as army sergeant. "I feel good because now I have enough
money to support my family and I can send my children to school."</LD>
<TE>   About one in 10 rebels has joined government forces, but that
still leaves tens of thousands of Muslim guerrillas, said Henry
Pungutan, 32, a former rebel and current army sharpshooter.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my comrades are still up in the mountains; some of them
have joined the Abu Sayyaf," he said, referring to a militant group
linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its relatively small Muslim population, the Philippines
increasingly has become an important front in the global war against
terror. Soon after a car packed with explosives killed 191 people in
Bali last month, a spate of bombings racked Manila, the capital, and
the southern island of Mindanao, where most of the country's Muslims
live among a population that is predominantly Roman Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   But the front is wider than domestic issues. Many of Al Qaeda's
recent plots, including the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., have been
traced back to terrorists who lived or worked in the Philippines.
Since the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan last year,
radical Muslims with suspected ties to Bin Laden are believed to be
moving their jihad to Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Radicals hope "to establish a fundamentalist Islamic republic
comprised of several countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia,
Singapore and parts of Thailand and Mindanao," said congressman
Prospero A. Pichay Jr., chairman of the committee on national
defense. "They want to use the bombings to weaken the resolve of
these governments, to destroy the leadership of these governments and
to incite the Muslim communities to take up arms against these
republics."</TE>
<TE>   A Breeding Ground</TE>
<TE>   Steeped in a history of uprisings, economic disparity and
political disenfranchisement, this archipelago of some 7,000 islands
has become a fertile breeding ground for foot soldiers fighting a
holy war. In recent years, bombings, kidnappings and battles have not
only claimed lives but turned the Philippines into a country afraid
of itself.</TE>
<TE>   "For an average young Muslim man whose only future, being as ill
equipped and poorly educated as he is, maybe a cargo handler in some
port, joining the Abu Sayyaf is cool," said congresswoman Imee R.
Marcos, daughter of former president Ferdinand E. Marcos. "They give
you Oakley sunglasses, a gun, radio equipment and you belong to a
brotherhood. If you die, they believe you end up in the garden of
earthly delights, so what's the problem?"</TE>
<TE>   President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo repeatedly has denounced poverty
as "the handmaiden of terrorism," but the Philippine government has
been unsuccessful in solving the problem. In this dirt-poor Muslim
area in the southern city of Zamboanga, the consequences of that
failure are seen in broken shanties and battered lives. Village
elders say as many as 90% of residents are unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 14 children and 33 grandchildren," said 82-year-old Alpa
Muallil At-Haj. "Only four of them have jobs, and they are living
abroad."</TE>
<TE>   All work is hard to come by, but Muslims say Christians are
preferred candidates regardless of qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is a licensed engineer, but when the employers look at his
resume and see that he is Muslim, they just tell him to come back
later," said a 52-year-old former guerrilla who did not want to give
his name. "Two years later he still hasn't found anything, while less
deserving Christians managed to land jobs."</TE>
<TE>   It is a situation repeated in Islamic communities across the
country, say Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why they join the rebels," said Shariff Jullabi, a former
senior commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the country's
biggest armed Muslim organization. It considers itself moderate
compared with the Abu Sayyaf, a radical splinter group known more for
its banditry than its philosophy. Although Jullabi broke with the
MILF this summer to lead his own splinter group, he still boasts of
an army of "100,000 moujahedeen."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to recruit them, they recruit themselves," Jullabi
said from his hide-out in Zamboanga.</TE>
<TE>   Officials don't buy that.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a poor country, we have to admit that," said Gen. Narciso
Abaya in Zamboanga, who assumed his post as southern command chief on
the day of a department store bombing in April. "But being poor
doesn't mean you can violate the law. There are countries poorer than
us and they do not do terrorist activities, so what kind of
justification is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials argue that they have devoted financial resources to
fight poverty in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao -- which
Manila set up in the mid-1990s to appease Muslim militants demanding
a separate state in the south -- but Muslim leaders there apparently
failed to take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We put in so many millions of dollars for economic development
projects, but it went to waste because of corruption and
mismanagement," Abaya said.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder, authorities say, foreign militants have stepped up
their recruiting in these poor Muslim neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda Ties Denied</TE>
<TE>   Just up a dusty dirt path from Kasanangan village is the shuttered
two-story building that once housed a charity organization run by
Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Bin Laden. Officials
suspect Khalifa used the International Islamic Relief Organization as
a front to supply money to Philippine rebels and build terrorist
networks.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the indigenous groups are believed to be merging their
own causes with those of the global terrorist campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Abu Sayyaf kidnapped people in March 2000, their initial
demand was for the release of the [1993] World Trade Center bombing
mastermind, Ramzi Yousef," Abaya said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, however, insist they have nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
"We are not connected to the terrorist activities in the other parts
of the world," said Jullabi. "Our objective is the regaining of our
homeland."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Philippine officials say they are fighting a
two-pronged war.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever is the category of these groups, whether it's Al Qaeda
or a franchise of Al Qaeda, we have to fight it," said Sen. Rodolfo
G. Biazon. "But the solution may not just be military. We need to
address the economic, social injustice and political roots of the
problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine Muslims, known as Moros -- derived from the Spanish
for "Moor" -- make up only about 5% of a country of 80 million. They
bear a proud tradition as descendants of the Royal Sultanate of Sulu,
an Islamic kingdom that ruled the seas long before the arrival of the
Spanish conquistadors.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not consider ourselves Filipinos," Jullabi said. "Filipinos
are those who surrendered to the Spaniards. We never surrendered."</TE>
<TE>   The Moros have a long-standing culture of fierce resistance. At
the turn of the last century, American colonial forces subdued the
rest of the Philippines but failed to conquer the Muslim south. The
adoption of the more powerful .45-caliber automatic was hastened by
the army's desire to defeat the Moros.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how impoverished and degraded, the Filipino Muslims kept
on fighting, against the Spanish, the Americans and now Manila.
Despite periods of peace and the creation of the autonomous region,
life has improved little, fueling fears that splinter rebel groups
are more likely to join forces with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems in Mindanao haven't ended," Marcos said.
"Unfortunately we are going to see a lot more violence."</TE>

<HD>Some Consider Firing on Aircraft as Cause for War</HD>
<DH>Differing views of Iraq's actions in 'no-fly' zones may be
the first crack in unity shown at the U.N.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Less than a week after the unanimous approval of a U.N. resolution on
disarming Iraq, Washington already faces conflict with other Security
Council members -- and within the Bush administration itself -- over
the interpretation of what should trigger an attack on the country.</LD>
<LD>   Although U.S. officials pledged last week that Resolution 1441
contained no "hidden triggers" for military action, hawks in the
National Security Council and the Pentagon have been arguing that the
bar for war with Baghdad should be lowered -- and Iraq's "no-fly"
zones are a key point of dispute.</LD>
<LD>   If Iraqi forces continue their routine shooting at U.S. and
British aircraft patrolling the zones in the north and south of the
country, or if Baghdad leaves something off the list of
weapons-related materiel it is supposed to deliver by Dec. 8, they
argue, that should be enough to ask the Security Council to consider
Iraq in "material breach" of the resolution -- a prelude to military
action. Even Iraq's bombastic letter Wednesday accepting the terms
for weapons inspectors has drawn U.S. fire.</LD>
<TE>   But that's not what the rest of the council has in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. does seem ... to have a lower threshold than others may
have" to justify war, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday in Washington before meeting with President Bush. "I think
the discussions in the council made it clear we should be looking for
something serious and meaningful, and not for excuses to do
something."</TE>
<TE>   In the eight weeks of hard-fought negotiations over the
resolution, the U.S. reassured the other council members that it
didn't intend to pounce on the slightest infraction of the resolution
but would consider a pattern of obstruction and obfuscation to be
cause for action.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, diplomats dickered for two days to substitute an "and"
for an "or" in the text to ensure that a simple omission from Iraq's
weapons declaration would not be considered a breach.</TE>
<TE>   After the resolution passed, France, China and Russia circulated a
document reaffirming the U.S. statement that the resolution did not
grant the automatic use of force.</TE>
<TE>   But on the same day, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and
other U.S. officials said they regarded Iraq's targeting of U.S. and
British aircraft, which have been patrolling the no-fly zones for
more than a decade, to be a violation of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Those officials were deliberately vague on whether such attacks
should be considered an action-provoking breach.</TE>
<TE>   "That's for the United Nations and the president of the United
States to make judgments like that," Rumsfeld said last Friday. "At
what point does Saddam Hussein's behavior reflect compliance and
cooperation, and at what point does it reflect something other than
that?"</TE>
<TE>   A council diplomat from a country that supported the U.S.
throughout the U.N. negotiations said of the saber rattling: "That's
not what the Security Council thought this was about. It's about
disarmament, not about no-fly zones."</TE>
<TE>   Even Britain, the U.S.' partner in patrolling the zones, doesn't
interpret shooting at the aircraft as a trigger in itself, but only
an element of an overall picture of noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis consider the zones an infringement on their sovereignty
and regularly try to shoot down the patrol planes.</TE>
<TE>   Since last Friday's vote, the issue of the no-fly zones has been
debated intensely even within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Some hard-liners argue that Iraq's belligerent letter confirming
its grudging acceptance of the resolution should be considered a
material breach, U.S. officials said, because it claimed that Iraq
has no weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Even Secretary of State Colin L. Powell -- the U.S. leader
perceived to be holding the U.N. line -- let it stretch a bit when he
hinted that firing on coalition planes might be a serious enough
violation of the resolution to warrant action.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to take hostile acts against the United States or
United Kingdom aircraft patrolling in the northern and [southern]
no-fly zone, then I think we would have to look at that with great
seriousness if they continue to do that," Powell said Thursday after
a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham in Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   As the hard-line bluster emerges from the White House, other U.S.
officials are quietly reeling the arguments back in.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be an omission and cheating on inspections," a U.S.
diplomat close to the negotiation of the resolution said. "Not one or
the other." Another official said the administration isn't on the
same page about how hard to press the no-fly zone issue.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting mixed messages are distressing those who signed on
to the U.S.-backed resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that there is a segment of the administration that is
absolutely trigger-happy," said another council diplomat who
requested anonymity. "We believed the U.S. assurances that they would
wait for a substantive breach, and we must hope that calmer minds
prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Washington may be pushing for early action to avoid being drawn
into a long process of inspections. If Iraq complies with the
resolution -- as it has grudgingly done so far -- the search for arms
could go on indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has claimed that it has no weapons of mass destruction, and
though Washington expects Baghdad to trip itself up by Dec. 8, when
it must catalog any weapons-related materiel, Iraq might somehow seem
to comply. It could list chemicals and biological agents as dual-use
goods used in agricultural or petrochemical sectors, or claim that
previously held items were destroyed in the last four years, when
inspectors weren't allowed in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   And it will probably offer reams of documentation that will take
weeks to go through.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Washington has offered the inspection teams a hit
list of 100 key sites that should be checked carefully, probably
including a sensitive site such as one of Hussein's presidential
compounds, to test Iraq's cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The key point that may emerge as an early tripwire is a single
line in the resolution that says, "Iraq shall not take or threaten
hostile acts" against any personnel of a U.N. member state "taking
action to uphold any council resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the administration interpret that to require Iraq to stop
its frequent firings on U.S. and British aircraft enforcing the
no-fly zones.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., Britain and France instituted the zones in 1991 and '92
after the Persian Gulf War ended so they could safely deliver aid to
ethnic Kurds in the north and protect Shiite Muslims in the south.
They have argued that the flights were helping uphold a 1991 U.N.
resolution designed to keep Iraq from repressing its minorities and a
1994 resolution halting Hussein's military buildup in southern Iraq.
The French later dropped out of the patrols.</TE>
<TE>   That reasoning isn't universally accepted, however, because the
patrols aren't explicitly mandated by the Security Council.</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Exiled opposition groups failed Thursday for a third time to organize
a meeting to discuss their possible role in toppling Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   A meeting planned for next week in Brussels was canceled after the
six Iraqi opposition groups recognized by the United States disagreed
on the gathering's composition, agenda and whether it could be held
in time.</LD>
<LD>   Radio Free Iraq, funded by the U.S., said the meeting was
"postponed until further notice."</LD>
<TE>   The six groups have refused to work together in the past. A major
obstacle this time reportedly was a demand by Ahmad Chalabi, leader
of the Iraqi National Congress, to enlarge the conference by about
300 INC members, trying to bring more of his supporters to the
gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Kanan Makiya, another key dissident and a Chalabi ally, had
written the U.S. State Department asking it to intervene to stop the
conference, which he said would have excluded liberal-minded,
independent dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has urged Iraqi opposition groups to develop plans for
governing their nation if Hussein is overthrown.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition is split along sectarian, ethnic, clan and
political lines.</TE>

<LD>Philippine police have captured a leader of a militant Muslim group
who was preparing to use truck bombs to attack the stock exchange,
shopping malls and foreign embassies in Manila, the government said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Abdulmukim Edris, the alleged head of the Abu Sayyaf group's
explosives team, has been accused in at least four bombings last
month in the southern city of Zamboanga that killed 12 people,
including a U.S. Green Beret.</LD>
<LD>   Edris was captured Tuesday in the Manila suburb of Pasay, military
Chief of Staff Gen. Benjamin Defensor said.</LD>
<TE>   Edris reportedly told police his team planned to use trucks loaded
with containers of ammonium nitrate and activated by cell phone to
bomb targets in Manila beginning this month.</TE>
<TE>   Edris received training making car bombs from two Yemenis he

<HD>Pope Urges Italians to Increase Birthrate</HD>
<DH>In first papal speech to Parliament, John Paul II says
state should ease the raising of children. He calls on the EU to
embrace religious roots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Maria De Cristofaro</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>ROME -- In the first papal speech to Italy's Parliament, Pope John
Paul II on Thursday urged Italians to have more babies, and called on
an expanding European Union not to forget its religious roots.</LD>
<LD>   Given in the building that housed the papacy's law courts until
the mid-19th century, the speech also was a milestone symbolizing
full reconciliation between the Vatican and the Italian state, which
have a long history of strained relations.</LD>
<LD>   The speech was interrupted by applause nearly two dozen times. The
lawmakers gave a standing ovation at its end, with some shouting,
"Evviva il papa!"</LD>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, described Italy's low birthrate and the aging of
its society as a "grave threat." The government should "make the task
of having children and bringing them up less burdensome both socially
and economically," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world and one of the
oldest populations. Italian women on average have 1.23 children,
compared with a U.S. average of about 2.1.</TE>
<TE>   Touching on a controversy over whether religion and God should be
mentioned in a new European Union constitution, the pontiff declared:
"It is my hope that ... the new foundations of the European 'common
house' will not lack the 'cement' of that extraordinary religious,
cultural and civil patrimony which has given Europe its greatness
down the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a need to guard against a vision of the continent which
would only take into account its economic and political aspects, or
which would uncritically yield to lifestyles inspired by a
consumerism indifferent to spiritual values," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In this noble Assembly I would like to renew the appeal which in
recent years I have made to the various peoples of the continent:
'Europe, at the beginning of the new millennium, open once again your
doors to Christ!' "</TE>
<TE>   Popes long held secular power in much of Italy, losing control of
the Papal States in 1860 and Rome itself 10 years later, when troops
of King Victor Emmanuel II took the city. In 1929, Italy and the
Vatican, left in control of just 108 acres of land, signed a treaty
recognizing both as sovereign entities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, John Paul said, the "sometimes turbulent" association
between the Holy See and the Italian state has had positive results.</TE>
<TE>   "We can well say that Italy's social and cultural identity, and
the civilizing mission it has exercised and continues to exercise in
Europe and the world, would be most difficult to understand without
reference to Christianity, its lifeblood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pontiff also called on authorities to show compassion to
prison inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "Without prejudice to the need to guarantee the security of
citizens, attention needs to be given to the prison situation, where
inmates often live in conditions of appalling overcrowding," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A gesture of clemency toward prisoners through a reduction of
their sentences would be clear evidence of a sensitivity" that would
also aid their rehabilitation and reentry into society, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pope has frequently stressed the need to treat inmates with
dignity and respect. During the church's jubilee celebrations in
2000, he made a call for global clemency.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul also called on the world's religions to do more to
promote peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Tragically, our hopes for peace are brutally contradicted by the
flaring up of chronic conflicts, beginning with the one which has
caused so much bloodshed in the Holy Land," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is also international terrorism, which has taken on a new
and fearful dimension, involving in a completely distorted way the
great religions.</TE>
<TE>   "Precisely for this reason, the world's religions are challenged
to show all their rich potential for peace by directing and, as it
were, 'converting' toward mutual understanding the cultures and
civilizations which draw inspiration from them."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Still Used as 'Shields,' Group Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An Israeli human rights group asserted Thursday that the Israeli army
continues to use unwilling Palestinian civilians as "human shields"
during military operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite
having pledged that the practice would stop while the country's
highest court weighs the matter.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of human rights petitioners went to Israel's Supreme
Court in August and won a temporary injunction barring the army from
ordering Palestinian civilians to carry out such tasks as knocking on
suspicious doors, delivering surrender ultimatums to wanted militants
or serving as advance scouts for Israeli soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   Israel calls it the "neighbor procedure" -- referring to the fact
that most of the civilians who are used happen to live near the scene
of a confrontation between the army and Palestinian militants.</LD>
<TE>   In a 20-page report, the human rights group B'Tselem said that in
the wake of the court ruling, the army has continued to compel
civilians to perform what can be dangerous duties on troops' behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recent cases it cited was that of a Palestinian
municipal worker in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, 39-year-old
Khaled Kamil. He told the group that before dawn Saturday, he was
forced to approach the home of Iyad Sawalha, a fugitive Islamic Jihad
leader, and call out to him to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Sawalha, whom Israel held responsible for a pair of bus bombings
that killed 31 Israelis, died in a subsequent exchange of gunfire
with troops.</TE>
<TE>   Kamil, a father of three, told the group he assisted the soldiers
only because he was forced to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Israeli] commander swore at me, threatened to destroy my
home, saying: 'Do you want your house destroyed? Do you want to live
in a tent? We'll demolish your house,' " the report quoted him as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said that after the Supreme Court injunction,
troops operating in the Palestinian territories were issued
"unequivocal instructions" telling them that the practice was banned.</TE>
<TE>   "Soldiers are strictly prohibited from employing civilians as
hostages, 'human shields' or in any way that would endanger their
lives," the army said in a statement, adding that it was "fully aware
of the importance of this issue."</TE>
<TE>   The military declined to comment on specific cases cited in the
B'Tselem report but said they were among about 30 alleged violations
that are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court case was prompted by the death in August of a
Palestinian teenager, Nidal abu Muhsein, who was ordered by troops in
the West Bank village of Tubas to knock on the door of a house where
a wanted Hamas leader, Nasser Jerar, was holed up.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old obeyed. As he approached the house, he fell dead
in a hail of bullets.</TE>
<TE>   It was never clearly established which side started the shooting.
The army blamed the Hamas fugitive, who was then shot dead by
soldiers, for firing the fatal shots.</TE>
<TE>   In past interviews regarding the practice, the army has argued
that civilians who are used to "help out" soldiers are not human
shields under the usual definition, because they are not deliberately
placed in harm's way. Army officers have said that under certain
circumstances, use of Palestinian neighbors to deliver messages to
gunmen can defuse a volatile situation and thus save both Palestinian
and Israeli lives.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers have previously provided human rights groups with
testimony describing the practice as well entrenched during 25 months
of bloody fighting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
Hebrew-language term for the tactic -- nohal shachen -- carries, in
military jargon, the connotation of a standing order.</TE>
<TE>   B'Tselem said that in the three months since the Supreme Court
injunction, there has been a "marked decrease" in the number of cases
in which soldiers have forced civilians to perform these tasks but
said the practice hasn't stopped altogether. It appealed for stronger
measures by the army to bring about a halt.</TE>
<TE>   "The protection of soldiers is a legitimate military
consideration, but it cannot be the sole consideration," the report
said. "Clearly, the civilian population does not have the duty to
protect soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for the Supreme Court to decide whether to
set permanent limits on the practice.</TE>

<HD>Allies Agree With U.S., Suspend Oil for N. Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- In a victory for Bush administration hard-liners, key
allies agreed Thursday to suspend future fuel oil shipments to North
Korea until it takes "concrete and credible actions" to dismantle its
recently revealed program to develop nuclear weapons using enriched
uranium.</LD>
<LD>   A ship ordered to slow its journey toward North Korea while the
international community decided what to do with the tanker's 47,000
tons of heavy fuel oil will be permitted to deliver its cargo, but
future oil shipments will be suspended beginning in December, the
executive board of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, or KEDO, announced Thursday night after a protracted
internal debate.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to "suspend" shipments represented a concession to
South Korea, which, along with a less-vocal Japan, reportedly opposed
an outright cutoff of fuel aid to North Korea. Those governments,
along with some Bush administration officials, had argued that
punishing North Korea could drive Kim Jong Il's regime to unfreeze
its stockpiles of plutonium and restart efforts to produce nuclear
weapons using it.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea agreed in 1994 to freeze its plutonium program in a
deal with the U.S., Japan, South Korea and the European Union. KEDO
was set up to administer the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision avoided a rift among the KEDO members and
allowed the aid donors to present North Korea with a united front,
which diplomats from the member countries see as crucial.</TE>
<TE>   The statement made it clear that North Korea could not expect to
be rewarded with aid after confessing last month to the secret
program to enrich uranium that could be used in a nuclear device, in
violation of its international commitments. Nor did it accede to
North Korea's key demand: that Washington negotiate with Pyongyang
over the terms under which the North Koreans might be willing to
abandon the program. Both were key U.S. objectives.</TE>
<TE>   The KEDO board's statement condemned the nuclear program as "a
clear and serious violation" of North Korea's commitments that posed
"a shared challenge to all responsible states." It "threatens
regional and international security and undermines the international
nonproliferation regime," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the board said that dialogue between North Korea
and Japan, South Korea and the EU would remain an important channel
for resolving those differences -- pointedly not mentioning the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Future shipments will depend on North Korea's concrete and
credible actions to dismantle completely its highly enriched uranium
program," the statement said. "In this light, other KEDO activities
with North Korea will be reviewed. The executive board will continue
to consult on next steps with regard to future activities of KEDO."</TE>
<TE>   That language presumably refers to the status of two light-water
nuclear power reactors promised to North Korea under the 1994 deal.
Under that agreement, North Korea vowed to freeze its plutonium bomb
program, and the U.S. pledged to fund 20 years of heavy fuel oil
shipments to help the energy-starved North until the reactors, paid
for and built by South Korea, Japan and the European Union, were
finished.</TE>
<TE>   If it were to restart its mothballed plutonium program, experts
believe, North Korea could produce plutonium for about six weapons in
as little as six months.</TE>

<HD>Insurer's Tactics Rebuked</HD>
<DH>A judge has ordered UnumProvident to 'obey the law' and
make disability payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's largest disability insurance firm is facing a flurry of
lawsuits in California and across the country from policyholders who
contend that UnumProvident Corp. cheated them out of their disability
payments in an aggressive campaign to boost profit.</LD>
<LD>   The company's tactics allegedly included spying on customers,
shredding medical records and using biased doctors to justify its
cancellations.</LD>
<LD>   The Chattanooga, Tenn.-based company received a harshly worded
rebuke this week from a San Francisco federal judge, who ordered it
to "obey the law" and stop targeting certain categories of claims for
cancellation, employing biased medical examiners, destroying medical
reports and withholding from policyholders information about their
benefits.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Robert Larson issued the unusual
injunction late Wednesday in a ruling upholding a $7.67-million jury
verdict for a single mother of two who lost her home and went on welfare
after the company cut off her disability benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Citing corporate documents and testimony of current and former
employees and an industry expert, Larson concluded that former
chiropractor Joan Harngarter's case was part of a broader effort to
target expensive claims filed by doctors, lawyers and other
self-employed professionals, particularly in California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "They planned to save money by terminating claims like
hers," Larson said in the order. The company developed a "comprehensive
system for targeting and terminating expensive claims."</TE>
<TE>   The litigation has put a spotlight on the culture of an insurer
that once handed out a "Hungry Vulture" award to its best employees.
A UnumProvident executive said the award was discontinued when it
became clear that people outside the company were misconstruing what
was meant as a lighthearted effort to boost morale.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar case against the company, a Tampa jury awarded $36.7
million last year to an eye surgeon who claimed that Parkinson's
disease left him unable to operate. A class-action suit recently was
filed in New York, several lawyers said they were preparing to file
additional lawsuits, and the Georgia insurance commissioner's office
has been investigating the company's practices in that state for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits have pilloried the company for requiring its claims
adjusters to maintain and give special attention to "Top 10" lists of
certain claims that were costing the company the most and for
conducting round-table internal discussions allegedly to come up with
ways to deny claims and cut off benefits.</TE>
<TE>   A top UnumProvident executive said Thursday that the company was
proud of its claims management practices and believed that
plaintiffs' lawyers were mischaracterizing its conduct in a smear
campaign designed to bolster their suits. The giant insurer, formed
in the 1990s through the merger of Provident Cos. and Unum Corp. and
the acquisition of Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., dominates the
individual and group disability market.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the biggest target out there," said J. Christopher
Collins, a senior vice president. "We have a third of the marketplace,
and we've just become their favorite whipping post."</TE>
<TE>   The disputed policies offer what is known as noncancelable,
own-occupation disability coverage. Such policies typically are
purchased by self-employed professionals to make up for lost income
if a disability were to prevent them from working in their specific
field. If a policyholder were able to work in another job, he or she
still would be entitled to benefits.</TE>
<TE>   One insurance analyst said there were concerns within the industry
in the mid-1990s that own-occupation policies were being exploited in
some cases by professionals who were not actually disabled but were
looking to retire with an income. And Collins of UnumProvident said
some industry experts believe fraud affects 5% to 15% of claims.</TE>
<TE>   But plaintiffs' lawyers said UnumProvident brought the suits on
itself by cutting off claims and benefits at the expense of
policyholders they contend are legitimately disabled. The lawyers
said that people who have been terminated by UnumProvident have
included individuals with Parkinson's disease, AIDS, spinal injuries,
organic brain damage and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the most vulnerable people imaginable," said
Ray Bourhis, a San Francisco lawyer with several cases against the
company, including the one before Judge Larson.</TE>
<TE>   "They're disabled. They don't have the energy to take on an
$8-billion insurance company, and the company knows it. You sell them
this policy on the basis that you will be there if anything should
ever happen.... You take their money, their premiums, for 10 or 15
years. And then lightning strikes, and you refuse to pay the claims."</TE>
<TE>   Incoming California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi,
who takes office in January, said he had talked to lawyers involved in
some of the California suits and planned to launch an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me to be a conspiracy to defraud individuals,"
Garamendi said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   UnumProvident is the subject of an audit in California, said a
spokesman for the current insurance commissioner, Harry Low. The
spokesman characterized the review as routine.</TE>
<TE>   The company has not publicly disclosed how many of the so-called
bad-faith suits it faces on own-occupation policies, but Collins
estimated that fewer than 200 have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the company planned to appeal Judge Larson's ruling
and that his injunction was based on bad evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge has essentially enjoined us to not do things we're not
doing," Collins said. "We don't employ biased medical examiners. We
don't destroy medical records. And we don't withhold from claimants
information about their benefits."</TE>
<TE>   In his 62-page ruling, Larson found support for his order in
company documents, including a law department instruction that claims
adjusters "shred all sensitive papers that will not be needed for
business purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the document was distributed in the early 1990s and
only to employees of the former Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance
Co. He said it had been provided by an outside vendor. Collins said
it had been superseded by a newer policy on document retention but
that there was nothing wrong with the old instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the company stood by its termination of Harngarter's
benefits. He said the judge based his decision on the testimony of
former employers and others with an ax to grind against the company
and on company memos that were old or mischaracterized at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Harngarter, a former Berkeley chiropractor, said she was forced to
walk away from her $100,000-a-year profession because of disabling
joint pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep wondering how long I can hold out," Harngarter said.</TE>

<HD>3 Associates of Rap Mogul Arrested</HD>
<DH>Picked up in a sweep, they are accused of plotting murder.
'Suge' Knight is not a suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips, Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an investigation that centers on the crumbling rap music empire of
Marion "Suge" Knight, Los Angeles authorities arrested three of his
associates Thursday on suspicion of conspiring to murder a gang
rival.</LD>
<LD>   The three -- a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy and two
alleged gang members -- are accused of plotting to kill the rival in
revenge for the death of another Knight associate who was gunned down
in April. The arrests came during an early-morning sweep in which 175
sheriff's deputies served search warrants at 16 sites in Southern
California and Las Vegas, including Knight's Beverly Hills office and
his homes in three cities.</LD>
<LD>   Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, was one of the most
influential figures in the development of rap and hip-hop music,
which he helped launch from an urban fad into an international
cultural phenomenon. Along the way, however, he has been closely
associated with the music's dark side: violence that has claimed the
lives of several of its brightest stars and many hangers-on.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said Thursday that Knight is not a suspect in
their investigation, which focuses on a string of alleged gang
killings, including several in which the victims were Knight
employees or associates. The officials also stressed that the
investigation is not related to the unsolved killings of two of rap's
biggest stars, Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (also known as
Biggie Smalls and Notorious B.I.G.).</TE>
<TE>   "This is strictly a gang-related murder in the city of Compton,"
Sheriff's Capt. Pete Amico told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's sweep led to the arrests of former Sheriff's Deputy
Kordell Depree Knox, 37, along with reputed gang members Michael
Payne, 25, and Theodore Kelly, 29, authorities said. The three were
charged with conspiracy stemming from the June 7 death of Eric
Letheal Daniel, 29, a reputed Compton gang member known by the
nickname "Scar."</TE>
<TE>   None of the three arrested is believed to have been the gunman,
investigators said. Sheriff's investigators have arrest warrants for
five other people, who are still at large.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was arrested at 5 a.m. at the Wilshire Boulevard
headquarters of Knight's company, now known as Tha Row Records. Knox,
who worked as a security guard at Tha Row, was arrested about the
same time at his Compton residence. Payne was arrested at a home in
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Knox is a former Compton police officer who became a sheriff's
deputy when the department took over policing duties in Compton. He
was dismissed by the department earlier this month when he came under
investigation over an off-duty assault, Amico said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other men, Darryl Small and DeShone Lacey, were arrested
Thursday on unrelated drug possession charges, sheriff's officials
said. Small was arrested at Knight's office; Lacey at his Compton
home. It was Small's second arrest in a month. The first was on
weapons charges after what sheriff's deputies described as an
attempted drive-by shooting on an Inglewood street in late October.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel's mother, Rose Mary Daniel-Rogers, said she was overjoyed
to hear of the arrests, and grateful to detectives for "not letting
it rest."</TE>
<TE>   "I just heard it on the television, and it feels like something
has just lifted," she said Thursday afternoon. "You don't know how
good I feel. It's just the idea of me knowing who really murdered my
baby."</TE>
<TE>   Her son had struggled in life but had recently been going to
church, she said, and was trying to improve his lot. Regardless of
bad times, he always appeared happy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel-Rogers said she was also glad to be able to tell his
8-year-old son that someone had been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he doesn't have to be mad with the world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Heavily armed deputies in Thursday's sweep served search and
arrest warrants in and around Los Angeles. Besides Compton, Beverly
Hills and Long Beach, warrants were served in Malibu, Lakewood,
Paramount, North Hollywood and Lynwood, plus Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said they employed the department's SWAT team
because of the suspects' history of violence.</TE>
<TE>   At Tha Row's office, a pile of glass marked the entrance where
sheriff's investigators smashed a door to force their way in. Yellow
tape surrounded the building as deputies seized boxes of documents
and a computer, which they carted away in an unmarked pickup.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a 9-millimeter handgun was recovered from Knight's
offices, Amico said. However, he added, "It's not the 9-millimeter
related to the Daniel shooting." One goal of the sweep was to recover
the weapon used in that slaying.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of Knight's 9,000-square-foot Malibu home, his
pregnant wife was briefly handcuffed, Amico said. "Deputies used
their discretion to make sure the home was safe and secured," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe Daniel's murder resulted from a rivalry
between two factions of the Bloods gang and was in revenge for the
killing of Alton "Buntry" McDonald, a former associate of Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "We are searching for evidence related to a murder and conspiracy
to commit murder," said Deputy Darren Harris. "Tha Row Records has
some connections."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was not in his office Thursday and did not return calls
seeking comment. His lawyer, David Z. Chesnoff, issued a one-sentence
statement: "We appreciate the professionalism of the police in
clearly indicating that Mr. Knight is not a suspect."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald is one of several members of Knight's inner circle who
have been killed in recent months. The most recent was Tha Row
employee Henry "Hendog" Smith, gunned down the afternoon of Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   A task force of federal and local law enforcement officials has
been looking into these and reputedly retaliatory killings, primarily
involving members of two Bloods factions, the Mob Pirus and the Fruit
Town Pirus, both based in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   During the early days of Death Row, Knight would brag that his
company hired ex-cons and gang members to give them a second chance.
In the early 1990s, Knight employed both Mob Pirus and Fruit Town
Pirus.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mid-1990s, the two factions had a falling out, setting
the stage for the recent violence.</TE>
<TE>   Knight himself was sentenced to prison in early 1997 for a
probation violation stemming from his participation, along with Tupac
Skakur and four reputed members of the Bloods, in a brawl in a Las
Vegas hotel lobby on Sept. 7, 1996. Shakur was mortally wounded three
hours later in a drive-by shooting near the Strip. Knight was at his
side.</TE>
<TE>   The four Bloods who participated in the Las Vegas altercation were
Alton McDonald, Travon "Tray" Lane, Roger "Neckbone" Williams and
Aaron "Heron" Palmer. Of these, Lane was later sent to prison for his
role in a drive-by shooting; Williams was jailed on a weapons
violation; Palmer was killed in a drive-by shooting in June 1997 and
McDonald was gunned down April 3, 2002, while filling his SUV with
gas.</TE>

<HD>House Revives Bankruptcy Bill</HD>
<DH>Language opposed by abortion foes is removed. Senate
passage is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook and Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House voted early today to revive a decade-long effort to rewrite
the U.S. bankruptcy code, passing legislation that would make it
harder for people to discharge their debts by declaring themselves
insolvent.</LD>
<LD>   Reversing a decision made only hours earlier, the House voted 244
to 116 to approve the bankruptcy overhaul and send it to the Senate
for consideration in the waning days of the lame-duck congressional
session.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is expected to approve the measure and President Bush
is expected to sign it, congressional sources said.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, which had been voted down 240 to 175 and left for dead
Thursday afternoon, was brought back to life by means of an unusual
parliamentary maneuver that drew loud objections from some Democratic
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the bill is dead, you vote to pass it," said Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.), calling it "the most transparently cynical
legislative maneuver I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   In the earlier vote, abortion opponents and consumer advocates had
teamed to overpower credit card companies and their allies in the
Republican leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The approval of the bill was a big victory for banks and other
financial interests that have been pushing to curb increases in
personal bankruptcy filings.</TE>
<TE>   The vote also was a triumph for House GOP leaders, who were able
to repair a rift with pro-business lawmakers who favored the
measure's broad provisions and social conservatives who opposed its
abortion-related language.</TE>
<TE>   In the initial showdown the bill was brought down by a provision
that was aimed at restricting antiabortion activists from using
bankruptcy proceedings to avoid paying court judgments and fines
arising from protests at abortion clinics.</TE>
<TE>   The provision was added to the bill earlier this year at the
insistence of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a strong supporter of
abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said the provision would have limited 1st Amendment
protections for abortion foes, placing them in a different category
from other social activists by exposing them to big financial
liabilities for their actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're condemning peaceful, innocent people who ... try to save
the life of an unborn child to a life of financial ruin," said Rep.
Joseph R. Pitts (R-Pa.).</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates characterized the bill as a gift to financial
services firms that showered Congress with political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the bill would impose undue hardship on financially
strapped people who are already struggling in the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders attributed the earlier vote against the bill to
an intense lobbying campaign mounted by antiabortion groups, which
jammed congressional switchboards in the hours before Thursday's
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been calling us all day, saying don't do it," said
John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)</TE>
<TE>   Almost forgotten in the jockeying over the abortion issue was the
core of the bill, which represented an effort to stem a steep rise in
individual bankruptcy filings over the last decade. A record 1.45
million bankruptcies were filed in 2001, up 14% from the previous
year.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors say some of that increase represents an abuse of the
bankruptcy code by people who file under Chapter 7 of the code simply
to unload their debts, even though they could afford to repay at
least some of them.</TE>
<TE>   To discourage that practice, the bill would force more people to
file under the code's Chapter 13, which requires debtors to work out
repayment plans for at least part of their debts. The bill would have
established a "means test" to determine who qualifies for a Chapter 7
filing.</TE>
<TE>   Another provision was designed to close a controversial legal
loophole that allows bankruptcy filers in several states to keep
expensive homes. The bill would limit the so-called homestead
exemption for felons and others convicted of financial misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   The eleventh-hour dispute over abortion was just the latest snag
in what has been a tortuous legislative journey for the bankruptcy
measure.</TE>
<TE>   A similar bill almost became law two years ago, but President
Clinton exercised a pocket veto by leaving it unsigned while Congress
was out of town. Different versions of the bill whizzed through the
House and Senate after Republicans took control of both chambers
following the 2000 elections. But after Democrats seized control of
the Senate in mid-2001, negotiations to reconcile the differing
versions stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the bill moved to the brink of approval in July when
House-Senate conferees reached agreement on compromise language for
the abortion provision. The compromise applied the prohibition on use
of bankruptcy proceedings to anyone trying to avoid a fine for
blocking any legitimate business. Bankruptcy could still be filed by
those facing other court fines.</TE>
<TE>   That accord was endorsed by Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a
longtime leader of antiabortion forces. But others continued to
vehemently oppose the provision, saying it remained aimed mainly at
antiabortion activists.</TE>
<TE>   That presented GOP House leaders with a quandary. While the
antiabortion forces are important to their political base, the bill
was fervently supported by another important faction: banking and
business interests. Rather than opening that rift as the midterm
campaign was about to kick into high gear, the leaders put off action
on the bill until the lame-duck, postelection session.</TE>

the rivers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana.</LD>
<LD>   Following the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Montana
environmental groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it
plans to designate 18,468 miles of streams and 532,721 acres of lakes
and reservoirs as critical.</LD>
<LD>   The agency estimates that it will take 25 years and $500 million
to restore bull trout to sustainable populations.</LD>

<HD>Bush Aims to Privatize Many Federal Jobs</HD>
<DH>About 850,000 civilian workers would face competition.
Unions, Democrats decry move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush plans to allow the private sector to compete for
nearly half of the nation's 1.8 million federal civilian jobs, the
White House said Thursday in a move that enraged labor unions and
their Democratic allies in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 850,000 workers -- covering a wide range of white- and
blue-collar jobs -- could be affected, according to the White House
Office of Management and Budget.</LD>
<LD>   "We're talking about every imaginable type of job: military
logistics and support, information technology, data collection,
people who work in OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health
Administration], in mine safety," said Jacqueline Simon, public
policy director of the 600,000-member American Federation of
Government Employees, the largest federal employee union.</LD>
<TE>   Other jobs subject to privatization under Bush's plan include
mapmakers, computer programmers, engineers, landscapers, park-fee
collectors, road builders and lens- and eyeglass-makers, according to
Trent Duffy, an OMB spokesman. High-ranking government jobs will not
be affected, the administration said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said the change was designed to reduce costs and
increase the federal bureaucracy's efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is make government work better for the
American taxpayer," White House Deputy Press Secretary Scott
McClellan told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon denounced the move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly one aspect of union-busting," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In taking on one of the Democratic Party's core constituencies,
the abrupt and unilateral move by the president suggested that he is
prepared to play hardball despite his postelection call for
bipartisan cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, McClellan called the positions "non-core" jobs
and said studies have shown that such privatization can save "in
excess of 30%." The theory is that competitive bidding will force the
bureaucracy to lower costs and improve service, or lose jobs to the
private sector.</TE>
<TE>   The White House sent the new rules to the Federal Register for
publication today after posting them Thursday on the Web site of the
OMB (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_111402.doc).
They would take effect after a 30-day comment period, Duffy said. The
administration wants at least 15% of the jobs opened to competition
by October.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said the president's initiative does not
require congressional approval. Privatization efforts have been
allowed since 1998 under the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act,
although there have been few efforts beyond the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts nevertheless predicted controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't like pouring gas on fire. It's more like pouring
nitroglycerin on fire," said Paul C. Light, a government studies
expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist Washington public
policy center.</TE>
<TE>   For a variety of reasons, the timing of Bush's move was a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it comes at a time when Republican priorities face
daunting obstacles because of a mounting budget deficit and
privatizing jobs would remove them from the government payroll. In
addition, the move surely would please private contractors, a
traditional Republican constituency.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's initiative also flies in the face of his
months-long efforts to court elements of the labor movement,
particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.</TE>
<TE>   Now all that could change, predicted Norman J. Ornstein, a
political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems like a radical plan that would unite Democrats and a
lot of their allies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein and other analysts also said the privatization drive
raised questions about Bush's recent assertions that his insistence
upon greater management leeway over employees in the proposed
Department of Homeland Security was not motivated by a desire to
privatize the work force and should not be seen as anti-union.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to really cast some serious doubt on their motives
in the homeland security area," Ornstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Light: "This is a form of bureaucratic trash talking that
obviously inflames labor."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, some of labor's most ardent champions quickly
offered their own withering critique of the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we see the real White House agenda -- it's not homeland
security, it's union-busting," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the Labor and Human Resources
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal means that the safety of our communities could be
entrusted to the administration's favorite companies and their
lobbyists, instead of to dedicated, trained federal workers," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The OMB's Duffy rejected the notion that the president's
initiative is anti-union.</TE>
<TE>   "This is to give taxpayers the best deal for their dollar and the
best service of their government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said: "I have often found that
privatizing federal responsibilities leads to higher costs to the
taxpayer and a lower quality of services.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time of national and economic insecurity for so many
Americans ... I don't understand why the president would place
800,000 workers who have good jobs, good pensions and good health
care in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Duffy said the administration expects the unions to compete and
win many contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But with the exception of the Defense Department, little such
competition has occurred, according to Light. One reason, he said, is
that such competitions can be time-consuming and "very expensive to
conduct."</TE>
<TE>   In successful competitions, private firms are supposed to be
selected by federal agencies if the companies demonstrate that they
can provide a product or a service at a savings of 10% or more, Light
said.</TE>

<HD>The Old School's Revenge</HD>
<DH>Upset by an invasion of urban culture into their Oregon
town, those who funded scholarships to every graduate pull the plug.</DH>

<DL>PHILOMATH, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Nearly 40 years ago, Rex and Ethel Clemens, a couple with no children
and a sizable timber fortune, made a remarkable promise: They would
pay college tuition for any graduate of Philomath High School.</LD>
<LD>   Their generosity benefited thousands, helping daughters and
sons of loggers and mill workers move on to careers as engineers,
teachers, nurses and business executives.</LD>
<LD>   But over the years, the town moved away from its blue-collar roots
as timber work dwindled, high-tech plants opened and equity-rich
newcomers moved in.</LD>
<TE>   The change is most vivid at the high school, where students have
shocked some old-timers by dying their hair in fluorescent colors,
piercing their noses and forming clubs like a gay support group.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy with what they were seeing, the Clemens Foundation board
of directors decided last month to teach the school a lesson. They
yanked the scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   John Ayer, 57, a former school board member who sympathizes with
the action, said the school has sullied "the values of the old timber
families ... working hard, God, America and apple pie."</TE>
<TE>   "We've had enough of political correctness," Ayer said.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in Philomath resonates across the country, where
once-rural communities, especially those near high-tech hubs, have
grown into bedroom communities.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's decision has sharply divided the 4,000 residents
of the town, whose name means "friend of learning." Members of some
families have stopped speaking to one another. Both sides agree the
heated bickering over the school is fueled by deeper resentments
built up during the town's transformation.</TE>
<TE>   The town's timber industry was hit hard in the 1980s by recession,
foreign competition and environmentalist efforts to save habitat for
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   High-tech jobs multiplied at a nearby Hewlett-Packard printer
plant and other companies. Philomath got subdivided and suburbanized,
what locals called "Californication." Wooded hillsides were cleared
to make room for cul-de-sacs of look-alike houses resembling parts of
the Antelope and San Fernando valleys. Philomath's population today
is more than double its 1970 size.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomers were suspected of moving in expressly for the
scholarships. In 1990, the Clemens Foundation limited awards to those
who had lived in Philomath for three years; in 1993, it raised the
minimum to eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Hard Feelings</TE>
<TE>   Some old-timers tagged the changing culture of the high school not
as a normal evolution, but an import carried in with the commuters.
Marlene McDonald, 68, a local historian, opposed killing the
scholarships. But she said she understands how longtime residents
occasionally feel slighted.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a perception that we're rednecks ... that we're
ignorant," McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   The hostility surfaced at a June school board meeting. Ron
Yechout, a retired banker, attacked newcomers whose "values were
different" because they criticized logging but "were first in line to
accept the handout of the Clemens scholarship." His remarks drew long
applause in the packed gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   At that meeting, Steve Lowther, one of the Clemenses' nephews,
implied that today's Philomath students are not the children of "the
man in the woods, at the mills, driving trucks" that Rex and Ethel
intended to help.</TE>
<TE>   Students are outraged. Philomath High senior Mischa Brittin, 17,
said it is absurd to knock the town's shift from logging, because the
scholarship is partly responsible. "They gave families money so their
kids would not have to work only as loggers. The kids did that, and
now they are mad."</TE>
<TE>   A visitor to Philomath might wonder what all the fuss is about.
The subdivisions, if charmless, are tiny compared with the sprawling
suburbs ringing Portland, about 80 miles to the north. The town
remains middle-class and homey: News still travels through Tuesday
Rotary and Wednesday night bowling league.</TE>
<TE>   Philomath retains the feel of a lumber town, even if the
industry is a shadow of its dominant past. Two sawmills remain open and
flatbed trucks loaded with freshly cut firs regularly roll by.</TE>
<TE>   If Philomath today is uncomfortable with change, some say it was
once downright hostile. Joyce Nesson remembers when locals were
largely able to keep change outside city limits.</TE>
<TE>   Nesson, 55, said she was kicked out of a grocery store shortly
after she moved here in 1972. Her offense, she believes, was her
appearance: long hair, jeans and a T-shirt with no bra.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a cultural chasm," she said, splitting Philomath from
even Corvallis, the college town five miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 1970 Philomath High yearbook -- the era in which
Lowther and his brothers attended the school -- shows a campus
without a trace of the counterculture or antiwar movements then
spreading across the country. Pictures of short-haired boys in
letterman sweaters and girls in skirts and neatly coiffed hair fill
every page.</TE>
<TE>   But today, even with a smattering of pierced and
tattooed students, it is easy to see much of the same cheerful innocence.
There are no metal detectors or armed police. The campus seems free
of bullies and cliques, as flannel-shirted "country" kids walk
alongside black-clad Goths to the Dairy Queen.</TE>
<TE>   "I have friends in the forestry club, the Bible club and the
gay-straight alliance," Brittin said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who see Philomath High School as symbolic of the town's
demise tend to blame Supt. Terry Kneisler.</TE>
<TE>   A Chicago native who came to Philomath in 1996 after coordinating
education programs for the Bahai faith, Kneisler has raised test
scores and the ire of district critics.</TE>
<TE>   During Kneisler's tenure, the gay support group was formed, a
dress code that did not deal with hair color or body piercings was
adopted and an oft-vandalized wooden Indian mascot was put in storage
after parents complained it was offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Kneisler's explanations have done little to placate critics. He
has asserted that students can legally form campus clubs. The dress
code targets health and safety concerns such as shirts with drug,
tobacco and alcohol messages, not style issues like hair, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kneisler and the school board did accede to one demand: The
warrior statue, a 6-foot caricature with an oversized head, was
returned to the school lobby.</TE>
<TE>   But Kneisler was at the center of two incidents that would become
flashpoints.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kneisler asked the Lowthers whether they knew the land
they had sold for an elementary school contained hazardous waste. The
family said they weren't aware of the contamination. Old-timers
became enraged when the exchange was made public.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Kneisler told sports boosters eager to build a new high
school baseball stadium that federal law requires equal facilities
for male and female athletes. Kneisler asked the baseball supporters
to also upgrade the girls' softball field. The request offended the
boosters, who withdrew their offer of a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was politically correct to give boys and girls equal
access. I say it's a legal obligation," Kneisler said.</TE>
<TE>   Decision Made</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lowther later persuaded the foundation directors, made up of
himself, his two brothers and four family friends, to end the
scholarships, which totaled more than $15 million in the program's
lifetime. Approximately 500 students receiving the grants now won't
be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients could attend any college, but the scholarship amount
matched annual tuition at Oregon State University, now about $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of the roughly 160 students who graduate from
Philomath High each year attend college, up from next to none when
the scholarships began.</TE>
<TE>   School officials think students who need the aid will find other
sources.</TE>
<TE>   A newspaper ad last month proclaimed the change, stating: "The
Clemens Foundation stands firm in the belief that a quality basic
education ought to precede funding for college." Lowther could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Without a Clemens scholarship, senior Brian Finley, 17, said he
expects to go to community college and work full time to save money
to transfer to a university. Finley said it is the Lowthers and their
backers, not students at the school, who are unruly and immature.</TE>
<TE>   "They're like elementary school kids who take the ball away when
the game's not being played their way," he said.</TE>

<HD>Death Row's Empire Mostly Just a Memory</HD>
<DH>Now known as Tha Row, Marion 'Suge' Knight's label is
struggling to rebuild itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In two weeks, the most promising music project of 2002 that bears the
name of Marion "Suge" Knight will hit record stores. But the album
with the bittersweet title "Better Dayz" is the leftover work of a
dead man, and will do very little to rebuild the fading empire that
once was Death Row Records.</LD>
<LD>   "Better Dayz" is the latest collection of unreleased Tupac Shakur
music and Knight is credited as executive producer, but sources
involved say his role in the project was minimal, unlike the glory
days when he had his hand in most every aspect of his label's music.
The roster of stars he has now is largely unproven, and Knight these
days is generating far more interest from police detectives than
music fans.</LD>
<LD>   At the height of its powers, Death Row Records (now known, more
simply, as Tha Row) was pulling in $100 million a year and proving
that hard-core rap could power a hit machine in pop music. The
cigar-chomping Knight, a 320-pound repeat felon in heaps of jewelry,
was the center of it all, a Capone-like figure of intimidation and
dark charisma who had a stable of stars with Shakur, Dr. Dre and
Snoop Dogg.</LD>
<TE>   Knight's talent was taking edgy urban music and selling it widely,
and his successes with Death Row set the stage for today's mainstream
embrace of rap, most evident at the moment in the reign of "8 Mile"
as America's top-grossing movie. The path between Knight and Eminem
runs through Dre, the Death Row defector who has mentored Eminem's
career.</TE>
<TE>   The flip side of the Death Row story is the violence that was the
company's trademark in both lyric and life. With the police search
Thursday of Knight's office, once again, the so-called "most
dangerous man in the music business" finds his name linked to a
violent crime investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the unsavory aspects of Knight's reputation were
bundled with his career success, but now his label's future is
uncertain. His biggest stars are gone and, though he has some of
their unreleased material to tap, his fortunes will be decided by his
long-term ability to find new talent and rehabilitate his
relationship with industry players.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, he is someone who knows how the business works and
definitely knows how to build a success," said Violet Brown, the
urban music buyer for the Wherehouse chain, Thursday. "He's shown
that before."</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old Knight grew up in Compton as the son of a janitor
and made a name for himself on the high school football field and
then as a defensive end at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. His
pro football aspirations fizzled and instead he became a bodyguard
for R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown. From that vantage he became mesmerized by
the music business and, in 1990, he started his own song publishing
company and promoted local rap shows.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Death Row, in alliance with Interscope Records,
debuted with the hugely successful album "The Chronic." Dre, a
founding member of the pivotal rap group N.W.A, was a familiar face
from Knight's youth in Compton but he was already under contract to
another label, Ruthless Records. In an episode that became part of
Death Row lore, Knight allegedly freed Dre from that contract by
making a menacing visit to the Ruthless offices of Eric "Eazy E"
Wright with some friends, pipes and bats in hand. Knight has denied
that account from Wright's lawsuit against Knight and Dre. The suit
was settled in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The defining rap label before the arrival of Death Row in 1992 was
Def Jam Recordings, which had East Coast stars such as Run-DMC, LL
Cool J and the Beastie Boys. Death Row's music and spirit were
dramatically different -- its template of West Coast gangsta rap,
shaped by N.W.A. The East Coast music had mostly been playful, but
the sound from Compton and Los Angeles was proudly thuggish and
graphic. Knight has kept company with the Mob Piru Bloods, the
notorious street gang, and the gang's trademark red has been a design
emphasis in Knight's offices and home.</TE>
<TE>   The music itself would stir controversy for its bloodied themes
and relentless misogyny, but it also was hugely successful as a
commercial and critical force. Dre's "The Chronic" in 1992 was
included on most every list of the decade's vital albums, and Snoop
Dogg's loping street drawl on hits such as "Gin &amp; Juice" made him a
cartoonish rap icon. Shakur, meanwhile, was hailed as a ghetto poet
and, along with Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, was cited as the lost
spokesman for his generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Death Row reintroduced Dre, they brought in Snoop and Shakur,"
Emmanuel "E-Man" Coquia said Thursday. Coquia is music director for
KPWR-FM (105.9), the leading urban radio station in Los Angeles.
"Their music paved the way to gangsta rap on a commercial level and
that was when radio opened up to hip-hop and embraced the West Coast
music. You just look at those albums. It was a great run."</TE>
<TE>   While Dre and Shakur were undeniable talents, Knight was a
specialist at crafting their marketing and a micro-manager in
everything from their music videos to their album cover art.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's reputation in the industry also grew as a hardball
businessman who was willing to let his 6-foot-3 stature and imposing
ways become part of his boardroom approach. In 1990, he allegedly
dangled the rapper Vanilla Ice from the balcony of a Beverly Hills
hotel to encourage his cooperation in a business deal. Knight has
alternately denied and encouraged the spread of that account, just as
he has recounted his youthful street escapades that have made him a
colorful, intimidating character. Knight was convicted in 1994 of
using a telephone to pummel two men at the Death Row studios.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous images of Knight are from a security video and a
photograph, both from Sept. 7, 1996, when he was in Las Vegas with
Shakur to attend a heavyweight boxing match at the MGM Grand Hotel.
The video shows Shakur, Knight and their bodyguards beating down a
rival in a casino. The photograph, snapped hours later, shows Shakur
in the passenger seat of Knight's black BMW and the music mogul at
the wheel. The rapper was shot in a hail of bullets minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   That murder, still unsolved by police, and the murder six months
later of Notorious B.I.G. in Los Angeles were the flash points of the
East Coast-West Coast rap rivalry that went from a war of words to a
conflict with a body count. Knight is, to many observers, a central
character in the strange rivalry, but the nature and extent of his
role in the hostilities remains a topic of hot debate.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the burly Knight was in a Los Angeles courtroom in
March 1997 to face sentencing for the Las Vegas attack, the mogul and
his label were fighting on many fronts. He was under investigation
not only by local police but also by the IRS, the Justice Department,
the FBI and the DEA. A federal grand jury was eyeing the company as
an alleged criminal enterprise and creditors were lining up to sue
the label.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was sentenced to nine years in prison for the casino
assault, a violation of his parole on previous crimes, which included
battery, assault with a firearm and federal weapons charges. After a
stint at Mule Creek State Prison and other facilities, he walked out
a free man in August 2001. A billboard with "Welcome Home Suge" stood
above his Wilshire Boulevard offices, but Knight returned to a
humbled record label. Shakur was dead and Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg had
defected, but Knight's confidence seemed unaffected.</TE>
<TE>   "Better days is coming," he told The Times the day he was released
from custody. "It's like we're getting ready for the Super Bowl.
Preparing for the game. We're going to win the big one. Going to sign
some new young producers to come up with some tough new stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The company also is releasing tough old stuff. Dre and Snoop Dogg
may be gone, but Tha Row has released albums of their older material,
to the chagrin of both rappers. Knight has lashed out against both of
his former artists in interviews, too. Knight and Snoop Dogg also had
a fleeting encounter at a recent awards show which onlookers
described as hostile.</TE>
<TE>   Tha Row is now a label under construction. Its roster includes
Kurupt, a second-tier star in rap circles, and some performers who
are largely unknown, such as Eastwood, Crooked I and Spider. The
label also has a solo album in the can from N.I.N.A., an alias for
the late Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, the TLC star who died in a car crash
in Honduras in April.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be all about the music, so we have to wait until
next year for that," said Brown of Wherehouse, which has about 600
music stores nationwide. "He has the Left Eye album, Kurupt will
always have interest in his music and Eastwood has been talked about
a lot. But we have to wait for the music. That's all that really
matters in this business."</TE>

<CX>   Death Row Records -- A chronology accompanying a story on Death Row
Records in Friday's A section mistakenly said that record producer
Delmar "Daz" Arnaud was killed in a 1999 attack outside an Atwater
Village recording studio. Arnaud reportedly was at the studio at the
time, but was not involved in the shooting.</CX>

<HD>Senate Bill Calls for More Aid for Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>The measure earmarks $2.3 billion over four years in
reconstruction funds for the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate passed legislation Thursday calling for more
reconstruction aid for Afghanistan and urging President Bush to push
to expand the mandate of international security troops now restricted
to Kabul, the capital.</LD>
<LD>   The House still must act on the bill to send it to Bush as
Congress works to complete a lame-duck session.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate passed by a voice vote the measure that calls for $2.3
billion over four years in reconstruction funds for the war-ravaged
country.</LD>
<TE>   Legislation that would provide reconstruction funds stalled in
this session along with most of the rest of the federal budget.
Congress is not expected to pass a foreign aid spending bill until
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr. (D-Del.), said the bill "sends a signal that the United States
plans to keep the commitment it made a year ago to help create a
stable, peaceful Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The bill urges Bush to "use U.S. diplomatic influence" to expand
the International Security Assistance Force or a similar
international force beyond its current assignment in Kabul and to
enlist U.S. allies to provide forces for the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has about 7,000 troops in Afghanistan, but they mainly
are focused on searching for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. The
administration says it cannot divert troops for peacekeeping
operation.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Biden said evidence of U.S. and international
commitment to Afghanistan was especially important "amid discussion
of possible military intervention in Iraq. We need to show that in
thinking these scenarios through, we are serious about the long run."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terrorism Deadlock Ends</HD>
<DH>Bowing to Bush, the House OKs an insurance bill, and
tighter seaport security clears Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Goaded by President Bush, Congress on Thursday broke legislative
deadlocks on two major anti-terrorism bills and finally agreed to set
up an independent commission to investigate government failures
surrounding last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In a key vote sought by Bush, the House late Thursday approved a
long-delayed bill to provide federal backup insurance against damage
caused by terrorism. Bush and other proponents have said the bill
will provide the economy a needed boost by stimulating stalled
construction projects.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is expected to pass the bill within a few days.</LD>
<TE>   Also approved Thursday by the House and Senate is legislation to
tighten security at seaports -- facilities considered especially weak
links in the nation's homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement on establishing the 10-member National Commission on
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States was reached just hours
before the House prepared to adjourn for the year, with Bush getting
much of what he wanted. The commission was included in an
intelligence bill approved on a 366-3 vote that came after midnight.
The Senate is expected to give its approval, perhaps as early as
today.</TE>
<TE>   Action on the terrorism insurance, port security and commission
measures -- along with expected Senate approval early next week on
legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security -- adds to
Congress' already extensive response to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Members of Congress have a nightmare: on the day after an attack,
having to explain why they held up terrorism insurance or a
Department of Homeland Security," said John J. Pitney Jr., a
professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   Bush helped spark this legislative flurry, demonstrating his
willingness to use the clout he gained in last week's midterm
elections to lean on Democrats and Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   On the insurance bill, Bush personally lobbied key GOP House
leaders -- including powerful House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas)
-- who wanted to put off the issue until next year when they have
more power in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And although Senate GOP leaders initially had wanted to put off
action on the bill to create a Homeland Security Department, they
reversed course in the face of Bush's determination and are expected
within days to deliver to the president a bill written largely to his
specifications. The House approved the measure on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The deference to Bush portends a shift in legislative dynamics in
the new Congress that convenes in January. At least for the first few
months, Bush may have a honeymoon period, with Republicans more
willing than ever to take marching orders from the White House and
Democrats less willing to take him on.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress fought to quickly finish a lame-duck session that
began this week, GOP leaders suffered one unexpected setback Thursday
when the House killed a long-awaited bill to overhaul the bankruptcy
code. But early today the measure was revived on a 244-116 vote when
an abortion-related provision loathed by conservatives was removed.</TE>
<TE>   Another deadlock ended in the Senate, where the Democratic-led
Judiciary Committee approved two of Bush's much-delayed conservative
nominees to the federal bench.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan welcomed the spate of
activity. "We are encouraged by the tremendous progress Congress is
making during this lame-duck session, in a very short amount of
time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorism insurance bill the House approved would make the
government the insurer of last resort for some of the damage caused
by any terrorist attacks in the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "If Congress does not pass this bill and another major terrorism
attack occurs, thousands of businesses could go bankrupt, people
won't be able to get coverage for their losses, and the government
will have to step in at a much higher price and without an efficient
payment mechanism to salvage the crisis," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry expects to be able to pay the estimated $40
billion to $50 billion in claims stemming from last year's attacks.
But industry officials have said they cannot insure against the
incalculable liability from a future attack without government
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Gate Bridge, for example, is paying twice as much in
premiums (about $1 million a year) for a fourth of the property
coverage -- and no longer has any coverage for a terrorist attack. As
a result, if the bridge is damaged in a terrorist attack, the
taxpayers would be liable for all of the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush portrayed the measure as a jobs bill, saying that the lack of
terrorism insurance -- or high cost of it -- after last year's
attacks has stalled construction projects and idled workers.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Republicans had sought to put off a vote because they
did not think the bill did enough to rein in what they regard as
frivolous lawsuits and excessive attorney fees. They also were upset
that the bill did not prohibit individuals injured in an attack from
suing building owners for punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called DeLay on Wednesday night urging him to support the
measure. "The president said we need to get this done," said a GOP
leadership aide.</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) also spoke to Bush on
Wednesday and received an assurance that the White House would make
legal reforms a major initiative next year.</TE>
<TE>   Some disputed whether the measure is still needed.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Miller, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, contended
that insurance markets have adjusted to the post-Sept 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "With taxpayers footing most of the bill for terrorism-related
losses, insurance companies and insurance customers will have less of
an incentive to upgrade security measures against terrorist attacks,"
he said. "Government does have a positive role to play in this, by
improving national security to reduce the risk of terrorism and its
costs."</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, insurance companies would pay a deductible
before federal assistance becomes available. For losses above a
company's deductible, the federal government would cover 90%, while
the company would contribute 10%, although there would be some
additional repayment under the three-year program.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry would be required to repay any government
expenditure for losses up to $10 billion in the first year, $12.5
billion the second and $15 billion the third year of the program.
Losses would be capped at $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement on the independent commission was announced by the
White House, which said that Bush would appoint the chairman,
congressional Democrats would appoint the vice chairman and subpoenas
could be issued with the agreement of the chairman and vice chairman
or by a majority of the commission members.</TE>
<TE>   Commission appointments would be evenly divided among Republicans
and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, we will get a clear, clean picture of what government
agencies failed, how they failed and why," said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) who with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) worked out
the agreement with White House staff members.</TE>
<TE>   Under the earlier proposal, commission members appointed by one
party could issue subpoenas, a power that the administration worried
could lead to witch hunts.</TE>
<TE>   The White House initially opposed creation of the panel, but Bush
relented after emotional appeals by families of victims of the Sept.
11 attacks. Commission members would examine subjects ranging from
intelligence failures to the flow of money to terrorist networks,
diplomacy, immigration policies and aviation security. The commission
will report to the president and Congress on its findings and
recommendations after 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The port security bill sailed through the Senate on a 95-0 vote;
it passed the House on a voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would require assessments of the vulnerability of ports
-- at home and abroad -- to terrorist attack, expand the Coast
Guard's authority to stop and search ships and bolster maritime
intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   It also would require background checks of workers in
security-sensitive jobs and implement new measures to better screen
the 6 million cargo containers coming in annually to the nation's 361
ports, which stretch from Los Angeles and Long Beach to Portland,
Maine.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the Council on Foreign Relations warned that
the U.S. remains "dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond" to
another terrorist attack and singled out seaports as particularly
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Experts warn that an attack on a seaport also could wreak economic
havoc.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measure said its urgency also was demonstrated
by a freighter crammed with Haitian refugees that eluded detection
until it was just two miles off the Florida coast last month. "It
could have been filled with 200 people who had bad intentions," said
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   The bill provides the promise of federal money to help secure
ports, a good chunk of which would probably go to the Los
Angeles-Long Beach port complex, the nation's busiest.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the measure falls short because it puts off until
next year a decision on how the promised security improvements will
be funded.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, the Bush administration would have six months
to submit a plan for funding port security improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The bill does call for an increase in spending for the Coast
Guard, from $5.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 to
about $6 billion this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) voted for the bill, but said
Congress "squandered an opportunity to take aggressive action to
erect a formidable barrier at our seaports," including approving
tougher criminal penalties for shippers who provide false cargo
information and requiring "high security" seals and electronic tags
on containers coming into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The measure gained momentum in the closing days of Congress only
after one of its chief sponsors, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.),
grudgingly dropped an effort to impose a new fee on cargo and
passengers that would have raised $700 million a year for security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   A security fee was added to airline tickets in the aviation
security bill approved last year. But the port security fee faced
stiff opposition from business groups and their GOP allies in
Congress. Hollings said that he will continue to press for the fee
next year.</TE>

<HD>FBI Warns of Possible 'Spectacular' Attack</HD>
<DH>No specifics are given, but Al Qaeda network may be looking
to cause mass casualties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda may be planning a "spectacular" terrorist attack intended to
damage the U.S. economy and inflict large-scale casualties, the FBI
warns in a law enforcement bulletin circulated Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The warning went to officials nationwide. It contains no
information about the timing, location or method of a possible
attack. Even so, the warning is unusual because of its dire language.</LD>
<LD>   "Sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet
several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage
to the U.S. economy and maximum psychological trauma," says the
alert, which was posted on the FBI's Web site early today.</LD>
<TE>   The warning came as the Senate's top Democrat said Thursday that
the failure of U.S. authorities to capture Osama bin Laden raises
questions about "whether or not we are winning the war on terror."</TE>
<TE>   "We can't find Bin Laden; we haven't made real progress" in
finding key elements of the Al Qaeda network, said Sen. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota. "They continue to be as great a threat today as they
were 1 1/2 years ago. So by what measure can we claim to be
successful so far?"</TE>
<TE>   The FBI warning said the highest priority targets remain within
the aviation, petroleum and nuclear sectors, as well as significant
national landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities previously have issued warnings for those
specific industries and national landmarks in general. But there is
clearly worry that the danger of an attack is growing because of
increased "chatter" picked up through intelligence channels, the
continuing U.S. showdown with Iraq and the recently revealed
audiotaped warnings believed to be from Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the latest warning has not led the Bush administration to
raise the terrorist threat level above code yellow, or "elevated,"
which is the middle of a five-level scale of risk developed after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that although the
terrorism risk level remains unchanged, "We are taking additional
precautions to meet the threat."</TE>
<TE>   These include unspecified "additional steps to ramp up our
protection and prevention measures" within federal agencies,
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and other agencies also are communicating possible threats
and assessments of risk to state and local law enforcement agencies
and specific industries that could be targeted for attack.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the FBI has issued warnings about possible
attacks on U.S. railroads and on the energy industry, as well as a
more general warning about heightened risk during the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan, which started Wednesday and ends Dec. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "We're especially sensitive to timeframes which might be thought
by the enemy to be a time when they might want to make a statement,"
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the FBI told authorities in Houston, Chicago, San
Francisco and Washington to be aware of threats against hospitals.
Even though that threat was assigned low credibility by senior law
enforcement officials, the FBI is preferring to err on the side of
caution in terms of giving out information, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to increase vigilance among local police and people
working in industries that are potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   In his meeting with reporters, Daschle said authorities should do
a better job of finding where Bin Laden's message came from.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems he has the ability to move at will," Daschle said. "It's
been a long time; 9/11 was more than year ago, and we have yet to
find him."</TE>
<TE>   A technical analysis of the tape was underway Thursday, and
officials said they still think it was Bin Laden's voice but have not
confirmed that.</TE>

<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Nearly 90 years and $21 million later, Oklahoma's Capitol has a dome.</LD>
<LD>   The crowning achievement -- the longest-running construction
project in Oklahoma's history -- will end Saturday in a celebration
also marking the 95th anniversary of statehood.</LD>
<LD>   All but about $1.5 million of the money for the project was raised
privately.</LD>
<TE>   Construction of the Capitol began in 1914 but was derailed at the
onset of World War I when money ran short. More recently, it was
delayed by strident opposition to the use of tax money for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   But the $1.5 million in public funds used as seed money allowed
"The People of Oklahoma" to be included on the ring of honor, in
which the names of private donors are displayed in raised, gold
lettering.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what's different is that we haven't named the dome after
anyone -- it's the State Capitol Dome," dedication ceremony
spokeswoman Brenda Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The columned, 157-foot steel and granite dome, topped with a
22-foot bronze statue of an American Indian gazing eastward,

<HD>Laws Lag Technology in Nabbing Drugged Drivers, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>State laws haven't kept up with advances in technology making it
easier for police to determine whether a driver is under the
influence of drugs, according to a study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   People who drive under the influence are rarely detected,
prosecuted or referred to treatment programs, according to the report
by the Walsh Group and the American Bar Assn.'s Standing Committee on
Substance Abuse. The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and urges state legislatures to pass laws aimed at drugged
drivers.</LD>
<LD>   "The law is often behind where the science is," said Linda Chezem,
senior judge for Harrison Circuit and Juvenile Court in Indiana.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, drug testing was limited to highly specialized
forensic labs, which sometimes took weeks to glean results.</TE>
<TE>   "People are driving with drugs in their system who shouldn't be,
and under many laws cannot be held accountable," said Jerry Landau,
county prosecutor in Maricopa County, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Before new technologies were developed, he said, urine samples
would go to a crime lab that might take several weeks to process
them. Often, the toxicology report wasn't ready before the case
reached court, and the charges had to be dropped because the evidence
wasn't ready.</TE>
<TE>   Now, rapid tests of urine samples can produce results within
minutes. Technology for testing blood and saliva also has improved,
making it easier to detect drugs.</TE>
<TE>   With drunk driving, many states have a 0.08% blood-alcohol level
standard. But there hasn't been a similar standard established for
illegal drugs. In 42 states, prosecutors have to prove that a
person's ability to drive was impaired because drugs were in their
system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a problem that everyone recognizes and the scientific
society has known about it, but because of difficulties in linking a
particular level of impairment to a drug, like it's done for alcohol,
people are looking the other way," said Michael Walsh, who headed the
team that wrote the study.</TE>
<TE>   For now, according to a panel of prosecutors, judges, police
officers and health officials, the best way for states to deal with
drivers under the influence of illegal drugs is with "per se" drug
laws -- making it illegal for a motorist to drive with any measurable
amount of illegal substance in the body.</TE>
<TE>   Only eight states -- Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Minnesota, Rhode Island and Utah -- have such laws, according to the
report. Other states require proof that the illegal drug affected
driving.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, the per se law has proved effective, Judge Chezem
said, citing an increase in drugged driving cases that have been
prosecuted since it was implemented in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Most states mandate a treatment program for any driver convicted
of having illegal drugs in his or her system. However, Walsh said,
"There's a missed opportunity here because it's hard to convict
people."</TE>
<TE>   The Princeton, N.J.-based Robert Wood Johnson Foundation was
established in 1972 as a national philanthropy devoted to health-care
issues.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Who Killed 2 at CIA Is Executed</HD>
<DH>Mir Aimal Kasi also wounded three others in 1993 ambush at
agency's headquarters. His death prompts warnings of possible
reprisals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mir Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani convicted in the ambush slayings of two
CIA employees nearly a decade ago, was executed by injection Thursday
night at a Virginia state prison amid warnings of possible reprisals
in this country and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Kasi, 38, was pronounced dead at 9:07 p.m. EST at the Greensville
Correctional Center in Jarratt, Va., after the Supreme Court declined
to grant a stay of execution earlier in the day and Gov. Mark Warner
refused to consider a request for clemency.</LD>
<LD>   Kasi's last words, repeated in his native language until he lost
consciousness, were "There is no God but Allah," said Larry Traylor,
a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections.</LD>
<TE>   In recent media interviews, Kasi said he had no regrets for the
January 1993 attack on a busy road in McLean, Va., just outside CIA
headquarters. But he did hope that there would be no retaliation from
those groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan who heralded him as a hero
after FBI agents arrested him in 1997 in a small hotel along the
border of the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I don't encourage anybody to attack Americans," Kasi
said in the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, Kasi's last day was marked by a smattering of
anti-American protests. Some activists called for his sentence to be
commuted to life in prison. A rally of about 150 members of Kasi's
tribe in Pakistan marched through the streets of Quetta, near the
Afghan border, and chanted, "Aimal is our hero." They also burned a
U.S. flag.</TE>
<TE>   "Aimal is not a terrorist," tribal elder Ibrahim Kansi told
demonstrators. "His action was a reaction to what was happening to
Muslims in Chechnya and Palestine." Kasi has said that the shooting
was a protest against U.S. foreign policy toward Muslim nations.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities never found any links between Kasi and
terrorist organizations, such as Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
operation. After Sept. 11, 2001, Kasi decried the attacks on the
World Trade Center because innocent lives were lost, but he said he
felt that the attack on the Pentagon seemed justified.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, the State Department has warned Americans that
Kasi's execution could prompt acts of revenge in this country and
against U.S. interests abroad.</TE>
<TE>   As a safeguard, extra security was placed around the prison in
southern Virginia and at the state Capitol in Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokesman Scott McClellan said Thursday: "Our
thoughts and prayers go to the families of the victims. This is a
criminal justice matter, and the decision of the jury is being
carried out."</TE>
<TE>   Just as CIA employees were reporting to work on Jan. 25, 1993,
Kasi stepped out of his pickup and began firing an AK-47 rifle near
the entrance to the agency's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Killed were Frank Darling, a 28-year-old CIA covert operations
employee, and Lansing Bennett, 66, a physician and agency
intelligence analyst. Three other men were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Kasi fired 11 times, and stopped shooting only when there were no
more men in his gun sight. He thought killing women would be wrong
because he believed that only men have power in the United States. He
fled, but the FBI tracked him to Pakistan more than four years later
and returned him to Virginia for trial.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted of murder in 1997 and sent to Virginia's death
row. His last meal request was for fried rice, bananas, boiled eggs
and wheat bread.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal Jafree, a Pakistani lawyer working on behalf of Kasi's
family, said Kasi never should have been returned to the United
States. "The Pakistan government and the government of the United
States have let him down," Jafree said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's brother said Kasi had called his mother Thursday,
asking her "to have courage."</TE>
<TE>   "He told her to give his wishes to the motherland and to the
people of Pakistan, and asked them to pray for him," Nasibullah Kasi
added.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Darling's family issued a statement recalling the
"beautiful love story and marriage" he had had with his wife, Judy.
She was in the car and witnessed her husband's murder.</TE>
<TE>   The family also noted that the U.S. justice system had been heard.</TE>
<TE>   "On Thursday, we will spend time in prayer for Kasi," they added,
"that God will have mercy on his soul, for his family, that there be
no terrorism reprisal, and for world peace."</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists, Ranchers Take On Oil and Gas Drillers</HD>
<DH>Citing property damage, the allies block access to wells.
Energy group says the sites are permitted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>Environmentalists joined ranchers Thursday as they locked gates to
keep oil and gas drillers from using the ranchers' roads to access
natural gas wells.</LD>
<LD>   Ranchers in the San Juan Basin blame the drillers for a string of
environmental problems, including erosion, water contamination,
livestock deaths and a decline in range quality.</LD>
<LD>   "They haven't done no reseeding and the roads are all eroded,"
Chris Velasquez, a third-generation rancher, said at the gate to one
of his ranching allotments about 10 miles northeast of Aztec. It was
one of at least three that protesters had locked.</LD>
<TE>   The ranchers said they have vainly sought help from the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management and the state's congressional delegation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a David-and-Goliath issue, and as long as Washington is
not behind getting the problem fixed, it will not be fixed," said
rancher Tweeti Blancett.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juan Basin covers 7,800 square miles in northwestern New
Mexico and southwestern Colorado. It produced $2.4 billion in oil and
gas income last year, bringing in $325 million in federal royalties.
The basin produces 10% of U.S. natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Bryant, a spokesman for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission in Oklahoma City, said Thursday that the oil and gas sites
are properly permitted and "anybody who tries to deny access to that
has got to be breaking the law."</TE>
<TE>   "Oil and gas companies are playing by the rules, and these people
should too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blancett said the lockout won't keep drillers off their wells,
since there are alternate routes to the sites. "They just can't come
through and destroy our private land in the process," she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Velasquez said the gate that he locked provided the only
access to about 25 gas wells.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gallagher, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Assn., said
Blancett and her fellow protesters are a vocal minority who refuse to
meet with oil and gas producers to iron out solutions. "The law is
very clear and it has been upheld that the mineral rights take
precedence over surface rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Linn Blancett, Tweeti Blancett's husband, said he locked an access
gate to his ranchland north of Aztec "so that I can control the
damage being done on my property, but also to the rest of the surface
on the BLM grazing permit that I hold." The Blancetts are
sixth-generation New Mexico ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Velasquez had a confrontation a few years ago with drillers who
had left a cattle gate open. "I'd had enough," Velasquez said after
that incident. "So I parked my pickup and my horse trailer across the
road and wouldn't let them [drillers] out. They called the state
cops."</TE>
<TE>   That incident ended amicably, and Tweeti Blancett said ranchers
have no intention of letting their protest get out of control. "We do
not intend to break the peace. We have been here since the 1870s, and
we're not going anywhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling has increased dramatically in the basin as demand for
natural gas has grown. More than 10,000 head of cattle frequently
encounter subcontractors and service crews in a basin with about
20,000 wells.</TE>

<HD>Jury Orders Gun Seller to Pay</HD>
<DH>A weapons distributor is largely spared blame in the
shooting death of a teacher by a student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A jury ordered a weapons distributor Thursday to pay $1.2 million to
the widow of a teacher gunned down by a 13-year-old student, largely
sparing the company from blame in the closely watched case.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors found Valor Corp. to be 5% responsible for the slaying of
Barry Grunow, who was shot two years ago at a Lake Worth middle
school.</LD>
<LD>   The jury said Valor didn't sell the gun with a safety feature,
such as a lock, that could have prevented Nathaniel Brazill from
pulling the trigger. But the $24-million verdict placed 95% of the
blame on the Palm Beach County School Board and the gun's owner.</LD>
<TE>   The six-woman jury held the school board 45% liable for allowing
Brazill on campus with a gun in his pocket to kill his favorite
teacher and ordered it to pay $10.8 million. Jurors found the gun's
owner 50% liable and ordered him to pay $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   Neither were named as defendants, and attorneys in the case said
they would not be expected to pay anything to Pam Grunow and her
children, 7-year-old Samuel and 3-year-old Lee-Anne.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Grunow said the verdict marked the first time a gun
distributor had been found liable in a shooting death.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge victory for safer guns," said Allen Rostron, an
attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "The jury
ruled this company could have distributed a safer gun that would have
made it harder for Nathaniel Brazill to commit this murder."</TE>
<TE>   Valor's attorney, John Renzulli, characterized the verdict as a
win for the defense because Grunow had asked for $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will have no impact whatsoever on the gun industry,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides say they plan to appeal, and Grunow's team said it will
try to have Valor pay all $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   The case was the first brought against the firearms industry to
target the absence of a gun lock and the overall design of a cheap,
easily concealable weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff's attorneys said Valor was notified thousands of
times by federal officials that products it distributed were used in
crimes, but that the company did nothing to make the weapons safer.</TE>
<TE>   Renzulli blamed the slaying on Brazill and Elmore McCray, who
owned the .25-caliber Raven handgun and stored it in a drawer,
unlocked and loaded, where it was found by the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Renzulli also said locking devices can be picked and potentially
inhibit people who own guns for self-protection</TE>
<TE>   Brazill was not mentioned in the verdict. The boy, who was tried
as an adult, was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing the
35-year-old English teacher who had refused to let him talk to girls
in his class.</TE>
<TE>   Brazill insisted the gun went off accidentally.</TE>
<TE>   The gun manufacturer, Raven Arms, is no longer in business.</TE>
<TE>   Grunow's attorneys had hoped for a verdict large enough to force
companies to stop selling the Raven, known on the street as a
"Saturday night special" because of its small size and low cost of
about $75.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Bob Montgomery, known for successfully spearheading the
state's efforts to sue Big Tobacco for $11.3 billion, said he hoped
the gun case would achieve the same crippling results against the gun
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Pam wanted to vindicate to whatever extent she could this
terrible tragedy that's been visited on everybody -- her, Nathaniel
Brazill, McCray, all the families -- by showing that this 'Saturday
night special' has no business being in commerce," he said. "I think
that we've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Pam Grunow's lawsuits against McCray and the Hypoluxo Pawn Shop,
where the gun was purchased, were settled for a total of $575,000.</TE>

<HD>6 Plead Not Guilty to Smuggling Haitians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Six men pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that they smuggled
more than 200 Haitians to the United States in a trip that ended with
television cameras catching the immigrants jumping ship, wading
ashore and begging motorists for rides.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say the Haitian men intended to make a profit by
charging their countrymen for the trip aboard the 50-foot freighter.
If convicted, they face mandatory sentences of five years in federal
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys said passengers and federal agents have denied
that the men charged tried to make a profit. The indictment did not
say how much passengers paid and prosecutors had no comment leaving
court.</LD>
<TE>   Like others on the trip, boat mechanic Jean Eddy Louis "was coming
to the United States seeking the American dream," said his attorney
David Markus. "Instead he finds himself behind American bars."</TE>
<TE>   Edner Dorvil is named as the owner of the boat and organizer of
the trip. Defense attorney Bernie Pastor said Dorvil's wife and two
children were among those who made the eight-day crossing that ended
Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment includes one smuggling conspiracy charge and 228
counts of alien smuggling that name all of the people caught,
including five from the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The boat was chased by the Coast Guard to shallow waters near
downtown Miami.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the six charged, the other immigrants
apprehended after they made it ashore remain in detention, where they
await asylum hearings. A few people are believed to have avoided
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   All illegal Haitian immigrants are held pending deportation to
deter what U.S. officials fear would be a mass exodus from Haiti.</TE>

<HD>Democrat-Led Senate Panel Meets Final Time, OKs 2 Judges</HD>
<DH>Judiciary Committee has now cleared 100 of 102 Bush
nominees over 16 months. Of those, 80 have been approved by the full
chamber.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate Judiciary Committee, in its last meeting under Democratic
control, raised its 98% approval rate for President Bush's judges by
clearing two more on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina, a protege of
retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), won a narrow vote to serve on
the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.</LD>
<LD>   Shedd's nomination was held up last month when civil rights
groups, led by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored
People, said the 49-year-old judge had regularly ruled against
plaintiffs in discrimination cases.</LD>
<TE>   Also Thursday, University of Utah law professor Michael McConnell,
47, won easy approval to serve on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver. A well-regarded conservative legal scholar,
McConnell drew the backing of 300 legal academics, many of them
liberals.</TE>
<TE>   After clearing the committee on a voice vote, the nominations now
go to the full Senate for final confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   The clash over judges flared after Democrats took a one-vote
control of the Senate last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush campaigned throughout the country against Democrats for
obstructing his choice of judges, and the Republican victories last
week should make for smooth sailing for his nominees in the year
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But outgoing committee chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said much
of the criticism had been unfair and exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday's vote, the committee -- where Democrats held a
slim 10-9 majority -- had taken up 100 of Bush's nominees since
Democrats assumed control, and approved 98 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Two were rejected as too conservative. They were U.S. District
Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi and Texas Supreme Court
Justice Priscilla Owen. Last week, GOP leaders said they will revive
those nominations.</TE>
<TE>   In the 16 months of Democrat control, 80 of Bush's judicial
nominees won final approval on the Senate floor, and that number may
go up today.</TE>
<TE>   For 30 months before July 2001, Republicans held the majority,
including during President Clinton's final two years in office. In
that time, 72 judges won Senate approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Our committee was able to achieve more on judicial nominations in
16 months than had been achieved in the previous 30 months," Leahy
said.</TE>
<TE>   But White House lawyers say statistics alone do not tell the tale.
Typically, a new president wins easy approval of nearly all his
initial nominees to the federal bench. Shortly after taking office,
Bush announced 11 nominees to the U.S. appeals courts. Nine of them
were conservatives with solid credentials. Two were black Democrats
who had been nominated earlier by Clinton: judges Roger Gregory of
Virginia and Barrington Parker Jr. of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his advisors saw this as a goodwill gesture that would
speed the confirmation process. Instead, Leahy's committee quickly
confirmed Gregory and Parker, but stalled on most of Bush's other
choices.</TE>
<TE>   They included four attorneys who argue regularly in the Supreme
Court: John Roberts and Miguel Estrada from Washington, Jeffrey
Sutton from Ohio and McConnell from Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Only Estrada and McConnell were given hearings before the
committee, and only the Utah law professor came up for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy had pledged to hold votes on McConnell and Shedd, another of
Bush's initial nominees, and Thursday's lame-duck session redeemed
that promise.</TE>
<TE>   Shedd's nomination divided the committee until the end.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the former and future committee
chairman, said Shedd was well known and well liked, as he had worked
in the past as a lawyer for the committee. "His work habits,
integrity, honesty and temperament were beyond reproach," Hatch said.</TE>
<TE>   But Leahy cited a long series of cases in which Shedd ruled
against discrimination plaintiffs. Often, he threw out the lawsuit
before it could go to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said nearly 30% of those who live
in the mid-South region served by the 4th Circuit are black. "I
believe Judge Shedd is not a strong supporter of civil rights," she
said, adding that she opposed elevating him to the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) had pressed Shedd to name a single case
during his 12 years on the bench in which a discrimination plaintiff
prevailed. "No one, according to his own testimony, claiming to be a
discrimination victim had been successful in his court," Edwards
said, adding that he too would oppose Shedd.</TE>
<TE>   All the Democrats who were present voted no, while all the
Republicans voted yes. But because the absent Sen. Joseph R. Biden
Jr. (D-Del.) did not object, Leahy said the panel on a voice vote had
agreed to send Shedd's nomination to the floor for final approval.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative activists applauded the committee's belated approval
of the two Bush nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is long overdue," said John Nowacki of the Free Congress
Foundation. "After 18 months, Sen. Leahy has run out of excuses to
keep stalling, but it's a shame that it took last week's election
losses to prod the committee into action."</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful today's action signals the beginning of a
fast-track approach to approving President Bush's nominees," said Jay
Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal activists said they were dismayed that Democrats cleared
the two nominations to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   "What a lousy end to the year," said Nan Aron of the Alliance for
Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, said the GOP
gains in last week's midterm elections do not "represent a mandate to
pack the courts with right-wing ideologues."</TE>

<HD>Museum Traces the Evolution of the Lunch Box</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Smithsonian Institution has dug out kids' lunch boxes from among
its prehistoric bones, Civil War relics and millions of other
artifacts and is sending them on a sentimental journey to American
museums.</LD>
<LD>   A three-year "Lunch Box Memories" tour begins Saturday at the
Lafayette Natural History Museum and Planetarium in Lafayette, La.</LD>
<LD>   The curator in charge, David H. Shayt of the National Museum of
American History, traces the origin of modern lunch boxes to the
large cookie containers and tobacco tins that workmen used a century
ago.</LD>
<TE>   The tins gave way to plain black or gray boxes made of sheet
steel. Sometimes those boxes, with a domed cover to hold a thermos,
swayed high above cities beside workers too busy on the girders to
come down for lunch. They remain a favorite model.</TE>
<TE>   Best-remembered are children's lunch boxes that started appearing
around 1950 and were tied to the emergence of television. Unlike the
old steel boxes that were rounded and opened on top, these were
square or oblong and opened on the side.</TE>
<TE>   On one side would be a colorful picture about the size of an early
TV screen. The first came from the popular Hopalong Cassidy cowboy
series. More than 600,000 sold in its first year.</TE>
<TE>   The most successful -- a school bus full of Disney characters --
sold more than 9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Woodall, a collector and dealer who runs a museum devoted to
lunch boxes in Columbus, Ga., said rare early versions sell for as
much as $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some models were made with domed tops, just like the workingmen's
boxes. With a little imagination, children viewed them not only as TV
screens but as school buses, Roy Rogers' chow wagon or a doghouse,
Woodall said.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-TV models had pictures from newspaper and film cartoons. Walt
Disney was so eager to popularize Mickey Mouse that in 1935 he paid
to have the image on lunch boxes, Shayt said. Now rare and highly
prized, only five examples could be found. Shayt borrowed one for his
show.</TE>
<TE>   Later, box manufacturers paid license fees to use TV cartoon
characters. They had to guess at the start of each school year which
programs would become so popular that all the kids would want the
scenes. Guessing wrong meant unsold boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "The popularity ... was a direct reflection of the emergence of
mass-marketing in the postwar baby boom years when waves of new
durable goods flooded the suburban supermarkets," Shayt said.</TE>

<HD>14 Mob Suspects Arrested in N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>An investigation into the mob's takeover of a Long Island strip club
ended with the arrests of 14 alleged members and associates of the
Luchese organized crime family, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Charges include racketeering, illegal gambling and loan-sharking.</LD>
<LD>   The probe began in February after members of the crime family
forced the owner of a complex called Sinderella's -- which included a
strip club, adult video store and novelty shop -- to leave at
gunpoint and told him to never come back, said Suffolk County Dist.
Atty. Thomas Spota.</LD>
<TE>   They took over the club and began skimming about $5,000 in profits
a week, Spota said. They also used it as a place for bookmaking and
illegal gambling, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The illegal activities netted about $2 million in profits over the
last year, said John Gallagher, Suffolk County commissioner of
police.</TE>
<TE>   Those charged include Joseph Caridi, 53, of East Northport, the
alleged underboss of the Luchese family. He was arraigned Thursday on
a felony charge of enterprise corruption, a racketeering charge.</TE>
<TE>   The charges came after 14 search warrants were executed Wednesday,
Spota said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Caridi, four others of those arrested will face the
enterprise corruption charge, Spota said.</TE>

<HD>Mormons to Take Sidewalk Speech Dispute to High Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mormon Church suffered a setback Thursday in its fight to
restrict speech on sidewalks running through its downtown plaza, but
vowed to take the dispute to the Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   A federal appeals court that had prohibited the church from
banning protests and other forms of free speech on the sidewalks
rejected the church's request for a new hearing, but the church said
it won't give up.</LD>
<LD>   The city sold the land for the plaza -- once a part of Main Street
-- to the church, but retained easement rights to ensure pedestrian
access.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled last month
that because sidewalks are a traditional public forum, the city
should protect free-speech rights there.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union and the First Unitarian Church
in Salt Lake City sued after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints imposed rules restricting protests, demonstrations and other
activities on the one-block plaza.</TE>
<TE>   A lower court judge agreed with the Mormon Church and the city
that the limits were constitutional. But the appeals court overturned
that decision.</TE>
<TE>   After buying the block of Main Street for $8.1 million, the church
turned it into a plaza.</TE>

<HD>New York City Warned of Belt-Tightening</HD>
<DH>Recalling lean times of 1970s, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
says city faces $7.5-billion gap in budget. He proposes new taxes,
service cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Recalling how New York almost went bankrupt in the mid-1970s, Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg announced Thursday that the city faces a
$7.5-billion budget gap over the next 20 months and proposed a menu
of new taxes and service cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The most controversial item was a tax on workers who commute to
jobs in the city.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no silver bullet," the mayor said at a City Hall budget
briefing. "The financial picture has eroded significantly."</LD>
<TE>   The proposal to tax commuters immediately ran into opposition from
New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey, who labeled it an "ill-conceived
notion" and pledged to lobby the New York Legislature to block the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   About 250,000 New Jersey residents cross the Hudson River each day
to get to their jobs in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The commuter tax would have to be approved by the Legislature,
where some key leaders of the state Senate already have voiced
skepticism about its chance for passage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Legislature repealed a similar commuter tax, and New
York Gov. George Pataki, who handily won reelection last week to a
third term, said during his campaign that he opposed reinstating the
tax.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg also called for raising the city property tax by 25%,
noting that property tax payments can be deducted from federal and
state income taxes by people who itemize returns.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he would seek to reduce the city's 250,000-member
work force by 8,000 by the end of 2004, mostly through buyouts and
early retirements.</TE>
<TE>   He also proposed closing eight fire companies, reducing July's
class of police recruits by 1,900 officers, enacting tolls on East
River bridges and raising fares on some bus lines.</TE>
<TE>   But Bloomberg stressed that the cuts were not so sharp as to
diminish quality of life or to curb essential services.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a problem because the tax revenues have declined more
than we expected, and the only way out of that is to raise taxes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Waiting will only exacerbate the problem, making the choices more
difficult, if not impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran financial analysts saw Bloomberg's remarks as the
beginning of what could be intense and lengthy bargaining with the
Legislature and the New York City Council, which also must approve
key elements of his plan.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations take on added complexity because, unlike during
the 1970s -- when even larger budget problems loomed -- the state
also is facing financial shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Economists say the lingering national recession, effects of last
year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Wall Street's
declining profits have combined to cut city revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said collections from non-property taxes have dropped by
11% since the attacks on the twin towers, and that one-third of the
city's economy is tied directly or indirectly to the securities
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Also contributing to the problem is a schedule of large payments
that remains on loans that were necessary to help solve the fiscal
crisis of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "We borrowed and encumbered out children," the mayor said. "We
lost control."</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that New York is in far better shape than when
bankruptcy was averted only with help from the federal government,
and that economic reforms instituted during the 1970s had resulted in
far more accurate forecasts of revenues and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the mid-1970s, the economic foundation remains strong,"
the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said the city's population is at a record high of more
than 8 million, major corporations are constructing headquarters in
Manhattan and hotel occupancy rates have recovered to their levels of
before the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, welfare cases have declined by more than 33,000 and
crime has dropped 5%, the mayor noted.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he warned that "painful" service cuts remain
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great if I could look everybody in the eye and say,
'You can have the chicken in every pot,' and nobody has to pay for
it," Bloomberg said. "That's not the real world."</TE>
<TE>   The city's almost $43-billion budget is larger than those of most
states, but financial planners have relatively little room to
maneuver because of debt service and fixed mandates by the state and
federal governments.</TE>

<HD>House Democrats Make History in Electing Pelosi</HD>
<DH>The San Francisco lawmaker will become the first woman to
head her party in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi won election easily Thursday as
leader of the House Democratic minority, making history for women and
reaching out to party moderates wary about the rise of a San
Francisco liberal.</LD>
<LD>   When the next Congress convenes in January, Pelosi will become the
first woman to head a party in either chamber of Congress, as well as
the first top party leader in the House from California.</LD>
<LD>   In another path-breaking selection, Democrats chose Rep. Robert
Menendez of New Jersey as caucus chairman -- their No. 3 House post.
A Cuban American, he will be the highest-ranking Latino ever in
congressional leadership.</LD>
<TE>   Pelosi, a 15-year veteran in Congress, smothered her lone
opponent, Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, 177 to 29, in a
closed-door meeting of Democrats. Ford, an African American, offered
himself as a centrist alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi's victory was never in doubt after a more prominent
centrist, Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, dropped out of the competition
last week and endorsed her.</TE>
<TE>   Her margin was nonetheless striking. With 86% of the caucus vote,
Pelosi outdid the 72% won by Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri,
the outgoing minority leader, when he first won the position eight
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Pelosi basked in the gender precedent Democrats
had just set. As a reporter attempted to break into her remarks with
a question, she cut him off gleefully: "I'm not finished yet. I've
been waiting over 200 years!"</TE>
<TE>   She added: "I didn't run as a woman. I ran, again, as a seasoned
politician and experienced legislator. It just so happens that I am a
woman, and we have been waiting a long time for this moment."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, 62, also quickly displayed the pragmatism that has helped
fuel her political ascendance, announcing that Rep. John M. Spratt
Jr. (D-S.C.) would serve as her leadership assistant. Spratt is a
fiscal conservative and a hawk on defense issues who hails from a
region where some Democrats have expressed concern that Pelosi's
selection could hurt the party.</TE>
<TE>   Spratt, who backed Pelosi, discounted such predictions. He said of
her: "She knows where the center of gravity is, and she'll seek it."</TE>
<TE>   To punctuate Pelosi's message of inclusion, the party chose Rep.
Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, a centrist, to succeed her in the No. 2
position of minority whip.</TE>
<TE>   Even before her election, Pelosi was making overtures to the
party's center, well aware of the criticism that she could take
Democrats too far to the left following their punishing losses to
Republicans in last week's midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Pelosi has consistently voted against the
Bush administration's social and economic agendas. She has also
broken with the president on some foreign policy questions, such as
the recent resolution authorizing the use of military force against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, she voted for a Republican-crafted bill to
establish a Department of Homeland Security -- months after she had
opposed a largely similar bill.</TE>
<TE>   And on Thursday, she offered words of conciliation after her
election. "Where we can find our common ground on the economy and on
other domestic issues, we shall seek it," Pelosi told reporters. "We
have that responsibility to the American people."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she made clear she is prepared to offer sharp
opposition to the GOP: "Where we cannot find that common ground, we
must stand our ground. The American people need us to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Hilda L. Solis of El Monte, who gave a speech nominating her,
said Pelosi would galvanize younger members of the party and draw
newcomers into it. "Latinas," Solis said. "Women, naturally. That's a
big plus for us."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi also drew immediate comparison to Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas),
the incoming House majority leader. She is every bit as liberal as he
is conservative. Both are fanatic fund-raisers with a sharp eye for
national party strategy. Both are vulnerable to caricature by
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   For California -- which will send 53 representatives to the House
when the 108th Congress convenes in January -- Pelosi's rise
increases the influence of a delegation whose influence has been
steadily growing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nancy becomes a symbol of what California is," said Rep. Sam Farr
(D-Carmel). "She's new, she's exciting, she's smart, she's
attractive, she's passionate."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 33 California Democrats in the new House, four will be
ranking minority members on committees: Reps. Henry A. Waxman of Los
Angeles on Government Reform, Tom Lantos of San Mateo on
International Relations, George Miller of Martinez on Education and
the Workforce, and Howard L. Berman of Mission Hills on Standards of
Official Conduct.</TE>
<TE>   California's 20 House Republicans have even more clout, since
their party controls the chamber. Rep. William M. Thomas of
Bakersfield chairs the Ways and Means Committee, overseeing taxes and
trade. Rep. David Dreier of San Dimas chairs the Rules Committee,
controlling the flow of legislation to the House floor. Rep.
Christopher Cox of Newport Beach chairs the Republican Policy
Committee, a leadership post, and Rep. John T. Doolittle of Rocklin
is the new GOP conference secretary.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Rep. Duncan Hunter of Alpine appears to have locked
up the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- a crucial
position in a time of military buildup. Rep. Jerry Lewis of Redlands
is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. And other
California Republicans could compete strongly for vacant
chairmanships on the Resources and Agriculture committees.</TE>
<TE>   But Pelosi will stand out.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush summons the four top congressional party
leaders to the White House, she will be there to speak for House
Democrats.</TE>

<HD>JFK Airport Begins Iris Scanning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>John F. Kennedy International Airport has become the first in the
nation to use iris scanning technology to prevent employee security
breaches.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy has been testing the technology on about 300 employees
working at Terminal 4 for two months, although the program is not
mandatory for now.</LD>
<LD>   John DeFelice, the international terminal's security director,
said the technology prevents employees from giving their ID cards to
someone else.</LD>
<TE>   "I can give my card, but I can't give my eyes to anyone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   DeFelice said he expects the Transportation Security
Administration, which oversees the nation's travel systems, to
require some sort of biometric screening for the terminal's 1,500
employees within the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark (N.J.) Liberty airports, is testing
different employee security systems but hasn't made a decision on
iris scanning.</TE>
<TE>   The $2,000 iris scanner and a $15,000 door barring entry into a
secure area have been installed at the customs area leading to the
tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   The scanner stores 247 traits of a person's iris into a computer
and on his or her ID card's magnetic strip. Terminal officials said
they believe the technique is more specific than fingerprinting,
which checks for 85 traits.</TE>
<TE>   After swiping their cards, workers peer into the scanner for 10 to
15 seconds, until the door clicks open. The system works with contact
lenses and eyeglasses, but not with sunglasses.</TE>

<HD>Bush Weighing Plan to Offer Smallpox Vaccine to the Public</HD>
<DH>Inoculations would be voluntary. They might not be
available until early 2004, though some in the administration want to
move faster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush is moving toward approving a plan to eventually offer
the smallpox vaccine to all Americans, starting with health-care
workers most likely to come into contact with a contagious patient,
administration officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   He has not, however, signed off on key details or a final plan.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is closer to a decision on shots for the military. Officials
said he is inclined to approve a blueprint for vaccinating some U.S.
troops against the disease, which was eradicated two decades ago but
could return in biowarfare.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's top bioterrorism aides agree that the vaccine should
eventually be offered to the public, and officials said Thursday that
Bush is comfortable with that plan. At issue is how fast to move
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   A once-feared disease, smallpox historically killed 30% of its
victims. The virus also could be a powerful weapon. It is highly
contagious and has no known treatment. Routine vaccinations in the
United States ended in 1972, making the population highly vulnerable
to an attack.</TE>
<TE>   But the vaccine, made from a live virus, is also dangerous. Health
experts estimate that one or two of every million people vaccinated
for the first time will die, and about 15 others will suffer
life-threatening side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal for the military, the first personnel to
receive the vaccine would be "first responders" -- troops responsible
for assisting in domestic disasters, such as a bioweapons attack.
They include medical specialists.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 500,000 troops might eventually be inoculated, senior
defense officials have said. Of the 1.4 million men and women in the
active-duty military, fewer than half have ever received the smallpox
vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is moving toward smallpox decisions as a prelude to possible
war with Iraq, which U.S. intelligence officials believe has smallpox
samples.</TE>
<TE>   Amid heightened concerns, the Pentagon is pushing to provide every
available form of protection for troops who might be exposed to germ
weapons in Iraq or elsewhere. Unlike the civilian vaccination
program, which would be entirely voluntary, troops would be required
to get the shots.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney, a former Defense secretary, is among
those who have pushed most aggressively for protecting the military
and the general civilian population against smallpox attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has postponed announcing a decision on vaccinating the
civilian population until after he returns from a NATO summit in
Europe on Nov. 23. Aides said they did not know when he would
disclose his decision on vaccinating troops.</TE>
<TE>   For the civilian population, top health officials favor offering
the shots first to people on special smallpox response teams and to
those who work in emergency rooms. Next would be about 10 million
others, including emergency responders and other health-care workers.
Eventually, the vaccine would be offered to the public, though not
until there was enough FDA-approved vaccine available, probably in
early 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the White House favor moving ahead more quickly, offering
it to the public even before FDA approval.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspects Indicted in Louisiana</HD>
<DH>Ballistic tests link a slaying in Baton Rouge to the
Washington-area attacks. Prosecutors in Washington also file murder
charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>A state grand jury Thursday indicted the Washington-area sniper
suspects on first-degree murder charges for a killing in Baton Rouge,
while prosecutors in Washington filed their own charges against the
pair.</LD>
<LD>   The Louisiana victim, Hong Im Ballenger, 45, was shot Sept. 23
during a robbery at the beauty products shop she managed. Prosecutors
said they will seek the death penalty for John Allen Muhammad and Lee
Boyd Malvo.</LD>
<LD>   "These two individuals now have a date in Baton Rouge because of
this indictment," said John Sinquefield, assistant district attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Sinquefield said he was unsure when Muhammad and Malvo would be
able to stand trial in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in Washington charged the pair with first-degree
murder while armed in the Oct. 3 shooting of Pascal Charlot, 72.
Charlot was standing on a street when he was killed. The charge
carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Washington and Louisiana are among several jurisdictions waiting
to prosecute the men suspected in a months-long shooting spree that
left 14 people dead and five others wounded. The others are Maryland,
Virginia, Washington state, Alabama and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic tests positively linked the .223-caliber bullet used in
the Baton Rouge killing of Ballenger with the weapon used in several
of the Washington-area sniper killings, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Store receipts found in the car driven by Muhammad, 41, and Malvo,
17, also show that the men were in Baton Rouge on the day of the
Ballenger shooting, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Ballenger was shot once in the head and her purse was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, federal agents in Baton Rouge cut trees and used
metal detectors and dogs to search the woods where some of Muhammad's
relatives and childhood friends live.</TE>
<TE>   They cut trees and hauled away limbs and trunks. Possible evidence
was sacked in brown paper bags and the ground was squared out in
grids and methodically searched.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was similar to that in Tacoma, Wash., last month when
authorities searched a home where Muhammad once lived, looking for
casings and bullet fragments.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo, 17, is being held in the Fairfax County jail in Virginia,
charged in the Oct. 14 slaying of FBI analyst Linda Franklin, 47,
outside a home improvement store in Falls Church, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad, now held in Prince William County, Va., is charged with
killing Dean Harold Meyers, 53.</TE>

<HD>Arrest of Fugitive Terrorist Suspect at Bus Stop Is
Disclosed</HD>
<DH>A federal indictment accuses 'Abdella' and three others
already in custody of plotting attacks in the U.S., Turkey and
Jordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A fugitive terrorist suspect was arrested at a bus stop this month in
North Carolina and is being transferred to Michigan to face federal
terrorism charges, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, identified in federal court papers only as "Abdella,"
allegedly provided direction for three others who sought to buy
weapons, obtain false identity documents and identify security
breaches at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, according to court
documents.</LD>
<LD>   The men are allegedly members of Salafiyya, or "True Path," a
radical Islamic group affiliated with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network, and were plotting "violent attacks against persons and
buildings within the territory of Jordan, Turkey and the United
States," according to an indictment of them issued in August.</LD>
<TE>   The case was the first in which authorities said they had
uncovered an active sleeper cell in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   All four men were accused of supporting terrorism and document
fraud, but Abdella has been a fugitive until now. Two others -- Karim
Koubriti and Ahmed Hannan -- have been in federal custody since the
FBI raided their Dearborn, Mich., apartment in September of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth member of the group, Farouk Haimoud, was arrested at
the same time. He was released a short time later but rearrested in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Koubriti, Hannan and Hammoud pleaded not guilty to the charges in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Abdella was arrested Nov. 5 in Greensboro, N.C., as he waited to
board a bus, according to law enforcement sources. Authorities
declined to say how he was identified or where he was headed.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Klauer, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Greensboro, said Abdella appeared before a magistrate and waived his
right to a detention hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Detroit, said Abdella could be arraigned as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Abdella is believed to be from Morocco. He lived primarily in the
Chicago area in recent years and is suspected of being a regular
visitor to the Dearborn apartment during that time, law enforcement
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items seized there were a videotape that contained
footage of Disneyland and other U.S. landmarks, as well as the MGM
Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also found a day planner containing sketches of a U.S.
airbase in Turkey and notes about a planned December 2000 trip to the
base by then-Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who canceled the
visit over concerns about a terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the indictment says, the group attempted to "directly
access airlines" for possible terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Koubriti and Hannan worked in the kitchen of an airline catering
firm in the summer of 2001. Abdella is described in the indictment as
an expert in airport security operations.</TE>

<HD>2 Florida Boys Get Reduced Sentences</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PENSACOLA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two teenage boys who bludgeoned their father to death with a baseball
bat pleaded guilty Thursday to reduced charges and got up to eight
years in prison after a judge threw out their convictions, sparing
them a much harsher sentence.</LD>
<LD>   In strong, clear voices, Derek King, 14, and his brother, Alex,
13, admitted to third-degree murder and arson; they burned down the
house around their father's body last year.</LD>
<LD>   Derek was sentenced to eight years in prison, Alex seven -- well
below the 12 1/2-year minimum specified under state guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   The case drew widespread attention in part because prosecutors
presented evidence at one trial that an adult friend of the teens was
the killer, but told another jury the boys did it.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Circuit Judge Frank Bell tossed out the boys'
second-degree murder convictions, saying the brothers' rights were
violated by the "unusual and bizarre" way prosecutors simultaneously
presented contradictory theories of the crime. He ordered both sides
to try to resolve the case in mediation.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were facing prison terms of 20 years to life before
the convictions were thrown out. They were tried as adults in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The boys' mother, Kelly Marino -- who has not lived with them for
several years -- made a last-ditch effort to have them examined by
mental health experts before they pleaded guilty, but the judge said
the request had no standing.</TE>
<TE>   The boys told the judge that they understood what they were doing.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Marino denounced the plea bargain and said her sons
had no idea what they were admitting to. She was accompanied by
lawyers hired by comedian Rosie O'Donnell to help with the case.
Those attorneys did not participate in the mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not right. This is America. Unbelievable," Marino said,
shaking her head in disbelief. "We do plan to challenge this."</TE>
<TE>   Terry King, 40, was beaten with an aluminum bat as he slept in a
recliner at his Cantonment home. The house was then torched to cover
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The boys, who were 12 and 13 at the time, gave detailed
confessions to police: Derek said he swung the bat and Alex said he
had urged his brother to kill their father because they were afraid
of being punished for running away from home.</TE>
<TE>   The boys later recanted and pinned the slaying on Ricky Chavis, a
41-year-old convicted child molester and family friend.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis was acquitted of first-degree murder but remains jailed on
other charges of accessory after the fact to murder, evidence
tampering and sexual molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors in the boys' trial said they believed Chavis wielded the
bat. But they said they convicted the boys because they let Chavis
into the house.</TE>
<TE>   The case was the latest murder trial involving a child in Florida,
which leads the nation in the prosecution of juveniles as adults.</TE>
<TE>   Nathaniel Brazill was 13 when he shot his teacher to death two
years ago. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to
28 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Also that year, 15-year-old John Silva kidnapped and strangled a
12-year-old neighbor. He is serving life without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Lionel Tate, 12, was sentenced to life without parole for fatally
body-slamming a 6-year-old neighbor in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The mediator in the King case, Bill Eddins, said the brothers will
serve their sentences with boys of the same age and will attend
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Eddins said a physician and a psychologist will be available for
counseling at all times.</TE>

<HD>2 Soldiers in Louisiana Hit by Tank, Killed During Drill</HD>
<DH>Casualties of the Ft. Polk training exercise were with the
3rd Brigade of 101st Airborne Division out of Ft. Campbell, Ky.,
recently in Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FT. POLK, La.</DL>
<LD>Two soldiers involved in an urban assault drill were killed Thursday
when they were run over by a 63-ton tank.</LD>
<LD>   The accident came a day after an Air Force Reserve F-16 fighter
crashed in Utah, killing the pilot. That crash was the second fatal
accident involving F-16s in Utah in less than three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers were with the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne
Division out of Ft. Campbell, Ky., which was recently stationed in
Afghanistan, Ft. Polk spokesman Ron Elliott said.</LD>
<TE>   Elliott said he didn't know whether the soldiers had seen overseas
service.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred about 5:20 a.m.; both soldiers were taken by
helicopter to the Ft. Polk hospital, where they were pronounced dead,
Elliott said.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 soldiers were participating in the predawn drill at the
Army's Joint Readiness Training Center. The victims were run over by
an M-1 Abrams tank, Elliott said. They were not part of the tank's
crew, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Their identities were withheld until relatives could be notified.
The accident was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The drill involved a battalion-size force trying to take over an
urban target, Elliott said. The training center has a simulated
village that was the target of the drill.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott said the 101st was not training for any specific
deployment, such as Iraq, and that the exercises were scheduled a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 101st Airborne is a rapid-deployment, air assault division
trained to go anywhere in the world within 36 hours.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 soldiers from the division's 3rd Brigade, 187th
Regiment, fought in Afghanistan. The division's tour ended in August.</TE>
<TE>   In Utah on Wednesday afternoon, the single-seat F-16C went down in
the desert, killing Lt. Col. Dillion L. McFarland, 40, a member of
the 419th Fighter Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities located the wreckage and McFarland's body about 2 1/2
hours later, said Stephanie Johns, a fighter wing spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word concerning what caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland, a commercial pilot, husband and father of two who lived
near Hill Air Force Base, joined the 419th in 1998 and had more than
3,000 flying hours in an F-16, including 85 combat hours, Johns said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of the
warrior we lost," fighter wing commander Col. Wayne Conroy said.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland's jet crashed about 25 miles northeast of Wendover, over
the military's test and training range.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland's jet was carrying no live weapons, but had an inert
missile used for training purposes, Maj. Shawn Mecham said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 25, two F-16Cs collided about 25 miles southeast of
Wendover. One pilot ejected safely.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the other pilot, Lt. Jorma Huhtala, was found the next
day after an extensive search, several miles from the wreckage of his
plane.</TE>
<TE>   That crash remains under investigation.</TE>

<HD>NASA's Unlucky Number Might Have Returned</HD>
<DH>Ex-astronaut notes eerie parallels between his Apollo 13
and shuttle's 113th mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Even James A. Lovell can't help but notice the spooky similarities
between his flight, Apollo 13, and NASA's upcoming space shuttle
mission, No. 113.</LD>
<LD>   Endeavour is still grounded, nearly a week after it was supposed
to blast off to the international space station.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, you know, this is shuttle 1-1-3. One hundred and-thirteen.
Two people have been removed from the shuttle for medical problems.
They have an oxygen leak," Lovell, Apollo 13's commander, said
Thursday evening at the local premiere of the movie "Apollo 13: The
IMAX Experience."</LD>
<TE>   "Hear a story there, Ron?"</TE>
<TE>   He was talking to Ron Howard, who directed "Apollo 13."</TE>
<TE>   Lovell, Howard and Tom Hanks, who portrayed Lovell on the big
screen, were at Kennedy Space Center for a dinner and showing of the
IMAX movie to raise money for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, NASA called off Endeavour's launch with just a
few hours remaining because of a leak in the astronauts' oxygen
supply. Lovell and his crew were on their way to the moon when an
oxygen tank in their service module ruptured on April 13, 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle's oxygen leak was traced to a deformed flex hose,
hardly a rupture.</TE>
<TE>   As for other resemblances, the Endeavour mission lost two crewmen
over the summer for health reasons. Substitutes stepped in. Apollo 13
lost one, but the switch in command module pilots occurred much
closer to launch, after the countdown had begun.</TE>
<TE>   Hanks said he did not think, initially, that he was right for the
starring role.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I thought it was the most hideous casting imaginable,"
Hanks said. "Shouldn't somebody else that is better looking or can
come in and make people fear you somehow? Because without knowing
Jim, I thought, 'He must be an incredibly fearful, commanding sort of
presence.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then I get to know Jim and I see that, look, he's a very charming
man. He's a great storyteller. He seems to have this wonderful zest
for life and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "He's also deeply, deeply competitive to the point of making sure
that he drives the car. He's the commander."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks then conspiratorially lowered his voice. "And I said, 'OK,
well in that case, I think I can have an approach on which I could
have some things in common.' "</TE>
<TE>   NASA is planning to launch Endeavour no earlier than Monday. While
fixing the oxygen leak, workers accidentally bumped a platform into
the shuttle robot arm. Managers are assessing the damage.</TE>

<KH>ACTION IN CONGRESS</KH>
<HD>2 Bills Extending Jobless Aid OKd</HD>
<DH>House and Senate measures afford more assistance but for
different time periods. No other action is seen before adjournment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House and Senate approved separate unemployment benefits bills
Thursday night as lawmakers rushed to get their legislation approved
before adjourning the postelection session and heading home for the
year.</LD>
<LD>   The House bill would extend unemployment benefits for victims of
the recession. Congress had approved a 13-week extension of
unemployment benefits as part of an economic stimulus package it
passed earlier this year, but that extension expires Dec. 31.</LD>
<LD>   The House bill would provide for another five weeks of benefits
for those who have not yet exhausted their extension. That's designed
to give lawmakers time to return in January and examine the issue
further.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate approved by voice vote a version that would offer an
extension through the end of March. It would also allow people who
have exhausted their regular 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to
qualify for the extension, lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   "The House passed a one-month program. This is a three-month
program," said Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.). "I happen to think it's a
more orderly, more well-thought-out program."</TE>
<TE>   "Extending unemployment insurance is not just the right thing to
do for working Americans, it is good economic policy," said Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), one of the authors of the
legislation. "I am calling on our colleagues in the House to pass
this extension before they adjourn."</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely that the House will consider the Senate's bill
before going home for the year, or that the Senate will consider the
House's bill before going home for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The House's bill also extends a welfare law and restores Medicare
payments to doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare provisions would extend the welfare law through March
31 to give lawmakers time to pass legislation renewing it.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers have negotiated for months on how best to renew the
landmark 1996 bill that overhauled the nation's welfare program. But
they remain hung up over issues such as whether welfare recipients
should be forced to work more hours each week and how much money
Washington should send states to help pay for child care.</TE>
<TE>   The government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would
get the legal protection to fix problems with a Medicare payment
formula that decides how much doctors get paid.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have said the faulty formula has caused them to lose
billions of dollars because it is tied to the economy, which is
struggling. Doctors have already taken a 5.4% cut and are facing
another 12% in cuts, equaling about $11 billion, over the next three
years. Many have begun to refuse to accept Medicare patients.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and the Bush administration agreed the payment formula
is unfair and expressed interest in finding a remedy. But the issue
got bogged down after the House and Senate wanted to include money
for hospitals, HMOs and other providers against White House wishes.
Thursday's provision does not offer new money to fix the problem, as
earlier proposals in Congress did.</TE>
<TE>   It simply gives the administration the legal protection to correct
the problem if it chooses.</TE>

<HD>Senate Votes for Memorial to Wellstone</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate voted Thursday to help establish a "living memorial" to
the late Sen. Paul Wellstone and his wife through the creation of an
immigrant community center in St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   "Paul, this is our first step toward finishing your work," said
the measure's sponsor, Sen. Dean Barkley, an independent from
Minnesota who is filling out the term of Wellstone, a Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   The House was expected to take up the bill late Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation authorizes $10 million in federal funds toward a
$25-million "Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community
Building." It would be part of Neighborhood House, a century-old
social service agency for immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.) said the legislation was a fitting
tribute to Wellstone's "undying compassion" for new Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The Wellstones were killed in a plane crash last month along with
their 33-year-old daughter, Marcia Wellstone Markuson, and five
others.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood House already has a $5.5-million commitment from the
city of St. Paul; it hopes to raise the remaining $10 million from
the state and private sources next year.</TE>
<TE>   The social service agency hopes to begin construction next year
and open in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Jury Calls for Death in 5 Kansas Murders</HD>
<DH>Two Wichita brothers were convicted of forcing victims to
engage in sex acts before shooting them on a snowy soccer field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WICHITA, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Jurors returned a verdict of death Thursday for two brothers
convicted of shooting five people on a snow-covered soccer field.</LD>
<LD>   It took jurors about seven hours to decide the sentence for
Reginald Carr, who turned 25 Thursday, and his brother Jonathan, 22.
They were convicted last week of capital murder for the December 2000
deaths of four of the victims, and of attempted murder for the
shooting of the fifth.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers also were convicted of first-degree murder in the
shooting of another woman four days before that attack.</LD>
<TE>   In their closing arguments Wednesday, prosecutors urged jurors to
show the brothers the same mercy the two showed the five friends,
ages 25 to 29, who were forced to engage in sex acts with each other
before they were shot on the soccer field. The women also were raped.</TE>
<TE>   "What murder would warrant the death penalty, if it is not this?
It defies reason to think torturous slaughter of these four young
people who gave no fight," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said just one juror could decide to show the
brothers mercy and spare their lives. If the judge rejects the jury's
recommendation, the brothers will spend at least 50 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Any one of you can decide to save this young man's life," Ron
Evans, Jonathan Carr's attorney, had said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can decide there is some good there. There is something worth
saving."</TE>
<TE>   Jay Greeno, the attorney for Reginald Carr, said his client was
the product of an abusive household, and he urged jurors to think
about the effect an execution would have on Carr's three young
children.</TE>
<TE>   The only survivor of the shootings, then a 25-year-old teacher,
ran naked through the snow to get help after she and her friends were
taken to the field, lined up on their knees and shot. She identified
her attackers and testified against them at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the brothers tried to blame each other for the
killings. Jonathan Carr's attorney said his client was innocent of
some of the crimes and that his brother was the leader in the
quadruple murder. Reginald Carr's attorney contended that most DNA
evidence pointed to Jonathan Carr.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas has not had an execution since the death penalty was
reinstated in 1994.</TE>
