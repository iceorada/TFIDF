<LD>Count on the hottest weather of the year this month, but also get
ready for our best planting season. Fall planting begins after the
middle of the month, peaks in October and lasts into December. The
days are getting shorter and the weather will be growing cooler, so
if you have grand plans, start soon.</LD>
<LD>   Don't ease up on the watering quite yet--it's still summer in that
respect. Those who live in fire-prone areas should remember that the
Santa Ana winds that fan fires typically start this month.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as possible, get rid of weeds where you plan to plant.
Water the area thoroughly several times--as if you are trying to help
a new lawn to sprout. This gets perennial weeds such as Bermuda grass
(devil grass) growing and sprouts weed seeds. A week or two later,
when everything's up, spray the area with Roundup or Finale. Both
herbicides move from leaves to roots, killing the whole plant but not
affecting the soil.</LD>
<TE>   Follow directions carefully (herbicides work best during warm,
sunny weather), and give them time to work. Then you are ready to
prepare the soil and plant, and you won't spend hours trying to get
weeds out of your new plantings.</TE>

<LD>Who Was John Philip Sousa?</LD>
<LD>   Do you remember what you did on the Fourth of July? If you were
watching a fireworks display, you probably heard music playing. And
that music was probably "Stars and Stripes Forever" by John Philip
Sousa.</LD>
<LD>   America has had many great composers, but one of the most famous
was John Philip Sousa. He was called "The March King" because he
wrote hundreds of marches for all sorts of occasions. One of the most
famous is the "Washington Post," which he wrote to honor the winner
of a children's writing contest held by the Washington Post
newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   Sousa composed most of his music for a wind band, which is an
orchestra without string instruments (but lots of brass and drums!).
Sousa's wind band concerts were famous in America and around the
world. In fact, 100 years ago, long before television or movie
theaters, there would often be as many as 30,000 people at a Sousa
concert.</TE>
<TE>   This Sunday, Symphony in the Glen celebrates National Grandparents
Day in Griffith Park. You can hear the "Washington Post" and a lot of
other great music from America and around the world. Beginning at
1:30 p.m., children and grandparents can join the "Junior &amp; Senior
Maestro Workshop," where they will have a chance to conduct the
symphony in a Sousa march. Then, when the maestro strikes up the
band, close your eyes and imagine what it was like 100 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The concert is free. Seating is picnic-style. Concertgoers are
encouraged to bring blankets. For more information, visit
www.symphonyin theglen.org or call (213) 955-6976.</TE>
<TE>   *This Learning Link was written by Arthur B. Rubinstein, conductor
of Symphony in the Glen, which performs at Griffith Park, 4800
Carousel Drive, near the merry-go-round (follow park signs on entry).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* My favorite dinosaur is brachiosaurus. I like it because it only
eats plants or leaves and not meat. Also because it's really big.
Finally, I like it because it doesn't look that scary. (Mitzi, 10)</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite dinosaur is the brontosaurus. He was big but not
safe. There was another dinosaur that wanted to eat him--allosaurus.
When allosaurus came near, brontosaurus ran through the mud and
splashed through the water. Allosaurus did not have long legs like
brontosaurus so he could not follow him into the deep water. When
brontosaurus got to the deep water, he was safe. (Michel, 10)</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite is Tyrannosaurus rex. They were the biggest, meanest
dinosaurs and were meat-eaters. Their name means they were king of
the lizards. (Christine, 10)</LD>
<TE>   * My favorite is triceratops. Its favorite food was tough plants.
It was a herbivore. It had a huge head with three horns, a short one
on its nose and long horns on its forehead. It was like a powerfully
built elephant. It had hundreds of teeth and could deliver
bone-crushing bites. (Jessica, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * Carnotaurus is my favorite. They were meat-eating dinosaurs,
similar in body and structure to T. rex, but with three-clawed hands.
They had a unique, blunt, tall skull sporting large horns over each
eye. (Julio, 10)</TE>

Oxnard Street Elementary in North Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>In Knitting Circles, Women Weave Their Prayers Into Cloths
of Comfort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THERESA SULLIVAN BARGER</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>When Elaine Wiatr's friend lost her husband to suicide, she felt
words wouldn't be enough. To show her concern, she gave her a
hand-knitted shawl.</LD>
<LD>   When she presented the purple shawl to her friend, fellow
parishioner Jeanne Ebaugh, she knew it was right. Ebaugh took a deep
breath, and Wiatr sensed an almost immediate calming.</LD>
<LD>   "Jeanne picked it up and wrapped it around herself. It was like
she was being wrapped in comfort," said Wiatr.</LD>
<TE>   The shawl was made by a prayer shawl ministry group from their
parish, St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church in Hartford. The group has
been knitting together for more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Galo and Janet Bristow are credited with starting the
practice of knitting shawls--called prayer, comfort, healing or
friendship shawls--and giving them to those grieving, suffering from
illness or celebrating a milestone. Since early 1998, it has spread
across the United States and to several foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   A Y-Me breast cancer support group in Old Saybrook, Conn., gives a
hand-knitted shawl to each new member at her first meeting. A group
of girls in western Massachusetts knits shawls to give to each baby
baptized in their church. A shawl recipient in Michigan knits them to
give to other oncology patients.</TE>
<TE>   Ebaugh says the shawl she received represented all the love and
compassion she and her family had felt from her church community
since her husband died, leaving her alone to raise their three
children, now 9, 14 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   "Truly to wrap yourself up in that shawl is to feel the support
and the prayers of everybody. I'm including not only the woman who
knit this shawl but the ministry, everyone from church. You could
literally feel it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after Ebaugh unwrapped the shawl, her youngest child,
Sarah, walked into the room and sat in her lap. Ebaugh enveloped both
of them in the shawl, providing comfort and warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the knitters say they draw comfort from the shawls just
by knitting them.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's a way to put my faith into action for women with
breast cancer," said the Rev. Toni Smith, spiritual director at the
Spiritual Life Center in Bloomfield, Conn., and a United Church of
Christ minister.</TE>
<TE>   The Chester resident heard of the shawl ministry and brought the
idea to her Old Saybrook breast-cancer support group. "My concern for
women with breast cancer isn't limited to knitting shawls, but it's a
way for me to actually do something," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Praying while knitting is a matter of personal choice. Whether the
knitter prays or just thinks about the recipient, these shawls tap
into people's sixth sense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a spiritual practice," Galo said. "I've even cried. I was
making a shawl for this woman; it was the anniversary of her two
children's deaths....I couldn't help but weep when I knitted this for
her because I'm a mother."</TE>
<TE>   "On the knitter's part, it's a prayerful process--from the
selection of color, the blessing of the yarn and needles, keeping the
person's intentions in mind, saying prayers as you knit," Bristow
said.</TE>
<TE>   While variations have emerged, many church groups also include a
prayer for the recipient. Women gather in groups to knit, light a
candle, play soft music and often say a prayer that the recipient
will be comforted and strengthened by receiving the shawl.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church, where Bristow started and leads
a ministry, knitters pass around their shawls so others can stitch in
a row, symbolizing the collective goodwill woven into each shawl. The
church also includes a lavender sachet and a letter explaining the
symbolism of the color and the stitching--knit three, purl three. The
Y-Me breast-cancer support group ties on a pink ribbon and wraps each
one in pink tissue paper.</TE>
<TE>   Bristow sees the shawl as a universal symbol of caring.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have no words for someone who is grieving or in a
serious situation. You want to say the right words to make it all
better. With this, you don't need any words," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa Sullivan Barger writes for the Hartford Courant, a Tribune
company.</TE>

<LD>My hands feel sticky from the punch. "Let's go find a faucet so I can
wash off," I say.</LD>
<LD>   As I rub my hands under the water, Little Dude says again, "I'm
sorry, Deon."</LD>
<LD>   "Never mind," I tell him. "Those two weren't going to take either
of us anyway."</LD>
<TE>   "After this picnic is over," he says, "what happens to you and
me?"</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you go back to Hilltop. I don't know about me."</TE>
<TE>   "How come?"</TE>
<TE>   "My foster family has to move. They can't take me along."</TE>
<TE>   "Will I ever see you again, Deon?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe. Maybe not." I feel sad saying that, but I can't let on.
That wouldn't be cool. "No sweat, buddy. You'll have another chance
next year."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I think. Another chance to be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   We hear the scrunch of gravel under car tires. A blue Honda is
turning into the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude jumps up and down. "Do you see what I see, Deon?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on," I warn him. But I have a look. It's Mr. and Mrs. Otis,
all right. Couldn't be anyone else in those shirts!</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude starts to run toward them. "Wait," I tell him, holding
him back. "Maybe they want that baby with the bow in her hair."</TE>
<TE>   When they come to the baby, she reaches up with both her chubby
arms. I bet they won't be able to resist that. They can't. Mrs. Otis
picks her up.</TE>

<LD>Bettijane Levine paints a sympathetic picture of the poor, misguided
perils of spendthrift Karyn Bosnak ("Digging Herself Out of Debt
Through Others' Pockets," Aug. 27). But all of Ms. Bosnak's financial
problems are of her own doing. No one did this to her. Eyes wide
open. Pocketbook wide open. Brain nonfunctional. Bosnak's cop-out
excuses of "my mom thinks that shopping solves everything," and "I
just grew up that way" cannot excuse her irresponsible behavior. She
states that " ... in her 20s ... she was soon earning $100,000 a
year." I earn a lot less and have been supporting a family of four
for many years without going into the enormous debt she has amassed
in two years.</LD>
<TE>   Here's some novel ideas: When the credit card companies send
promos offering great rates on credit cards, throw them out! Her
premise of running up the balance on a card and transferring the
balance to a new card to create a zero balance, and using that card
again, is the height of financial suicide. Get a roommate. Try
JCPenney and Robinsons-May. Six-hundred-dollar coats--aaarrgghh! I
could outfit my family for that amount. And the topper--$800 a month
for a personal trainer. Get a grip on reality, girl. But here's the
real insult to our intelligence: She goes on the Internet to beg for
money and offer advice to others in the same situation. There are a
slew of words for a person like that, but for editorial purposes I'll
say she's got a heck of a load of nerve. Books and film in her
future? Forget about it. She should be held up to public view as an
example of the perfect idiot. And then promptly ignored.</TE>

<LD>The church of Jesus Christ has nothing to do with a "cathedra" (a
bishop's official throne) ("How the Cathedral Will Become 'Catholic,'
" Aug. 20). There is no throne except the throne of God, and he has
no earthly building, but dwells in the heart of every Christian: "Do
you [Christians] not know that you are the temple of God, and that
the spirit of God dwells in you?" (1 Cor. 3:16). A physical building
has no significance except as a convenient place to assemble. Jesus
said that the place of worship does not matter, but rather "worship
in spirit and truth" (John 4:21-24).</LD>
<LD>   This cathedral is largely about expense and ostentation, hierarchy
and hullabaloo. Especially when perhaps the majority of the area's
Catholics are needy immigrants and their children, the expenditure of
hundreds of millions of dollars on a building is truly obscene.</LD>

<LD>I would like to commend Thomas Curwen for his story about Mary Lou
Heard, her life and her nursery ("She Sowed, and Reaped Life's
Lessons," Aug 19). He wrote elegantly and compassionately about a
woman who brings the mystery of fragile nature and fragile attitude
into all our lives. I suffer from a terminal disease and find great
joy in tending my tiny garden. I was moved to tears when I read the
story. I am inspired by her words, "We are not called upon to think
about how close to death we are, but rather to consider the gifts
that have been given to us."</LD>
<LD>   Again I am reminded that life holds more beauty than fiction.</LD>

<LD>While I commend Marjean Tinoco for trying to save infants' lives ("A
Poolful of Guppies and Wails," Aug. 18), I question her methodology.
Screaming does not go with the territory, as she claims. When she
started teaching swimming 50 years ago, that was indeed the way to
teach young children to swim. However, gentle and loving techniques
were developed using fun and music and games. I invite Marjean Tinoco
to attend one of our conferences to see the advantages of a gentle
approach to preschool age swimming.</LD>

<LD>NO CERTAIN REST</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Jim Lehrer</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   226 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Battles such as the one fought on this ground are never really
over. The force of the collision and the rawness of the death and the
loudness of the screams preclude certain rest." So ruminates retired
U.S. Army Col. Gary Wayne Doleman in view of the banks of Antietam
Creek, 135 years after the carnage that took place there. The
fictional colonel's words not only provide an apt title for the
disturbing, engrossing novel through which he ambles as a sort of
Virgilian guide to that hellish Civil War battlefield--they also
presage modern-day embroilments.</TE>
<TE>   Judged by its cover, "No Certain Rest" bears all the earmarks of a
handy beach-blanket mystery, embellished with sufficient Civil War
facticity and pedagogy to attract the not inconsiderable book-buying
population of buffs.</TE>
<TE>   Read from the inside, however, Jim Lehrer's re-visitation of the
morning of Sept. 17, 1862, is the chronicle of a haunting. In his
concluding notes, the prolific and multifaceted author (yes, that Jim
Lehrer, who apart from other accomplishments numbers 12 novels to his
name) implies that he struggled to finish the writing of this story.
In fact, he says, without the encouragement of people close to him,
especially his wife, "this novel would never have seen the light of
day."</TE>
<TE>   One might seek an underlying reason for such authorial reluctance
in light of passages like this one: "[I]n an excerpt from a
Hartford-published pamphlet ... Don found an account of the death of
Lieutenant Allbritten.... Don saw long streams of red blood and hunks
and pieces of hair and skin and blue uniform and skull and brains
splatter to the winds. Then he saw the bloody stump of a man's neck
as the rest of his headless body fell to the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer would not be the first writer to be so shaken by the grisly
nature of his material that he can hardly set it down on the page.
And what exerts the opposing fascination? Surely it is that, as the
colonel tells his younger, civilian friend Don, " 'This is the place
to be astonished that all of these young men, on both sides, so
willingly gave their lives.... It is a wonder-- an
astonishment--there was not more running the other way, that honor so
ruled this battlefield.' " The event that rejoins the two men on a
spring day in 1998 at Antietam Creek is the very recent discovery
there, by Civil War relic hunters, of human bones. The remains of a
Union officer, no less. And despite those afore-cited accounts of Lt.
Allbritten's having been blown to high heaven, Don finds evidence
leading him to suspect that this intact corpse, apparently executed
by a pistol shot to the head, might be that of the hero of the
Connecticut Eleventh.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Don--respectfully addressed by colleagues as Dr. Don
Spaniel--has an unusual job, a dream job from the point of view of
the Civil War-obsessed: He is an archeologist in the employ of the
National Park Service, a sort of "skinny guy in glasses," Indiana
Jones to the buried secrets of the War Between the States. He's
single ("I'm accused of living too much in the past"), skilled at
maneuvering within bureaucratic budget limits, and has the team and
tools at his command to solve the mystery of this murdered Union
soldier.</TE>
<TE>   As a mystery novel, "No Certain Rest" has certain problems. Not
least of these is the classic pitfall of an overly visible
solution--visible, that is, to all but the questing protagonist. In
this case, by page 85 the outlines of motive, weapon, perpetrator and
stratagem have been pretty well disinterred, but Don's eureka moment
doesn't occur until a good 50 pages later.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do the personal conflicts of the detective's life take up the
slack in suspense, for Don has no personal life, no girl (nor much
desire for one), no friends but the distant, and dying, colonel. (One
wonders why Don Spaniel bears such an unprepossessing last name, in
contrast to the manly sounding Allbritten. One wonders at an academic
PhD's being routinely called "doctor," without demurring.)</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the writing style in the present-day passages can be as
stiff and flat--"Don's brain quickly got cramped, and his hand got
cramped from note taking"--as a Park Service memo.</TE>
<TE>   However, the heart of "No Certain Rest" isn't Don's surface story.
A good part of the book, its most riveting passages, are presented as
excerpts from memoirs written by Union soldiers and veterans.</TE>
<TE>   These first-person voices are consistently compelling. They paint
vivid tableaux; they shine with the truthfulness, hard-held values
and modesty of an unrecoverable age.</TE>
<TE>   It comes then as no great surprise to learn from Lehrer's notes
that "the words ... to describe the horror on the battlefield are
taken directly from real soldiers' first-person accounts in letters."
These accounts of doubt and valor lead us straight to the real riddle
for our more cynical time, the same mystery that consumed Col.
Doleman--Why did so many young men, especially from the relatively
unthreatened North, volunteer to risk death?</TE>
<TE>   There is surely no single, simple answer.</TE>
<TE>   But one motive seemed to dominate all others, namely, the value of
preserving the ideal of the Union, and the yet-unfulfilled destiny of
these United States. Those boys marched into battle believing, as
their commander in chief exhorted, that "a house divided against
itself cannot stand."</TE>

<DH>A squalid upbringing yields a grimly droll memoir</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Augusten Burroughs smiles as yet another reader approaches his table
inside Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard on a recent evening.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm Mike," the fan tells Burroughs, who is signing copies of his
bestselling memoir. "You know, I e-mailed you...."</LD>
<LD>   Burroughs offers a few noncommittal sympathies--Mike is just one
of several hundred readers who have felt a compelling need to contact
the author, having read "Running With Scissors" (St. Martin's Press,
2002). At times, fans have offered Burroughs intimate confidences, at
times their own unsolicited memories, in response to his story of how
his unstable mother gave him away to be raised by her crazy
therapist, "Dr. Finch," when he was 12 years old.</LD>
<TE>   Despite its grim subject matter--Burroughs is essentially a
neglected child, growing up in squalor--the book is amusing and told
with little self-pity.</TE>
<TE>   "The really magnetic force of the book is that feeling of not
being comfortable in the world," said the 36-year-old author,
explaining why readers identify with his writing.</TE>
<TE>   One man, for instance, told Burroughs the story of how he was
sexually abused as a child. Still, it wasn't exactly the writer's
ambition to do double duty as his readers' therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted to do was to make people laugh," he says the day
before his Book Soup appearance, as he fights jet lag with espressos
in the garden of the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard. "In a sick
way, it's great to read about someone who's worse off than yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Especially if the story is humorously told. And "Running With
Scissors"--whose episodes range from a faked suicide to his mother's
abandoning him to pursue her "poetry career" --is a surprisingly
funny book.</TE>
<TE>   It also belongs to a genre that could be called: "If it doesn't
kill you, it'll make a good anecdote."</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs has been polishing this set of anecdotes for years,
first in a daily journal he began as a young teenager to prepare for
the autobiography that he--with the self confidence of a
13-year-old--knew was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   When he revisited his childhood journals as an adult, "they
disgusted me--what a pathetic kid," he says. "But then I opened them
randomly, and I started laughing. I was so tortured, so profoundly
upset."</TE>
<TE>   If there was teenage angst, there was also the arrogance of youth.
"I always saw everything with a smirk." The young Burroughs was also
the star of his own movie, playing to the imaginary cameras that
followed him everywhere. "Tony Orlando--I dressed like that," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs craved attention and glamour, but beyond everything
else, normalcy. Instead of the celluloid-perfect "Eight Is Enough"
childhood, though, he got a "cold sore of a past."</TE>
<TE>   As the book opens, Burroughs lives with his father, a functional
alcoholic, and his mother, a manic writer of bad poetry, who is
crazy. "Not crazy in a let's paint the kitchen bright red! sort of
way," he writes. "But crazy in a gas oven, toothpaste sandwich, I am
God sort of way."</TE>
<TE>   All the 9-year-old Burroughs wants is for his life to be
"fabric-softener, tuna-salad-on-white, PTA meeting normal."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he is sent to live with "the Finches," in their
dilapidated Victorian house, where Dr. Finch's wife can be found
eating dog food, and patients roam the halls, contributing to the
general mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   One anecdote begins like this:</TE>
<TE>   "We were young. We were bored. And the old electroshock therapy
machine was just under the stairs in a box next to the Hoover...."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, well-polished anecdotes include eating the Christmas
tree, which was still standing in the living room in May, and
visiting Dr. Finch's "masturbatorium," where the doctor retreats with
pictures of Golda Meir.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewer Carolyn See, in the Washington Post, warned that, though
she loved it, the book wasn't for everyone. "PTA ladies and some
Republican members of Congress might want to give this book a pass,"
she wrote, noting that the book, "has a very high gross-out factor."</TE>
<TE>   "Absolute squalor, eccentric chaos" is how Burroughs describes his
childhood environment in Massachusetts. "I felt like a freak, a total
outsider." As a child, "it's no wonder you sit there, fastening and
unfastening your belt."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being a compulsive worrier as a child, Burroughs grew into
a confident adult. In public appearances and in private, he fires off
glib one-liners, his stories--written as well as told--bearing traces
of his years in advertising.</TE>
<TE>   As he undertook what he terms "the greatest recycling project,"
writing about his childhood, the trick was to make the work honest
and funny, without getting sued.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, names of characters in the book have been changed, making
it difficult to establish the veracity of events. Burroughs
understands that some things--like the parentally assisted fake
suicide he staged to get out of going to school--sound outlandish,
but he is adamant that all his accounts are true. "I can go on Court
TV and get a lie-detector test," he joked. "I could have written a
very different book, a sad, bitter, strange, upsetting, violent book.
I didn't. But this is equally truthful."</TE>
<TE>   He was candid about sex, but not without reservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid people would be like, 'Oh man, this is some gay
memoir.' But the pedophilia stuff"--the book describes his
relationship at age 13 with a 33-year-old man, a patient boarding at
the Finch residence--"no one has mentioned that."</TE>
<TE>   Though critical reception for the book generally has been good,
Burroughs' family, he says, was less enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It's not unlike Christina Crawford writing about Joan
Crawford,' " was his mother's response, he says. "I didn't say, 'But
you were not unlike Joan Crawford,' " he adds. His father, he says,
hasn't read the book.</TE>
<TE>   As for his adopted family, "the Finches," they had little reaction
to the book. (Dr. Finch, the postscript says, died in 2000.)
Burroughs did get a misspelled e-mail from "Vicky," one of the Finch
sisters whom he grew up with, who didn't exactly impart her
blessings.</TE>
<TE>   But then, resentment goes both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful to them for putting a roof over my head," he said
simply of his adopted family, with whom he lived off and on until he
was 17. Perhaps that was all that was left to say after the harrowing
accounts he put in the book. And his biological family?</TE>
<TE>   "They were lousy, terrible parents."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, from that tumultuous beginning came a career in
advertising. As an adult, Burroughs found he had a knack for writing
the $20-million ad campaign. For someone without an education, it was
perfect. "Advertising didn't care where I came from."</TE>
<TE>   But it was also a career (and a lifestyle) that kept him from his
teenage ambitions. He didn't rediscover them until after the death of
a friend, when, panicked about his own mortality, he wrote
"Sellevision" (Griffin Trade Paperback, 2000), a book about the
shopping network universe, and the C-list stars who inhabit it.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately, my blood pressure dropped 20%," he said. "That's
what I should have been doing."</TE>
<TE>   The original manuscript for "Sellevision" was a
stream-of-consciousness effort without indentation for paragraphs or
quotation marks for dialogue. Instead, it had idiosyncratic grammar.
"I capitalized certain words that freaked me out, like Penis or
Dessert," says Burroughs. "It was very revealing."</TE>
<TE>   He is still amused that his dysfunctional childhood became the
basis for a functional bestseller, he says, as he looks at his
hot-young-writer itinerary. Later this week there would be a photo
shoot for People magazine and an interview with National Public
Radio.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't go to the right schools, I didn't have the
connections,'' he says. "But it proved my childhood theory: Writing
is talking. It's just talking with your fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs' next book, "Dry," due out next summer, is the sequel to
"Running," although it was written before. And two other books are on
the way. "It's all about myself," Burroughs says. "If I go to Kmart
and buy detergent--you'll read about it. If I wash the car--it's
going to be a story."</TE>

<HD>Color Crayola's Strategy Creative</HD>
<DH>In a Maryland mall, the crayon maker reaps goodwill with
entertainment that's child-friendly</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GUS G. SENTEMENTES</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From cerulean blue to magenta, a kaleidoscope of colors dazzles the
eyes at Crayola's first-ever retail venture at Arundel Mills mall in
Hanover, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, scores of crayons, as well as markers, paints and clay, are
sold at the store, called Crayola Works Creativity Studio and Store.
But half of the 20,000-square-foot space is an art studio, where
visitors can buy craft kits, sit at tables and color, paint and
individualize them.</LD>
<LD>   Crayola Works taps into the concept of entertainment
retailing--one of the hottest trends in retail--where consumers are
offered not only a product, but also a fun and engaging in-store
experience that helps build brand loyalty for companies.</LD>
<TE>   The hot seller so far? A soccer ball that people can color and
customize.</TE>
<TE>   For Crayola, one of the most identifiable brands in America, the
store is an experimental first step in a possible roll-out of similar
stores across the country. It's a bold new direction for 99-year-old
Binney &amp; Smith, the Easton, Pa., maker of Crayola products that is
more accustomed to the role of manufacturer than retailer.</TE>
<TE>   The store will appeal to children who don't mind getting sloppy
when creating works of art, according to Nancy DeBellis, Crayola's
director of retail. "And parents don't have to worry about cleaning
up."</TE>
<TE>   A pathway called a "river of color" winds through the store. Boxes
of markers and crayons line shelves and walls throughout. A new
Volkswagen Beetle--painted half black and half white--waits in one
corner for people to grab markers and write, draw and color on it.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a craft kit, for as little as $5.99, grants a visitor
access to the 200-seat art studio, where art supplies are free and
there is no time limit.</TE>
<TE>   The store, open since early June, plans to change its menu of
craft kits regularly to keep the interest level high.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just trying to sell you something and kick you out,"
said Gay Smoak, a 40-year-old homemaker from Severn, Md., who visited
the store recently with her sons Michael, 12, and Brian, 10.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an activity that you could sit here for an hour and a half
and do. There aren't too many places you can go out with kids and do
something together without spending a fortune."</TE>
<TE>   Binney &amp; Smith, a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards Inc., was
encouraged to launch the retail project partly from its success with
the Crayola Factory in Easton, Md., a hands-on visitors center that
demonstrates the crayon-making process.</TE>
<TE>   But the private company, which made about $500 million last year,
was also nudged into the venture by Mills Corp., Arundel Mills'
owner, which came up with the idea for a Crayola store and then
pitched it to the company, officials from both companies said.</TE>
<TE>   "Crayola is just a formidable organization," said Mark J. Rivers,
Mills' executive vice president and chief strategic officer. "They're
a market leader in children's art and expression. We love
partnerships with pedigree."</TE>
<TE>   Arundel Mills is an ideal first spot for Crayola. The mall is a
potent regional attraction that drew 14 million visitors last year.
And it's nestled between Baltimore and Washington in a market that
Binney &amp; Smith says holds 1.4 million children between 2 and 12.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping that demographic is key to the store's success, said
retail consultant Mike Rubin of MRA International Inc. of
Philadelphia. Rubin, a well-known expert in the field of experiential
and entertainment retailing, worked with Crayola and Mills to develop
the store's business model.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to have the parents very much engaged," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   The store enables children to color and draw with their parents,
or parents can drop off their children for an art class or workshop,
go mall shopping and pick them up 1 1/2 hours later. A small coffee
shop is planned for one corner of the studio, for parents waiting for
their children.</TE>
<TE>   "This had to work as a business, but at the same time we wanted to
push the envelope on what the experience can be," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Crayola nor Mills will say how much was spent on the
store, but Crayola doesn't have an exclusive relationship with Mills,
officials from both companies said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephanie Kerley Schwartz has created clothes for supermodels, movie
sets for superstars and furniture for fussy clients. But her latest
commission demanded that she not only blend tradition with
practicality, but please a thousands-strong congregation. And there
was an unrelenting deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Three months ago, Kerley Schwartz, a member of Kehillat Israel
Reconstructionist Congregation in Pacific Palisades, accepted the
difficult assignment of designing liturgical furniture for her
synagogue and to have it completed by the High Holy Days, which begin
at sunset Friday with Rosh Hashanah.</LD>
<LD>   The new pieces--a large ark, Torah stand, candle table and
lecterns for the rabbi and cantor--replace splintering oak ones that
bear the marks of three decades of weekly use as well as dents
gathered by being moved to larger halls to accommodate a swell of
participants during the High Holy Days.</LD>
<TE>   Kerley Schwartz wanted pieces with clean lines that not only were
appropriate for Kehillat Israel's contemporary building but that
allowed for the synagogue's "spiritual home" to move with the
congregation to the larger Veterans Wadsworth Theater in Los Angeles
for this year's services.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to solve the needs of the service and have a spiritual
essence," says Kerley Schwartz, who worked closely with Kehillat
Israel's clergy and carpenter Dave Hieronymus.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces are made of solid maple and Finland birch plywood. The
plywood's layers are exposed at the edges, creating bands of straight
lines. The updated Arts and Crafts design has specific nods to Gustav
Stickley with its angled top supports.</TE>
<TE>   The ark, which is almost 7 feet wide and tall, holds four Torahs,
the sacred scrolls of Hebrew Scripture. Two bi-fold glass doors
display sandblasted images of flames in reference to the Bible
passage in which God spoke to Moses from a burning bush. "It's a
dramatic moment when the ark doors are opened," says Kerley Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   When the 400-pound ark must be moved, it can be disassembled into
seven sections. The smaller pieces can't be taken apart but are
portable because of streamlined dimensions--the lecterns are about
one-third smaller than the boxy old ones--and they have custom
dollies to transport them.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi's lectern weighs 100 pounds and has a 30-inch-wide top
surface and three closed sides. The open side has shelves to hold
prayer shawls. "A rabbi's lectern is a platform from which to send
prayers, blessings and hopes out into the world," says Rabbi Sheryl
Lewart, one of the synagogue's two rabbis.</TE>
<TE>   The 150-pound cantor's lectern is 6 inches wider and almost a foot
deeper than the rabbi's to accommodate a Torah and sheet music. It
has two shelves and a drawer, and a pullout surface on the left to
extend the work space.</TE>
<TE>   The Torah stand is almost 5 feet high with a tilted back to
support the 25-pound scrolls. It has angled feet, as does the ark and
cantor's lectern, while the small candle table has straight legs. "I
wanted the pieces to work together, but have individual aspects,"
says Kerley Schwartz.</TE>

<TE>   Glass Advantages</TE>
<TE>   Decorative glass has been grabbing attention for centuries; even
Jamestown settlers found the time to make the showy stuff for
windows. And, sure, it can enhance architectural elements and be seen
as luminous art, but don't think of it as just a pretty luxury. In a
world of big houses squeezed onto tiny lots, and condos stacked
together like crates at Costco, translucent glass can also soften a
few modern realities.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Kazanjian, who's made a career of mixing glass with lead,
says it can artfully conceal the view of an ugly fence, roof or trash
can, or stop passersby from peeking into your home. It's all a matter
of design and material.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, a house in Huntington Beach. The owners wanted
a bright, contemporary look for their double-door entrance, but they
also needed privacy. Kazanjian delivered by using six types of glass
that blur the view, but don't block the light. He assembled ripples,
droplets and waffle-weave textures to create an abstract of swoops
and ribbons. Light emanates differently through each, which adds
another dimension to the piece and the entry room.</TE>
<TE>   "In a lot of my work, shape and design are separated by density of
texture rather than by color," says Kazanjian, who is celebrating 30
years as a stained-glass artist in Hermosa Beach. (He received his
bachelor's degree in civil engineering and an MBA from UCLA, but
chucked the idea of building bridges after seeing a glass artist
polishing away at a festival in Venice, Calif., in 1969.)</TE>
<TE>   To make a door panel, Kazanjian draws the design--a
"cartoon"--then traces the pattern onto heavy paper. He cuts the
glass--handmade in Europe, South America and the Pacific
Northwest--and assembles the pieces with lead. He adds a little
putty, buffs with a bristle brush and, about two weeks later, the
door is in place and foiling the efforts of nosy neighbors.</TE>

<HD>The Bar Tanked. Many Suffered.</HD>
<DH>The closure of Harry's Bar leaves a Hemingway contest
without a home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While thousands of aspiring authors slave over hot laptops trying to
write the great American novel or short story, it's a whole different
breed that attempts bad fiction. Consider the entrants in the
Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest staged by San Jose State University,
who strive to invent the worst possible first sentence to a terrible
novel. The contest is named for the man who wrote, "It was a dark and
stormy night," Snoopy's favorite opening line.</LD>
<LD>   A Faux Faulkner contest attracts writers with the soul of the
South in their fingertips. But for more than 20 years, the most
fearless of writers manque have fashioned themselves as the
reincarnation of Ernest Hemingway, and composed short, declarative
sentences designed to win the International Imitation Hemingway
Competition.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles home of Hemingway parodies, Harry's Bar &amp; American
Grill in Century City, closed last month and will soon be slammed by
the wrecking ball poised over the ABC Entertainment Center. Will
Papa's dedicated followers have to abandon their literary pretensions
and take up bullfighting?</LD>
<TE>   Nope. The competition that has been held since 1977 at the L.A.
replica of Harry's Bar in Florence, Italy, will continue, but with
the restaurant gone, it will be a contest without a home and without
part of its tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The contest's loyal supporters lament that it just won't be the
same without Judgment Night, the evening when a hearty band of
hard-drinking, no-frills prose buffs gathered in Century City to
choose the literary pretender who would be rewarded with two
round-trip tickets to Italy and a free dinner at Harry's Bar in
Florence.</TE>
<TE>   "Harry's Bar was the perfect place for the contest," says Bernice
Kert, who wrote "The Hemingway Women" (W.W. Norton, 1985) and became
the first female judge in 1986. "The judges would rendezvous once a
year, read the finalists, argue and laugh a lot. It will be hard to
retain the flavor of those evenings somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The contest, which drew up to 25,000 entries in the most fecund
years of its first quarter century, launched some very silly
parodies, several heroic hangovers and even a book--"The Best of Bad
Hemingway: Choice Entries From the Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill
Imitation Hemingway Competition" (Harcourt, 1989).</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the competition came from Paul Keye, an advertising
executive who Harry's Bar owners Jerry Magnin and Larry Mindel
engaged to raise the restaurant's profile. From the time the
restaurant opened in 1972, "our customer base was people who worked
in Century City and who went to the Shubert Theater," Magnin recalls.
"We wanted to reach out to a wider audience, to let people know we
were the sister restaurant of the Harry's in Florence. Paul pointed
out that Harry's Bar was so associated with Ernest Hemingway and his
writing that we should start a competition."</TE>
<TE>   A single page ad in the New Yorker read: "One very good page of
very bad Hemingway will send you and a friend to Italy for dinner."
The contest announcements were the only advertising Harry's Bar ever
ran. Entries had to be a maximum of 500 words, be written in the
spare, rhythmic sentences that characterized the bearded writer's
work, be funny and mention Harry's Bar. Favorably.</TE>
<TE>   Parodies were sent from every state. In the early years, according
to Kert, most entrants were knowledgeable Hemingway fans. "They had
his style down and were good at satirizing it," she says. Some of
that has fallen off, she says, though the winning entries are still
solid.</TE>
<TE>   The core group of judges included Digby Diehl, book editor of the
Los Angeles Times from 1969 to 1978, writers Ray Bradbury and Barnaby
Conrad and Times columnist Jack Smith. Dean Faulkner Wells, publisher
of the Yoknapatawpha Press and a niece of William Faulkner became the
second female judge, and, after Smith's death in 1996, biographer A.
Scott Berg signed on. Guest judges, who served short stints, included
Hemingway's son, Jack, and his granddaughter Mariel, poet Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, columnist Herb Caen and writers George Plimpton and
Joseph Wambaugh.</TE>
<TE>   Judgment Night was a bacchanal, but a little serious business was
accomplished: The judges chose from a group of finalists selected by
university literature professors who screened every entry. "One of
the first years, there were four television cameras focused on six
men sitting at a table, reading and getting drunk," Diehl says. "Even
in the slower years, we'd get 2,500 or 3,000 entries. For a long
time, I'd run into people from all walks of life who would tell me
that they entered the contest over and over."</TE>
<TE>   No names ever appeared on the finalists' work, so the judges had
no way of knowing who authored "The Dow Also Rises," "A Clean,
Well-Sighted Ace" or "The Toes of Kilimanjaro."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hemingway's status as an icon of machismo, several women
mimicked him well enough to win. In May, Kathryn Bold, an Orange
County writer and editor, was awarded the prize for "The Old Man and
the Flea," the tale of a dog.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at times like this that he feared life had no meaning,"
she wrote. "What was life anyway, but lying around on one's blankie,
waiting for the next bowl of kibble. Life was nothing. Nada. Nada y
nada y pues nada. Woof nada. Then she came along and gave him a treat
and for a brief time life was good. Then he puked the treat on the
rug and life was bad again."</TE>
<TE>   For contestants who entered repeatedly, life was bad during the
latter half of the '80s, when ownership of Harry's changed twice and
the competition was suspended for three years. Diehl, active with PEN
Center USA West, persuaded the writer's organization to adopt the
contest. When it resumed in 1992, Judgment Night was again held at
the restaurant, the proceeds from ticket sales went to PEN, and
American Airlines became a co-sponsor. But American and PEN stepped
aside in 1999, then the restaurant closed. The contest seemed doomed.</TE>
<TE>   But Hemispheres, the in-flight magazine of United Airlines, which
had become a co-sponsor in 2000, said it will continue the annual
competition. Each year's triumphant entry will be published in
Hemisphere's July issue, along with the winner of the annual Faux
Faulkner prize.</TE>
<TE>   Hemispheres editor Randy Johnson says United Airlines and the
magazine are committed to encouraging bad Hemingway imitators. "I
feel confident that we'll have a place for Judgment Night by next
year," he says. "If not in L.A., then perhaps in Key West."</TE>
<TE>   Key West, Fla., as any Hemingway aficionado knows, was as
legendary a Hemingway haunt as Paris, Havana, Africa or Idaho. The
Harry's Bar Hemingway actually frequented was in Venice, not
Florence, according to Hemingway biographer A.E. Hotchner, author of
"Papa Hemingway" (Random House, 1966). "It was a little bar on the
Grand Canal," he says. "Hemingway had his own table there, but he
mostly liked to hang out at the bar. He frequented it in the '20s and
'30s. Some people think that Hemingway put up the money for the bar,
but the money came from a man named Harry. When Harry's opened,
Ernest was struggling, so it's doubtful he could have lent anyone
money.</TE>
<TE>   "I first went there with him in 1948. By then, it had become the
hub of cafe life in Venice. 'Across the River and Into the Trees' is
set in Venice, and the characters in it go to Harry's Bar."</TE>
<TE>   What would Hemingway have thought of prizes being awarded to the
funniest parodies of his writing? His friend Hotchner says, "He
probably would have gone to all the contests and shot everybody on
sight."</TE>

<HD>Missing 'Idols' Still Worthy of Worshiping</HD>
<DH>The guests of honor are no-shows but that doesn't keep the
fans from partying</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The search for the first American idol is over, but is the idolizing?
Not judging by the thousand or so fans who came to Fox's worship
fest--and those who stayed outside--on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 3,500 people who had tickets to the live taping, 1,000 were
invited to the celebration bash at the Highlands nightclub at the
Hollywood &amp; Highland complex. That left the crowd holding
heart-shaped "Justin" fans standing in the shopping center's
hallways. Meanwhile, two souvenir hunters made off with the signs
directing guests to the club.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had to add security to the freight elevators," said Tolan
Clark, director of marketing for the two-story, 28,000-square-foot
nightclub and restaurant. "Everybody is trying to get in."</LD>
<TE>   But those who were on the guest list were more disappointed than
those who got left out. Guests of honor Kelly Clarkson, 20, and
Justin Guarini, 23, the two finalists, never appeared, even though
Fox publicists kept insisting they were on their way. Even Guarini's
father, who was dancing and posing for pictures with his son's fans,
was at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He's supposed to be here," said Eldrin Bell, a former Atlanta
police chief who shares Guarini's trademark smile. "But they keep
them so busy. Who knows what happened? It's OK. I'm enjoying myself.
I've got a career of my own but it's been great being known as
Justin's dad throughout all of this."</TE>
<TE>   Catered by Wolfgang Puck, the party featured such staples as
hamburgers and fries, and chili. It got a little more creative with
the mashed potatoes served up in martini glasses and drinks adorned
with red and blue light-up ice cubes.</TE>
<TE>   Fox publicists never explained why Clarkson and Guarini were
no-shows. After they had all but given up hope on the show's judges
arriving and the party was fizzling out, in walked Paula Abdul, Randy
Jackson and Simon Cowell.</TE>
<TE>   Fans who clamored for their brush with the now-famous contestants
made due with semi-finalists Tamyra Gray, 23, R.J. Helton, 21, and
Nikki McKibbin, 23.</TE>
<TE>   The three made their rounds, signing autographs and chatting with
fans. Actress Tori Spelling congratulated Gray, who was the favorite
among many of the show's fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love reality television," Spelling said. "Although I act
for a living, I think real people are the best actors."</TE>
<TE>   Helton, who was mobbed by a group of women at the door, said he's
thrilled to be part of the latest American pop-cultural phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been living my dream these past few weeks, so I can't
complain about anything," he said, moments after a woman who is old
enough to be his mother hung her arms around his neck and told him
how sad she was that he had lost.</TE>

<DH>The 'Real World' cast lives it up in a snazzy high-rise
suite designed for intimacy, not privacy</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--"My house in Cutoff is, like, a country house," says the
all-smiles Trichelle, a 22-year-old from an aptly named rural
Louisiana town, soon after the opening credits of the season premiere
episode of MTV's "The Real World." The cameras-in-the-house show that
helped unleash a flood of so-called reality programming begins its
12th season on Sept. 17, set this time in the new youth-oriented
Palms Casino Resort just off the Las Vegas strip.</LD>
<LD>   "This," drawls Trichelle, who--like all "Real World" cast
members--uses only her first name, "is a city house."</LD>
<LD>   To even call the show's setting a house is a stretch. A
three-bedroom, full-service high-roller hotel suite is more like it.
"Real World's" trademark device is to see what kind of intimacy can
result when you make roommates of seven photogenic twentysomethings
who first meet in their quasi-dormitory living situation.</LD>
<TE>   As "Real World" moved to the very unreal world of Vegas, the
producers left behind the Ikea-style decor of their lofts and houses
of past seasons. This time, the cast lives in souped-up modern style
on the 28th floor of a casino resort, with incredible views out their
windows and a relentless 24-hour scene just below.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas is a place where what you do away from the bedroom is
often more alluring than anything you can do in a room with a bed. As
a result, the show's creators had to make their apartment snazzy
enough to suit the setting, cozy enough to invite conversation or ...
whatever ... and yet still be an unimposing backdrop for "real
lives."</TE>
<TE>   "Real World" expects the cast to get out, get jobs, eat in
restaurants, have friends drop by, and do normal things like talk on
the phone. Part of the voyeuristic appeal relies on the cast living
fully exposed lives. And for it to work, the backdrop that is their
home--the setting where feelings are confessed and intimacy
occurs--is key.</TE>
<TE>   Walk into the "Real World" suite today and it looks pretty much as
it did when the cast lived there from mid-February until late June of
this year. Palms owner George Maloof has taken care to preserve what
the casino and MTV created together, and he is marketing the space to
his top customers, personally deciding who can stay
there--"high-rollers, celebrities and sports people" being his first
choice, he says. A far cry from the wide-eyed aspirants who appear in
the show.</TE>
<TE>   Maloof says the project cost him $2 million. He paid to configure
the rooms and decorate the space, and MTV, which won't say how much
it spent on the apartment, added some of the fine touches, including
artworks and other details.</TE>
<TE>   Maloof used as designers the L.A.-based Jerde Partnership, which
had designed the rest of the Palms resort-casino, because he wanted
to give the apartment the same signature look. The 2,900-square-foot
suite was created by demolishing six hotel rooms, and the entire
floor had to remain empty for seven months to accommodate the setup,
including 4 1/2 months of taping. An additional four rooms
surrounding the suite were used for production. It was a small price
to pay, Maloof says, for the exposure that the show will afford his
$265-million Palms enterprise. Beyond the suite, the resort's
high-rise exterior, signage and every bar, dance club and restaurant
all become regular fixtures in the show.</TE>
<TE>   There's a definite "wow" effect to Jerde's interior design,
created by Sharmila Tankha in partnership with Maloof and Tracy
Chaplin, the show's executive producer. The circular suite has three
very small bedrooms on one side, two with two queen beds, and a third
with three. None of the rooms have doors, just curtains. Quirks
abound throughout: The kitchen doesn't have a sink, although the
adjacent bar has two, and showers are designed for use by two or
more. Three washbasins, all in a tightly fitting row, stand out in
the open hallway, just outside the bedrooms, and they all have only
small mirrors. A multi-person hot tub gets nearly as much space as
the living room, and the dining table is made of transparent plastic
cast with dice inside--the only direct reference to gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "The show is about voyeurism," Chaplin says, "and we needed to
create unique living spaces for the cast." The sight-lines, he says,
drive the flow of the design. In the shower, for example, you can see
through windows into the living room and the bath, inviting
inclusion--and a bit of intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pool table, a lounge with a jellyfish tank for quiet
time, and a larger living room with enough sofas and chairs for a
group chat. Large hanging orange pads create a booth-like space,
providing semi-privacy for phone conversations, and the requisite
"confessional"--where the psychodramas are worked through--is hidden
in its own central, closet-like space.</TE>
<TE>   Frank, 23, who prior to the show lived with his parents in
Lewisberg, Penn., and is now entering business school at USC, says he
averaged about two confessionals a day for the first two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated, hated, hated that there were no doors," he said in a
recent conversation from his new Brentwood apartment, which he says
is nothing like his home on "Real World." "That apartment ruined me
for all other apartments," he says, although it had limitations.
Sharing bathroom facilities with three women was one, although there
were alternatives: "We gave up showering there because we had a huge
spa downstairs" in the resort, he said. "If you used the bathroom in
the apartment, you had to clean up. It got slimy."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the design for a "Real World" apartment does much to
determine, even manipulate, how the cast interacts. Not only because
it is the best place for surveillance--there's more "control," as
producer Chaplin describes it--but also because the distinct spaces
naturally lead to different kinds of experiences, the essence of all
well-considered design.</TE>
<TE>   Arissa, 23, who grew up in a tough neighborhood of Boston, came to
"Real World" from a job at an accounting firm and is now moving to
Los Angeles to work as a model. She says she was one of the few who
spent a lot of her free time at home in the Vegas apartment, and the
sofa that sat in front of the jellyfish aquarium became a favorite
spot for her.</TE>
<TE>   "The couch was a big pillow," she says, "I spent so much time
there, just reading and looking out the window. That was the one
place that was really comfortable that made it a home. From there you
could see the hallways, the phone room, the pool table, and there was
always something going on. When you woke up from a nap, you could see
who's doing what."</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin has worked on eight "Real World" shows and says that by
now, he pretty much knows that some situations are going to happen.
"I know that two people are going to end up in a shower," he said,
"so we create a shower that suits our purpose. Same thing with the
communal bath."</TE>
<TE>   Previous casts had sometimes complained that they felt like they
were living in a set, rather than a home, he said, so for this
production they tried hard to make the space more homey.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there are limitations, many unexpected, to having
seven grown people living in a tight space. And real intimacy is not
the only problem when there's at least one camera crew next to you at
all times. "I cooked a lot," Arissa says. "The others ate out more
than me, but I cooked pasta all the time. And I'd be at the sink
pouring out the water, and the camera guy would be right there. I'd
have to say, 'Look, I'm going to burn your arm.' "</TE>
<TE>   Reality can be tough.</TE>

<LD>The Dixie Chicks' new album has found a home at the top of the
nation's pop chart by selling 780,000 copies in its first week in
stores--the second-highest first-week total this year, behind
Eminem's "The Eminen Show" (1.3 million in its first full week in
May).</LD>
<LD>   The figure for the country trio's "Home" is also the most for any
female group since Nielsen SoundScan began monitoring U.S. sales in
1991, Columbia Records reports. The album's success is likely to be
cheered by country traditionalists because the Chicks' music is
roots-oriented.</LD>
<LD>   Two other new arrivals also broke into the Top 10: the British
rock group Coldplay's "A Rush of Blood to the Head," which finished
No. 5 after selling 141,000 copies, and rapper Eve's "Eve-Olution,"
which finished No. 6 by selling 123,000.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the top 10 were claimed by, in order,
Eminem, Avril Lavigne, Nelly, Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, Clipse
and Volume 10 of "Now That's What I Call Music." The Chicks' "Long
Time Gone" remains the bestselling single.</TE>

<HD>Rockers and Bikers on Tour Help Harley Celebrate Its 100th
Birthday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kid Rock knows how to pass the long hours between tour dates: with
the grips of a motorcycle throbbing in his hands. The
rocker-rapper-provocateur and tour sidekick DJ Uncle Cracker never
leave Detroit without their bikes.</LD>
<LD>   "We got a chopper and a Harley Fat Boy out here; Cracker's got his
Harley," says Rock, calling from an East Coast tour date with
Aerosmith. "We bring as many bikes as we can, depending on the room.
If it's nice out and we're in a nice area, we love to go riding."</LD>
<LD>   Rock will bring that biker sensibility to the stage as one of a
patchwork of new and classic acts gathered this weekend for the
Southern California stop of the Open Road Tour, celebrating
Harley-Davidson's 100th anniversary, at California Motor Speedway in
Fontana. He joins an unlikely lineup that includes a reunion of the
Doors, Stone Temple Pilots, Los Lobos, Nickelback,
Parliament-Funkadelic, Earl Scruggs and the Doobie Brothers.</LD>
<TE>   "Rock music nowadays is very boring," says Rock. "To have a
diverse bill with a lot of acts, whether they're young, old,
good-looking, not good-looking--just good songs and musicians--it
doesn't get any better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Berlin of Los Lobos compares the lineup to shows two decades
ago at the Fillmore in San Francisco, when the disparate likes of
folk guitarist John Fahey, bop giant Miles Davis and proto-metal
rockers Blue Cheer might somehow share a stage for a night.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any other circumstance where those
audiences and those bands would be on the same stage," says Berlin.
"We'll have to get down there and see what's actually going to happen
on the ground, because God knows it could be a complete debacle."</TE>
<TE>   The Fontana concerts are part of a yearlong tour of
Harley-Davidson festivals, which began in July in Atlanta and will
travel overseas before ending next year in Milwaukee. The American
shows are organized by House of Blues Concerts and each city offers a
different talent lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales for this weekend are going well, says Jack Gannon,
vice president of marketing for House of Blues, with Saturday's Stone
Temple Pilots and Nickelback lineup the most popular so far.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from live music, the festivals offer historic motorcycle
displays, a mini film festival on Harley-Davidson history, a
children's area with coloring contests and rub-off tattoos, and a
place where licensed motorcycle riders can try out the newest
Harleys.</TE>
<TE>   Legendary biker gang the Hells Angels were involved in a deadly
fight during a Laughlin, Nev., motorcycle rally this spring, but
organizers expect little of the darker side of motorcycle culture to
emerge during the weekend. "The events we've had to date have been
peaceful events," says Gannon. "We've had no security issues
whatsoever. We're taken a lot of precautions to ensure the safety of
everyone at the event. It really is a non-issue."</TE>
<TE>   Los Lobos will approach Friday night with some experience playing
for motorcycle enthusiasts. At last summer's Redwood Run in Northern
California, they were joined by Billy Idol for an impromptu version
of Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild."</TE>
<TE>   "He was drunk out of his bloody mind," Berlin says with a laugh.
(Idol is scheduled to perform his own set at Open Road on Saturday.)
"I'd certainly welcome him back, and if he wants to get up there and
do it, that would be great."</TE>

<LD>   If music be the food of love--not to mention poetry and classical
dance--head for the Cahuenga Pass. Titled "Much Ado About Something,"
Shakespeare night at the Hollywood Bowl celebrates the Bard of Avon
three ways. First, conductor John Mauceri leads the Bowl Orchestra in
music by Felix Mendelssohn, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Nino Rota and
Miklos Rozsa inspired by or related to Shakespeare's time and plays.
Next, actor Michael York reads selected passages by Shakespeare
before, after and sometimes over the music. Finally, Pacific
Northwest Ballet comes all the way from Seattle to dance about an
hour's worth of the much-loved 1962 "Midsummer Night's Dream" ballet
choreographed by the late George Balanchine. All that's missing is
Gwyneth Paltrow in a farthingale.</LD>

Ping Chong, who won a 2000 Obie Award for sustained achievement, and

<TE>   If it's been 15 years since you've seen a new Jean-Luc Godard film
in a theater ("King Lear," anyone?), it might be time to give the old
New Wave master another whirl. Checking in for a one-week run at the
Nuart is Godard's "In Praise of Love" (Eloge de l'Amour), a
mind-bending--but conventional by JLG standards; there's a narrative
of sorts--meditation on love, culture, history and time. Shot in
beautiful 35-millimeter black-and-white, as well as color-saturated
digital video, the movie created a stir at Cannes in 2001 for its
provocative stabs at Steven Spielberg and U.S. cultural imperialism.</TE>

with her daughter becomes more complicated when she meets the
daughter's fiance--a theater-bashing reporter. Hare's play, directed
by Jessica Kubzansky and starring Carol Lawrence and Susan Egan as
mother and daughter, takes place over a period of 16 years, as Mom
struggles to realize that there are limits to her ability to control
her daughter's life, and her daughter battles to gain both approval
and independence.</TE>

<TE>   The son jarocho music of Veracruz is rarely heard in its pure form
beyond the borders of the Mexican Gulf state, so the John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre's "Fandango Jarocho" is a must-see for the many Latin
music fans who have sparked a revival of interest in the distinctive,
improvisational style. The headliners are the esteemed
traditionalists Mono Blanco and the more experimental Son de Madera,
and the format is the "jam session" approach that gives the evening
its title.</TE>

Aztlan, Conjunto Jardin. John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga

<TE>   The Asian Film Foundation's "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense,
Suzuki-Style: Seijun Suzuki's Taisho Trilogy" presents the director's
interpretation of Japan's hedonistic Taisho period, 1912-1926. The
two-day event also includes a fashion show featuring Suzuki-styled
kimono designs and a silent auction, plus a panel discussion of the
three films. Freed from the commercial restraints of his long
association with Nikkatsu Studios, Suzuki let loose in 1980 with the
epic-length "Zigeunerweisen," an eerie and erotic reflection on
desire, death and betrayal, involving two men engaged in a battle of
wits over three women. In "Mirage Theater," (1981) a playwright
discovers that the woman with whom he is having an affair might be
the dead wife of his patron. Suzuki completed the trilogy with 1991's
"Yumeji," a surreal, fictionalized biography of the famous watercolor
painter. The latter two films are Los Angeles premieres.</TE>

<TE>   By now, the locally based Lula Washington Dance Theatre should be
giving performances in its long-awaited community dance center. But,
after approving all the plans, the city of Los Angeles suddenly
turned Washington's land over to a commercial developer and, two
years after she filed suit, the matter still hasn't been settled. So
Washington is giving a benefit performance at the Orpheum Theater in
downtown L.A. to raise funds to renovate her new company center on
South Crenshaw Boulevard. Stellar guests include Debbie Allen,
Jasmine Guy, Tavis Smiley, Ronald E. Brown and Rudy Perez, but the
main event will be the company dancing Washington pieces--"Dances for
McCoy," "Om" and "Rites 2000"--with her sensational Youth Dance
Ensemble also very much in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Lula Washington Dance Theatre and guests, Orpheum Theatre, 842 S.
Broadway, downtown L.A., 8 p.m. $10 to $100. (213) 480-3232.</TE>

<LD>   The American Cinematheque presents "Poet of Doom: A Tribute to
Werner Herzog," an eight-film retrospective of the eccentric German
director's work, beginning tonight with a sneak preview of his latest
film, "Invincible." Part of the New German Cinema movement of the
'60s and '70s, Herzog later established his own unique presence in
world cinema through his work with actor Klaus Kinski ("Aguirre, the
Wrath of God," "Nosferatu, the Vampyre") and unconventional
documentaries such as "My Best Fiend," a chronicle of his
collaboration with Kinski. Herzog's work became the stuff of
documentary in Les Blank's film, "Burden of Dreams," an account of
the arduous making of "Fitzcarraldo" in the Peruvian Amazon. See
descriptions of Herzog films in Screening Room, Page 24.</LD>

<TE>   When 21-year-old tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton arrived on the
New York jazz scene in 1976, his classic 1930s-'40s-style sound
caught people's attention partly because it was out of step with the
times. Since then, Hamilton's sound has evolved to embrace both the
traditional and the modern. His is one of those rare voices that is
instantly recognizable, even to the casual listener. Hamilton and
company will do two shows per night through Saturday.</TE>

<LD>'Twas nothin' but a gangsta party at the Ivy on Sunday night as Lil'
Kim and her raucous entourage kept the Sidecars flowing till closing
at the tony Robertson Boulevard restaurant. The New York rapper's in
town putting the finishing touches on her third solo album while
simultaneously filming "Guns and Roses," a girl-power, western
shoot-'em-up also starring Monica Calhoun, Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye.
Yippee yo, yippee yeah.... Justin Timberlake couldn't have hooked up
with a better scenester, the club scene's very own Alyssa Milano,
whom he squired to A.D. on Saturday night. The Hollywood nightclub
was filled with such thick-necked heavyweights as Vin Diesel, Mark
Wahlberg, Mickey Rourke, Brett Ratner and supermodel Tyson. Ouch....
Last week at A.D., Christina Aguilera nearly suffered defenestration
after demanding her usual VIP perch, which the Irish super group
Westlife had been inhabiting. While the power powwow ensued, a guest
nearly bumped her off the balcony in an attempt to get out of the
way. All's well that ends well. Westlife graciously gave up the
booth.... Wowzy wowzy woo woo, the Davis Brothers (the Gate/the
Lounge/A.D.) are moving to the Sunset Strip. The team is set to take
over the food and entertainment of a major Strip landmark, and
they're right on time cuz the Strip's hoppin'.</LD>
<TE>   We dropped into Cherry at the Key Club and it's a fab fit. Joseph
Brooks and Mike Messex lighted the Friday night glam club's main
floor with loads of rock 'n' roll, while Danzig's Howie Pyro deejayed
the downstairs Plush Lounge, where we caught up with colorists to the
stars, the Parlour's Steven Tapp and John Frieda's Lori Goddard.
Between the two of 'em, they rule the roots of Hollywood's most
infamous tresses--Madonna, Gwyneth, Ricky Martin, Jen &amp; Brad. To dye
for.... Popped into Belly for owner Mike Boogie's b-day bash and
turns out he and Belly partner Lonnie Moore are renovating Chardonnay
at Melrose and Sweetzer. They're renaming it Dolce, hiring Falcon's
design crew and looking to take Italian food to a whole nutha level.
Bravo.... And finally, we hear Will Shatter (Daddy's/4100 Bar) is
planning to open a bar in the Valley. Like, that's so cool.</TE>

<HD>The Officer Behind 'City' Tells of a Life Altered by Crimes</HD>
<DH>Film is based on former Officer Vincent LaMarca, whose
father, son were convicted for deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shoot to kill, that's what we think cops are trained to do. But once,
Officer Vincent LaMarca came upon a gang rape along a Long Island
boardwalk. First he knocked down two of the guys. Then he pulled his
gun--and fired a warning shot into the air. The other two culprits
stopped in their tracks. All were apprehended.</LD>
<LD>   This is the Vincent LaMarca upon whose story "City by the Sea" is
based, and yet--since movies are movies--there are significant
differences, as well as parallels.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, killing another human being is not as easy as it
appears on the screen. LaMarca, 55, served 20 years on the police
force of Long Beach, N.Y., and believes that until confronted with a
life-threatening situation, "you don't know exactly what you would
do. I let a warning shot go in the air, and I'm very grateful that it
did its job."</LD>
<TE>   "I had a good friend who killed somebody in a shootout," he
explains. "This was a tough cop, but it bothered him; he was
physically shaken by this."</TE>
<TE>   LaMarca, too, has been shaken up by killing--but not by his own
hand. When he was 9, his father, Angelo LaMarca, was convicted of
murder in the death of a child he kidnapped; 40 years later his own
son Joey was arrested for stabbing a man to death.</TE>
<TE>   The movie borrows this premise, with LaMarca played by Robert De
Niro, now a New York City detective who's investigating a
murder--which happens to have been committed by his estranged son,
Joey (James Franco), a strung-out drug addict. The movie LaMarca has
to face up to his own fatherly responsibilities--after avoiding them
for most of his son's life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles on a press tour, Vincent LaMarca is a burly,
medium-sized man with a smooth bullet of a head, a neatly trimmed
beard, and large, metal-framed glasses. Wearing jeans and a Harley
Davidson leather vest, his biker's arms gesture as he talks.</TE>
<TE>   He has a tough-guy exterior, but he is a thoughtful man--one who's
spent a lot of time trying to make sense of the family tragedies that
have bookended his life.</TE>
<TE>   He wishes he had been a better father. He and Joey's mother were
separated in 1975 and, as the film indicates, it was under
acrimonious circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked out," LaMarca admits. Also accurate is Joey's drug
addiction. By 15, the boy was smoking crack daily and was in and out
of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent LaMarca wonders whether it would have made a difference if
he had been more available. He knows he cherishes the memories of his
own father, despite what he did.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, Angelo LaMarca, married with two young children living in
Plainview, N.Y., found himself $1,800 in debt--$400 of that to a loan
shark. One day, driving through a more affluent neighborhood, the
taxi dispatcher who also had a job at a moving company had the devil
of an idea--he decided to kidnap a baby left outside in his carriage.
In a ransom note, he demanded $2,000 to be left at a designated
drop-off point. When time came, Angelo was spooked by the cops and
abandoned the baby in the woods.</TE>
<TE>   To the family, the crime was unfathomable. Vincent LaMarca
remembers his father as a caring, loving man. "We were dirt poor, but
there was a lot of love in the family."</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Vincent had been stricken with polio, and every
morning and evening for a year, his father would bathe him and
massage his legs. "He wouldn't accept the doctors telling my parents
I'd never walk right again."</TE>
<TE>   Seven weeks after the kidnapping, Angelo was arrested and
confessed.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapping was a sensation, as was the trial; the conviction
came quickly. Nine-year-old Vincent did feel "some guilt,
specifically wondering if my medical bills had something to do with
it."</TE>
<TE>   For the two years Angelo was on death row at Sing Sing, he and his
wife wrote one another daily. She would also visit weekly, sometimes
with Vincent in tow. All the letters came to Vincent when he was 21,
when his mother died--more than 1,500 pieces of mail, he says. At the
time LaMarca could not bring himself to read them all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent LaMarca joined the police force of Long Beach, more out of
circumstance than design, he says. Still, he was dedicated to his job
and eventually moved up to the position of executive officer, the No.
2 spot on the force.</TE>
<TE>   Not once in his 20 years of service was his father's record held
against him, he says, and he still glows with pride at having been a
member of that fraternity. "They were a very special breed of
people," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Joey was the second son of LaMarca's first marriage. The police
were onto him shortly after the stabbing--an act of revenge. The
police caught Joey in Texas. In the film, the murder occurs over a
drug deal gone awry and Joey kills the crazed dealer in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger difference is that the movie LaMarca investigates
the murder whereas the real LaMarca had by then retired with his
second wife and three stepchildren to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberties were taken, there's no question about that," LaMarca
says. Warner Bros. had approached him about the rights to his story
after seeing Mike McAlary's article about the case, "Mark of a
Murderer," which appeared in Esquire in September 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part I understand--they're making a movie. The
liberties they took, it didn't bother me because the part of the
story that was important stayed intact," he says. "They didn't
portray my son poorly, they didn't portray my father poorly, those
were my main concerns."</TE>
<TE>   When McAlary first approached him, LaMarca had refused to
cooperate. Then his wife convinced him that the story would be
written with or without him, so he might as well have input. Since
then, he has found the strength to read all those letters between his
parents, plus all the newspaper clippings and letters from strangers
his mother kept. Amazingly, most of the latter were sympathetic, and
some even enclosed a couple dollars to help the family out. "I'm not
only handling the letters," LaMarca says, "I'm planning on putting
them into a book."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Joey was caught, father and son exchanged an angry,
mutually accusatory phone conversation. Joey plea bargained and got
15 to 20 years. Then slowly, gradually, the two began talking on the
phone. They learned to listen, and not to shout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not making an excuse for him; I'm not saying Joey wouldn't
have killed somebody if he'd had a father," says LaMarca, "but I
gotta know him having me might have helped."</TE>
<TE>   These days, they speak on the phone several times a month--and
they write one another. Joey is 30 now. While it will be nine or 10
years before he is up for parole, they already have plans.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows my passion for riding motorcycles. We're planning a trip
for when he gets out of prison--with his older brother and one of my
stepchildren," LaMarca says. "I'll be 65, pushing 70, at that point,
and hopefully I won't need training wheels on the Harley."</TE>

<HD>Inglewood's Java Jive: A Strong House Blend</HD>
<DH>The Howling Monk Jazz Coffee Bar is out to prove that booze
and bebop don't always have to be drinking companions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just 'round midnight at the Howling Monk, and the old
refurbished Inglewood storefront has taken on the fervor of a revival
meeting. Drummer Winard Harper's jazz sextet has a crowd of about 60
people--mostly African American, mostly over 30--clapping time to a
version of Bobby Timmons' "Moanin'," shouting out from their rows of
chairs, steaming up the plate glass windows, dancing in the doorways
thrown open to Market Street.</LD>
<LD>   The venue here is new, open only nine months, but the ritual is
old, older than Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, even Louis Armstrong,
whose photographs hang framed above the makeshift bandstand. The mix
of Saturday night party and Sunday morning congregational assembly is
familiar to Inglewood, but this is neither a bar nor a church. In
fact, it's something that almost doesn't exist in Inglewood: a
coffeehouse.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no natural connection between coffee and jazz," chuckles
Ken Moore, 53, a tall, charismatic, instantly likable man who greets
customers at the door with a big handshake. Dressed in a chocolate
brown, knee length dashiki, black trousers and sandals, he roams
between the stage and his large espresso bar, nodding and clapping
with the band. "This creates quite a marketing dilemma for me. It's
difficult, but I'm involved in two of my passions, so that takes some
of the bite out of it."</LD>
<TE>   The Howling Monk is very much the timeless image of the local jazz
joint--lighted mostly by the streetlights outside, a low $5 to $10
cover, packed with sweaty bodies, emotions running high, a sense of
drama in the room. Black-and-white photos of icons hang on the walls,
including Billie Holiday and the house's patron saints, Howlin' Wolf
and Thelonious Monk. But absent from the party are the haze of
cigarettes and the clink of cold beer glasses.</TE>
<TE>   It's part of Moore's mission to offer straight-ahead jazz for the
purist without the negative impact that alcohol has had on his
community. But replacing it with coffee? Let's just say that the
gourmet coffeehouse explosion that has transformed Western
civilization into coffee junkies has yet to deeply penetrate
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that there are only a couple
coffeehouses out here," Moore says, adding only half-ironically: "Of
course, some of the big-name coffee companies are holding our
customers hostage. And we're still trying to get 'em out a man at a
time."</TE>
<TE>   Part of his strategy is to jazz the place up: to move coffee by
making a reputation for nighttime entertainment. During a quiet piano
break in the standard "In a Sentimental Mood," a lady fanning herself
against the window calls out, "Play for me, baby, play for me," as
easy as if she were sitting in her living room. Moore says he feels
"blessed" to have had this atmosphere right from the start. It might
also be the key to his success: In a town where neither gourmet
coffee nor Coltrane-era jazz are hits with the youth, making a
spiritualized place to congregate might keep the doors open long
enough to get established.</TE>
<TE>   A Vision Emerges</TE>
<TE>   Moore's vision for the Howling Monk was more than a way to make a
buck. He'd already handled his share of money working 23 years as a
production accountant for movie studios in Hollywood. For the last 10
of those years, he was looking for a more constructive purpose. He
wanted to put something back into Inglewood, where he's lived since
the late '70s. He's a longtime connoisseur of exotic coffees, so the
coffeehouse phenomenon was just what he'd been waiting for.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he began roasting his first coffee under the brand name
Howling Monk, a full-bodied Sumatra Mandheling blend he called
Mysteriously Dark. Over the next three years, seven more Howling Monk
coffees emerged, each using premium AA Arabica beans and named after
heroes of jazz or African American culture. The 100th birthday of
Duke Ellington (whom Moore considers "the greatest artist of the 20th
century") is celebrated in his Mood Ndigo blend, using Colombian
Supremo-Buccamaranga coffee. The coffeehouse was to be the bridge
between coffee and live jazz performance. But Moore had to wait until
the coffee business would support the kind of straight-ahead jazz he
loved, which is not as popular now as the R&amp;B-inflected "smooth
jazz." "If you really study coffeehouses up until the Starbucks
explosion here in America, you'll find that coffeehouses always
served a very intimate community function," notes Moore. "The very
first coffeehouse was in Mecca. And it served a purpose there, for
people wanting to gather without an intoxicating beverage." Alcohol
is banned by Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   "So we came into it with that in mind," he continues. "Inglewood
is really similar to a small village. I see it serving the community
as a gathering place."</TE>
<TE>   Fate Intervenes</TE>
<TE>   Finally, fate intervened with what Moore considered the perfect
location. As part of the redevelopment of Market Street, which has
been landscaped with islands of trees and shrubbery and refurbished
with gaslight-style fixtures for nighttime pedestrians, the city
offered Moore a stylish--though challenging--location. It is situated
in a largish corner storefront with a big sidewalk patio area
featuring a flowing fountain and benches for taking in the night air.
The ambience of the club flows out into the street by night. By day,
however, Market Street's mix of beauty shops, discount stores and
boarded-up theaters doesn't offer a lot of foot traffic. Moore put
his faith in the music and opened on Dec. 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   By day, business is steady but light. The place rings with the
wheezing of milk steamers. Customers do the same stuff they do in
coffeehouses everywhere: read books, do homework, take meetings.
Local politicians drop by to hold informal quorums. Moore says he's
got a long way to go to get the coffee flying out the door.</TE>
<TE>   'A Special Feeling'</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Saturday and some Sunday nights, however, it's a
different story altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get here," rasps New Yorker Winard Harper between songs,
"I hang so hard people think I'm from here. That's because I love
y'all." Three or four people shout back, "We love you too!" Thanks in
part to that enthusiasm, the band's first set at the Howling Monk
stretches to 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It does give you a special feeling to play places like this,"
says the high-energy Harper, autographing copies of his latest CD,
"Faith." "The people here are with you."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally recognized acts like Harper are quickly giving the
Howling Monk a reputation for both local talent and major stars.
Harper, a former sideman with Dexter Gordon and Betty Carter, stormed
the Billboard jazz charts in 1991 with "Remembrance," a recording
with his Harper Brothers Quintet that stayed at No. 1 for two months.
This night, his new sextet's deepening involvement with African
drumming sets off his at-times-raucous, straight-ahead style to turn
each piece into an extended jam. Trumpeter Patrick Rickman and tenor
sax player Brian Horton trade off leads on bebop-oriented pieces like
George Cables' "Circles," but the exchanges between Harper and
percussionist Kevin Jones drive the pieces into edgy territory.</TE>
<TE>   The effect is explosive, and by the time the band--rounded out by
bassist Norrie Shioto and pianist Jeb Petton--reaches the set-closing
"Allah Akbar (God Is Great)," with both Harper and Jones on congas,
the music has transcended form to reach a bone-rattling crescendo,
setting people back in their chairs. Man, there must be something in
that coffee they serve.</TE>
<TE>   By all reports, dull nights have been rare at the Howling Monk.
Drummer Sherman Ferguson, who's played with Kenny Burrell and Pharoah
Sanders, performs there regularly, most recently with vocalist Elissa
Lala. Former "Arsenio Hall Show" bassist John B. Williams brought his
trio there Aug. 23 and 24, with pianist Llew Matthews and Ndugu
Chancler on drums.</TE>
<TE>   Local Talents Welcome</TE>
<TE>   Local talents young and old find a warm welcome, especially at the
Sunday "Ultimate Jazz Jam Sessions."</TE>
<TE>   "This place is important, because folks here are doing what they
can to revitalize this area, and it's working out real nice," says
Wally Ali, a guitarist and keyboardist sitting at the coffee bar
taking in the sounds. A regular performer at BB King's club on
Universal City Walk, Ali hangs at the Howling Monk because as a
resident of Culver City, it's local for him.</TE>
<TE>   For Moore, who grew up in Chicago in the late '50s listening to
his big brother's jazz records, the biggest thrill is when he gets to
see his heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had Max Roach in here yet, or Sonny Rollins," he says.
"I'm looking forward to that day when Sonny Rollins will call me and
say, 'Hey, Ken! I heard about Howling Monk and I just want to come
down there and play.' And that's when I'll fall on the floor, you
know?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're like me, the mention of Russian food invokes images of
borscht, blini and kasha, or maybe old-fashioned Russian restaurant
dishes such as beef stroganoff and chicken Kiev. You won't find any
of these on the menu at Traktir. What you will find at this new West
Hollywood place is ethnic foods from the former Soviet republics.</LD>
<LD>   Traktir sits just west of Hollywood's Little Russia neighborhood.
The dining room opens out to the street, and the passing scene gives
it the upbeat feel of an outdoor Paris cafe. But inside, the rustic
pine tables and delicate Russian porcelains suggest a luxurious
pre-Soviet hunting lodge (there's even a stuffed head of a wild pig
mounted on one wall).</LD>
<LD>   The crowd runs to attractive fashionistas and guys in Hugo Boss
duds who might while away an hour or two gossiping over an Armenian
coffee or a Lithuanian beer as they nibble on Traktir's outstanding
zakuski. These hot and cold appetizers, the Russian equivalent of
tapas, can make a marvelous meal by themselves.</LD>
<TE>   One of the cold zakuski, salmon cured on the premises, arrives
alongside a small platter of tiny, meticulously peeled potatoes the
size of pecans. The potatoes are lightly anointed with garlic
vinaigrette and a generous shower of fresh dill. At $5.95, the salmon
is easily enough for two and rivals many an appetizer at a top-tier
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   With the salmon (or marinated herring, also served with those tiny
potatoes), you'll want the kubansky salad. Shimmering under a light
cream dill dressing is a composition of tomatoes, tender Persian
cucumbers and baby lettuces. Whoever selects the produce here has an
eye for quality.</TE>
<TE>   A single bowl of the robust Georgian soup kharcho holds a dozen or
so whole garlic cloves cooked until they've melted like butter. Their
sweetness permeates the lightly spicy tomato-beef broth garnished
with chopped herbs. An even more substantial soup, pohlebka
slovyanskaya, is afloat with tiny squares of Polish sausage, deep
maroon kidney beans, olives and sauerkraut that somehow is scarcely
sour.</TE>
<TE>   After you give your order, complimentary samples of homemade
infused vodkas are presented in hopes you'll want to order more, as
well you may. The jalapeno vodka is nippy without being scalding, and
the raspberry version has a mere breath of berry perfume.</TE>
<TE>   This place makes wonderful vareniki. Those half-moon-shaped
dumplings, which have a reputation for being heavy in this country,
here resemble agnolotti: tender pillows with attractively chewy
skins. A plate full of these beauties (with fillings such as meat,
bean and mushroom-sauerkraut), lightly splashed with cream and
sprinkled with smoked pork, are heaven on a plate. The smaller
meat-filled dumplings called pelmeni are served in broth or with sour
cream or vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   With a nod to today's lighter tastes, the Armenian-style lula
kebab may be made either from the traditional lamb or from ground
chicken. Nevertheless, the $7.50 serving includes a whole lot of
sauteed potatoes with mushrooms, not to mention a refreshing
Mediterranean diced cucumber-tomato salad. Double-rib pork chops
taste of a light marinade that really spikes up the meat's flavor and
goes well with the chops' wild mushroom stuffing.</TE>
<TE>   Chicken tabaka is a partially boned chicken flattened and grilled
under a weight, like the Italian pollo al mattone. This Georgian
specialty emerges as a tender, compact mass of intense chicken
flavor. Roasted white fish with Parmesan "scales" could have used
slightly less breading, but the dish is redeemed by the magical
flavor combination of cheese and fish lightly scented with lemon.</TE>
<TE>   Apricot preserves may seem like a weird dessert, but this isn't
the jam you might expect. It's whole dried apricots, plumped by
simmering in very light syrup; they taste like a pure distillation of
sun-ripened fruit. You can also order ice cream novelties imported
from Lithuania--not as good as a homemade dessert or, frankly, even
an improvement over their American counterparts, but an interesting
glimpse of what's cooking these days in the former Soviet Union.</TE>

<LD>One film crew is already shooting in the sparsely decorated
Mulholland Drive home of Charissa Saverio--a.k.a. popular nightclub
disc jockey DJ Rap--when a second crew arrives at the door. It's a
little before 4 in the afternoon, the start of her day. Bouncing
around the room in tight blue jeans, a black tank top and boots, her
blond hair flying, Saverio is actually at work--getting her set list
together for an after-party to the Sunset Junction street fair, which
is being held at the Echo Park nightclub the Echo.</LD>
<LD>   The house is suddenly full of cameras, bodies and booming music,
all flowing together in a kind of impromptu mix.</LD>
<LD>   That she happens to be a woman in a male-dominated art form has
long ceased to matter to Saverio. She's got to tend to business, and
business is very good. The first film crew is one she hired to
document the making of her new album, her third, which she promises
will blend the frenetic, tribal-esque drum-and-bass beats she's known
for with the breaks she's been utilizing in recent sets. The second
crew is there to interview her for a documentary on electronic music.</LD>
<TE>   Female DJs, once a novelty, increasingly are becoming established
players in the serious business of late-night fun, with their
popularity growing. Despite concerns that some of the women are
relying on their sex appeal to get gigs, and the resulting backlash
on the credibility of others, there is a core of talented female
artists who are taking hold of the scene, with newcomers arriving
regularly. In the process, the idea that women can't compete with
their male counterparts--from sheer talent to handling the constant
travel and the vampire-esque hours--is slowly fading.</TE>
<TE>   On the August weekend of Sunset Junction, DJs Rap and Colette are
sharing the bill at the first-night after-party. The next day, DJs
Colette and Irene are headlining the dance stage. This seems
appropriate for a fair celebrating diversity and open-mindedness, but
that's not why they are appearing as featured entertainers. Along
with hot local and nationally known acts DJ Angelique, DJ Alicia, DJ
Dazy, Mistress Barbara, Sandra Collins, DJ Heather and Lisa Lashes,
these women are routinely listed among the area's top picks to get
the party started.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of women behind the decks changes the room--and, most
people say, for the better. Women definitely use their sex appeal,
and often their voices (occasionally singing over their mix), to push
the party higher. They dance during sets and look great. But they've
been dogged for years by charges that they get the gigs only because
they're still relatively rare or because they're cute.</TE>
<TE>   For Saverio, it only means she has more to prove. "For a two-hour
set, I practice all day," she says, thumbing through endless boxes of
records. "I really want to know the ins and outs of my records. The
mixing is what makes me different, so it's important I not get caught
off-guard by a groove."</TE>
<TE>   On the wall of Saverio's home recording studio is a picture of a
beach chair on an empty beach. Written above it in black pen are the
words, "Just 5 years away. Work harder!"</TE>
<TE>   There are posters promoting the drum-and-bass records she has
made, 21 stacks of mostly unlabeled vinyl stacked on various shelves,
candles in the fireplace, magazines--Spin, Urb, Entertainment Weekly,
BPM--on the coffee table. There are also photos of her family
throughout her studio, where she and her music partner, Brian
Paturalski, are working on her forthcoming album as well as a film
score they are doing on spec. As an artist, producer and label head
(she runs Proper Talent records), Saverio is almost completely
single-minded in her pursuit of the perfect mix.</TE>
<TE>   That tenacity is what allows her to be one of the few women to
succeed in the competitive world of drum-and-bass, a style
popularized by Goldie and Roni Size in the late '90s. Saverio says of
her preferred style of music: "There is definitely a war. It's
fiercely competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Why, though, is drum-and-bass so much more cutthroat than other
styles of electronic music? "It's so fast," she says, "it's so
technical and it's such sharp music."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colette--last name Marino--stops short in front of Vice, a trendy
clothing boutique on Sunset Boulevard, where a girl with pink hair is
kicking out an awesome mix of songs on Day 2 of the street fair. "Oh,
it's a girl DJ," a man in a cowboy hat says to a friend as he walks
past.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear that?" Colette asks, looking to her entourage. "It
always cracks me up. When people say that, they must not ever go out,
because there are so many female DJs out there now."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Jenny Arellano is one of several fans dancing throughout
Colette's hourlong performance. As Colette goes down off the the
stage to meet her followers (this is still standard practice for her
but no longer typical of the increasingly superstar world of DJs),
Arellano is one of the first to approach her. Arellano is a bit shy,
but as soon as she sees how receptive Colette is to the
compliment--Colette asks Arellano's name, poses for pictures and
signs autographs--Arellano embraces her in a hug.</TE>
<TE>   "Colette is house music," Arellano says. "And we don't have a lot
of female DJs who can throw the energy to the crowd, so any time you
see a woman up there, it's inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   Colette has an intimate understanding of the female DJ movement.
She became a role model for it, albeit unintentionally, after getting
her start with Super Jane, a collective of four women--Colette,
Heather, DJ Dayhota and Lady D. Formed in 1997, Super Jane inspired a
number of female DJs and was among the first DJ acts, male or female,
to infiltrate mainstream national press. A sort of Spice Girls (even
Colette jokingly uses the term "girl power" to describe them) for the
female DJ scene, Super Jane was featured in Spin, among other
publications, for its positive influence on young women.</TE>
<TE>   "People freak out over Super Jane," Colette says. "They love it."</TE>
<TE>   But Colette recalls a comment by Reid Speed, one of the few women
to break into the drum-and-bass scene, that put their impact in
perspective. "What she said is: 'What I like best about Super Jane is
it's not just they're girls; they're all great DJs.' "</TE>
<TE>   Colette comes from the less aggressive genre of house music. The
day of her Sunset Junction performance, she prepares in her San
Fernando Valley home by going through her mail (she says records are
sent to her every day; among the swag being opened on this day are
12-inch singles by Moby, which she doesn't like, Underworld, which
she does, and a T-shirt from dance label Electric Monkey), practicing
and eating her usual: chicken Caesar salad at Mazzarinos, a Sherman
Oaks eatery owned by her cousin.</TE>
<TE>   If Colette and Saverio have the same dedication, their approach to
music varies in theory. For Colette, who painted the oils on canvas
hanging in her living room (paintings done during her college days at
DePaul and the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she
graduated) and who has studied photography and is a voracious reader,
music may be her life, but it's not her only interest.</TE>
<TE>   And walking around the Junction, she frequently stops to ooh and
aah over babies. At 27, she freely admits to "baby fever."</TE>
<TE>   "It started in airports," she says. "There were five babies on my
flight from New York back to L.A. yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to have kids, but for a DJ it's even more difficult than
for female musicians like Madonna or Patti Smith because DJs have to
be on the road so frequently. Although a recording artist can make an
album and choose not to tour, being away from home is the way in
which DJs support their recording work.</TE>
<TE>   From January of this year through August, Colette has flown
140,000 miles. She can tell you that United Airlines switched from
Coke products to Pepsi. Little wonder she says, "I don't have a time
zone." So, how will Colette handle the baby thing? "I don't know,"
she says, smiling. "I'd need a superlative man."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saverio can relate. She bemoans the fact that, somewhere in her
industrial-strength schedule, she hasn't managed to find a boyfriend
since moving to L.A. from London last February.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is so dry," she says with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   For Saverio though, that's secondary to the music. If she feels
she has something to prove, it has less to do with her being a woman
behind the decks than with her own intensity. A self-described
"bulldog," she is, at times, almost disarmingly candid. Even at her
most personable.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because I felt I'd gone as far as I could go in
England," she says. "People were not physically stopping me, but I
really felt that people did not want me to step out of place and I
should just be a little cute girl that plays drum-and-bass in clubs
where nobody really cares. I'm better than that, and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of female musicians, she's fed up with the focus on
gender. At the mention of the phrase "female DJ," she snaps: "Male,
female; it's the same. We've got to stop going on about female, male.
There are tons of female DJs now; get over it."</TE>
<TE>   While it may feel equal to Saverio, who along with Irene and
trance goddess Sandra Collins opened the door for female DJs, DJ
Irene questions if that is indeed the case. "It's great that there
are other women becoming DJs, but they have to realize that they have
to work harder than the average guy who's a DJ. We still live in a
world where we think women are OK, but we get judged more than a man
next to us," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "That will always exist and we'll always have to work harder to
prove our point--that we are just as good," Irene adds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Following Colette's set, the spiky-haired Irene takes the stage at
Sunset Junction, throwing down some furiously paced hard-core house
beats to a gathering of enthusiastic fans down front, who make it
clear why she is America's top-selling female DJ.</TE>
<TE>   Clad all in black, the smiling Irene comes to the front of the
stage, waving to her fans, then throwing some CDs into the crowd. A
star here in L.A., where she earned an "MVP" honor from L.A. Weekly,
she is conscious of maintaining that bond with her fans. Later, when
her monitors go out, rather than throw a tantrum, she apologies to
the crowd and promises to do her best, despite the fact she can't
hear her own mixes.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Colette and Irene back to back on Sunday night, and
Saverio, as DJ Rap, the night before, it becomes clear that one
noticeable way in which female DJs differ from their male
counterparts is their use of physicality.</TE>
<TE>   Many male DJs look stagnant on stage, save for some fist pumping
and hand waving to energize the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But Colette and Rap use their bodies--bouncing when directly
behind the turntables and dancing during particularly long tracks
that don't require them to be glued to the decks.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that the crown feeds on their energy.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as Rap takes her place behind the decks at Echo,
the dance floor fills up. Deftly crisscrossing her arms to navigate
the multiple turntables, she reconfigures her normal drum-and-bass
set to a break-heavy mix. Although the friendlier breaks, featuring
more stops and starts and large synthesizers, are not her usual
weapons of choice, she wears out the dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Rabin, of Rabin, Rodgers Inc., a party-planning company that
counts Details magazine and Madonna among its clients, says female
DJs bring less ego to the mix, which is why his company likes to use
them for events. "Women ... can really read the crowd and map out the
details of the night," Rabin says. "That makes the difference between
a good night and a great, unforgettable night."</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that while women have proved their skills
behind the decks, they still do occasionally get gigs because of
their gender. Some promoters suggest that women have more of a
built-in audience than male DJs. Men want to watch a female DJ,
particularly an attractive one, while women feel they should support
one of their own, the theory goes.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, of late, there is a sort of reverse sexism taking
effect.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the male DJs who have a problem with it, at least
outwardly, but the women who feel it diminishes them. "There are DJs
that get recognition just because they're females, and that's not
necessarily fair either," says Alicia, an L.A. resident via Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   Saverio finds the same thing: "All I see is promoters giving girls
a chance because they're girls, and that's not right."</TE>
<TE>   Penelope Tuesdae is a New York-based DJ who likes to go topless
during her set. She is not the only one, though she is the best
known. Though even she admits in an interview with Orlando Weekly, "I
have to back it up with the skills."</TE>
<TE>   Irene seconds that.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other women who may be sexy, but as long as they can
back up their stuff, then I'm all for them."</TE>

<HD>A Steakhouse That Serves Up Lean Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Arroyo of Cobras &amp; Matadors has a knack for creating
restaurants that are moderately priced and fun, which in the L.A.
restaurantscape are about as rare as a pair of Manolos for next to
nothing. He's got a good eye and can turn the most unpromising space
into something interesting.</LD>
<LD>   Every time I drive by Cobras &amp; Matadors on Beverly Boulevard, a
crowd is spilling out the door and around the trio of sidewalk
tables. This casual spot, where you can eat--and eat--for less than
$20, is a bona fide hit with the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Still, not every hipster is enamored of Spanish tapas. That's why
he recently opened Hillmont in Los Feliz. It's on Hollywood Boulevard
between Hillhurst and Vermont, hence the name. The menu is zealously
anti-exotic, pretty much steak and more steak and other cuts of meat
at what the French would call "interesting" prices. Every main course
comes with watercress salad and a choice of one side, and they're all
less than $20.</LD>
<TE>   Forget about cozying up to your honey at a romantic table for two,
though. Hillmont takes the refectory route with long communal tables
set out in rows. Walk in, find an empty spot and set your own table.
Don't wait for the waiter: About all he or she does is hand you the
menu and inform you of the occasional special or non-show on the
menu.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've decided, you order at the counter and go back to your
seat. (To note: Reservations are taken only for parties of six or
more.) Then, with your order pinned to the clotheslines that run
overhead, you take in the convivial scene and the industrial chic
room until a server brings your dinner.</TE>
<TE>   On a slow weekday night, when I'm not even sure the chef is in
house, the food is just OK. Maybe it's an off night, I don't know,
but at these prices, it's not a tragedy. There's a nice chicken, rice
and mint soup, an oily spinach salad adorned with bacon and egg, and
fresh asparagus paired with pecorino cheese. You can order platters
for the table, too--an assortment of charcuterie, a mixed grill, or
shellfish selection, along with steamed mussels or clams.</TE>
<TE>   Hillmont is basically a budget steakhouse looking to break the
tradition wide open. Skirt steak is $15, filet and dry-aged New York
strip, $21. (The latter is the tastiest piece of beef on offer.) No
obfuscation here: The menu lists the weight of each of the steaks on
offer.</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't eat red meat can go with a very roasted chicken or
fish of the day. Sides, which range from French green beans and
mashed red-skinned potatoes to "Mac and cheese," are enjoyable.
Desserts are real kid stuff--fudge brownies, French toast, cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it's the perfect place to go with friends from the
neighborhood at prices that won't make anyone's wallet wince. The
format can be a surprise, though. It's funny to watch newcomers do a
double take: The communal table thing doesn't come naturally. But
then, who knows, you might get to talking.... Oh, and until the new
bar is finished in a couple of weeks, Hillmont is strictly BYOB (wine
or beer) for a $5 service fee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hillmont, 4655 Hollywood Blvd., Los Feliz; (323) 669-3922.
Appetizers, $5-$10; main courses, $15-$21. Open Tuesdays-Sundays for
dinner only; kitchen stays open till midnight on weekends;
reservations not required for parties of fewer than six. Lot parking.</TE>

<HD>The Auteur in the Background</HD>
<DH>Frontman, sideman, writer, producer, performer: John Parish
happily goes his own way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PJ Harvey ... Eels ... Tracy Chapman ... Sparklehorse ... Giant Sand.</LD>
<LD>   That's a diverse bunch of distinguished pop artists, but they have
at least one thing in common besides piles of rave reviews--a bloke
named John Parish.</LD>
<LD>   His teamings with these pop auteurs have quietly established the
low-key musician and producer as the consummate collaborator. Now
he's being nudged out of the shadows, sharing in the acclaim for
Eels' current "Souljacker" album, then landing the co-producer
assignment on veteran singer-songwriter Chapman's upcoming record.
He's also planning to team again with Harvey after a long hiatus, and
on Tuesday, Thrill Jockey Records will release Parish's first solo
album in the U.S., "How Animals Move."</LD>
<TE>   "There's no kind of shift in career--'Oh, I don't want to be a
sideman anymore, I want to be a frontman,' " says Parish, 43. "I
don't really have any desire to be a frontman full time, because
that's not really where my interest is.</TE>
<TE>   "I like writing music by myself, I like writing with other people
and I like producing stuff, and I'm quite happy to shift from
collaborator to main protagonist. It's kind of whatever seems the
most interesting thing tends to be what I get drawn to."</TE>
<TE>   That list ranges from projects with little-known bands in
England's West Country, where Parish grew up and still lives, to that
remarkable string of albums he's participated in, from Harvey's "To
Bring You My Love" in 1995 to, more recently, Giant Sand's "Chore of
Enchantment" and Sparklehorse's "It's a Wonderful Life."</TE>
<TE>   "He's an incredible person, John. I'd trust him with my life,"
says Harvey, who's known Parish since she was 17 and counts him as
her best friend. "Having that trust in somebody is always what I look
for in who I collaborate with, because that's when you can be open
and yourself....</TE>
<TE>   "John is an extremely good judge of music.... He's got a brilliant
ear for hearing when something's good, when something's bad or what's
wrong with it. And he's such an intelligent and articulate person
that he can then describe it to you really well so that you
understand it."</TE>
<TE>   "He gets some amazing sounds," says Eels leader E, who granted
Parish a major writing, performing and producing role on
"Souljacker." "We both have a love for the kind of sounds that make
people get up to check their stereo to see if something's gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great things about him is that he's not that
diplomatic." He will just come out and say that something doesn't
work. "And in the end," says E, "you want that on your side."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, whose more traditional style makes her the odd fit in the
Parish resume, was looking for a co-producer who could bring "a
musician's sensibility" to the recording process.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that, in spite of our different backgrounds, we had some
overlapping musical tastes--T. Rex, David Bowie, Johnny Cash," says
Chapman. "Upon meeting John, I was impressed by his forthright nature
and sense of humor--qualities he displayed throughout the making of
the record, along with his willingness to let the method serve the
song, the needs of the musicians."</TE>
<TE>   T. Rex and Bowie, along with Led Zeppelin, were early influences
on Parish, followed by Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, among many.
He played in a band called Automatic Dlamini, which along the way
added a young Harvey on guitar, saxophone and backing vocals.</TE>
<TE>   She had gone on to become one of rock's most provocative artists
when she enlisted Parish to co-produce her third album, 1995's "To
Bring You My Love." Parish then played with her on tour, leading to
their 1996 co-billed album "Dance Hall at Louse Point."</TE>
<TE>   All along, Parish was recording bits and pieces of his own,
ranging from spare, classical-sounding works to grand, eccentric
pieces of instrumental pop. When he formed an 11-piece band of West
Country musicians for some recreational playing, he rifled through
this catalog to find material for shows. The songs sounded pretty
good when put together in a set, so he decided to make an album with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's the rare Parish project that bears his own name (his
first solo work, the soundtrack for the Belgian film "Rosie," wasn't
released in the U.S.), "How Animals Move" isn't designed to make him
a star. Mostly instrumental, it's as demanding as it is evocative and
mainly somber in mood until a bawdy old blues song sung by Harvey
shifts the balance at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I know everybody says they make music for themselves," says
Parish, who plans to tour here with his group next year. "But I think
probably most people do, and you kind of figure if I like it, then
other people like me will like it, I suppose.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to work very instinctively. I'm not sure I've ever sat
down and planned something in advance.... At the time I don't really
think about it. Stuff just comes out, and I try to collect it in the
best way that I can."</TE>
<TE>   That will do for a mission statement. Meantime, Parish, who lives
in Bristol with his wife, artist Michelle Henning, and their two
young daughters, finds himself surprisingly far along a path he
dreamed about some 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this thought that, wow, Robert Fripp must have a nice life:
He gets to play on really interesting records, he gets to produce a
few things, gets to do his own stuff, and I guess nobody's ever gonna
bother him when he goes out shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking that must be a really good position to be in,
and I kind of thought the other day, well, I guess in some ways I'm
headed to that kind of place, and if I end up there that would be
great."</TE>

<HD>A Night on the Wild Side</HD>
<DH>Families can camp at the L.A. Zoo, touring habitats and
learning more about the animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The natives are restless. Anxious bearers clutch their loads. All are
certain that an adventure awaits them, not on the plains of Kenya or
on Himalayan cliff tops but on one of the few family camping
experiences to be had within Los Angeles' city limits, through
Sundown Safari.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 10 years, the popular zoo sleepover program has opened
the Los Angeles Zoo for family camping overnights. You bring the
backpacks, duffels, sleeping bags and tents, and the zoo provides a
way to explore the after-hours domain of the animals housed there.
Campers range in age from children in strollers to pre-teens and
their accompanying mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles and grandparents.</LD>
<LD>   The program has it all over conventional camping; there's no need
to forage for kindling, haul bags of briquettes or pick the crisp,
black casing off overdone hot dogs.</LD>
<TE>   Campers check in at the front gates and a tram takes them and
their equipment to Play Park--a grass-covered base camp surrounded by
trees--where families offload their gear and meet the camp staff.</TE>
<TE>   The evenings are coordinated by one of the zoo's curators, and the
talks and tours are led by docents.</TE>
<TE>   On one recent evening, docent Margaret Tollner welcomed a group of
nearly 150, gave a rundown of the evening's activities and explained
campsite rules: Do not leave the campground or go anywhere
unattended; flashlights aren't allowed; don't feed the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Then Tollner switched to the topic the docents are passionate
about: animal life.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith Park, where the zoo is situated, has animal life of its
own.</TE>
<TE>   "Does anybody know what kinds of animals we might find in the
park, outside of the zoo?" Tollner asked. Young campers shouted back:
"Skunks!" "Bats!" "Raccoons!" "Coyotes!"</TE>
<TE>   Tollner then explained that although campers might hear or, in the
case of the skunk, smell these animals during the night, the camp is
safe and secure.</TE>
<TE>   One of the high points was a chance for campers to get close--even
touch--some of the smallest zoo residents.</TE>
<TE>   Docent Georgia Hill lifted a scaly skink, a member of the lizard
family, from his box. Tollner pointed out a white peacock that was
exploring the brush at the edges of the campground.</TE>
<TE>   And assistant curator Kristin Evans held a huge hissing cockroach
in her palm. It sat motionless until a tiny camper reached over to
touch its shiny back; it hissed and more than a few campers jumped
back.</TE>
<TE>   While the children tossed questions to the docents and made the
rounds from animal to animal, parents finished setting up camp.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo Staff Cooks Meals</TE>
<TE>   Most of the logistics are handled by zoo staffers, who set up
communal areas, coordinate the spacing of tents and prepare meals and
snacks.</TE>
<TE>   This evening's dinner menu included chicken tenders prepared on
the grill, accompanied by pesto pasta and salad, with a peanut butter
and jelly option and fruit to top things off.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, participants were divided into small groups, each
assigned a pair of docents who set off with their groups for tours.</TE>
<TE>   Animal keepers met the groups at the various enclosures and
escorted them behind the scenes for an up-close look at black bears,
rhinoceroses, giraffes and orangutans in their indoor habitats.</TE>
<TE>   Keeper Samantha Messer led one small group of campers through a
utility entrance to one of the "bedrooms" of a pair of adolescent
black bears, Ranger and Ashby.</TE>
<TE>   Past the maintenance equipment and into a fairly narrow passage,
campers squeezed in to get a look at one of the 250-pound teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Children and parents had questions: "Would he kill you if you got
into his cage?" Messer popped a snack into Ranger's mouth and
answered, "He could if he wanted to."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to touring animal habitats, campers played games and
did crafts; some took advantage of the "jungle gym" play structure
next to the campground.</TE>
<TE>   Just before lights out, campers sat around a fire and roasted
marshmallows for s'mores--the venerable chocolate, marshmallow and
graham cracker campfire confection--and listened to stories.</TE>
<TE>   After an full evening of walking tours, games and outdoor
activities, most campers were quite ready to head for their tents,
crawl into their sleeping bags and listen to the apes--siamangs and
gibbons--call out their goodnights.</TE>
<TE>   Morning came early: Campers had the option of taking a walk
through the zoo, followed by breakfast and a talk by one of the
keepers.</TE>
<TE>   The program officially ended at 9 a.m., but many families stowed
their camping gear in their cars, then headed back into the zoo to
spend the day--this time in front of the cages.</TE>
<TE>   Groups Can Also Camp</TE>
<TE>   Sundown Safari, aimed at family groups, is the centerpiece of the
zoo's sleepover programs; a close relative is Zoopendous Nights.</TE>
<TE>   The program allows organized groups of up to 100 individuals,
including scouts, civic clubs, church youth groups or school classes
to take part in a zoo sleepover program that generally follows the
Safari itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor camping is available from April through October; indoor
camping (no tents) is offered the rest of the year.</TE>

Championships in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The Whole City in a Day: I like to bike across the city early in
the morning on a Saturday or Sunday. Sometimes I go out to Mt.
Wilson, so I cross a big part of the city. I've biked everywhere.
I've been through Beverly Hills, Hawthorne, Inglewood and East L.A. I
had to see it all. When I go to Mt. Wilson, I'll start at my house in
Woodland Hills, cut across Oxnard Street and then I take Magnolia and
then Glenoaks toward Pasadena. It's a pretty good route. There are
bike lanes on most of those roads. Or another example is I'll cut
across one of the canyons and I'll ride out to Santa Monica and have
a coffee at the Rose Cafe. Then I will ride across the Sepulveda Pass
and all the way up to Mt. Wilson and then back through the Valley.
Sometimes on those days I put in 160 miles. I'll leave when the sun
comes up and come back when the sun comes down.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bargains and Babes at Target: My favorite place to shop is Target,
the one here on Ventura Boulevard. There are a lot of pretty women
there, always walking around. I'm still a typical Dutch person. Dutch
people keep their money in their pocket, and I know that Americans
consume and the economy here just turns over a lot quicker. So I've
learned to spend my money, but I still buy stuff in bulk, and I go to
Target. I don't go there to shop for anything stylish. But for
everyday household stuff, it's good.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Along the Road: I've discovered some interesting things while
bicycling. I mountain bike in Topanga State Park, and I've seen
basically all the animals you have out here. I've seen a mountain
lion and a bobcat and deer. What's also fun is trying to find roads
I've never been on before. I just try and turn left and right, and
you can sometimes find some really interesting, long climbs and
there's absolutely nothing out there, and you wonder why they ever
paved that road. I've been here for seven years, and in the beginning
when I was out here, I really wanted to see everything. And I ended
up in downtown and I saw all the homeless and I was like "wow."
They're living in all those carton boxes, and you see hundreds of
them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Young Town: One thing I miss about Europe is people walking,
just people walking on the street, especially here in the San
Fernando Valley. You have it in Santa Monica, and that's why I like
Santa Monica. I think I also miss the old architecture. It's just
such a young town. My town in Holland is 1,000 years old. So those
are the things I miss a little bit. But you're highly compensated
here by the weather, entertainment and freedom of enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Best Place to Bike: I have a favorite route in the morning that I
usually take, and it passes through Cold Creek Canyon on the way to
Malibu. The roads are so well maintained in the Santa Monica
Mountains and relatively quiet. Topanga and Malibu Canyon are a
little busy, but anything else, the other 10 or 15 climbs in the
Santa Monica Mountains, I absolutely love. That's my favorite spot.</TE>

<HD>'Scales of Justice' Teeters Between the Extremes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William C. Kovacsik's world premiere play "Scales of Justice," at the
Long Beach Playhouse's Studio Theatre, is a well-crafted and often
intelligent play marred by stereotypes and a certain obviousness.</LD>
<LD>   There's an almost cinematic quality to Kovacsik's drama about
battling student editors at a university law review who are furiously
divided over whether or not to allow a controversial Supreme Court
justice to speak at their graduation ceremonies.</LD>
<LD>   With a few revisions, the story could find a second life as a
feature film. Its twentysomething characters are impassioned,
politically precocious and sexually eclectic--a natural for
Hollywood's youth demographic. But those revisions are key. Kovacsik
too often idiot-proofs his material, making didactic ethical
pronouncements that cheapen the integrity of the piece.</LD>
<TE>   The most obvious example is the fractious dynamic between Paul
(Vincent Roca), the head of the law review, and his bricklayer dad,
Joe (Ian Tanza), a character who seems bafflingly extraneous to the
plot. At play's end, when Paul arrives at a moral crossroads, Joe is
conveniently on hand to point out just what Paul has to lose by
compromising his principles--a deduction that should be self-evident
to the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, director Martin Lang too often allows the rhythms of
Kovacsik's sharp dialogue to degenerate into archness. And, of
course, the play's African American female is an in-your-face kind of
gal, while the obligatory feminist is bound to be secretly lesbian.
Need we say that the Supreme Court justice in question (Richard
Meese), a dangerous ideologue, is a right-winger?</TE>
<TE>   That said, Kovacsik exploits his stereotypes to surprisingly
cerebral effect. "Scales of Justice" is a flawed but consistently
entertaining examination of the dangers of censorship in a free
society. Moreover, it explores the perils of self-righteousness and
blind self-justification--growing threats that undermine rational
discourse on both sides of the political spectrum.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Big Step Up</HD>
<DH>Venues* In a major revamping, the historic Wiltern Theatre
loses its floor seating but gains a new and versatile floor
arrangement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Dylan is pretty much guaranteed a standing ovation when he plays
at the Wiltern Theatre on Oct. 15.</LD>
<LD>   That's because for the first time since the ornate Art Deco house
opened at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue with
the 1931 premiere of the movie "Alexander Hamilton," most of the
audience won't have seats.</LD>
<LD>   Dylan's concert will kick off a series of events inaugurating the
historic facility after a reported $1.5-million makeover that was
begun July 1. Dylan will also play the next two nights, with the
Cult, Underworld, Ryan Adams, Ani DiFranco, Jaguares, Badly Drawn Boy
and an already announced Nov. 4 show by the Rolling Stones among the
other acts booked for the opening run.</LD>
<TE>   With the about 1,200 fixed seats removed, the slanted floor has
been sculpted into five tiers rising away from the front of the
stage. Each level is fronted with a waist-high wall and can be set up
either for a standing, general-admission format, with tables and
chairs nightclub style, or with seats placed in rows. It can also be
configured in different combinations--the first two tiers with tables
and chairs, the back three general-admission standing, for example.
The balcony will retain its fixed seats for nearly 1,000 people, with
the main floor holding from about 900 to 1,400, depending on the
setup.</TE>
<TE>   The work is being done with care to preserve the details of the
theater, which had fallen into disuse but was saved from the wrecking
ball by the Los Angeles Conservancy and in 1985 was reopened as an
officially designated historic landmark. The lobby is also getting a
face-lift to provide for better bar service and to accommodate full
food service.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Murphy, chief operating officer of Wiltern owner Clear
Channel Entertainment's Los Angeles music division, began the push to
remodel two years ago after surveying the changes he saw coming in
the region's concert theater landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "We were meeting with the Music Center people and looking at the
Disney Hall plans, and we were being shown what was coming with the
Kodak Theatre," he said, noting that without L.A. Philharmonic and
other events, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion will have 120 nights a
year open for bookings.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy foresaw the Wiltern competing against the Chandler, the
Pantages Theatre (after the run of "The Producers" concludes) and
several other conventional-seating facilities, not just for rock and
pop concerts, but also dance performances, awards shows, television
tapings, stage productions and corporate events. He also had noticed
the Wiltern losing out on acts preferring general-admission shows,
which turned to the smaller Palace, House of Blues and El Rey
Theatre, as well as the larger Hollywood Palladium.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt, 'We gotta become something different,' " he said. As a
basic model, Murphy and his team looked at a renovation done in the
mid-'80s at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre, which is now also owned
by Clear Channel. The Warfield, though, ended up with a flat, open
floor. The tiered arrangement was proposed for the Wiltern to make
for better sight lines and to allow for the versatility of format.</TE>
<TE>   Conducting a recent tour of the Wiltern, longtime production
manager Reid Bartlett stressed that every change was subject to
approval by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission, right down to
the new carpeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a sample of the lobby carpet and were able to find a loom
that could reproduce the pattern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And contingencies had to be made for the possibility of restoring
the Wiltern to its original state.</TE>
<TE>   "The seats are all in storage," he said. "It was a condition that
we had to keep them in case we give up on this in a few years.... We
have to restore it then."</TE>
<TE>   The 1985 restoration of the Wiltern by developers Ratkovich,
Bowsers and Perez Inc. and Bronco Ltd. was hailed both as a major
victory for preservation efforts and as the arrival of a first-rate
presence in the city's performance circuit. Housed in an office
building marked by its distinctive Pellister green patina, the
theater had a checkered history and had been dark since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   From its reopening performance by the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre
through pop singer Pink's late-June concerts, it has been among the
most prominent venues in town. Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and
Sting are among the performers who chose to give special, intimate
shows there. In addition to Dylan's Oct. 15-17 stand and the Stones'
Nov. 4 show, confirmed dates are Musiq (Oct. 18), the Cult (Oct. 19
and 20), Underworld (Oct. 21), Ryan Adams (Oct. 23), Ani DiFranco
(Oct. 24), Art Garfunkel (Oct. 27), Jaguares (Nov. 1), Sinbad (Nov.
2), a Step Up benefit with Aimee Mann and Joe Henry (Nov. 5), Badly
Drawn Boy (Nov. 8) and Filter (Nov. 9). Unconfirmed but expected are
dates for Chris Robinson, Sigur Ros, Soft Cell, Thievery Corporation
and Me'shell Ndegeocello.</TE>

<HD>An 'American Idol' of Their Very Own</HD>
<DH>Games* Developed with girls 10 to 16 in mind, a CD-ROM lets
players plan routines, perform for judges and make a video.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new "American Idol" may have been crowned last night in the
star-studded two-hour finale of the Fox summer series but the
competition to uncover the next pop superstar won't necessarily have
to wait for "American Idol 2," now slated to come to TV early next
year. The contest continues with the Nov. 1 release of the "American
Idol CD-ROM."</LD>
<LD>   The game features a microphone, 20 different tunes, dance
routines, two hosts and three judges--all the ingredients necessary
to create the cyber "American Idol."</LD>
<LD>   And players can even post their performances online for a national
voting competition.</LD>
<TE>   "The key portions of the show we were looking to re-create is that
tension that people had performing in front of the judges," says Mike
Eaton, an executive producer of the Fox series for FremantleMedia.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be able to see the interaction between the judges
and the contestants and also have the ability to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal Publishing approached Fremantle just before the
series premiered in June with a game the company had been developing
for girls ages 10 to 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we started seeing this phenomenon mainly with girls
where girls wanted to become famous and play the part of an aspiring
pop idol," says Leslie House, vice president of Vivendi Universal
Publishing's kids division.</TE>
<TE>   "We developed the game and started looking for a partner. Several
months ago we saw this phenomenon in the U.K. and when we heard it
was coming to Fox, we contacted Fremantle in New York and presented
the nuts and bolts of the game and then adapted and changed it so it
would be suitable for 'American Idol.' "</TE>
<TE>   The game features three judges who are similar in personality to
Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, though the Cowell-esque
judge isn't quite so harsh as he is on the series.</TE>
<TE>   The game allows players to customize their cyber alter ego, who
House says resemble the series' 10 finalists, though she admits "we
never really got Justin's hair."</TE>
<TE>   Cyber contestants must sing, dance, answer questions and handle
difficult situations.</TE>
<TE>   The game allows winners to create a video of their "performance"
and then post it on a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The CD-ROM is just one marketing opportunity Fremantle is
developing to cash in on the attention the television show has
generated.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a genre of television where this show isn't going to
live on for 13 years. We understand that," Eaton says. "We need to
strike while the iron is hot, and we are moving forward with some
partners that are really attuned to be able to get product in the
market quickly."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mekons' lusty, artsy take on agit-punk has kept them
swashbuckling for 25 years, bobbing atop currents of political dogma
and stylistic purity that pulled under many of their contemporaries.</LD>
<LD>   From their 1977 single "Never Been in a Riot," a direct response
to the Clash's smash-it-up anthem "White Riot," to the new album,
"OOOH! (Out Of Our Heads)," these U.K. ex-pats (leaders Jon Langford
and Sally Timms live in the U.S.) have dredged art-punk, drunken
barroom howl, roaring guitar rock ("The Mekons Rock and Roll"),
alt-country (Langford fronted the Waco Brothers) and even sing-along
pop ("Millionaire").</LD>
<LD>   "OOOH!" finds their anarchic humor and consciousness intact, with
a great new Richard Thompson-like single, "Thee Olde Trip to
Jerusalem." The anniversary tour brings the "Rock and Roll" lineup,
including guitarists Tom Greenhalgh and Rico Bell, drummer Steve
Goulding, bassist Sarah Corina, violinist Suzie Honeyman and sax
player Lu Edmonds.</LD>
<TE>   A new book of Mekons lyrics, art and photographs, "Hello Cruel
World" (Verse Chorus Press), celebrating the art show "Out of Our
Heads," which gave rise to this album, also goes on sale this week.</TE>

<LD>   The 1962 reunion of the once-popular Calendars, a Weavers-like
folk trio split by the anti-communist hysteria of the 1950s, is a
tense one. Fervent political and social activist Fred and his loyal
wife, Kathy, haven't seen partner Curly since the pair's blacklisting
by the House Un-American Activities Committee. In a New York City
rehearsal room, they prepare for a three-song Calendars spot on
Curly's TV show--if they can agree on the songs. Seamlessly staged by
director Michael Canavan, William Mesnik's "Three Songs" is infused
with passionate immediacy by actors Stephen Rockwell, Jennifer
Hetrick and Kim Story, who sing with stirring conviction; Story and
Rockwell also provide deft accompaniment on guitar, banjo and
harmonica. The 10 folk songs--workers' anthems, a bawdy ballad, a
breathtaking a cappella rendition of "Shenandoah"</LD>
<LD>   --reveal each sharply defined character's love, passion, anger and
regret. Richard Spaulding's sound design and Carol Doehring's
lighting enhance the production.</LD>

<HD>Dreams, Fate Get 'Twisted' in Time-Hopping Tale of 2 Bands</HD>
<DH>The groups, two decades apart, play for love and success in
a musical that cuts back and forth and ties itself in knots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music and sports are the great hopes of many young Americans. Success
in one or the other can be a ticket out of poverty or an unhappy
home--a fast ride to a better life.</LD>
<LD>   The odds stink, but the dream stays alive.</LD>
<LD>   The new musical "Twisted" tells the tales of two bands, two
decades apart, that pursue that dream. Along the way, both groups
find themselves bucking the odds in an equally daunting field: love.</LD>
<TE>   These are compelling ideas, driven by a dozen high-energy songs.
But the story, by Geo Hartley, loses its way among too many plot
strands, and the songs, by Max Baxley, lose some of their power when
performed to prerecorded tracks, without microphones.</TE>
<TE>   As nice as it would be to see the show turn into a small-theater
smash like "Reefer Madness!" or "bare," the chances don't look good
for its presentation at McCadden Place Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The action cuts back and forth between 1980, when a brother-sister
singing duo climbs the charts, and the present, as a co-ed sextet of
soulful hip-hoppers tries to get noticed. The connection between the
groups is Phyllis (Gayla Goehl), who managed the siblings and, years
later, finds herself living adjacent to an alley where the young
hip-hoppers practice.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis has been on the lam for the 22 years in between because
she is accused of having killed the female singer in the former group
(Phe Caplan) and wounding the brother (Jasper Wood).</TE>
<TE>   The show's title is, in part, a reference to love's tendency to
twist the heart around, as Phyllis' entanglement with the '80s duo
unfolds alongside complications within the present-day group (Aaron
Cooke, Denver Dowridge, Jason Powell, Amber Stuart, Frankie Anne and
Bridget Jones).</TE>
<TE>   Little of this rises above the level of a TV crime show, but
Hartley's staging is sleek and sexy, and the songs set a fun groove,
whether in the style of '80s new wave, slinky R&amp;B or pulsating
hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-bodied young performers have charisma to spare, and the
sounds coming out of their mouths are often quite impressive (though
some of the harmony numbers were still experiencing pitch problems
during opening weekend).</TE>
<TE>   The songs are performed without amplification, though, which makes
them sound naked. Today's ears expect that added level of slickness
in a pop song.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Twisted," McCadden Place Theatre, 1157 N. McCadden Place,
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Sept. 29.
$20. (310) 275-9887. Running time: 2 hours, 10 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Fried or sometimes baked, these savory Latin turnovers can be stuffed
with anything--meat, fish or vegetables.</LD>
<LD>   Tere's Mexican Grill: In a small Hollywood mini-mall, this
family-run grill serves puffy fried cornmeal empanadas filled with
chorizo sausage, potatoes, tomatoes, onions and garlic. You get two
on a bed of shredded lettuce with guacamole and pico de gallo. For a
little bit extra, you can get Spanish rice and refried beans on the
side. (Empanadas, $5.50; with beans and rice, $6.95.) Tere's Mexican
Grill, 5870 W. Melrose Ave., L.A., (323) 468-9345.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Little Belize: Owner Adrian Zetina specializes in Belizean fish
empanadas. Tuna fried with green peppers and onions is the filling
for the little cornmeal dumplings, which are topped with chopped
cabbage, habaneros and onions. These silver-dollar-sized empanadas
cost less than a dollar. (Fish empanadas, 75 cents each.) Little
Belize, 217 Nutwood Ave., Inglewood, (310) 674-0696.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mojo: Chef Reza Motamednia makes a plate of three empanadas--one
with Mexican beef chorizo, one with chicken, almonds and dried fruit,
and the third with shrimp, corn, green chiles and cheese. Served with
a puree of avocado, cilantro, jalapeno and tomatillos, and a spicy
chile sauce. (Tres empanadas, $16.) Mojo, W Hotel, 930 Hilgard Ave.,
Westwood, (310) 443-7820.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Empanada's Place: This chain, which specializes in Argentine
empanadas, just opened its third location on La Cienega Boulevard. It
features 16 varieties, eight with meat and eight with vegetable
fillings. The fried dumplings are small enough that you'll want to
try at least three, so how about starting with a criolla (beef,
raisins, green onions and egg) and a pascualina (spinach, mozzarella
and white sauce)? They come with green salad in Italian dressing.
(Empanadas, $2.25 each; 12 for $22.50.) Empanada's Place, 3811
Sawtelle Blvd., Culver City, (310) 391-0888; 18912 Ventura Blvd.,
Tarzana, (818) 708-8640; 1040 N. La Cienega Blvd., L.A., (310)
358-0588.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlitos Gardel: Chef Azniz Bozoghlian makes an assortment of
delicately flavored little empanadas with four choices of filling:
ground beef, chicken with bell peppers, spinach with cheese or a very
subtle corn filling. The fried empanadas are served with chimichurri,
an Argentine garlic-parsley sauce. (Empanadas, $2.90 each.) Carlitos
Gardel, 7963 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (323) 655-0891.</TE>

<LD>   Clinton Denies Talk of a Talk Show, for Now</LD>
<LD>   Former President Bill Clinton, appearing on "Larry King Live,"
dispelled rumors that--having met with executives at CBS and
NBC--he's embarking on a daily talk show. "I'll think I'll leave that
to you," he quipped to the show's host.</LD>
<TE>   Ever the politician, however, Clinton left the door open for a
change of heart. While he doesn't anticipate becoming the new Oprah,
he conceded, he wouldn't rule out television.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, maybe sometime later in my life I'd like to do it," he
said Tuesday. "It would be intriguing to me because I like to talk to
people. I'd like to have [former rival Bob] Dole come on my show and
tell me what I did wrong about things."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, however, his plate is too full to commit to a daily
show, Clinton pointed out. He has to write his memoirs, pursue a host
of public speaking engagements and travel. "You know, I'm going to
Africa later this month," he said. "I'm going to India at the end of
November. And I really believe I should always spend more than half
my time on public service so I just don't see how I can do it."</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Off-Broadway Tickets:  A Record High at $100?</TE>
<TE>   Off-Broadway, traditionally the bastion of affordable fare, will
soon post what is said to be a record $100 ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we don't keep such records, it is almost a certainty
that this is a first," Marc Rossier, director of development and
marketing for art for New York, an organization that monitors the
Off-Broadway scene, told the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   The play? Bertolt Brecht's "The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui" at
the 750-seat Pace University Theater in downtown Manhattan, running
Oct. 3 to 26. For their money, ticket buyers will get an all-star
cast: Al Pacino, Billy Crudup, Chazz Palminteri, Steve Buscemi and
Charles Durning.</TE>
<TE>   The play will be produced by the National Actors Theater, run by
Tony Randall. "This is a special presentation for us that will help
the company, of course," said spokesman Gary Springer. "We're a
not-for-profit theater company, and nobody is going off to put money
in their own pockets."</TE>

<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   A Golden Paycheck for 'Legally Blonde' Sequel</TE>
<TE>   Joining the ranks of Hollywood's best-paid actresses, Reese
Witherspoon will receive a hefty $15 million for "Legally Blonde 2:
Red, White &amp; Blonde," Variety reports. It will be a sequel to the
2001 film in which she played a superficial Bel Air sorority girl who
enrolls at Harvard Law School to win back her boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "Legally Blonde" took in $96.5 million in North America and
performed well on home video. Witherspoon will serve as a producer on
the sequel--and there may be more "Legally Blonde" down the road: MGM
and Disney's Touchstone Pictures are trying to adapt it for a
half-hour midseason comedy for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Stellan Skarsgard ("Breaking the Waves") will play the young
Father Merrin in "Exorcist: The Beginning," the prequel to the 1973
film. Paul Schrader will direct....UCLA Performing Arts has canceled
one of its higher-profile events, "Three Tales," a collaboration
between minimalist composer Steve Reich and video artist Beryl Korot
that was scheduled for Feb. 27-28. No explanation was offered....
Encouraged by the reception for its series "Sorority Life" this
summer, MTV not only has ordered another season of that but also a
companion show called--of course--"Fraternity Life."</TE>

<LD>* Mia Doi Todd, "In a Foreign Land," Columbia. The major label debut
from the Silver Lake, California resident. Todd's lyrics are often
intensely intimate--sometimes uncomfortably so, sounding like pages
from a personal journal not meant for others to read, from the
declaration of strength that is "Independence Day" to the startling
post-sex poetry of "Poppy Fields." The music is just as arresting,
generally eschewing the standard pop verse-chorus structures. At the
center is her remarkable voice, a full, round instrument that shows
her childhood operatic training and seems all the more stunning
coming from this slight, meek-seeming woman."</LD>

<LD>* New this week: "Blade II" brings back Wesley Snipes in the title
role as the Marvel Comics half-human, half-vampire who wears a long,
flowing black coat and has all the strengths of vampires but none of
their weaknesses--save a craving for blood. This time out, the
current vampire overlord has asked his sworn enemy, Blade, to join
forces with him to combat the Reapers, a super race of vampires
intent on destroying all vampires and then all humans. Silver bullets
and garlic mean nothing to these guys. The film is more enjoyable
than the original. Bloodbath that it is, it is largely free of the
extreme, lingering sadism that characterized the first film and
threatened to overwhelm Snipes' iconic presence. Director Guillermo
del Toro, the celebrated maker of "Cronos" and last year's "The
Devil's Backbone," brings to the film's nonstop action a mastery of
moods.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodbye to Harry's: Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill, the Century City
restaurant based on the famous Harry's Bar in Florence, Italy, shut
its doors Aug. 12. The message on the restaurant's answering machine
now says, "We're sorry to say that after 30 years at the ABC
Entertainment Center, Harry's Bar has now closed." Reason: The ABC
Entertainment Center is scheduled to close later this year to make
way for an office complex. Harry's was best known for its annual
Ernest Hemingway parody contest. The person who wrote what the judges
declared the best "one really good page of really bad Hemingway"
would win a trip to Italy and dinner at the original Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill in Florence.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A Few Additions to Joe's: In the last couple of weeks, Joe Miller
has added two seasoned chefs to the kitchen at Joe's: Blake Schumpert
as executive sous-chef and Mark Willard as executive pastry chef.
Schumpert was most recently the chef de partie-rotisseur at
Citronelle in Washington, D.C. Before that he opened the MGM Hotel
restaurant in Las Vegas and worked as sous-chef at Blue Hill
Restaurant and Zoe in New York. Willard has been the executive pastry
chef at All Seasons Bistro in Calistoga, Calif., consulting chef at
the Taj Hotel group in India and pastry cook at Hotel du Rhone in
Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   "I need new ideas and new people to help me," Miller says. "The
restaurant is changing and evolving ... we want to keep things fresh
and new."</TE>
<TE>   Miller has also added more options to his prix-fixe menu. There
are now a vegetarian menu, a tomato menu (seasonal) and a
seven-course menu, all under $50. "I've always been price-conscious
when it comes to food," Miller says. "I want to give people a good
deal. No customer wants to feel cheated--no, they want to feel full
and satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Joe's, 1023 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice, (310) 399-5811.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Food Studio: Developer Albert Sweet has renovated countless
industrial spaces in Hollywood and converted them into studio space
under the umbrella of Occidental Studios. Now, with so many food
shows on TV, Sweet is putting the finishing touches on a studio
devoted completely to food production.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no place on the West Coast except for Wolfgang Puck's
studio that's just for food," he says. The 4,200-square-foot space
has a fully equipped kitchen with a large Wolf range and all the
refrigerator space anyone could need, along with dressing rooms,
ample parking space and, yes, Sweet's own prop studio a mere block
away.</TE>
<TE>   His hope is that Southern California chefs will not have to fly
back East to do their television appearances. Instead, they can drive
15 or 20 minutes to the heart of Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>Herzog: A Poet of Doom and Survival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinematheque's retrospective, "Poet of Doom: A Tribute
to Werner Herzog in Person," is an overdue honor for a major
filmmaker, a pioneer of the New German Cinema whose more recent work
has barely surfaced in the U.S., if at all.</LD>
<LD>   The program's selection spans some of Herzog's earliest work right
up to tonight's sneak preview at 7:30 p.m. at the Egyptian of his
latest film, "Invincible," a pre-World War II drama based on a true
story and starring Tim Roth. The series runs through Sunday at the
Egyptian with Herzog, who turns 60 today, scheduled to attend all
screenings.</LD>
<LD>   While Herzog is a poet of doom, he is as much or more a poet of
survival and a relentless explorer of the extremes and margins of
human experience both in his fictional films and many provocative,
incisive documentaries. Since some of his most memorable films were
made with the late Klaus Kinski, the weekend gets underway Friday at
7 p.m. with Herzog's appreciation of his screen alter ego, "My Best
Fiend--Klaus Kinski" (1999).</LD>
<TE>   Herzog and actor Kinski were made for each other and worked on
five films together, beginning with their 1972 masterpiece "Aguirre,
the Wrath of God" (screening tonight at 9:45 p.m.). These films
reveal Herzog's obsession with exploring those outer-most limits of
human experience and Kinski's mesmerizing gift in portraying men
driven to risk madness in attaining all-but-impossible goals.</TE>
<TE>   Kinski's Aguirre is a 16th century Spanish conquistador who
becomes cruel and savage in his unrelenting search for El Dorado in
the wilds of the Peruvian jungle. Similarly, in the title role of
"Fitzcarraldo" (1982), which closes the series Sunday at 8 p.m.,
Kinski is an opera-loving Irishman, a failed railroad builder and a
struggling ice manufacturer who realizes he must belatedly join the
Peruvian rubber boom if he is to realize his absurd dream of building
an opera house in Iquitos that he intends his idol, Enrico Caruso, to
inaugurate. Herzog and Kinski went on to do a stylish 1978 remake of
"Nosferatu" (Saturday at 9:15 p.m.), an homage to F.W. Murnau's
silent original, with Kinski a perfectly cast Count Dracula.</TE>
<TE>   Their partnership ended in 1988 with "Cobra Verde," with Kinski
cast as an exploited Brazilian peasant turned bandit who is sent off
to revive the slave trade in West Africa only to end up leading a
rebellion against the mad king of Dahomey. "Cobra Verde," widely
regarded as a disappointment, was scheduled for a local release not
long after its completion only to be withdrawn, never to resurface.</TE>
<TE>   With "My Best Fiend," Herzog made a heartfelt homage to Kinski
that's alternately funny, tender and downright scary. In Herzog's
recounting of his tempestuous relationship with the actor, Kinski
emerges every bit as driven as the director but with considerably
less self-control, to put it mildly. Herzog owns up to his own
moments of madness, recorded memorably in Les Blank's "Burden of
Dreams," a compelling 1982 documentary on the making of
"Fitzcarraldo" that will screen Sunday at 4 p.m. with a newly
restored print.</TE>
<TE>   A world-class egomaniac given to volcanic eruptions of rage at the
slightest provocation, Kinski could also be a caring and thoughtful
man, as both Eva Mattes and Claudia Cardinale, leading ladies of
"Woyzeck" and "Fitzcarraldo," respectively, attest. Kinski, small and
wiry with a striking face, could be charming and likable off-screen
despite a blazing intensity that could leave one feeling drained.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow director and actor had enough understanding and respect
for each other for long enough periods of time to make their five
films, glimpsed in an array of fine clips, although Herzog says that
both Kinski and their working relationship were deteriorating by the
end of "Cobra Verde." "My Best Fiend" leaves one feeling that it was
a miracle that Herzog was able to work with Kinski at all. Herzog,
though, has said that the notion that Kinski might have been insane
"can only be justified from a petty and mediocre standpoint." Herzog
says that Kinski, "the most fascinating actor I know," had "burned
out" when he was found dead at 65 in his Northern California home in
1991. A discussion with Herzog follows the screening.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Herzog was about to begin shooting "Aguirre" in the
Peruvian jungle, he found himself stranded at the Lima airport on
Christmas Eve, 1971. The flight that would carry him and his crew to
their location was canceled; the group had also failed to get on an
earlier flight. Herzog was feeling unlucky--but only for a short
time: Soon after takeoff, the plane was struck by lightning and
plunged. The crash killed 92 passengers and crew. Search teams gave
up looking for survivors after 10 days. Much to everyone's
astonishment, a 17-year-old girl--Juliane Koepcke, the crash's sole
survivor--turned up two days later. For his 1999 "Wings of Hope,"
which screens Saturday at 5 p.m. in its local premiere, Herzog
persuaded Koepcke, a German biologist, to return to the
hard-to-locate site of the crash and retrace her steps out of the
jungle. "Wings of Hope" will be followed by the premiere of another
documentary, the 1997 "Little Dieter Needs to Fly," unavailable for
preview. In this film Herzog has persuaded German American pilot
Dieter Dengler to relive his escape from a Viet Cong prison through
the jungles of Laos. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agnes Incze's "I Love Budapest" is the second film in the Sunset
5's three-film "Women in Peril" weekend 10 a.m. series. It is a wry,
adroit account of a beautiful blond country girl, Aniko (Gabriella
Hamori), eagerly joining her friend Moni (Martina Kovacs) in
Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   Moni insists that all a pretty girl has to do is look alive and
men will throw money at her, allowing her to live a life of luxury.
For now, however, Aniko must be patient and join Moni in working a
grim, grinding factory job. Moni has taken up with Miki (Sandor
Csanyi), a slick wheeler-dealer and obvious crook, although she
insists on not knowing what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   The naive Aniko is immediately smitten with a tall, well-built but
oafish factory security guard, Krisztian (Tamas Lengyel), who's not
nearly as smart as he thinks he is. In short, the couple are way over
their heads in trying to keep pace on the fast track on which Miki
travels. (323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' Documentary Days series also continues at
the Sunset 5 Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. with German filmmaker Uli
Gaulke's "Havana Mi Amor," which is pleasant but not nearly as
revealing or incisive as other documentaries in the Cuban capital. It
screens at 11 a.m. Sept. 14 and 15 at the Monica 4-Plex, (310)
394-9741; Sept. 21 and 22 at the Playhouse 7, Pasadena, (626)
844-6500; and the Fallbrook 7, West Hills, (818) 340-8710.</TE>

<LD>* Wintertime (La Jolla Playhouse, La Jolla Village Drive and Torrey
Pines Road, La Jolla, [858] 550-1010). Three couples sneak away for a
secret rendezvous and unexpectedly collide at the same winter getaway
in the world premiere comedy by Charles L. Mee. Emily Donahoe and
Francois Giroday, above, take part in the antics. "A rip-roaring
comedy--complete with enormous tantrums, tacky underwear and bare
bums--that also becomes an intellectual high-wire act, thanks to its
brazen mixture of echoes from the classics, contemporary conversation
and a plot that goes bizarrely haywire" (Don Shirley). Tue.-Fri., 8

<LD>The ability to exhibit courage in the face of danger can earn you
kudos. But as two women tragically discovered in Mexico last year, it
can also get you killed.</LD>
<LD>   Not that knowing the level of risk involved likely would have
dissuaded the crusading attorneys from following their related but
independent courses of action. As we learn tonight in the "Wide
Angle" documentary "Cause for Murder" (KCET, 8 p.m), the two may have
come from vastly different backgrounds, but they shared a fierce
distaste for the human rights violations and political corruption
that have plagued Mexico for decades.</LD>
<LD>   Digna Ochoa was one of 13 children born into poverty in eastern
Mexico. Marigeli Tames was the only child of a middle-class couple
who had a keen interest in politics. Both women found their way to
law school and, upon graduation, sought to ferret out injustice
wherever they found it.</LD>
<TE>   And they found plenty. Although both women saw Vicente Fox's
election to the presidency in July 2000 as a hopeful sign, they were
soon to learn that El Cambio (the change), promised by Fox's PAN
party wouldn't come overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Fox appears in tonight's program to discuss the reforms that have
been implemented in his country, but unfortunately, Ochoa and Tames
aren't around to hear the message.</TE>

<HD>A Fantasy Getaway Right in Town</HD>
<DH>Travel dreams, cabin kitsch and shoe shopping--themed bars,
restaurants offer a little escapism.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In September, it's a lot easier to leave summer behind with a quick
fix of getaway fantasy. L.A.'s long-standing tradition of themed bars
and restaurants offers a variety of environments--where you can have
dinner in an RV without leaving town, hang out in a campy mountain
cabin and order a cocktail in a shoe store.</LD>
<LD>   For those fans of classic camping, there's the Airstream Diner.
Open since July, this creation of Los Feliz restaurateur Fred Eric
(Vida, Fred '62) is a 24-hour eatery housed in an oversized replica
of the renowned streamlined silver trailer. Parked at the corner of
Camden Drive and Little Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Eric
sees the restaurant as a casual oasis where locals tired of toting
Gucci bags can drop their cares and feel good about enjoying a
deep-fried doughnut--along with more "well traveled" dishes.</LD>
<LD>   The trailer look is carried indoors with foldaway travel bar,
rounded windows revealing staged scenes of mobile living and plastic
tables custom-made by the Airstream company in Jackson Center, Ohio.
A longtime admirer of the firm's tenacious sense of style, Eric is
himself an Airstream-owning fan of company founder and ideologue
Wally Byam, a natural vagabond who saw his creation as a vehicle for
helping people from diverse corners come together. The down-home
neighborhood feel of the diner is intended to create that same
connection.</LD>
<TE>   Across town, the Bigfoot Lodge, in Atwater Village, could pass for
one of those rustic stops where Airstream travelers might come to
swap tall tales. This woodsy retreat, in the "Sasquatch National
Forest," according to a sign, is filled with comic flourishes like a
full-size Smokey Bear and mechanical raccoon created by owner Bobby
Green and friends. Rockers, gay couples, industry types and college
students come here to gather around the hefty flagstone fireplace,
listen to live bands or eye the stuffed sloth masquerading as a baby
Bigfoot.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Airstream Diner, the Lodge's theming was inspired by
personal experience. Green, who grew up in Oklahoma, recalls how his
"family was always going to Indian reservations or pioneer towns
where they'd put on little shows. And every year we'd go to Colorado
or New Mexico skiing where we'd stay in log cabins that looked pretty
much like the one we built here." Though the themed interior took
roughly three months and $50,000 to assemble, Green thinks the cozy
novelty of the place has been key to drawing visitors off the beaten
track as well as keeping the crowd relaxed and social. "It's not like
someplace with four bare walls where you're always on your guard.
People feel they can come here to let loose."</TE>
<TE>   Roughly a year after the 1999 opening of Bigfoot Lodge, New York
nightclub entrepreneur Paul Devitt opened an L.A. version of his East
Village Beauty Bar, adding nearby a second fashion-themed bar, Star
Shoes, the following year. Larger than its New York prototype, L.A.'s
Beauty Bar is a knowingly froufrou environment where glam-rockers and
bridal parties together sip cocktails like the Prell and the Platinum
Blond.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Graham Northwood agrees with Green that fantasy decor
makes for a more lively clientele, remarking that he's occasionally
"seen people spinning each other around on the barber chairs like
they're in a theme park." Retro art from beauticians' manuals, and
displays of cosmetics also make for nice icebreakers, he says, and
the clear plastic domes of the Beauty Bar's 1960s hair dryers
sometimes serve as improvisational space helmets for male astronauts
eager to amuse female patrons. Those who take the theme more
literally can submit their nails to one of the Beauty Bar's
professional manicurists.</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner at Star Shoes, visitors can not only have their
shoes shined while sipping their Stolis but can shop from a large
array of never-worn vintage footwear. Part of the collection of
Joseph LaRose, designer for stars such as Joan Crawford and Betty
Grable, these shoes go for anywhere from $100 to $200. Mid-century
store fixtures, sandals in spotlighted vitrines and a bar with inlaid
marble stars like those on the Walk of Fame combine to evoke the
glamour of Tinseltown.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most expansive newcomer to the themed eatery business
is Larry Pollack's Saddle Ranch Chop House on the Sunset Strip. A
false-front Knott's Berry Farm-style exterior houses this rowdy
steak-and-suds hangout enlivened by strolling fiddlers, gas
"campfires" for self-serve s'mores and a mechanical bull for urban
cowboys with something to prove.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Pollack opened another themed Sunset Boulevard restaurant,
Rome, where diners munch gnocchi under a reproduction of the Sistine
Chapel ceiling, and he recently opened a second Saddle Ranch, at
Universal CityWalk, that's nearly four times as large as the
original.</TE>
<TE>   The Bigfoot Lodge also recently opened a second location, in San
Francisco, but Green doesn't have the same aspirations toward a
themed empire a la House of Blues. "It has to be mom and pop," Green
says. "If it's slick and corporate, no matter how crazy the theme,
it's just hard to care. You completely lose the whole campiness of
it."</TE>
<TE>   For Green, whose Lodge is occasionally visited by a costumed
Sasquatch, humor is an ingredient in the formula. He and partner Al
Newberry, he says, began their first venture--Cacao, a themed
Westside coffeehouse--"as a joke." The cafe, now owned by loyal
customer Jeremy Bell, is a kitschy outer-space-Polynesian hybrid. "It
was only after we opened, we discovered a huge tiki underground,"
Green says. "We had no idea there could possibly be anybody into this
like the two of us."</TE>
<TE>   During this early '90s revival of interest in lounge culture and
its take on Polynesia, Green met fellow devotee Lee Joseph (now a
Bigfoot DJ) and other tikiphiles flocking to tiki happenings and
faux-tropical landmarks like Rosemead's colossal Bahooka or Silver
Lake's boisterous family-run Tiki-Ti.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time Cacao opened, another artist opened a rather
different space-themed hangout in the Fairfax area. Cary Long's Nova
Express Cafe takes its name and subcultural orientation from the
novel by William Burroughs. Decked out with glowing amoeboid tables,
intimate black-light vortices and a sculpted astral ogre with gaping
floor-to-ceiling jaws, Long's "walk-in sculpture that sells pizza"
was created largely from scrap materials. It represents, for him, the
tangible outcome of his study of art and philosophy at Berkeley as
well as three years in a Buddhist monastery. "I believe artists
should try to integrate themselves into society, and this was one way
I could show how that could be done," he explains. The community of
regulars who begin filling the place at 11 p.m. seems to validate his
notion (shared by proprietors of Beauty Bar, Saddle Ranch Chop House
and Bigfoot Lodge) that a stimulating environment helps people
interact.</TE>
<TE>   But don't call this inter-dimensional environment escapist.
"Around the time I opened this place," Long explains, "everyone was
talking about virtual online communities. To me that's escapist. This
place is different. It's about getting out of your house and actually
connecting with people." Airstream's Wally Byam would certainly
approve.</TE>

<LD>The steadily building drumbeat for "American Idol" continues, with
record ratings for the show last week and higher tune-in for the
penultimate episode on Tuesday, based on viewing estimates issued
Wednesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, Fox's prime-time viewing this summer is up 7% compared
with last year, an improvement almost entirely attributable to the
twice-a-week talent contest. In fact, Fox's next most-watched program
last week attracted half the audience "Idol" did, and the network
still finished fourth in overall viewing.</LD>
<LD>   CBS ranked first by that measure, despite a dismal performance
with an original movie, "The Biographer," which told Princess Diana's
story from the perspective of biographer Andrew Morton.</LD>
<TE>   ABC's experiment with running the USA cable series "Monk,"
meanwhile, has paid dividends, as the show has held its own despite
competing with "American Idol" on Tuesdays, adding viewers until this
week's telecast. Preseason "Monday Night Football" coverage has also
ticked upward by 6% versus last summer--a trend that may be as
attributable to more competitive games and the arrival of commentator
John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   The major networks took a collective hit Thursday from MTV's
"Video Music Awards," which averaged nearly 12 million viewers.</TE>

<LD>Within a few weeks, the networks will be unveiling their new fall TV
series as well as new episodes of returning favorites. The home
entertainment world, though, has already kicked off its season of
vintage and cult TV series on video and DVD.</LD>
<LD>   As NBC's top-rated comedy series "Friends" heads into its ninth
and supposedly final season, Warner Home Video is releasing the
complete second season of the sitcom ($50 for VHS; $70 on DVD) about
the lives and loves of buddies Rachel, Joey, Monica, Ross, Chandler
and Phoebe.</LD>
<LD>   The four-disc digital edition set includes fact-filled commentary
from executive producers Kevin S. Bright, David Crane and Marta
Kauffman on two classic episodes from that season ("The One With the
List" and "The One With the Prom Video"); a look at Rachel and
Monica's apartment with interviews with designers and costumers; a
trivia quiz; and clips highlighting each character.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The great Leo McKern, who died July 23, is best known for his role
as the colorful British lawyer Horace Rumpole in John Mortimer's
acclaimed series "Rumpole of the Bailey," which aired stateside on
PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre." HBO Home Video recently released a
four-disc set of the first two seasons ($70) of the literate, witty
and sophisticated series. The set also includes a Q&amp;A about the
British legal system, production notes and a filmography of McKern
and Mortimer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing wrong with your DVD player. Do not attempt to
adjust the picture. We are controlling the transmission. If we wish
to make it louder, we will bring up the volume.... For the next 27
hours, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You
are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the
inner mind to  ... "The Outer Limits."</TE>
<TE>   MGM is releasing on DVD ($80) all 32 episodes from the first
season--1963-64--of the sci-fi anthology that aired on ABC. Among the
classic episodes featured on the discs are "The Galaxy Being,"
starring Cliff Robertson as the owner of a radio station who contacts
a being from outer space; "The Architects of Fear," with Robert Culp
as a man who undergoes surgery to turn him into an alien creature,
and "The Zanti Misfits," about a group of ant-like creatures with
human faces who are sent to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Broadway Theater Archives, the New York-based company that is
restoring and releasing vintage plays produced for television, has
unveiled several new shows on DVD (Kultur, $25 each):</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Chamberlain, Marsha Mason, Edward Asner, Bob Dishy and
Lee Grant star in the 1978 PBS adaptation of Neil Simon's "The Good
Doctor," based on both comedic and serious short stories of Anton
Chekhov.</TE>
<TE>   * James Daly, Kate Reid and Philip Bosco star in a stirring
rendition of Henrik Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" that was
telecast on PBS in 1966. Daly plays an earnest doctor who discovers
that the healing springs located in his small Norwegian town are
polluted.</TE>
<TE>   * Other titles new on DVD include "The Secret Service" (1977),
starring Meryl Streep and John Lithgow; "Eccentricities of a
Nightingale" (1976), starring Blythe Danner; and "The Rimers of
Eldrich" (1974), with Susan Sarandon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the lackluster new "Mickey's House of Villains" (Disney, $22
for VHS; $30 for DVD), such famous Disney animated movie villains as
Jafar, Cruella, Hades, Ursula, Captain Hook and Maleficent try to
take over Mickey Mouse's nightclub, the House of Mouse, and turn it
into the House of Villains. The DVD extras include a collection of
sound effects, the "Escape the House of Villains Adventure Game" and
a villains' gallery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar Home Video celebrates the 25th anniversary of the
syndicated series "The Muppet Show" with the two volumes of "Best of
the Muppet Show" ($25) on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Each disc contains three episodes of the Jim Henson musical
variety series, including installments with Mark Hamill, Paul Simon
and Raquel Welch (the latter gets into a bit of a cat fight with Miss
Piggy).</TE>
<TE>   Each installment includes an introduction from Brian Henson, Jim
Henson's son; very funny screen tests of various Muppet characters
auditioning for the role of Yoda; and a funny glimpse into the world
of the ultimate diva, Miss Piggy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Art" is making the rounds. Yasmina Reza's fun and feisty polemical
play, which won a 1996 Tony in its English translation (by
Christopher Hampton) and other awards in Europe in its original
French, was presented by Santa Barbara's Ensemble Theatre last season
and is on the upcoming Rubicon Theatre roster. Through this weekend,
catch the Santa Paula Theater Center production, in which an
all-female cast (as opposed to the usual male cast) has great fun
with its coursing river of language and ideas.</LD>
<LD>   In the Santa Paula version, we're witness to a few white chicks
sittin' around, talkin' about contemporary art. Of course, subtext is
important here, and the play emphasizes the relative fragility of
social relations and the subjectivity of cultural experience. The
often catty banter between three friends only partly revolves around
opinions of a certain painting, a white-on-white canvas for which
Sasha (Leslie Nichols) has paid 200,000 francs.</LD>
<LD>   Broadly speaking, the balance of personalities has Sasha as the
cool, sometimes haughty art aficionado, intolerant of aesthetic
intolerance. Her friend Marc (Lorraine MacDonald) is the rational
one, channeling skepticism about contemporary art into sniping
sarcasm and a scatological one-word review of the painting.</LD>
<TE>   The quirkily ambivalent Yvonne (Kim Little) mediates the bickering
friends, trying to make peace but also joining in backbiting. Little
digs into her role and has some scene-stealing moments, including a
whirlwind, breathless account of a wedding invitation psychodrama and
a later emotional outburst. The crowd reflexively applauds, and Sasha
blandly admonishes her, "could we steer clear of pathos?"</TE>
<TE>   The engaging cast is directed with a spare effectiveness by
directors Gerald Castillo and Linda Livingston. Economical lighting
enlivens the single set, and the canvas in question is moved about as
an integral prop.</TE>
<TE>   But the real point of focus is language, flung about like paint in
a Pollock action painting, and with a similar resistance to easy
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   * "Art," through Sunday at the Santa Paula Theater Center, 125 S.
7th St., Santa Paula. Performances are Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.
and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults, $12 for seniors
and students, and $10 for children 10 and younger; (805) 525-4645.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Structural Sights: Tucked up just off Main on Fir Street in
Ventura, the John Nichols Gallery/Live Oak Gallery is a pleasant
weekend gallery space with a view--and dual intentions. The current
two-fer exhibition is a good example.</TE>
<TE>   Up front is the intriguing photography show "Shooting Buildings,"
with imagery of architecture and structures. Some of the best images
are "found" snapshots, culled from Nichols' collection.</TE>
<TE>   In the back of the gallery, watercolorist Susan Stoutz heeds an
approach in which prettiness and the celebration of idyllic
landscapes rule. She has a soothing, seeping style, in which details
merge with vaporous washes of color to create a sense of place, in
paintings such as "Las Posas Valley" and "Montana Homestead."</TE>
<TE>   Stark contrast separates her romantic lean from the unexpected
scruffy charm of a snapshot like "Smiling Man and Tent." In it, a
long-haired, suit-donning hobo stands before his makeshift tent,
exuding humble bohemian splendor.</TE>
<TE>   A different, desolate splendor hovers over the tiny snapshot
called "Western Town," perhaps the finest photo in the house.</TE>
<TE>   Another highlight is the deceptively casual "Man at Door," from
the Hedrick-Blessing Studio. Mystery becomes this shot of a man
entering a sunbaked Chicago building. The darkness of his attire and
angular shadow on a light building facade help to pique curiosity
about intrigue that is probably not there and also helps it work on
visual intrigue alone.</TE>
<TE>   * "Shooting Buildings" and "From the Mountains to the Sea,"
through Sunday at Live Oak Gallery, 40 N. Fir St., Ventura. Saturday
and Sunday, 1-5 p.m.; (805) 643-2583.</TE>

<HD>Caring for Our Kids Should Be the Bottom Line</HD>
<DH>It's a disgrace that children suffer most under tThis
selfish, wrongheaded state budget. is a shame and a disgrace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT C. FELLMETH</AU>
<BD>Robert C. Fellmeth is a professor of public interest
law at the University of San Diego Law School and director of the
Children's Advocacy Institute, which publishes the annual California
Children's Budget.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long labor now done, the California Legislature has given birth
to a monster that will eat away our public investment in children,
child programs and education for decades to come.</LD>
<LD>   It will leave many poor children, who don't have the Social
Security safety net of the elderly, bereft. And it raises profound
questions about our commitment to the children who are our common
legacy.</LD>
<LD>   How might these cuts have been avoided, given our state budget
deficit?</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps our big-time campaign-donor prison guards should not be
able to retire at age 50 with as much as 90% of their top pay for
life. Perhaps the $5.7 billion in state tax deductions and credits
for business and the elderly enacted since 1999 should be reexamined.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, California's lawmakers have cut public investment in
children more than the members of any other Legislature in the nation
since the Great Depression--not the $7 billion that Gov. Gray Davis
has contended but more than $13 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts are everywhere: job investment in impoverished parents
facing an imminent loss of the federal safety net; basic K-12
education investment (once again, California is about to slip to last
place in the nation in class size); investment in higher education
(slots for youth needing post-high school training will decrease in
relation to population).</TE>
<TE>   The 100,000 foster children--kids so abused that the state has
removed them and taken parental jurisdiction--will continue to suffer
neglect, substantially being abandoned at the age of 18, despite the
$350 million solemnly promised to them by the Assembly Democratic
caucus at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   That is only the start. Virtually every penny of new federal money
going to California for children is being diverted to general fund
relief. Federal dollars will not supplement state efforts but
supplant them.</TE>
<TE>   The Healthy Families program has signed up some new children for
medical coverage, but hundreds of millions in federal money will be
returned to Washington for distribution to other states because
California cannot come up with its 33% match. These cuts will occur
along with a 6% gain in personal income projected for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If we adults paid the same percentage of our income in public
investment in children as our parents did in 1979, we would be
investing $15 billion more than the sum provided in the current state
budget. Yet in the eyes of lawmakers, all that matters is that we
have avoided a tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   Our values and biases are revealed not so much by what we say as
by what we choose to talk about. Tax levels are on the media-public
policy table. But tax spending is not. Children are not, unless one
happens to be abducted. Yet abductions actually are down markedly,
while massive negative trends in youth employment, teacher quality,
classroom size, child health coverage and child hunger get no media
coverage. And if we do discuss them, it is rarely in relation to
public investment.</TE>
<TE>   News anchor and writer Tom Brokaw calls those who matured during
the Depression and World War II "the Greatest Generation" for their
courage and generosity. Yet their remarkable sacrifice was not that
atypical.</TE>
<TE>   The United States long has stood for investment in its children
above all else, from the communities in the pioneer West selling
crops to build schoolhouses to immigrant families committing their
savings so children could go to college or own homes.</TE>
<TE>   It is the current group of baby boomers--self-indulgent and
shameless takers--who are the anomalous generation.</TE>

<HD>Beware the Congressional Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Hearings put their targets in peril. Look out, Martha.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT A. MINTZ</AU>
<BD>Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor, is a
lawyer in Newark, N.J.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The subpoena that Martha Stewart may soon receive to testify before
the House Energy and Commerce Committee about alleged insider trading
presents a classic double bind: No matter how she responds, she
loses.</LD>
<LD>   If Stewart answers questions in an effort to clear her name, her
statements can be used against her in the federal criminal
investigation in New York. If she asserts her privilege against
self-incrimination and "takes the 5th,'' she will only further damage
an already wilting reputation.</LD>
<LD>   While Stewart would be the most recognizable chief executive to
testify before Congress in recent months, her predicament is not
unusual, nor is it fair. Hearings follow a familiar headline-grabbing
recipe: Demand documents, trickle out the most damaging tidbits, then
subpoena executives to be grilled before a skeptical committee and,
depending on the witnesses' responsiveness, cause them to lose either
a legal or a PR battle.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional inquiries that parallel criminal investigations
illustrate--painfully for the accused--the vast difference of purpose
between the institutions. One system enforces laws while protecting
individual rights, the other creates laws while protecting the
public's rights. This tension between individual rights and public
policy often becomes the heart of the inquiry: Was the alleged fraud
a result of the willful misconduct of a few rogue corporate
executives attempting to circumvent a fundamentally sound regulatory
scheme or did the system itself fail?</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of such hearings point to Congress' ability to move
more swiftly and publicly than the Department of Justice or the
Securities and Exchange Commission. But the emphasis on media
attention and public humiliation creates a circus-like atmosphere
that threatens to trample individual rights and promotes a
rush-to-judgment mentality that fails to achieve the ultimate goal:
getting to the truth.</TE>
<TE>   As would certainly be the case with Stewart, while Congress did
its work in public, the Justice Department would simultaneously
conduct its investigation in private. Interviews with potential
cooperating witnesses and grand jury subpoenas for documents and
testimony are tools that are routinely used by prosecutors to develop
facts and ultimately build a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department inquiries, unlike the congressional
hearings, are governed by rules of grand jury secrecy--the
prosecutors and the grand jurors are barred from disclosing what
occurs before the grand jury during the investigation. The rationale
for this is simple: It would be unfair to disclose the
investigation's findings because the individuals involved have had no
opportunity to defend against the allegations. The federal criminal
justice system allows prosecutors maximum power and freedom to
investigate allegations of criminality while at the same time
protecting the civil liberties of those who have yet to be--and may
never be--formally charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the congressional inquiry is public by design.
Witnesses have the choice of either publicly invoking their 5th
Amendment rights against self-incrimination--and thereby drawing the
very type of adverse inference against which the Constitution
protects them in the criminal context--or submitting to testimony
that can be later used against them in a criminal proceeding.
Moreover, unlike a trial setting, those who are subpoenaed before
Congress have no right to call their own witnesses, to introduce
evidence or to cross-examine the testimony of others.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has broad discretion to conduct fact-finding inquiries in
order to ensure that the laws are fully and fairly enforced. But
these hearings should not become quasi-criminal proceedings in which
allegations of illegality are tossed around as sound bites.</TE>
<TE>   If, as expected, Stewart becomes the latest in the list of
corporate chieftains to appear before Congress, she deserves hearings
aimed at influencing policy, not building a criminal case. Leave that
inquiry to the prosecutors.</TE>

<HD>Economic Collision in the Wake of Apartheid</HD>
<DH>Small-scale capitalism is the next big step in the
evolution of South Africa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL>SOWETO, South Africa</DL>
<LD>This region is the cradle of the anti-apartheid revolution that
transformed South Africa from white minority rule to black majority
rule. Now that black political participation is secure, next on the
national agenda is black economic empowerment.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the way forward is much debated as old ideologies contend with
new practical realities. And so the battle is joined: lingering
quasi-Marxism versus rising small-scale capitalism.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson Mandela lived in Soweto as a young man. Arrested in 1963 by
the white-supremacist government for his political activism, he was
imprisoned for three decades before becoming the country's first
black president, in 1994. Today, his erstwhile residence is a
national shrine, while he lives in a mansion in a once-white suburb
near the site of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</LD>
<TE>   That summit met for nearly two weeks, issuing vague
recommendations on such issues as global warming and renewable
energy. But long after the delegates have departed, the economic
future of this country will depend on what happens in places such as
the Baragwanath taxi park.</TE>
<TE>   A taxi in South Africa is not a luxury but rather a necessity,
filling in for a government that can't afford mass transit and the
people's inability to afford autos.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the intricate system that has emerged is a leading indicator
of black upward mobility. Individual entrepreneurs park their
minivans by destination; then they negotiate the route to be taken
with as many paying passengers as possible. Meanwhile, hawkers crowd
hundreds of nearby stalls, selling everything from candy to shoes to
chickens.</TE>
<TE>   No government agency runs these operations. Instead, Baragwanath
is an example of what the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek
termed "the spontaneous order of the marketplace." I buy a T-shirt
that reads, "Soweto. Know It. Feel It. Do It."</TE>
<TE>   This is small business in action. This is sustainable development.
This is the hope for a new South Africa. To be sure, the ghosts of
the past still haunt. I look up and see an artificial yellow
mountain, known simply as "the waste dump." That's the slag heap
thrown up from the mines along the Witwatersrand, the gold "reef"
discovered in 1886.</TE>
<TE>   The mines made South Africa rich, although with repressive regimes
in power most of that wealth went to just a few people. In addition
to the economic effect, the mines had a political effect, convincing
much of the black political class that Marxist analysis--rich versus
poor--was correct. And so the black government mostly ignored the
interests of the taxi drivers and hawkers of Baragwanath as it
pursued its anti-capitalist agenda.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the national government has moved toward new rules
intended to guarantee blacks between 30% and 51% of mine ownership.
To left-wing activists, it was simple justice, long overdue. But to
investors, it was simply a sign that the South African business
climate was about to take a turn for the worse.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the currency, the rand, fell by half, and prices on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange fell sharply.</TE>
<TE>   The local magazine Finance Week reports that whereas in 2001
foreign investment totaled $3 billion, this year, in the wake of the
government's proposed policies, foreigners have disinvested $350
million. Fearing a recession, the government has backpedaled, and
both the money and the market have regained some of the lost ground.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that the mines are mostly played out. Today, South
Africa accounts for just 16% of world gold production.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the yellow metal is no longer as precious as it once
was; the international economy now favors added-value manufactured
products, not mere mined commodities.</TE>
<TE>   So just as South Africa had to shift from an unsustainable system
of political oppression, so too it will have to shift from an
unsustainable system of resource extraction.</TE>
<TE>   The hope for this country is an entrepreneurial mercantile class,
such as the people at Baragwanath. They might not be following
economic policymaking in detail, but as they work their way up they
should at least expect government policymakers to liberate themselves
from the dead ideologies of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Only then will South Africa find its own path to sustainable
development.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer in New York City. Web site:

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its inception in the mid-1970s, the animal rights movement
seems to have succeeded, more than any of us might have expected, in
changing the way we view animals.</LD>
<LD>   The latest indications of this change made news earlier this
summer when animal rights activists lobbied the Los Angeles City
Council to replace the term pet "owner" with pet "guardian" in local
codes. Because language shapes thought and vice versa, this kind of
semantic activism is certainly a way to temper human "speciesism."
But does it really mean we are starting to see animals as more than
brutes, or is it just a token gesture to make us feel better?</LD>
<LD>   Evidence abounds, after all, that we are treating our pets
differently than we did 25 years ago, a phenomenon that has not
escaped the notice of hawkish marketing teams at pet superstores.
Petsmart, for example, is a behemoth chain that operates more than
560 outlets across the United States and Canada. Despite the strains
that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks put on businesses, the company
made a profit this year. Its strategy for market dominance, according
to its investor relations Web site, is "to target the 'pet
enthusiast' [who is] ... passionately committed to his/her pet(s),
values services and premium products, is brand loyal and insensitive
to price."</LD>
<TE>   According to the American Animal Hospital Assn., 37% of pet owners
talk to their pets on the phone or leave messages on their answering
machines meant for the pets to hear in their absence, and 75% of pet
owners say they would go into debt to keep their pets healthy--one
reason why pet insurance is more popular than ever.</TE>
<TE>   But all of this increased coddling of and spending on pets haven't
translated into a significant shift in our attitudes toward animals
in general. Perhaps the most telling indication of this is the fact
that, according to the Vegetarian Resource Group, the number of
vegetarians in this country has remained stable at a minuscule 1%
since the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   While more people are eating tofu dogs and veggie burgers
(increasingly available in mainstream supermarkets), the driving
force behind this trend seems to be a desire for healthy menu
alternatives, not a conscientious renunciation of meat.</TE>
<TE>   So how do we square this blithe acceptance of animal slaughter for
profit with the sometimes extreme lengths to which more and more of
us will gladly go to ensure not just the physical but the emotional
well-being of our pets? We don't, and that may be exactly why we're
all such neurotic "pet enthusiasts."</TE>
<TE>   We aren't oblivious to the compelling argument that animal rights
guru Peter Singer made in his 1975 book "Animal Liberation": "If
possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human
to use another for his own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit
nonhumans?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet we're still eating meat, buying leather and going to the
circus and the zoo. It's just that now we're feeling guilty about it,
which is probably why we're all obsessively watching the pet psychic
on the Animal Planet channel.</TE>
<TE>   As a devotee of the Atkins diet and a doting mommy of three cats,
I am, to be sure, one of the worst offenders--which is why I applaud
efforts to rename us "guardians" of our pets. They make me feel
better while I'm trying to find the conviction and discipline to
start eating green.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't make me any less of a hypocrite.</TE>

<LD>If the 1996 tragedy on Mt. Everest was not enough to scare off other
would-be Everesters, then you'd think reading the appalling and
spellbinding details in Jon Krakauer's bestseller "Into Thin Air"
certainly would.</LD>
<LD>   Members of two American teams led by paid guides jammed the route
up the southeast side of the mountain in Nepal. Eight clients and
guides were trapped by a storm at various points above 27,000 feet
and died. That others survived and got back to their tents was
considered virtually miraculous.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the tale seems to have been more attractive
publicity than deterrent. On May 16, a record number of climbers for
one day, 61, reached the 29,035-foot summit of the world during a
brief window of fair weather. In all, 250 people populated base camp
at the foot of the southeast ridge of Everest this year. Ninety-one
reached the summit and only two died, considerably better than the
historical death rate.</LD>
<TE>   But Nepal's Ministry of Tourism is expecting even greater numbers
next spring to mark the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of
Everest, by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Elizabeth Hawley,
who has chronicled Himalayan climbs for 40 years, told Outside
magazine: "Everest next year: Do not show up. No parking space."</TE>
<TE>   The hordes of climbers not only create unsafe conditions at
bottlenecks high on the mountain, such as the famous Hillary Step,
they also degrade the environment around base camp and contribute to
a massive trash problem. Also on the mountain are many dead climbers
whose bodies cannot be recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and 1960s, Nepal allowed only one or two Everest
expeditions each year. But over time, more climbers had the money and
time required to attempt Everest, and the Nepalese government
realized it could collect considerable hard currency by charging up
to $60,000 for an expedition permit. Inexperienced climbers plunked
down as much as $65,000 each for a spot on a commercially guided
team. Climbing Everest has become the ultimate adventure trek.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants Nepal to give tests to determine who should be
allowed to attempt Everest. But the Nepalis should be more diligent
in determining what the environment can bear and put a reasonable
limit on masses flocking to the famous but abused mountain they call
Sagarmatha--"head of the sky."</TE>

<HD>Wait-and-See in Guatemala</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, when Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo
announced he would drastically cut that country's armed forces, few
Guatemalans cheered him. He also announced he would turn certain
military installations into school classrooms, and the reaction of
the people, even in a nation as desperately short of educational
opportunity as Guatemala, was restrained when not openly skeptical.
"I'll believe it when I see it," said a chief human rights activist.</LD>
<LD>   Guatemalans don't trust their military, and they won't trust
Portillo until he proves to them he will really change that secretive
and feared institution. During Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which
ended in 1996, more than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, died or
disappeared. The military slaughtered Maya Indians, who without
evidence were considered sympathetic to the rebels. Human rights
violations--rapes, illegal detentions, torture--by the army and its
paramilitary allies were widespread and did not quite end with the
war. Whole villages were burned to the ground.</LD>
<LD>   There is a consensus in Guatemala that radical cuts in the size of
the army are necessary, not just because of its history but because
the guerrilla wars across Central America have fully ended.</LD>
<TE>   The first task is determining the size of the army, which
officials put at 40,000, a disputed figure. By comparison,
neighboring Honduras has an army of only 18,000.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemala's Roman Catholic archdiocese, a chief defender of human
rights, called Portillo's announcement economically sensible and
morally necessary, given the terrible record of the armed forces. But
it stopped short of outright endorsement, demanding investigation of
atrocities during the civil war and prosecution of those responsible
for human rights violations. Other organizations took issue with the
government's plan to lay off 6,000 soldiers but no officers. Officers
draw the largest salaries, and they are the ones more often accused
of human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Portillo should make the best of the occasion, throwing some
needed light on an institution that has never been accountable to
society. He should spell out the army's true numbers and announce
that cuts will affect officers and troops alike. He should also
promise further cuts, perhaps following the example of Costa Rica, a
sister Central American state, which replaced its army with a smaller
and less powerful civil guard in the late 1940s, boosting economic
prosperity and confidence in government. Guatemala is desperately
short on both. Portillo should heed his skeptical citizens and prove
he can carry out his vow.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The widely varying assessments of the global summit that ended
Wednesday in Johannesburg, South Africa, testify to the breadth of
expectations that advocates and governments held going in.
Environmental organizations, which were the most disappointed, wanted
the leaders of 100 nations and thousands of delegates to come up with
detailed plans and targets for ending poverty and protecting the
global environment. That was not realistic, and declaring the meeting
a failure dismisses its gains.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. delegates pronounced themselves well satisfied with the
result. The Bush administration, even minus the presence of President
Bush, was the most powerful single entity at what officially was
known as the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</LD>
<LD>   Though Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was booed Wednesday and
Washington was criticized for blocking firm targets on increasing the
use of renewable energy, the United States got its way. Delegates
agreed only to an "urgent and substantial" increase in the use of
renewable sources of power such as solar and wind.</LD>
<TE>   Some smaller promises were more specific. Powell said Wednesday
that 6,000 children died from water-related illnesses every day,
underlining the need to improve one of the essentials of life. He
announced a $970-million joint program with Japan to improve water
quality and sanitation in developing countries, and the summit did
set a target date, 2015, to cut by half the number of people without
access to safe drinking water, some 1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates also agreed that by 2015 the world's fishing stocks
would be restored. Ending overfishing through better management of
regional fisheries and stopping illegal catches could provide a
steady source of food for hundreds of millions of people.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering was a sequel to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of
1992, which sharpened the world's focus on environmental issues but
set goals that were not met. The Johannesburg meeting was designed to
push the problems identified at Rio closer to a solution.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations did note progress in the last decade. More than
800 million people in developing countries gained improved drinking
water, and more than 700 million got access to sanitation facilities.
The U.N. also noted failures, especially the increasing consumption
of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other nations must make good on their
promises. That means sending money, of course--but also ensuring that
programs work as planned by inspecting them as they are developed,
keeping records of how many wells are dug and how many people are
inoculated against diseases. The Bush administration has stressed
providing aid only to governments that are not corrupt, another
promise to be kept.</TE>
<TE>   It will do no good to hold another meeting in 10 years to lament
darker skies, dirtier water and more people living deeply in poverty.</TE>

<LD>Re "Witness Mistakes Costly for Accused," Sept. 2: The wrongful
incarceration of Louie Gomez illustrates a more fundamental problem
with our criminal justice system than the unreliability of eyewitness
identification: We have a system of "criminal justice on the cheap."
At the same time as the LAPD is attempting to hire a thousand
additional police officers, the L.A. County district attorney's
office has a hiring freeze. Who will prosecute the offenders arrested
by those additional police officers?</LD>
<LD>   As your article demonstrated, dedicated but overworked prosecutors
simply lack the time to do a thorough investigation of every case. In
addition, prosecutors are severely underpaid. A head deputy district
attorney with 20 years of experience makes less money than a
first-year attorney at a major Los Angeles law firm. Unfortunately,
part of the price tag for an inadequately funded criminal justice
system is the occasional incarceration of the innocent.</LD>
<LD>   Arnie Bell</LD>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since Gomez was exonerated, why aren't his former employers giving
him his jobs back? Why doesn't his accuser have some responsibility
for putting him in such jeopardy? The police could have saved Gomez a
lot of grief. The deputy district attorney should not be excused
because she could not sit down with witnesses due to her heavy
caseload. This is certainly an example of justice delayed and should
not have happened.</TE>

<LD>I find it interesting that the state is having a tough time making
ends meet and at the same time is spending money building freeway
sound walls along the south end of the Harbor Freeway. The only
benefit appears to be to the taggers, who have been given a new clean
space on which to spray paint.</LD>

<LD>While the anti-Semitic garbage spewing from the Arabic world is
disheartening (Aug. 31), it's worth noting that these sentiments
spring from nations whose people live under dictatorships, which
foster such hatreds to distract from their own abuses. Such tactics
are hardly new; anti-Semitism flourished in czarist and Stalinist
Russia and, of course, in Nazi Germany for the same reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The answer is democracy, and the U.S. alone is powerful enough to
foster democracy in the region. But as long as our government speaks
democracy while cozying up to dictators, as long as it preaches
freedom but props up corrupt regimes like those in Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as long as its leaders value
access to cheap Arab oil more than the basic human rights of the
Arabic people--so long will we endure such mindless vilification of
innocent people and the terrorism and death that go with it.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a soon-to-return-to-the-classroom teacher, I read the Sept. 1
commentary by Abraham Cooper and Harold Brackman on educating
children about Sept. 11 anticipating some advice that I could use.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, I found a list of simplistic slogans and
self-contradictory advice verging on the incoherent. One example
should suffice: "Why not," ask the authors, "begin teaching
patriotism and our obligation to defend the nation from enemies,
foreign and domestic, in the elementary grades?" Now that would be
quite an undertaking! Who, exactly, are these "enemies, foreign and
domestic"? Will Cooper and Brackman issue a list or should we
teachers rely on the Bush administration? Might that list include the
government in Baghdad or the sneaky guy who just moved in down the
street? Will evidence be necessary or just intuition?</LD>
<LD>   Here is my problem more specifically described. Since, as a
card-carrying member of the ACLU, I am absolutely committed to
equality and democracy, couldn't I make a decent case that the
category of "domestic enemies" might include the current attorney
general, John Ashcroft, and, perhaps, even the current president?
After all, within the last year they have arrogantly diminished our
due process protections and proudly defended new laws allowing
federal officials to spy on Americans without evidence.</LD>
<TE>   Is that what Cooper and Brackman meant? Or am I just old-fashioned
in my commitment to the Bill of Rights?</TE>

<TE>   Regarding your special section, "The Plot," Sept. 1: I must praise
The Times for the informative article by Terry McDermott. It was well
written, and the facts, as presented, give a frightening account of
the origins of the past disturbing year for Americans. Articles of
this nature should be discussed in high school classrooms so that our
future leaders will understand the gravity of this present danger.</TE>

<HD>Access to Art Collection Paints a Strange Picture</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, when friends and I were in Philadelphia for the
Cezanne show, we went to the Barnes Foundation to see its collection
("Great Art Framed by Turmoil," Sept. 3). We took the train out to
Merion and walked the few blocks past the stately mansions (and the
Episcopal boys school that an old friend had attended). We didn't add
to the vehicle traffic, but when you see the area you can understand
why they would not necessarily want a commercial enterprise in the
middle of it, along with the traffic it brings.</LD>
<LD>   The problems all go back to the eccentric Dr. Albert C. Barnes. It
is a pity he had such a narrow vision for what to do with his vast
collection of masterpieces (although his 181 Renoirs are 180 more
than anyone really needs). While I am in total agreement with the
Barnes mission in society, it is a shame it is so narrowly dictated
today by a man long gone, with each side being a little too
antagonistic toward the other.</LD>
<LD>   This is a collection that deserves to be enjoyed. I saw paintings
that I had never even seen pictures of in art school because of the
foundation's restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   It is a shame it can't all be moved to a place where everyone
could have access.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having been fortunate to have visited the Barnes Foundation three
times, I can say that other museums I have been to, such as the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris, pale in comparison. The City of Brotherly Love
should unite--not fight--to enable this magnificent art collection to
be shown to the public. We had to park four blocks away to gain
admission.</TE>
<TE>   Its selfish neighbors should be working on ways toward helping,
not hurting, the foundation. The courts should be working on ways to
permit more cash flow; i.e., authorize more travel shows, sell off a
few paintings not on display. I'm sure Barnes would have done this if
he could have been as farsighted in this area as he was in selecting
this outstanding collection.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since I've given to Democrats in the past, in this election season I
get many, many solicitations from the Democratic Party for money.
They talk about the need to support Social Security, less-expensive
medicine for seniors (like me) and protection for the environment.
But what good are Social Security and cheaper medicine and a clean
environment if we live in a police state without civil rights, where
corporations have usurped our democratic processes and where the
government is bent on starting unprovoked and self-destructive wars?
I send the envelopes back without a contribution, but with this
message.</LD>
<LD>   I hope the point gets through to those in power and is not just
thrown in the wastebasket when they see there is no check inside.
They may be discarding something they need now more than money.</LD>

<LD>Jacob Heilbrunn's article ("The Reaganites Strike Back," Opinion,
Sept. 1) turned on a few simple points: The two poles of Republican
foreign policy are "neoconservativism" and "realism."
Neoconservatives have a crusading, confrontational mentality and are,
generally, bad. Realists are pragmatic people who are not interested
in getting into fights all over the world. They are good.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps Heilbrunn can weigh in on what seems to be the question of
the day: With the existence of portable weapons of mass destruction,
and with devices and delivery systems increasingly available to
groups and regimes hostile to the U.S., is the "realism" or "America
First" approach possible? Is it intellectually coherent? Put
differently, hasn't the evolution of weapons technology placed the
entire world in our hemisphere, within our immediate sphere of
defense and influence? This, I believe, is the neoconservatives'
point.</LD>

their salvation and the security of the world, President Bush should
go ahead with the war, but the main goal should be the removal of all
tyrants of the Middle East: presidents such as Saddam Hussein, Hosni
Mubarak, Moammar Kadafi and royal families such as Al Saud and Al
Hussein, who are responsible for the creation of extremism and
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Until democracy spreads over the Middle East, hundreds or

<HD>Frankie Albert, 82; 1st T-Formation Quarterback</HD>

<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frankie Albert, the first T-formation quarterback in modern football
history, died Wednesday of complications from Alzheimer's disease in
a Palo Alto nursing home. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Albert, a little left-handed passer with sleight-of-hand
deception, was the heart of Stanford's undefeated 1940 team that
climaxed its season with a 21-13 win over Nebraska in the 1941 Rose
Bowl game. Against the Cornhuskers, he threw a 40-yard touchdown pass
to Hugh Gallarneau, blocked two defenders on a 39-yard punt return
for a touchdown by Pete Kmetovic, got off an 85-yard quick kick and
kicked three extra points.</LD>
<LD>   "Go tell that [Stanford Coach] Clark Shaughnessy I'll buy him 120
acres of fine corn if he'll tell me where we can get a Frankie
Albert," Nebraska Coach Biff Jones said after the game. "That kid had
too much pass, too much kick, too much noodle for us."</LD>
<TE>   In 1940, Albert was a unanimous All-American quarterback as a
junior, but was edged out by Tom Harmon of Michigan, a senior, for
the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Born Jan. 27, 1920 in Chicago, Albert was a graduate of Glendale
High, where he was CIF high school player of the year in 1937. He
played only one year of varsity football in high school because he
weighed only 130 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore at Stanford, he was a 5-foot-9, 160-pound tailback
on a team coached by Claude "Tiny" Thornhill that won only one game
while scoring seven touchdowns in nine games. When Shaughnessy was
named coach in 1940 he installed the T-formation with Albert at
quarterback, Gallarneau and Kmetovic at halfbacks and Norm Standlee
at fullback, and the Indians were undefeated Pacific Coast Conference
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Shaughnessy later said that if Albert had not succeeded as his
quarterback, he might have abandoned the T-formation.</TE>
<TE>   In an article for Esquire in 1943, Shaughnessy wrote of his
Stanford team: "First of all, there was Albert, a superb ballhandler,
a magician with the ball and a gifted field general; wonderfully
observing, a great left-handed passer and a great kicker. He was
neither strong nor fast. His talents were primarily those of a faker;
he could fool people, and by temperament he ate up that sort of
assignment."</TE>
<TE>   He could play defense too. In a crucial game with USC, which had a
17-game winning streak, Albert returned an intercepted pass for a
touchdown in a 21-7 win.</TE>
<TE>   His senior year did not turn out as well. Stanford won six and
lost three, climaxed by a 16-0 loss to California. After playing
three years, Albert graduated in 1941 and joined the Navy, where he
served as an aircraft officer in the Pacific during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Albert was the first player selected by the San Francisco 49ers of
the then-new All-America Conference. He played seven seasons with the
49ers as a T-formation quarterback and one season with Calgary in the
Canadian Football League before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers hired him as a scout and coach and in 1956 he was
elevated to head coach by owner Tony Morabito, a position he held for
three years. In 1957 the 49ers tied Detroit for the Western
Conference title and led, 27-7, in the third quarter of a playoff
game before the Lions rallied to win, 31-27.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from football, Albert and his wife, Marty, his high
school sweetheart who followed him to Stanford, lived in Pebble
Beach, Menlo Park and Palm Desert before Albert developed Alzheimer's
and moved to Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife; three daughters, Nancy James of Bend,
Ore., Jane Willens of Palo Alto and Terry Levin of San Francisco; and
seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private, but a memorial service at Stanford is
being planned.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that donations be made to Stanford
University, 326 Galvez St., Stanford, CA 94305, or Alzheimer's Assn.,
2065 W. El Camino Real, Mountain View, CA 94040.</TE>

<LD>New Century Financial Corp., an Irvine mortgage lender that is
benefiting from low consumer borrowing rates, said Tuesday that it
expects third-quarter earnings to exceed analysts' estimates.</LD>
<LD>   New Century will earn $1.95 a share in the three months ending
Sept. 30, said spokeswoman Carrie Marrelli. Wall Street was expecting
earnings of $1.77 a share, according to a survey of four analysts by
Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   The company made $1.31 billion in loans in August to set a monthly
record, surpassing the $1.29 billion in loans in July.</LD>
<TE>   Mortgage rates, which are near all-time lows, have spurred
consumers to buy homes and refinance existing loans.</TE>
<TE>   New Century shares fell 34 cents to $28.98 on Nasdaq. The stock
has more than doubled this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Autobytel Inc., the Internet-based car-buying referral service,
has stepped up screening of potential buyers to boost sales and
reduce expenses for automobile dealers who use its Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Autobytel is seeking to increase the number of cars and trucks
sold through its referrals by eliminating requests from people who
use bogus names and invalid phone numbers on its Web sites, Chief
Executive Jeffrey Schwartz said in an interview. The company said it
will call people to verify orders.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always done some degree of filtering, but we've taken our
level of filtering to a new level," Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   Serious buyers, or people who plan to buy a vehicle within 30 to
60 days, will be referred to the 9,500 dealers who use Autobytel's
services, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Increased scrutiny has led to "appreciable" improvements in
so-called closing rates, or the percentage of referrals resulting in
sales, Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to give a specific number. Dealers in Autobytel's
network typically had a closing rate of 15% to 20%, he said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Trader Settles CFTC Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Settling charges that his company fraudulently solicited thousands of
customers from 1998 through 2001, a Los Angeles commodities trader
has agreed to repay investors $810,000, pay a $110,000 fine to the
government, and be banned from the industry, regulators said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A Commodity Futures Trading Commission complaint contended Madison
Financial Group President Richard A. Cohen told employees to "make up
a story" when soliciting customers by phone.</LD>
<LD>   Using high-pressure tactics, the employees claimed Madison clients
were making large sums trading commodity options when in fact 97% of
them lost money, the CFTC said. The CFTC said net losses in Madison
accounts totaled $17 million while Madison made $9 million in fees.</LD>
<TE>   Another principal in Madison, Ronald G. Scott of Beverly Hills,
faces similar charges; his lawyer, Eric O. Ibisi of Los Angeles,
declined to comment. Jack Barrett, head of the CFTC's Los Angeles
office, said an administrative law judge is expected to schedule a
hearing this fall on the charges against Scott.</TE>
<TE>   The CFTC banned Cohen and his Los Angeles-based firm, which is no
longer in business, from trading commodities or acting as advisors to
investors. He was given 10 years to repay investors, then pay his
fine. Cohen's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel's Radio Pacts Irk Labels</HD>
<DH>Music: The chain's lucrative deals with independent
promoters have resulted in massive playlist price hikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications Inc. is pushing the
envelope in the murky world of record promotion--and upsetting music
executives in the process.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel has notified record labels that it has signed new
pacts with three independent music promoters and granted them the
exclusive right to pitch songs to Clear Channel program directors at
its top black music, or "urban," radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   Those promoters, in turn, have dramatically raised the prices they
charge record labels for new songs added to a station's weekly
playlist.</LD>
<TE>   At KHHT-FM in Los Angeles, promotional prices surged 50%, with
Clear Channel's new gatekeepers charging $2,000 for each song added
to its weekly playlist. By last week, rates had jumped 20% to 100% at
42 Clear Channel black music stations across the nation after the
company signed exclusive deals with promoters Ted Astin, Wes Johnson
and Reuben Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden price hikes appear to contradict statements by Clear
Channel Chief Executive Mark Mays, who has admonished music
executives for wasting money on independent promotion. "I told them,
'Please, don't make the payments,' " Mays said in an interview this
summer. "Why they continue the payments I have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hart, an analyst for the New York-based media watchdog group
Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, accused Mays of "talking out both
sides of his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   "One day he's boasting about cleaning up a corrupt system. The
next day we learn that his company is getting more deeply involved in
the practice that he condemns," Hart said. "The message is clear:
Clear Channel is not serious about cracking down on independent
[music] promotion but in fact looking to capitalize on it."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel says it has no control over what prices the
promoters charge--and receives no percentage of their per-song rates.
The broadcast chain earns its money in the form of annual fees by
charging Astin, Johnson and Rodriguez about $100,000 and up per year
at each station for the exclusive right to pitch songs at its black
music stations.</TE>
<TE>   Astin and Johnson declined to comment, and Rodriguez could not be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Pop and Rock Contracts</TE>
<TE>   The radio chain is paid even more at its pop and rock stations, as
much as $250,000 annually per station, under a series of deals cut
with Tri-State Promotions, Jeff McClusky, Bill McGathy and other
promoters, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   "We have decided to set up a system where there are contracts with
a limited number of independent promoters because it makes it
possible for us to establish controls and oversight to monitor the
system," Mays said in a statement this week. "This also allows us to
keep it separate from programming. Decisions on programming are based
entirely on research and on data from local markets indicating what
listeners want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Record executives declined to comment, saying they feared Clear
Channel might retaliate by withholding airplay of their artists'
music.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, music executives, independent promoters and
radio employees contend that behind the scenes Clear Channel has
doggedly pursued cutting lucrative promotion pacts at its radio
stations as a way to tap more of the millions spent on promotions by
record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel also recently renewed several deals with music
promoters covering about 200 stations in the pop and rock fields. As
a result, this year Clear Channel could rake in $15 million to $20
million in fees from its pop, rock and black music station promotion
agreements, industry sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Mays defended his position, suggesting that Clear Channel has been
"very consistent" regarding its position on independent promotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Independent promoters are being paid significant amounts of money
for our proprietary information--our playlists and our research,"
Mays said. "If record companies choose to continue spending money
with independent promoters, we may not agree that it's the best
business practice on their part, but we'll participate if we can work
within our guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits radio stations from accepting money for
playing songs without disclosing that information to listeners.
Legislation was proposed recently by Sen. Russell D. Feingold
(D-Wis.) to ban independent promotion arrangements. Feingold alleges
that current pay-for-play practices violate payola laws.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel, the nation's largest broadcast chain with more than
1,200 radio stations, insists that its foray into independent
promotion is legal. Radio One Inc. and other competitors have
implemented similar promotion contracts.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, powerful music companies were accused of directly
bribing deejays to play songs. To sidestep current payola laws, an
independent contractor pays an annual fee to a radio station for the
exclusive right to pitch songs to the station's program director.</TE>
<TE>   The station is not required to play any song pitched by the
promoter but agrees to give the independent promoter advance
information about which songs the station will add to its weekly
playlist. The promoter then sells that information to the labels,
collecting a fee for each song added to the playlist.</TE>
<TE>   Shift of Power</TE>
<TE>   The current practice was invented by the music industry to
insulate record labels from allegations of payola while still
allowing them to influence airplay. Previously, labels paid only
promoters whom they believed had the power to manipulate programming
in their favor.</TE>
<TE>   But recent broadcast mergers have shifted the power to radio
groups, which today have the clout to launch a song simultaneously in
scores of markets across the country. In recent years Clear Channel
has installed its own team of independent promoters--intermediaries
who, labels say, charge higher prices but have less influence over
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's new gatekeepers immediately issued rate cards to
record companies, charging $800 to $3,000 per song, depending on the
market. Under the arrangement, promotion prices surged 100% in
Detroit, 55% in Philadelphia, 45% in Milwaukee and at least 25% in
most other cities, music executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Clear Channel continues to press music companies to
purchase programming data through a variety of other in-house
ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Under one service called PD Perceptuals, Clear Channel charges
labels $5,000 to showcase a song before a panel of its top
programming directors. The broadcast chain also sells access to its
programmers during radio conventions, charging music acts a fee to
perform live in concert before them.</TE>

<HD>Owners Seek Bids for Glendale Galleria</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Industry observers say the giant shopping mall
will fetch more than $400 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of the Glendale Galleria have put the giant shopping mall
up for sale, and industry observers say strong demand for such
properties should prompt a long line of bidders. The mall is expected
to sell for more than $400 million.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional investors and some of the nation's largest mall
operators, including Santa Monica-based Macerich Co. and Westfield
America Inc. of Los Angeles, are among the likely bidders for the
250-store mall, according to real estate brokers and retail
specialists.</LD>
<LD>   "It's got the full complement of department stores and ... it's a
very strong performer in a very healthy market," said retail
consultant Rob York.</LD>
<TE>   The 26-year-old mall is owned by a joint venture that includes
health insurer Cigna Corp., the New York State Teachers' Retirement
System and other investors. The field of prospective bidders for the
1.5-million-square-foot property should be narrowed to the finalists
by early October and the sale should be completed by the end of the
year, said Daniel Donahue, chairman of Costa Mesa-based Donahue
Schriber, which manages the mall.</TE>
<TE>   The owners put the mall, which sprawls over two blocks in the
heart of Glendale, up for sale to take advantage of a heated
investment market for prime commercial real estate. "The values being
paid for regional malls are probably near a 10-year high," Donahue
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mall sales have remained strong all year long. Earlier this summer
Macerich completed the acquisition of Arizona's largest mall owner,
Westcor Realty, for about $662 million, while cross-town rival
Westfield America was digesting the 14 malls it received in January
as part of the $2.2-billion acquisition of Rodamco North America.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, New York-based Trizec Properties Inc. tentatively
agreed to sell its nearly year-old Paseo Colorado shopping center in
Pasadena to an investment group in a deal valued at more than $100
million, according to people familiar with the transaction. Officials
with Trizec were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect more product to come on the market because of the
pent-up demand," said Matthew C. Sullivan, who specializes in retail
property sales for brokerage firm Colliers Seeley International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the Glendale Galleria are credited with keeping the
property competitive over the years through expansion, attracting new
retailers and experimenting with new concepts, such as a section of
the mall devoted to young shoppers called The Zone.</TE>
<TE>   Annual sales at the mall top $525 a square foot--among the highest
in the nation, according to industry observers.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly it's a terrific property," said Macerich President Arthur
Coppola, who said his firm does not comment on acquisition efforts.
"It's comparable to assets that we have purchased recently. It should
be a property that will be strong for a very, very long time."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing to Slash Value of Its Holdings</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm says a reassessment will show less than
$5 billion in assets, down from $15.4 billion. The CEO says it is
meeting some key financial goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a deal pending to pull it out of bankruptcy, Global Crossing
Ltd. said it would slash the value of its worldwide fiber-optic
network and other assets by at least $10 billion, or two-thirds of
their current listed value.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with the Bankruptcy Court in New York, the
telecommunications firm said it is completing a detailed assessment
of its holdings in light of a pending $250-million deal from two
Asian companies.</LD>
<LD>   The filing, part of a monthly report on finances, also revealed
that Global Crossing's closely watched cash on hand fell by $106
million in July, the biggest one-month drop since March. The company
did not explain the cause for the drop, which left it with $677
million at the end of the month.</LD>
<TE>   But Chief Executive John Legere said in a statement that the
company is meeting some key financial goals, such as lowering
operating expenses. The goals, provided in March to creditors, have
not been released publicly. The company lost $145 million, or 16
cents a share, in July, an improvement over June's loss of $173
million, or 19 cents. Sales were $249 million in July, $1 million
less than in the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   Global has said in filings that it expected to lower the value of
its assets once it had a deal approved for the purchase of the
company, but it had never put a dollar amount on the reduction.</TE>
<TE>   When it filed its Chapter 11 petition in January, Global listed
$22.4 billion in assets, which at the time ranked it as the
fourth-largest bankruptcy case. But Global has since lowered that
figure to $15.4 billion, and the major revaluation it is undergoing
will cut it to less than $5 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives would not elaborate on the monthly report,
which was filed Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the court approved an agreement that Global and its
creditors worked out with two Asian companies, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
in Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte. Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, the two firms would invest $250 million in cash
for 61.5% of Global, and the company's creditors and bankers would
get 38.5% of Global, about $300 million in cash and $200 million in
notes.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to be the basis for a reorganization plan
that Global expects to file with the court Sept. 16. Other creditors
then can object or file their own plans to restructure the company.</TE>
<TE>   Global's original filing listed debts of $12.4 billion, which
included amounts owed by some subsidiaries that it did not put in
bankruptcy. Its July report values the total bankruptcy claims at
$7.8 billion for the company and 55 affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, it put two dozen more subsidiaries into bankruptcy to
make it easier to include them in the reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, the company has filed a series of documents
seeking court approval for tentative settlements with major equipment
suppliers, such as Lucent Technologies Inc. Those documents were
filed under seal, Global said, to keep the details from other vendors
still negotiating deals.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements probably will provide payments over time to avoid
taking a chunk out of Global's remaining cash on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, for instance, was owed $31.4 million at the time Global
filed its Chapter 11 petition. Other major suppliers include Alcatel,
which is owed $31.1 million, and TyCom Ltd., which is owed $29.2
million.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Seeks Role for Media Software</HD>
<DH>Technology: The company hopes to persuade entertainment
firms to deliver their products digitally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venturing into the heart of Hollywood, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday
unveiled the preliminary version of its latest software for watching
movies and listening to music, hoping to persuade consumers and
entertainment companies to give Windows-based computers a starring
role in the future of entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was joined by a handful of
entertainment luminaries who endorsed the more than 120 improvements
to the company's Windows Media technologies.</LD>
<LD>   But absent from the event at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex were
major studio executives who ultimately will decide how many of their
movies and television shows will be delivered digitally by
Microsoft's software.</LD>
<TE>   With Windows Media Series 9, Microsoft is aiming at two different
but equally important groups of customers. It not only wants
consumers to use the Windows Media Player to organize and control
their music and video files but also hopes entertainment companies
will use Windows Media software to deliver their products
digitally--either via the Internet or on disc.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft faces fierce competition, particularly from RealNetworks
Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. But it also must overcome the reluctance
of major entertainment companies to embrace the Internet as a
distribution pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   On hand to endorse Microsoft's technology were "Titanic" director
James Cameron, former Beatles producer George Martin and rapper-actor
LL Cool J--respected artists all but none of them in charge of a
major studio or record label. In an interview, Gates said the company
invited leading entertainment creators, not studio heads, because
"those would be the best ones to speak out about what our
technology's going to let them do."</TE>
<TE>   "The time to bring the business people in," he added, "is when you
have the services built."</TE>
<TE>   Those services are few and far between, particularly when it comes
to full-length video. Although five of the seven major Hollywood
studios plan to test the waters with a downloadable movie service
this year, the Movielink venture, like the handful of independent
online movie outlets, probably would offer only a tiny fraction of
what's in the studios' vaults.</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives and other industry representatives say the main
holdups are the limited picture quality of online video and the risk
of digital piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Although Microsoft's new software adds the ability to scramble
live broadcasts over the Internet, it doesn't seem to answer two of
the studios' key concerns: the proliferation of piracy on Internet
file-sharing networks and the continuing ability to turn scrambled
media files into pirated analog copies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on both security and quality fronts, Microsoft
representatives say, the new Windows Media technology has made
important improvements. And Gates warned that the time has come to
start competing with online pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's the studio-backed efforts like Movielink or the
independents like CinemaNow or Intertainer, we are very strongly
telling the studios they've got to make those things successful, in
big numbers," he said. "They can't sit back and say, 'DVDs are doing
well, why do we care?' ... They're creating the same awful common
sense for movies that for many young people exists for music, which
is you steal the bits.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of the music industry, I don't think there's anyone
in that industry who wouldn't say, 'Darn, we were late. We should
have done [a legitimate online service] years ago, or ... version one
should have been perhaps more flexible than it was.' "</TE>
<TE>   The new version of the Windows Media Player includes many powerful
customization features, among them the ability to speed or slow
playback without changing the pitch of the music or voices.</TE>
<TE>   It also integrates four fee-based services: video on demand from
Intertainer and CinemaNow and music from Pressplay and FullAudio.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Windows Media technologies also boast the ability to
deliver surround sound through the Internet, a feature that rocker
Peter Gabriel plans to use Sept. 25 on a downloadable version of his
new album, "Up."</TE>
<TE>   And Windows Media can compress a full-length high-definition video
onto a single DVD, a technique BMW of North America plans to use this
month when it distributes Artisan Entertainment's "Standing in the
Shadows of Motown" to selected theaters with digital projectors.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent survey by ComScore Media Metrix, Microsoft
and Seattle-based RealNetworks are neck and neck in the battle for
consumers. But Real has lined up more deals with entertainment and
media companies, including exclusive deals with major league baseball
and NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's great that they've improved their plumbing,"
RealNetworks' chief executive, Rob Glaser, said of Microsoft's new
technology, but he added that consumers care most about being able to
play the files they find online. Real's player can handle far more
formats than Microsoft's.</TE>

<HD>Oakley Trims Forecast Amid Waning Sales</HD>
<DH>News surprises analysts and sends shares down by 25%</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing soft sales of its costly sunglasses, Oakley Inc. said
Wednesday that revenue and earnings for the second half of this year
probably won't meet expectations--triggering a 25% drop in its share
price.</LD>
<LD>   Oakley's announcement was viewed by some as another sign that
shoppers are shying away from expensive discretionary items, although
analysts were nonetheless taken aback by the revised forecast.</LD>
<LD>   "It knocked us off our feet," said Lehman Bros. analyst Eric
Beder, who downgraded the stock from "buy" to "market perform." "We
talked to some of our largest holders and they couldn't believe it."</LD>
<TE>   The stock closed at $9.70, down $3.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange. It was the lowest closing price in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   The lower sales and earnings outlook was particularly surprising
because it came just seven weeks after Oakley said it had recovered
from problems that cropped up last year when its biggest customer,
Sunglass Hut, slashed orders after being acquired by competitor
Luxottica Group. Oakley and Luxottica have resolved their
differences, so analysts were expecting brighter news this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But Oakley is operating in a more challenging retail environment,
and the lower-than-expected sales of its trendy sunglasses may be
evidence that consumers are opting to spend less. Though some Oakley
shades sell for $65, other styles cost much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Oakley's products all fall in the consumer discretionary realm,"
said Terrence Mackay, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. "With some of
these sunglasses retailing at $200 or more, you can bet a lot of
these consumers are going to take a pass on some of these products
this season, simply because they're uncomfortable spending that
money."</TE>
<TE>   To cater to a more cautious consumer, Oakley may need to consider
lowering prices, Mackay said.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill Ranch-based Oakley said it expects earnings of about 16
cents a share for the third quarter ending Sept. 30, rather than the
27 cents anticipated in July. The company lowered its sales
expectations by about 15% compared with earlier guidance and said
sales probably would grow 10% to 12% to $125 million to $128 million.
In last year's third quarter, Oakley earned 21 cents a share on sales
of $114 million.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley also lowered its fourth-quarter outlook, based on current
sales trends, and said earnings probably would be 10 cents a share on
sales of $108 million to $110 million. Previously, Oakley predicted
that fourth-quarter profit would be 16 cents a share on sales of
about $129 million. In the final quarter of fiscal 2001, Oakley
earned 5 cents a share on sales of $90.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mackay also said Oakley must tread carefully as it continues to
expand into its newer categories--which include shoes, watches and
apparel--because the profit margins are lower on those products than
on eyewear. The analyst said he still considers the stock too risky
and would not recommend investing in it, despite Wednesday's price
decline.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Executive Jim Jannard, who has accumulated Oakley stock
in the past, said in Wednesday's statement that he is prepared to buy
up to 2 million shares of the company's stock to show his confidence
in its long-term strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "While we are certainly disappointed with current sales trends, we
are confident that when overall consumer confidence and spending
levels return to stronger levels, our revenue and earnings outlook
will benefit accordingly," the statement said.</TE>

<HD>House Widens IPO Probe to 2 More Banks</HD>
<DH>Securities: A committee requests data from Goldman Sachs
and CSFB on their business dealings with tech firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An investigation of Wall Street's conduct during the late-1990s bull
market intensified Wednesday as Congress asked two more investment
banks for information about their research analysts and new-stock
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee sent letters to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston. The committee is
seeking details about the brokerages' business dealings with more
than two dozen companies, including information on any allocations of
initial public stock offerings to company executives.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the firms named in the letters are telecom or Internet
businesses, including Commerce One Inc., Global Crossing Ltd.,
Razorfish Inc. and IVillage Inc. Energy trader Enron Corp. also is
included.</LD>
<TE>   The committee asked for the data by Sept. 19 and said it may issue
subpoenas if the brokerages do not fully comply.</TE>
<TE>   The requests grew out of the committee's investigation of Salomon
Smith Barney and that firm's allocation of sought-after IPO shares to
top management of WorldCom Inc. The committee released documents last
week showing that former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers
earned $11 million on IPOs he received from Salomon, a unit of
Citigroup Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee's investigation of Wall Street is one of
several underway at the state and federal levels. The inquiries,
including those by the New York attorney general and the Securities
and Exchange Commission, center on whether apparently long-ingrained
brokerage practices hurt individual investors and contributed to the
collapses of firms such as Enron and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   The letters to Goldman and CSFB, which come a week before the
anniversary of Sept. 11, also illustrate the degree to which
sentiment toward Wall Street has grown increasingly antagonistic.
Though investment banks were faulted before the terrorist attacks for
alleged abuses in the late 1990s, the criticisms were largely muted
in the months after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Wall Street is being skewered by politicians who are
alleging an array of wrongdoing during the long bull market.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee's investigation centers on whether brokerages
allocated coveted IPO shares to curry favor with company
executives--assuring that the executives would grant the brokerages
fee-rich investment-banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Any such quid pro quo, if undisclosed, would violate securities
laws, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also are looking at the role brokerage research
analysts played in pumping up tech stocks and in continuing to tout
them to individual investors even as share prices began to collapse
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street critics have lashed out at some analysts' close
relationships with executives of the companies they were supposed to
be objectively evaluating.</TE>
<TE>   Though the committee had been focusing on Salomon Smith Barney,
"It's important that we look beyond one firm to get a bigger picture
of how common these practices were on Wall Street," said Peggy
Peterson, a spokeswoman for Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), the
committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman and CSFB said they would cooperate with the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We're more than happy to cooperate with Rep. Oxley's request,
although we are surprised to have been asked," Goldman said in a
statement. "We too have read recent reports of so-called industry
practices, and they do not accord with how we do business at Goldman
Sachs."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, said "We
continue to cooperate with all authorities." She declined to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked CSFB for details about its dealings with 15
companies; it asked Goldman for information about 14 companies.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked both brokerages for detailed information about
the recommendations of the stock analysts who covered the named
companies, and the total compensation the analysts have received
since Jan. 1, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also are seeking e-mails and other communication
between analysts and their supervisors and between analysts and
executives of the firms named. The committee also wants to see the
appointment calendars of the analysts from 1996 to the present.</TE>
<TE>   The information requests may guarantee that investment banks will
face a continued stream of bad publicity, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of the other regulatory inquiries underway, the House
committee's investigation has played out on the public stage through
the frequent release of data. That has created a public-relations
nightmare for the investment banks, which typically shun the
limelight.</TE>
<TE>   "The image of Wall Street as a tool for enriching corporate
executives at the expense of average Americans is perpetuated by the
congressional pressure," said Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor and
SEC enforcement attorney now in private practice.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of the number of headlines being generated, the House
committee's investigation has at least temporarily eclipsed a similar
examination being done by New York State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Spitzer stunned Wall Street by releasing subpoenaed
e-mails from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts, showing that the analysts
were privately disparaging Internet stocks in 1999 and 2000 even as
they continued to tout the shares to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill settled Spitzer's allegations by agreeing to pay $100
million and to reform its research practices. Other investment banks
also have said they will reform their practices.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer is continuing his investigation, focusing on Salomon and
Morgan Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   Under a deal worked out among a group of state securities
regulators earlier this summer, major brokerages are facing probes by
one or more of the regulators. Massachusetts, for example, is
investigating CSFB, and Utah is investigating Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee, in its letters to the brokerages, asked for
"all information relating to the ongoing investigation" of the firms
by the states.</TE>

<HD>Union, Shippers Return to Table</HD>
<DH>Ports: A brief halt in contract negotiations had raised
concerns that dockworkers might begin a work slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast dockworkers and shipping lines returned to the bargaining
table Wednesday, ending a brief halt in contract negotiations that
had heightened concerns about a possible disruption at the ports.</LD>
<LD>   Bargaining subcommittees devoted to issues such as benefits and
safety resumed discussion in the afternoon in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Although top union and management officials at the so-called big
table have yet to meet--and so far have no plans to do so--both sides
characterized Wednesday's developments as progress after a tense
Labor Day weekend standoff in which talks broke down and the
long-extended labor agreement expired.</LD>
<TE>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union had accused the
management group of sabotaging negotiations by trying to make a
tentative agreement on health care contingent upon a deal on
arbitration--a charge that the management group denied.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone said the two sides agreed Wednesday
on a framework for further bargaining, paving the way for the two
sides to restart negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's significant in that they asked us to get back [to the table]
and that they agreed to take one issue at a time," Stallone said.
"We'll see what happens from here."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Suite, contract administrator for the Pacific Maritime Assn.,
said the management group is likewise pleased that both sides are
again communicating directly.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we are encouraged," Suite said. "You don't settle
contracts by sniping at each other and holding press conferences and
rallies. You settle it by sitting at the table and bargaining."</TE>
<TE>   The resumption of talks was good news to companies dependent on
the West Coast's 29 ports, which move an estimated $300 billion of
goods each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cautiously optimistic," said Robin Lanier, executive
director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents
retailers, manufacturers and other importers and exporters. "Both
sides appear to have cooled off a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Lanier said her group is still concerned that the dockworkers
union is working without a contract. The 10,500-member union had
agreed to day-to-day contract extensions since the original agreement
expired July 1. It refused further extensions Sunday, paving the way
for potential work slowdowns. But so far cargo appears to be moving
normally.</TE>
<TE>   September is prime time for retailers to receive merchandise for
the all-important holiday season, and many are rushing to take
possession of it as soon as possible in the face of potential labor
disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Lanier said the only delays her members have been experiencing
stem from a shortage of equipment at the ports caused by "all the
uncertainty." She said chassis, or wheels used to move metal shipping
containers over land, are in particularly short supply.</TE>

<HD>More Charges Expected in Probe of WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Telecom: As two former executives plead not guilty to
securities fraud, prosecutors say their case is expanding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Widening their probe of the largest accounting scandal in U.S.
history, federal prosecutors said Wednesday that they plan to file
new charges and indict additional defendants in their investigation
of telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. David B. Anders told a federal judge in New
York on Wednesday that he intends to expand on a criminal indictment
unveiled last week that named five former WorldCom executives as
masterminds of an alleged accounting scheme that inflated WorldCom's
profit by billions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Anders made his remarks at the arraignment of former WorldCom
Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and accounting executive
Buford Yates Jr., who were indicted last week on charges that they
directed employees to hide $3.9 billion in expenses at WorldCom,
which owns MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone company.
Sullivan and Yates both pleaded not guilty to securities fraud
charges.</LD>
<TE>   For weeks, prosecutors have threatened potential defendants in the
WorldCom case with jail time to get them to cooperate with the
government in bringing additional charges against more senior company
executives, including former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J.
Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The government is said to be weighing several new charges against
Sullivan and Yates and possibly other defendants. The charges include
insider trading on nonpublic information, obstruction of justice,
perjury and filing false financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   In last week's indictment, two former WorldCom executives, Betty
Vinson and Troy Normand, were named as unindicted co-conspirators.
They are expected to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors.
Former WorldCom comptroller David F. Myers is negotiating a plea
agreement in connection with the accounting probe.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Anders and other WorldCom prosecutors have faced off
in court against drug lords and organized crime groups, some experts
say racketeering charges against some former WorldCom executives also
are a possibility. To prove racketeering, prosecutors would have to
show that WorldCom executives had engaged in a criminal enterprise to
shortchange investors and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of additional charges ups the ante in a criminal case
that could have significant repercussions for corporate bookkeeping
and for Wall Street, where negative investor reaction to a wave of
financial scandals has pummeled stock prices and weakened the
nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom is waging a fight now for the hearts and minds of
clients, employees and investors," said Blair Levin, a
telecommunications analyst at the Washington office of Legg Mason
Wood Walker Inc. "There's a crime here that really devastated the
whole [telecom] sector."</TE>
<TE>   However, some experts saw little indication Wednesday that
WorldCom's former chief executive might soon face criminal charges,
along with some of his subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the case involving Enron Corp., in which the government
clearly telegraphed its intention to go after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow after reaching a plea agreement with former Fastow
subordinate Michael J. Kopper, experts say there has been little or
no mention of Ebbers in court documents filed by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "While there may be widespread hope and expectation by those
following the WorldCom investigation that Ebbers will be charged,
such a case--if one will ever be brought--still appears to be far
off," said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor and lawyer for
the Securities and Exchange Commission. He added that "if there is no
case to be made against Bernie Ebbers, the big fish to fry in
WorldCom becomes Scott Sullivan."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Sullivan, who remained free on $10-million bail after his
arraignment Wednesday, nor his attorney, Irvin B. Nathan, could be
reached for comment. Nathan has said that his client was a victim of
"a rush to judgment" and that his client looks forward to having his
day in court.</TE>
<TE>   Yates' attorney, David Schertler, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the conspiracy count, Yates and Sullivan face a
maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The securities
fraud and false statement counts each carry a maximum sentence of 10
years in prison and a $1-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, Schertler said he will seek to have his
client's trial moved out of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the government said WorldCom defendants faced a
hostile reception in New York, where a jury probably would include
some pensioners, investors or telecom employees angry over the
fallout from the WorldCom accounting scandal. If Yates' request is
granted, it could lead to a separate trial for the former WorldCom
executive, who was released Wednesday on a $500,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance before a congressional panel in July that was
attended by Justice Department officials investigating WorldCom,
Ebbers maintained his innocence, saying: "No one will conclude that I
engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct during my tenure at
WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting scheme at the heart of the WorldCom case allowed
the company to claim billions of dollars in profit over the last two
fiscal years.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme unraveled in June, when WorldCom publicly acknowledged
the accounting problems and was forced to restate its earnings. The
company subsequently sought Chapter 11 protection on July 21 in the
biggest corporate bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones scheduled a Dec. 9 pretrial
hearing for Sullivan and Yates.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Adopt a New Currency, Free 55 People</HD>
<DH>Asia: Fiscal move aims to end the confusion from various
forms of money now in use. Meanwhile, the Pakistani captives are
returned to homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>President Hamid Karzai on Wednesday announced the issuing of a new
currency, designed to end the confusion from several forms of money
now in circulation and provide a symbol of Afghan renewal and unity.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day, Afghanistan handed over 55 longtime Pakistani
prisoners who had fought on the side of the ousted Taliban regime to
their government, saying they no longer posed a danger here.</LD>
<LD>   Rumors of the new currency had abounded in recent days, causing
extreme volatility at money changer stands across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai's announcement seemed aimed at averting panic among Afghans
that their existing currency would become worthless.</TE>
<TE>   In a nationally broadcast address, he assured Afghans that they
would not lose money during the introduction of the new bills.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to get rid of inflation, our economists and commercial
consultants decided to remove three zeros from the old afghanis," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not worry. No matter how much you have, you can freely
exchange all your old afghanis at the nearest bank in all parts of
Afghanistan," he promised. "If banks are crowded or not available,
you can change your money with money changers."</TE>
<TE>   The current afghanis, which over the past year have been valued at
about 40,000 to the U.S. dollar, will be replaced by afghanis valued
at about 40 to the dollar. The new currency, like the old, will float
with the market and be backed by the nation's gold and hard-currency
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said the new currency will be honored throughout the
country. Presently, variants of the afghani bill circulate in areas
formerly controlled by Northern Alliance forces that overthrew the
Taliban last fall with the help of U.S.-led troops. In addition,
several foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the
Pakistani rupee, are widely used.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be proud," Karzai said. "The new money will have
value, and in the exchange markets it will be stable and credible."</TE>
<TE>   The government said two planeloads of new notes have arrived in
Kabul, the capital, and the exchange of the notes will begin soon.
The bills are being printed in Germany using the latest techniques to
foil counterfeiters, Finance Ministry officials said. The switch will
enable the Central Bank to determine how many afghanis are in
circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Afghan officials characterized the prisoner release as
the beginning of an exchange. But some here feared that the gesture
may boomerang if those released return to take up arms against the
multinational peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The 55 prisoners had fought under the Taliban until they were
captured by opposition forces before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and the ensuing offensive by U.S.-led forces that toppled the Islamic
regime. Another 55 are due to be turned over to Pakistan today.</TE>
<TE>   "Those deemed not a threat to this country or others as terrorists
and not wanted by any other country were returned to Pakistan," said
Omar Samad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The first batch included several aged men and some people on
crutches. Reporters in Kabul were not allowed to interview them.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pakistan has made no commitment, Afghanistan is hoping to
receive in exchange significant numbers of its citizens held in
Pakistani jails on minor charges such as theft and improper
documentation, Samad said in an interview earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "We have complained about the treatment of Afghan refugees," Samad
said. "Pakistan should release our citizens who may be unarmed petty
criminals who were only looking for a morsel of food."</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani prisoners turned over Wednesday, some of whom had
spent as long as six years in the custody of militias that opposed
the Taliban regime, were brought to Kabul's airport and turned over
to the Pakistani ambassador, Rustam Shah Mohmand. They were flown by
military transport to Peshawar, Pakistan, where they were jailed
again.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities will determine whether the prisoners will be
freed, face charges for various crimes or be held as potential
terrorist threats, the Afghan government said. Mohmand told reporters
at the airport that he hopes for the release of more Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is still holding at least 600 Pakistanis in the cities
of Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul for having fought alongside
Taliban forces, the Pakistani government says. Significant numbers of
those are suspected of having been members of Al Qaeda, Osama bin
Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   There are 2,000 to 4,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners of various
nationalities in Afghan jails, security officials in Afghanistan said
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Samad said the Pakistanis sent home Wednesday are believed to be
religious militants, many of whom thought that they were enlisting to
chase U.S. or Russian "infidels" out of Muslim Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have expressed reservations about the hand-over,
citing the possibility that some of those freed will return and
regroup to attack Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials have insisted that the prisoners were screened by
police as well as by the International Committee of the Red Cross and
pose a minimal threat of being terrorists.</TE>

<HD>A Strategy That Hits All Fronts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"Today, the process starts."</LD>
<LD>   With those words, President Bush on Wednesday launched a
multi-pronged strategy that will unfold over the next few months at a
deliberate pace and will result, if all goes as the administration
hopes, in the dismantling of Iraq's suspected weapons of mass
destruction and the ouster of President Saddam Hussein sometime next
year.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell will tackle the tough
diplomatic work of persuading key allies to join--or at least not
publicly reject--a "coalition of the willing" that would enable the
United States to eventually move against Iraq, administration
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   As part of these consultations, Washington is willing to consider
a more aggressive round of United Nations weapons inspections to
track and destroy any nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or
ballistic missiles it finds, even though Hussein is unlikely to
agree. It's a compromise that may slow the pace, but the
administration now acknowledges that it is also the main hope for
winning international support.</TE>
<TE>   "First things first," Powell told reporters Wednesday after
meeting with 10 European, African and Asian officials at the U.N.
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South
Africa. "It would be the quickest, cleanest solution if the regime
were to change, but there is an international community out there,
and there are these [U.N.] resolutions which are still present."</TE>
<TE>   On a parallel track, the State Department, Pentagon and CIA will
be working with the Iraqi opposition to develop plans for a
government to replace Hussein's and to determine what forces now
inside the country, particularly in the Kurdish areas of northern
Iraq, might be available to work with U.S. troops in a military
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At home, the administration will throw its top foreign policy
officials at congressional committee hearings to outline U.S.
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become a seven-ring circus, and all seven rings are
running at the same time," a senior administration official said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The administration refuses to discuss timelines, insisting that
there are no target dates for wrapping up any phase of the
international consultations and internal deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no deadlines for decisions. These are real
consultations, and what the president decides will be influenced by
that process. There's no high-noon decision expected soon," the
senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some benchmarks are emerging.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is due to break in October for midterm elections, and the
White House made clear Wednesday that it hopes to have a mandate for
action against Iraq from Capitol Hill before then.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also hopes to spur the United Nations to action. The
administration has not come up with a cutoff time, but again, the
emphasis is on a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to go the U.N. route, and we have to give it the best
effort. But if we can't redefine the [inspections] process so it
leads to the desired result, we won't be jerked around," said a
well-placed U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is saying we'll give it only three, six or nine months,
but the timing will become part of the equation as the discussions
develop over the next few weeks," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Added the senior administration official: "The experience with
this regime is largely in, and we have to keep this in mind. We know
the risks only increase with time. The longer he defies sanctions,
the longer he develops weapons of mass destruction and the longer he
develops ties with terrorists, the already great risk to our friends
and allies only grows."</TE>
<TE>   To expedite the process, the State Department this week is
completing two detailed reports for distribution worldwide.
Department officials said the main document outlines what the U.S.
knows about Iraq's programs for weapons of mass destruction. Bush
will cite some, but not all, of this information in a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 12, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no stunning revelations or dramatic new
facts to make the case for ousting Hussein, senior U.S. officials
said Wednesday. Instead, the document is based on "what we know, what
we suspect and what we fear," a State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been working for months with Britain to
accumulate an "evidentiary trail" on Iraq's weapons programs since
U.N. inspectors left Baghdad in 1998, and it has compiled data from
the last 11 years, the official added.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to be a dramatic 'Here are the pictures, here
are the firsthand stories.' It's more a larger-picture summary," the
well-placed official said.</TE>
<TE>   The document will be based on five general categories of
information: discoveries made by former U.N. inspectors; reports from
recent defectors; intelligence from satellites and other technical
devices; data on the importation of materiel needed to assemble
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons; and general behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Hussein has given up $166 billion in oil since 1998 rather than
let inspectors go back in. That's a lot of money. The loss in oil
income has been stupendous. That's the sort of thing you tell a jury
in the closing argument to make your case," the well-placed official
said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with CNN, Powell said Wednesday that the United
Nations needs to look at the accumulated facts to see how extensively
Iraq has been thwarting the will of the international community since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The second document is a compendium of the Iraqi leader's crimes
against his people.</TE>
<TE>   Both documents will be reviewed this weekend when Bush meets with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David in Maryland, where
they will work on strategy to get other key members of the U.N. on
board, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, to spur the Iraqi opposition and lay the groundwork for
the immediate post-Hussein period, the State Department has expanded
and expedited its "Future of Iraq" program. A State Department
official played host at a meeting of a group of Iraqi exiles
Wednesday in London to discuss "democratic principles" for the next
government in Baghdad. Three more working groups will meet this
month.</TE>
<TE>   In October, working groups will meet each week to deal with issues
ranging from defense and the oil industry to the economy and foreign
policy, according to State Department sources.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi opposition is also expected to hold a U.S.-financed
conference in Europe at the end of this month or early next month,
the sources added. Some Iraqi exiles are now pressing for the
conference to form a government-in-exile to take over once Hussein is
ousted, somewhat like the conference of Afghan leaders in Germany
last year.</TE>

<HD>Blair's Stance on Hussein Elicits Misgivings at Home,
Abroad</HD>
<DH>Europe: British leader's promise to offer proof that Iraqi
leader poses a threat draws skepticism. German chancellor says he's
not swayed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In a sign of the political battle to precede any military strike
against Iraq, British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday
encountered resistance at home and among European neighbors to his
call for ousting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Blair declared support for the Bush administration's
campaign against Hussein, the reaction in Britain was decidedly
mixed. Voters and leaders of Blair's own center-left Labor Party
expressed misgivings about the prime minister's willingness to use
force against Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Britain remains the closest U.S. ally, but even here polls show
considerable opposition to Washington's war talk. And that sentiment
is widespread throughout Europe: German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
responded to Blair's speech with a sharp rebuff Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "With all respect for Tony Blair: Just like anyone else, he will
not speak for Europe alone on this issue or on others," said
Schroeder, whose loud opposition to President Bush's policy on Iraq
has been a centerpiece of his campaign for reelection in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "We have absolutely no reason to change our well-founded position.
Under my leadership, Germany will not take part in an intervention in
Iraq," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   Debate in Britain on Wednesday centered on Blair's promise to make
the case against Iraq by presenting a dossier of evidence to support
the claim that Hussein's regime is developing nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Critics predicted that the dossier would not produce compelling
new arguments to prove the prime minister's assertion that Hussein
poses "a real and unique threat" to world security.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my doubts that hard evidence will be produced in time to
allay the great fears that people have in this country of delivering
action against Saddam Hussein," said Ian Gibson, a Labor member of
Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, analysts said Blair, who is scheduled to meet with
Bush this weekend at Camp David in Maryland, had set a new tone by
emphasizing the need to seek renewed United Nations weapons
inspections in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's speech was shaped by his awareness of his political
difficulties at home and in Europe, one analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "He got it just about right," said Daniel Neep of the Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies, a think tank here. "In the
United Kingdom until now, the debate had been dominated by the
antiwar opposition. He made clear the need to gain international
consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Polls have consistently shown a reluctance in Britain to commit to
a military campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the Guardian newspaper last month, for example, showed
52% of respondents opposed to using British forces in such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   However, a poll taken Wednesday by GMTV, a morning television
show, found that 65% of respondents would favor a war--if evidence
showed that Hussein had developed weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of an aggressive stance toward Iraq urged Blair to use
his skills as a politician and orator to combat the prevailing mood
of reluctance at home and elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Blair is well aware that his own party has grave doubts about
declaring war on Iraq, that opinion polls indicate profound public
skepticism and that the rest of Europe opposes toppling Saddam," the
conservative Daily Telegraph said in an editorial. "Yet it is not
merely right but imperative for him to swim against this tide.... He
needs to do more to flush out and defeat what he rightly calls 'just
straightforward anti-Americanism.' "</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Americanism is certainly widespread in Europe--both among the
public and many government officials--and is fed by the Bush
administration's campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, critics fear that an invasion of Iraq would produce
chaos and carnage in a region already unsettled by the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Islamic terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The dangers are ... that there would be massive destruction and
casualties, which would infuriate the Arab world," said Tam Dalyell,
a veteran Labor member of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   France, a major military and political force in Europe, has
stopped short of Germany's adamant antiwar statements. Instead, the
French have insisted that every effort be made to return U.N. weapons
inspectors to Iraq--they left in 1998--and that a U.N. Security
Council vote be held before any military action by an international
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   President Jacques Chirac repeated that position Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The center-right governments of Spain and Italy tend to be
pro-American and are likely, at a minimum, to allow the use of bases
in their territory for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the inclination of the governments, public opinion on the
continent seems resolutely against the idea of a "preemptive"
Anglo-American operation without U.N. approval or a well-articulated
explanation of the threat posed by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to think constructively about what can and should justify
intervention by the international community in the internal affairs
of a sovereign state," Chris Patten, foreign affairs commissioner of
the European Union, warned in a speech Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The international community's top priority, Patten said, should be
to combat terrorism "on as broad a front as possible, including
promoting Middle East peace and preventing a gulf opening up between
the West and the Islamic world."</TE>
<TE>   To bridge the more immediate gap between antiwar forces and the
Bush and Blair administrations, British officials said they intend to
put the evidence of Hussein's misdeeds on the table.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Office Minister Mike O'Brien asserted that the dossier on
Hussein's suspected stockpile of weaponry would "set out the whole
case."</TE>
<TE>   That would apparently include details fleshing out Blair's
comments, which echoed those of U.S. officials in recent weeks,
suggesting that Iraq is trying to develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as nuclear weapons are concerned, we believe that he is in
the process of developing that capacity," O'Brien said in a BBC
interview. "Obviously it is not just having the nuclear weapons but
the ballistic missile technology in that capacity in order to deliver
them. We believe he is in the process of trying to get that, so we
will set out all the details."</TE>
<TE>   The Blair government has plenty of fighting to do on the political
front before it gets to the military front, the left-leaning Guardian
said in a Wednesday editorial.</TE>
<TE>   Blair "will need better evidence and more convincing arguments
than we were given yesterday before he is able to win back the
public's support," the editorial said.</TE>

<LD>A Munich club owner was convicted of incitement to hate and
anti-Semitism for canceling a pro-Israel fund-raiser that involved
the granddaughter of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He
was fined and sentenced to six months' probation.</LD>
<LD>   The trial of Rudolf Fischer, 52, followed his refusal to allow the
gathering for 400 guests at his club in March 2001. The event was a
fund-raiser for Keren Hayesod, a quasi-governmental Israeli
organization that raises money to promote Jewish immigration to
Israel and other Israeli causes.</LD>
<LD>   Claus Peter Zistl, an attorney for the group, testified Monday
that Fischer told one of its members that he had canceled the event
because "he wanted nothing to do" with Jews and would sooner host a
far-right political rally.</LD>

<KH>POLICY ON IRAQ</KH>
<HD>Bush to Involve Congress Before Moving on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Policy: The White House does not specify whether support
must precede action. The case for the 'serious threat' posed by
Hussein will be made at the U.N. and abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Wednesday that he would seek congressional
approval before taking action against Iraq, as he began a major drive
to win support at home and abroad for removing Saddam Hussein from
power.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also said that he will press his case against the Iraqi
president when he addresses the United Nations next Thursday, telling
his audience of diplomats that Hussein is "stiffing the world" by
violating the agreements he had made not to develop weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi leader is "a serious threat to the world," Bush said
Wednesday after meeting for an hour with congressional leaders at the
White House. He added: "Doing nothing about that serious threat is
not an option for the United States."</LD>
<TE>   The president also said he would meet this weekend with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David in Maryland, and then reach
out to the leaders of Canada, China, Russia and France, engaging in
personal diplomacy to persuade world leaders to join his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of activity reflects a newly energized effort by the
White House to broaden support--in Congress and around the world--for
changing the regime in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The administration expects to lay out evidence of an Iraqi weapons
program to Congress soon, although officials said privately Wednesday
that the presentation would not include dramatic new revelations.</TE>
<TE>   During the last month, the administration, with the exception of
Vice President Dick Cheney, has largely taken a back seat while
critics overseas and at home expressed sharp reservations about
launching a war against Iraq, particularly if Bush does not first
line up a coalition of international support. Several U.S.
lawmakers--including some of Bush's fellow Republicans--also have
complained that the administration has kept Congress in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the go-it-alone approach appears to have been abandoned.
Bush's remarks Wednesday to reporters, his commitment to members of
Congress to seek their approval, and the upcoming diplomatic efforts
suggested that the complaints had registered with the White House.</TE>
<TE>   But there were no immediate dividends, either in Congress or among
foreign officials. Also left unclear at the end of the day was just
what course Bush would take, and whether he would have wide support.</TE>
<TE>   "I am in the process of deciding how to proceed," Bush said in a
letter he dispatched to every member of Congress. He pledged to seek
congressional support "for U.S. action to do whatever is necessary to
deal with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime."</TE>
<TE>   Left unclear, however, was whether the administration might
proceed with action against Hussein if it failed to win congressional
approval.</TE>
<TE>   There were also widespread complaints on Capitol Hill that a
briefing Wednesday by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had
produced no intelligence information supporting the administration's
argument against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has said that the Iraqis' arsenal includes
chemical weapons and that they are rushing to develop nuclear and
biological armaments.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing new, nothing compelling, nothing to lead me to
believe there is any kind of an imminent threat from Iraq," Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said after the defense secretary spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld indicated during a Pentagon briefing Tuesday that the
administration has information to support its claim that Iraq is
close to developing nuclear weapons. But Feinstein said: "I can find
nothing that Iraq has a present-day nuclear capability."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said Wednesday that CIA Director George J. Tenet would
soon present the Senate with intelligence information about the Iraqi
weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers defended the administration's position.</TE>
<TE>   "We have plenty of reason to believe [Hussein] has now chemical
and biological weapons," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.). "We have a great deal of information indicating that he is
working on the ability to have nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   In preparing their plan to confront such threats, Bush
administration officials are considering proposals for requiring Iraq
to submit to what they are calling "extremely aggressive" weapons
inspections or face military action. Such a program would provide
inspection teams with thousands of U.S. troops or soldiers from a
multinational force as backup in or near Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A failure by Iraq to cooperate completely with the inspection
teams could help Bush's effort to win international support for a
confrontation with Hussein, and result in a military attack.</TE>
<TE>   Weapons inspectors, mandated in the wake of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, were pulled out of Iraq in 1998 ahead of U.S. airstrikes, and
the Hussein regime has since blocked their return.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the administration's effort to draw support from
overseas reached to the U.N. development summit in Johannesburg,
South Africa. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met there with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and several other leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to make sure the world understands this threat is
as real as we believe it to be," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he received "a solid expression of support" from heads of
state and other leaders. But after meeting with Powell, Danish Prime
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said it was "vitally important" that
the United States work through the United Nations and not try to oust
Hussein by itself.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has said he has made no decision about what course
to follow, the message he will take to the Congress and the United
Nations grew increasingly evident with his remarks Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Using the blunt, colloquial language he favors when discussing
U.S. enemies, Bush said he will remind the U.N. that "for 11 long
years, Saddam Hussein has sidestepped, crawfished, wheedled out of
any agreement he had made not to harbor, not to develop weapons of
mass destruction, agreements he's made to treat the people within his
country with respect."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to call upon the world to recognize that he is stiffing
the world," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending Bush's meeting with congressional leaders in the
Cabinet Room said the president's preference is that a vote on
supporting action against Iraq occur before Congress breaks in
October.</TE>
<TE>   This would be just weeks before the November elections--putting
political pressure on members of Congress to support the president in
the face of a foe he has presented as a threat to global security.
The entire House and one-third of the Senate are up for election.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) expressed concern that
the timing of the debate would unnecessarily politicize the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There are skeptics out there who wonder to what extent the
political implications of any of this may affect the elections," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bush's decision to seek a congressional vote was an
important first step toward building political support on Capitol
Hill. Such a vote was considered important in early 1991 when the
administration of Bush's father was preparing to go to war with Iraq
over Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Bush appears to face a tougher sell. Lawmakers
returning to Washington from a monthlong recess this week have been
posing a host of questions about the timing, rationale and strategy
of action against Hussein--especially a military strike.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting with Bush, Daschle said, "There has to be a
better case made. The president began making that case today. He
acknowledged that this is just the beginning of a dialogue. But we
certainly have to better understand the threat."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle and others in the meeting with Bush said they did not
believe the president considered a military attack to be a foregone
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not be my assumption that the military course is the
only action available to him today," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) added: "We've
got to now have an argument made to the Congress and the American
people, and it's got to be one that convinces a majority of Americans
that this is something that we need to do. What happens in Iraq after
something happens? How are we going to build a democracy? Who's going
to help with that? What is the strategy for dealing with all of
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Even members of Bush's party--from conservative Sen. Larry E.
Craig of Idaho to moderate Sen. Susan Collins of Maine--have said the
president has yet to make a convincing case for military action.</TE>

<HD>Hanging With the Cranes</HD>
<DH>A renowned glider is teaching an endangered Siberian
species a safer migration route, and picking up a few flying tips on
the long journey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OKA STATE NATURE RESERVE, Russia</DL>
<LD>Lean, light and hawk-profiled, hang-glider Angelo d'Arrigo twitches
with a bird-like intensity and tends to push himself higher, ever
higher, unsatisfied by the bounds of gravity.</LD>
<LD>   So it is no coincidence that D'Arrigo wants to become a bird. Or
at least as close to one as is humanly possible.</LD>
<LD>   He calls it his five-year "Metamorphosis" project. And as part of
it, he is embarking on one of the most ambitious--and
unusual--wildlife rescue plans ever devised. Russian scientists and
the U.S.-based International Crane Foundation have tapped D'Arrigo to
help them rescue the western Siberian crane from extinction.</LD>
<TE>   This elegant, long-limbed and long-lived bird has been ravaged by
a shrinking habitat and hunting, especially a tiny subgroup of an
endangered crane population that has been risking the combat zone of
Afghanistan on its annual migration from north of the Arctic Circle
to its wintering place in a national park in India.</TE>
<TE>   In the wild, fewer than 20 of the western Siberian cranes are
left. The scientists believe that D'Arrigo may prove the cranes'
salvation by steering them instead to the highlands of Iran near the
Caspian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, at the onset of the Arctic winter, D'Arrigo began
leading 10 cranes bred in captivity on a new migration route. Soaring
like a bird--without an engine--he will take them on a 3,400-mile
journey following several Russian rivers that provide wetlands where
the cranes can feed.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time world champion hang glider, retired from active
competition, has devoted himself to studying birds--mostly
raptors--trying to learn from them the secrets of unassisted flight.</TE>
<TE>   Like the mythological Icarus, he intends to soar on the winds over
mountain, sea and valley using the sun and the air currents as his
engine. If he succeeds, it will be the longest human flight in the
history of free flying.</TE>
<TE>   And in the process, scientists plan for him to teach his charges,
the Siberian cranes, a new, safer migration route that avoids
Afghanistan and Pakistan--where they fall victim to the abundant guns
in the hands of tribal fighters--and which would then, scientists
hope, be passed on from parent to fledgling for generations of cranes
to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The attempt to change the migration route is truly an
innovation," said Russian ornithologist Tatyana Zhuchkova, who is
helping to raise the cranes bred in captivity at this nature reserve
230 miles southeast of Moscow. "It has never been done before."</TE>
<TE>   At the reserve, the hatchling cranes--now about 110 days old--were
"imprinted" to view D'Arrigo, wraparound sunglasses and all, as their
parent. They were raised under the wings of his hang glider and
received their food from him and other white-suited keepers.</TE>
<TE>   Each day they saw him flying like an adult crane, riding on the
thermal currents about them, and then landing with the same easy
grace as a real crane. They were also taught to be at home with the
sound of his 12-pound motor, which he requires only to take off or in
an emergency when he cannot find the needed currents to keep him
aloft. ("Unfortunately, I cannot flap," he said. "Maybe someday it
will be possible.")</TE>
<TE>   Working with him is a small corps of dedicated Russian naturalists
like Zhuchkova, the ornithologist, who can't help admiring the
species.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very intelligent birds," she said. "Each has its own
character and cast of mind and its own behavioral patterns. They have
their own tastes, preferences, likes and dislikes. They know where
they want to walk, what they want to eat and what they don't want to
do.</TE>
<TE>   "When they are little they are funny and their intellectual level
is not that high.... When they grow up they become totally,
absolutely independent individuals."</TE>
<TE>   The young birds raised at the breeding center are far from that
stage. For now, they need D'Arrigo to lead them on their migratory
quest, and the benefit for him, he said, is to learn to live and
think like a bird.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time on the migration, D'Arrigo explained in an
interview here, his motor will be hauled back into his harness and
his propellers folded back to look like black tail feathers. The
set-up leaves him to glide only with his nylon and aluminum wings,
which have been crafted to mimic the flying profile of the cranes.</TE>
<TE>   The trans-Siberian migration is similar to the ultralight flights
between Wisconsin and Florida by the International Crane Foundation
to rescue the American whooping crane, but it is three times longer.
(And an ultralight journey to teach orphaned Canada geese to migrate
from Canada to North Carolina was the plot of the movie "Fly Away
Home.") By employing unassisted flight rather than an ultralight
airplane, D'Arrigo intends to make it easier on the young birds to
keep up and not exhaust them on the lengthy voyage.</TE>
<TE>   Each night, D'Arrigo will land with the birds, and each morning
take off with them behind, in a leisurely journey expected to last up
to 40 days.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Mirande, director of the International Crane Foundation,
based in Baraboo, Wis., is enthusiastic. She sees the flight as the
best hope to save the western Siberian crane, a graceful bird with a
6-foot wingspan, and the foundation and its patrons have come up with
the funding for the effort.</TE>
<TE>   For the past decade, Russian scientists have been raising the
birds in captivity and then in the fall taking them to live in the
wilds of Siberia. But the short Arctic summer means that the birds
hardly have time to mature before they face the difficult test of
survival in making the lengthy journey.</TE>
<TE>   "The birds [raised in captivity] learn to survive and start to
migrate, but then there is a very, very low rate of seeing the birds
again," Mirande said. "Our success rate is lower than we need to
sustain the population, and that is why we are trying something so
crazy." To make it, she said, "they just need that extra parental
supervision."</TE>
<TE>   The 200-square-mile crane reserve is along the Oka River, a
winding tributary of the Volga. A wide range of biologists and
botanists drive down from Moscow to work here.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit in July, the two white wings of D'Arrigo's glider
shimmered in the breeze across a sea of tall grasses that sheltered
the pen where the crane chicks were being raised.</TE>
<TE>   Tape players emitted recordings of the feeding sounds of Siberian
cranes, interspersed with the sound of a working engine so that the
birds learned not to be afraid. Twice a day, D'Arrigo stepped into
his hang-glider harness and walked among them, handing out food to
the still gangly fledglings who had not yet managed more than a few
hops off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Walking among them were other staff of the breeding center,
dressed in white hoods and knee-length white tunics, a rough
approximation of a crane's plumage. Occasionally they flapped their
arms, and the young cranes followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   The area is strictly off-limits to the public, and visitors to the
site are allowed to observe the cranes only from a distance of about
100 yards, hidden behind camouflage netting.</TE>
<TE>   "We will handpick the best for the migration," said one of the
biologists at the Oka reserve. "Our job is to change their mental
imprinting and orient it toward the hang glider."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 10 birds raised, only six were chosen for the flight.</TE>
<TE>   D'Arrigo, his flying crew and the Russian scientists teaching the
cranes to regard him as their parent lived for months in a small,
shaded lodge about half a mile away. The 40-year-old D'Arrigo--whose
mother was French and father Italian--has been hang gliding since he
was 16, when he first spotted a glider jumping off a mountain while
he was at a competition on the French national ski team.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work for a shop manufacturing hang gliders--taking no
salary in exchange for the promise that he would be able to build his
own glider.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to take part in hang-gliding competitions, and set
world records in time and distance for free flight. But it was not
without danger.</TE>
<TE>   His worst crash came several years ago, when he flew into a
20,000-volt high-tension wire. The landing broke his back, and for
six months he was paralyzed below the waist because of pressure on
his spinal cord. He wasn't sure that he would ever walk again.</TE>
<TE>   "In these six months, I came to understand what I wanted from
life," he said in his accented English. "And I wanted only one point:
to fly again."</TE>
<TE>   D'Arrigo lives on the slopes of the volcano Mt. Etna in Sicily
with his wife and two children. He became obsessed with the idea of
replicating a bird's flight after an experience in which an eagle
came to fly beside him, unafraid, while he was spiraling up among the
Alps.</TE>
<TE>   He was intrigued enough to buy a baby steppe eagle from a breeding
center in England and raise it on Mt. Etna. He lived with the eagle
chick, and in time he taught her to hunt and to fly.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the eagle--he called her Nike, for the winged goddess of
victory--was clumsy.</TE>
<TE>   "At the start, she would crash on trees, on the rocks. For many
days, I have some problems to teach this eagle to fly. But I have a
school of flight in Italy, and I can say this eagle is my best
student. In two weeks she flies like me," he said. "We take and catch
thermals and spend every day two or three hours together."</TE>
<TE>   The student soon became a teacher. D'Arrigo said that in time, he
realized that the eagle, using her instincts, was more adept at
finding the upward drafts than he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I think inside any person, there remains one part of birds," he
said. "Maybe it is possible to find in my mind this little part....
Maybe I make a long flight using only my senses."</TE>
<TE>   His experience raising Nike, and taking her on her first migration
from Sicily to southern Tunisia, brought D'Arrigo to the attention of
Dr. Alexander Sorokin, Russia's leading crane expert. He contacted
D'Arrigo and asked if he might be willing to also lead a migration of
cranes. D'Arrigo flew to Russia to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "It just clicked," said Mirande of the crane foundation.</TE>
<TE>   This year the birds were flown and helicoptered in mid-August to
the Arctic breeding grounds. On Aug. 26, with a winter storm front
expected and other species of cranes in the area starting to migrate,
D'Arrigo decided it was time to take off.</TE>
<TE>   So far, according to the notes posted on D'Arrigo's Web site
(http://www.angelodarrigo.com), they have covered more than 300
miles. The weather is difficult, but everything is going according to
plan, "though the hardest parts are still ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The Siberian crane is one of 15 crane species in the world.
According to Mirande, 11 of them are threatened, and the Siberian
crane--especially its western variety--is the closest to extinction.</TE>
<TE>   There are two populations of Siberian cranes, the eastern and
western. Although they are genetically identical, they do not overlap
in the wild and are separated by hundreds of miles. Although there
are an estimated 3,000 eastern Siberian cranes, their numbers also
are dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   If the western Siberian crane were to die out, the eastern cranes
would be the only population left, making the species' continued
existence all the more precarious, Zhuchkova said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the western Siberian crane population has been flying to
Iran, considered by far the safer locale for the birds because it
does not necessitate crossing Afghanistan. Mirande said the current
project aims to redirect the rest to a preferred nesting area in Iran
near the Caspian Sea that is off-limits to hunters, ironically,
because it is reserved for duck trapping. So although the ducks there
are in danger, she said, the much larger Siberian cranes will be safe
from firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting the cranes is an investment in longevity. Scientists
don't know exactly how long the birds would live if not disturbed by
humans, Zhuchkova said, but one Siberian crane was known to have been
older than 80.</TE>
<TE>   "When we raise toasts here," she said of her co-workers at the
breeding center, "we wish that all of us live as long as our cranes
do."</TE>

<HD>2 Palestinians in West Bank Are Exiled by Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The pair, accused of aiding their brother in an
attack, are left in a remote Gaza Strip vineyard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Clutching a zippered wallet and a small Koran, and with the dust of
the Gaza Strip smudging her black head scarf, Intisar Ajouri stood on
the sidewalk here Wednesday, exiled by Israel and looking for refuge
at the Red Cross.</LD>
<LD>   Intisar and her brother Kifah were expelled from the West Bank
after Israel accused them of assisting another brother in a suicide
bombing in July. An Israeli army vehicle dumped them in a remote
vineyard.</LD>
<LD>   In a landmark decision, the Israeli Supreme Court this week ruled
that Israel can "relocate" the relatives of suspected militants if
there is evidence that the family members were accomplices and pose a
security threat.</LD>
<TE>   Saying the measure serves as a deterrent, Israel previously has
expelled people it regarded as terrorists but, until now, never their
family.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan joined
human rights groups in condemning such expulsions as a violation of
international law.</TE>
<TE>   The Ajouris, who lived in a refugee camp in the West Bank city of
Nablus, said the army placed them blindfolded and handcuffed in an
armored personnel carrier, drove them deep into the Gaza Strip and
dropped them off in an orchard.</TE>
<TE>   They walked until they found a farmer, who warned them that they
were within shooting range of nearby Jewish settlers and soldiers--in
an area, in fact, where an Israeli tank shell killed four Palestinian
civilians last month.</TE>
<TE>   "They just threw us away in the grape groves," Intisar Ajouri said
in an interview. "If we had gone just a few steps the other way, we
would have been in serious danger."</TE>
<TE>   The Ajouris said they went to a nearby house where the family gave
them tea. Later, they were picked up by journalists and taken to the
offices of a Palestinian human rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   Intisar Ajouri, 34, insisted again that she is innocent, saying
that if Israel could prove its allegation that she sewed the
explosive belts for suicide bombers then the state should have put
her on trial and convicted her.</TE>
<TE>   "They are doing this to threaten people, to frighten people and to
break their will," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She and Kifah, a father of three, said they planned to stay with
the International Committee of the Red Cross as a protest symbolizing
their refusal to recognize Israel's right to expel them. The pair,
who are to remain in exile for two years, spent their first night in
Gaza at the agency's offices.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities staged an elaborate operation to avoid
journalists and slip the Ajouris into Gaza. A convoy of military
vehicles transported the pair from a prison in the West Bank to the
Gaza Strip but sent a decoy vehicle through the main entrance at Erez
crossing, where dozens of journalists waited.</TE>
<TE>   The personnel carrier transporting the Ajouris then went over back
roads and entered Gaza near the settlement of Netzarim. When
journalists at Erez caught wind of the ruse, they made a high-speed
dash through the chaotic streets of Gaza to reach the Ajouris.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the siblings were already wandering in the Gaza
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said such efforts were necessary because they
were concerned that the Ajouris would resist being deported or make a
scene, and Palestinian officials were saying they would not accept
the pair. The Israeli army gave the siblings the equivalent of about
$215 each and a change of clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaza Strip--fenced in and cut off by the army--is considered a
prison by many of its more than 1 million residents, and there is
little if any travel between the area and the West Bank. Expulsion
from one to the other removes a Palestinian from his or her extended
family in what is a clan-based society.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and some Israeli human rights activists said they
fear the army will use the court's sanctions to carry out large-scale
deportations.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show wide support among the Israeli public, however, for
expulsions and other tough measures aimed at crushing a 23-month-old
Palestinian uprising and ending a wave of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court, meeting as an expanded nine-judge panel,
apparently took public opinion into consideration while weighing both
security issues and concern for human rights.</TE>
<TE>   The decision "created a sense that the court understands the
feelings and needs of the security establishment, and certainly
understands the mood of the public that gnashes its teeth at the wave
of suicide bombers," commentator Eitan Haber, a former aide to late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, wrote in an editorial Wednesday. "Its
ruling was in the style of the Jewish folk tale: 'kosher, but
stinks.' "</TE>
<TE>   In another development Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon hinted at what he called a "breakthrough" in efforts aimed at
reviving a long-dead peace process. He also said he plans to meet
with a high-level Palestinian in the coming days, his first such
encounter since taking office 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, for the first time, I see the possibility for a breakthrough
for a political settlement," Sharon told Israeli television. "It
won't be a simple thing or an easy thing, but there is a
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The reason, he said, is a change of heart among the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the beginnings of cracks on the Palestinian side," he said
earlier in the day, "possibly the dawning of the recognition that
Israel cannot be defeated by force."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials dismissed Sharon's speculation.</TE>

<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Wednesday that his people don't
want a war, but he vowed that they would defeat any U.S. military
action to oust his government.</LD>
<LD>   "Your brothers in Iraq wish that God would spare them evil and
avoid fighting," Hussein told a group of Arab representatives
gathered in Baghdad to show their opposition to a possible U.S.
military strike.</LD>
<LD>   "If God chooses that we have to fight, we won't disappoint you,"
he said. "We will fight them in a way that will please you and annoy
[the] enemies."</LD>
<TE>   He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein said earlier that Iraq wants an overall solution, based on
United Nations Security Council resolutions, to its crisis with the
U.S., which is centered on Baghdad's alleged production of weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 representatives from all Arab states except Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia capped a meeting in Baghdad on Wednesday by opposing
the threat of U.S. military action against Iraq and calling for the
lifting of the sanctions imposed on the nation for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Lawmaker Sentenced for Graft</HD>
<DH>Asia: The conviction is a rarity for the country, despite
its reputation for corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The speaker of parliament was convicted Wednesday and sentenced to
three years in prison for stealing $4.5 million intended for the poor
and using the money in a political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Akbar Tanjung's conviction marked one of the few times that an
official has been found guilty of such a crime in Indonesia, which is
widely viewed as one of the world's most corrupt countries.</LD>
<LD>   Tanjung, who heads the formerly ruling Golkar Party, denied
stealing and said he would appeal. He remains free and continues to
hold his leadership positions.</LD>
<TE>   "If someone is convicted, that doesn't mean that his political
career is gone," he said. "I never committed a crime."</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that the three-year prison term was too light.
Prosecutors had asked for the minimum sentence of four years provided
by law. Tanjung could have received 20 years. But the five-judge
panel chose instead to impose an even lower sentence, citing
mitigating circumstances, including the return of the money this year
by a co-defendant who said he had kept it at home.</TE>
<TE>   Tanjung was found guilty of diverting the money while serving as a
Cabinet secretary in 1999. The money was intended for use by a
charity group to feed the needy after the Asian economic collapse of
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Amiruddin Zakaria, the presiding judge, said Tanjung had "damaged
the government's credibility, misused an Islamic foundation and
caused suffering for the poor."</TE>
<TE>   Two associates connected with the charity, Dadang Sukandar and
Winfried Simatupang, also were found guilty and were sentenced to 18
months in prison each.</TE>
<TE>   Tanjung's party is the second largest in parliament and part of
the coalition supporting President Megawati Sukarnoputri.</TE>
<TE>   The court may have done Megawati a favor. Tanjung could have been
a rival to the president in elections scheduled for 2004. With court
appeals likely to continue for months or even years, it is unlikely
his reputation will recover from the stain of a corruption
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Indonesia's Tempo magazine before the verdict
was announced, Zakaria insisted that the judges were not concerned
with the politics of the case and that there had been no outside
interference.</TE>
<TE>   "I assure you and the public, there's no intervention from
anybody," he said. "This is truly just."</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey by Transparency International concluded that
Indonesia was perceived as the sixth-most-corrupt nation among more
than 150 listed, with Bangladesh labeled the worst offender.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesian judiciary itself is widely viewed as corrupt, and
recent cases have done nothing to dispel that image.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the high court overturned the graft conviction of
former Bank of Indonesia Gov. Syahril Sabirin.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Zakaria was the presiding judge of a panel that sentenced
Hutomo Mandala Putra, the son of former President Suharto, to 15
years in prison for masterminding the assassination of a Supreme
Court judge who refused a bribe.</TE>
<TE>   The slain judge had been handling the trial of Hutomo, who is
widely known as Tommy, on corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   Rights activists were angered last month when a court acquitted
six military and police officers charged with orchestrating some of
the worst violence in the former separatist province of East Timor.</TE>

<HD>Fans, Activists Aghast at Proposal to Kill Keiko</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OSLO</DL>
<LD>A Norwegian whale expert's suggestion to kill Keiko--star of the
"Free Willy" movies--has outraged activists and the whale's fans.</LD>
<LD>   Keiko turned up in a fiord in western Norway last weekend, six
weeks after being released from his pen in Iceland, where experts had
spent years helping the killer whale make the transition from life in
captivity to life in the wild. Keiko swam nearly 870 miles to reach
the fiord.</LD>
<LD>   A leading whale expert, Nils Oeien, claimed that Keiko has little
chance of surviving a winter in the cold Norwegian fiords.</LD>
<TE>   "Then it would be better to put him to death," Oeien said in an
interview broadcast by Norwegian state radio. He could not be reached
for more comment.</TE>
<TE>   Activists denounced the suggestion. Dag Paulsen, a spokesman for
the Norwegian Fisheries Ministry, said killing Keiko is not an
option.</TE>

<HD>Sri Lanka Ends Ban on Tamil Guerrillas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka</DL>
<LD>The Sri Lankan government lifted its ban on the Tamil Tiger rebels
Wednesday, paving the way for peace talks to end the island nation's
19-year civil war.</LD>
<LD>   Given the midnight hour of the lifting of the 4-year-old ban on
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was no immediate reaction
in Colombo, the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Minister Thilak Marapana told the Cabinet that he used his
powers to end the ban, meeting a key rebel demand ahead of peace
talks scheduled for Sept. 16 in Thailand.</LD>
<TE>   The Tamil Tigers, who are on the U.S. State Department's list of
terrorist organizations, had demanded that the ban against them be
lifted, saying they would not come to the negotiating table as an
outlawed group. The U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka, E. Ashley Wills,
has said Washington will not lift its ban anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to lift the ban on the rebel group had been on the rise
since Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed office after his
alliance won Dec. 5 elections. President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who
is elected separately, has demanded that the ban stay in place until
talks show solid progress. Kumaratunga's stance has put her at odds
with Wickremesinghe, and the rivalry has threatened to mar the peace
process.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Buddhist monks and opposition Marxist party
supporters took to the streets protesting plans to lift the ban.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have been fighting for a homeland, claiming that the
country's 3.2 million Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, suffer
discrimination by the 14 million mainly Buddhist Sinhalese. More than
64,000 people have been killed in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel group was banned after an attack on a Buddhist shrine in
1998 that killed 26 people and outraged the Sinhalese majority.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodshed ended after the government and the rebels signed a
Norwegian-brokered cease-fire agreement Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, both sides have implemented several
confidence-building measures--under the watchful eyes of Scandinavian
monitors.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the government lifted 7-year-old economic sanctions on
areas held by the rebels and allowed trucks to head to the northern
jungles, carrying goods ranging from sugar to fertilizers.</TE>
<TE>   It also reopened a highway linking rebel-held areas with the rest
of the island and allowed sea passage to rebels traveling from north
to east.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Text of President Bush's letter on Iraq, sent Wednesday to members of
Congress:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   America and the civilized world face a critical decision in the
months ahead. The decision is how to disarm an outlaw regime that
continues to possess and develop weapons of mass destruction, despite
its own promises over the last decade and despite the condemnation of
the world. Since Sept. 11, we have been tragically reminded that we
are vulnerable to evil people. And this vulnerability increases
dramatically when evil people have access to weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<TE>   I know members of Congress agree that Saddam Hussein's regime is
still a threat to peace, as it was when you passed the Iraq
Liberation Act of 1998. I also know members of the United Nations are
angry that this regime continues to thumb its nose at the world,
defying at least 16 U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted between
1990 and 1999 that require Iraq to disarm and give up weapons of mass
destruction, to stop threatening its neighbors, and to stop
oppressing the Iraqi people.</TE>
<TE>   America intends to lead the way to make certain that the Saddam
Hussein regime is not able to threaten anyone in the world with the
world's most devastating weapons.</TE>
<TE>   I am in the process of deciding how to proceed. This is an
important decision that must be made with great thought and care.
Therefore, I welcome and encourage discussion and debate. The
Congress will hold hearings on Iraq this month, and I have asked
members of my administration to participate fully.</TE>
<TE>   Doing nothing in the face of a grave threat to the world is not an
option. At an appropriate time and after consultations with the
leadership, I will seek congressional support for U.S. action to do
whatever is necessary to deal with the threat posed by Saddam
Hussein's regime. The Congress can play an important role in building
a national consensus for action.</TE>
<TE>   The international community must also be involved. I have asked
Prime Minister Blair to visit America this week to discuss Iraq. I
will also reach out to President Chirac of France, President Putin of
Russia, President Jiang of China, and other world leaders.</TE>
<TE>   I will have these discussions in advance of next week's meeting of
the United Nations General Assembly in New York. At that meeting, I
will discuss the challenge that the current Iraqi regime represents
to the United Nations and the entire international community.</TE>
<TE>   My administration remains committed to the regime change policy
enshrined in the Iraq Liberation Act. The world must address how the
Iraqi people can be liberated from the bondage in which the regime
holds them and realize a better future for their children.</TE>
<TE>   We must not allow an outlaw regime that incites and uses terror at
home and abroad to threaten the world by developing the ultimate
weapons of terror. The months ahead will be important ones and the
civilized world must come together to deal with the threat posed by
the Iraqi regime.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JANI KHEL, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Pakistani troops launched an attack Wednesday against
villagers sheltering eight suspected Al Qaeda fighters, shelling the
house of a Muslim cleric.</LD>
<LD>   The attack began after sundown against the village of Jani Khel,
about 125 miles southwest of Peshawar in western Pakistan, after
villagers refused to hand over the suspected members of the terrorist
network. No casualties were reported.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening minutes of the operation, troops shelled the house
of cleric Maulana Shams Haq and arrested his two brothers. The cleric
was at large, officials said. Soldiers sealed off roads leading into
the village and ordered journalists to leave the area.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of Pakistani soldiers were sent to the village Monday
after residents gave sanctuary to the suspects, who had been stopped
at a checkpoint near the Afghan border the day before.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani security guards had arrested the suspects Sunday four
miles from Jani Khel, but villagers ambushed the troops and freed the
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the men were believed to be Middle Easterners who
had crossed into Pakistan from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers insisted that the fugitives weren't members of Al
Qaeda but had been associated with the former Taliban regime in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, a village elder, Nasir Khan, said the villagers
would refuse to turn over "our guests to their enemy," meaning the
Pakistani army, and that they were ready to fight to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan is a key supporter of the U.S.-led war against terrorism
and so far has handed over to U.S. authorities more than 300
suspected members of Al Qaeda arrested in the border region and
several cities.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Navy is chartering a commercial ship to send tanks and other
cargo to the Persian Gulf in what officials said Wednesday is a
routine rotation of equipment to protect Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   It is the third time in a month that the U.S. Military Sealift
Command is known to have chartered a ship for the shipping of
weaponry and other equipment to the region.</LD>
<LD>   Command spokeswoman Marge Holtz said private ships are used dozens
of times a year, but reports of the two shipments in August raised
speculation--denied by the Pentagon--that the shipments were part of
a military buildup in the region ahead of an invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the equipment in those shipments was for
long-planned military exercises in the region.</TE>
<TE>   As President Bush pressed his argument Wednesday for overthrowing
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Pentagon again played down the
idea that the shipment is related to preparation for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   They said general cargo, 70 tracked vehicles such as tanks and an
unannounced amount of rolling stock such as trucks were being sent
for arrival this month as part of the normal rotation of equipment
into and out of Kuwait.</TE>

<HD>Powell Is Jeered at World Summit</HD>
<DH>Africa: Environmental activists criticize U.S. resistance
to specific targets and timetables, and Bush's decision not to attend
the conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Interrupted by jeers, boos and chants of "shame on Bush," Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell on Wednesday gamely attempted to defend U.S.
programs to reduce global warming and help the world's poor.</LD>
<LD>   The disruption came during the final day of a U.N. summit on
development here and was the noisiest protest inside the convention
hall during the 10-day conference. The commotion, started by
environmental activists, spread into the ranks of delegates, who were
frustrated by President Bush's decisions to withdraw from an
international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases and to not attend the
gathering of world leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you, I have now heard you. I ask that you hear me," Powell
said, breaking off from his prepared speech.</LD>
<TE>   South Africa's foreign minister banged her gavel, trying to bring
the crowd under control. U.N. police hustled half a dozen protesters
in suits and ties out of the main convention hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, can we continue our meeting?" asked Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma. "This behavior is totally unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials said the outburst illustrated how what they called
the Bush administration's go-it-alone policies on the environment are
viewed as out of step with much of the world.</TE>
<TE>   T-shirts showed up at the gathering with the printed question:
"What are we going to do about the United States?"</TE>
<TE>   The head of the British delegation, America's closest ally, issued
a statement pleading for international comity. "How can we ever
persuade the U.S. to act more multilaterally if whatever they do is
attacked?" asked Margaret Beckett, Britain's lead delegate. "Nations
are like people. They react better to the carrot of approval than to
the stick of abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The protest was a noisy distraction on a busy concluding day of
the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which the United Nations
sponsored to bring together more than 100 heads of state and
government to tackle twin issues of reducing poverty while protecting
the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday evening, exhausted delegates quit their quibbling
over language and gave their blessing to a political declaration and
a 65-page implementation plan that contains hundreds of goals and
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the goals focus on reducing poverty and human suffering by
providing clean water, sanitation and energy to some of the poorest
regions of the world. Others aim to phase out cancer-causing
chemicals, reduce fossil fuel emissions responsible for global
warming or slow the number of species lost to extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental and human relief organizations on Wednesday piled on
complaints that the plan doesn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very disappointed in the outcome of the summit," said
Paul Joffe, international affairs director of the National Wildlife
Federation. "It's a sad commentary on the lack of leadership,
compared to previous generations."</TE>
<TE>   Although U.N. officials were pleased that the summit elevated key
issues, even Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted that expectations
were perhaps too high. "We didn't get everything we wanted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations sponsored the summit here a decade after the
first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The Rio gathering was widely
credited for focusing the world's attention on pressing environmental
and poverty matters. But many have been disappointed that so little
progress has been made since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The Johannesburg summit was called to set up a plan to implement
the many goals outlined at Rio. Environmental groups and delegates in
Europe pushed for specific targets and timetables as performance
measures to keep governments on track.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. delegation successfully resisted some of those
targets, saying the Bush administration would prefer to see action on
existing goals before setting new ones.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of new commitments, the United States rolled out a series
of partnerships that bring together governments, nonprofit groups,
businesses and international agencies to tackle specific issues.</TE>
<TE>   Powell spent a good portion of Wednesday promoting these ideas.
Under heavy guard at a private college near the summit site in
Johannesburg, he talked up the partnership between African nations
and the American Forest &amp; Paper Assn. to protect one of the last
great tropical forests in the Congo Basin. He held a separate
ceremony before television cameras to highlight a U.S. partnership
with Japan to begin bringing clean water and sanitation to the 2
billion people who have neither.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the challenge facing us is enormous," said Japanese
Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi, "I believe that the U.S. and
Japan, the two largest economies of the world, can make a difference
if we act together."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials are enthusiastic about the partnerships as a means
of chipping away at seemingly insurmountable problems.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have been vague on specifics about
the programs, especially about financial commitments, causing many
environmental and human relief groups to dismiss these partnerships
as merely recycled dollars and programs.</TE>
<TE>   That criticism, in turn, has brought attention back to why the
administration fought so hard against global targets in the
implementation plan, such as the European proposal that 15% of the
world's energy supplies should come from renewable wind and solar
sources by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   All this seemed to feed into Wednesday's disruption of what has
otherwise been a polite conference.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it was spontaneous anger after 10 days of negotiations
in which the United States has sought to weaken the implementation
plan and water it down," said Tony Juniper, British director of the
nonprofit group Friends of the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The protest erupted when Powell defended the safety of genetically
modified grain, a hot-button issue in Africa. It quickly escalated
when he brought up the topic of global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is taking action to meet environmental
challenges, including climate change," Powell said, his words drowned
out by catcalls and whistles. "We are committed--not just to
rhetoric--to a billion-dollar program to mitigate greenhouse gas
emissions."</TE>
<TE>   It took Powell a couple of tries to complete this sentence over
the increasing volume that included a slow, rhythmic clapping that
spread from the activists into the ranks of delegates.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration angered environmentalists by pulling out
of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set up targets for reducing
greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Brune, of the Rainforest Action Network in San Francisco,
said he planned a silent protest holding up a banner that read,
"Betrayed by Government." But U.N. police grabbed the banner and
forcibly escorted him from the building--all caught on worldwide
television. Others soon followed.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters hours later, Powell characterized the summit
as a "successful effort" that allowed the U.S. to showcase its
commitment to reducing poverty and protecting the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "Activist hecklers always get a bit of attention," Powell said.
"But I was more impressed by the reaction I got from my fellow
ministers as I had bilateral discussions as well as when I passed
through the hallways."</TE>

<HD>Car Sales at Highest Level in 10 Months</HD>
<DH>Automobiles: The August figures beat forecasts as consumers
make use of incentives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM BROWN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S. auto sales surged to their highest level in 10 months in August
as consumers shrugged off fears about the economy and seized on
interest-free loans and hefty rebates to buy new cars and trucks.</LD>
<LD>   With all major auto makers reporting results Wednesday, sales rose
13.2% compared with August 2001, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 18.7 million vehicles, well above analysts' forecasts of about
17.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   The annual rate was the highest since an all-time record of 21.3
million in October.</LD>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, raised its
earnings targets and production forecasts after reporting an 18.2%
gain in August sales, excluding its Saab brand and some heavy trucks.</TE>
<TE>   GM earlier in the day upped the ante in Detroit's price war by
adding new incentives, including interest-free loans, on many of its
2003 models.</TE>
<TE>   The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler reported the highest August
sales increase of any Detroit auto maker, with a rise of 23.6% over a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Even No. 2 Ford Motor Co., which has suffered a sharp drop in
sales nearly every month this year, said its sales rose 8.2%,
excluding heavy trucks and foreign brands Jaguar, Land Rover and
Volvo.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike GM, Ford said it expected to post lower production in the
fourth quarter compared with the same period last year, and there are
growing concerns about its efforts to return to profitability after a
$5.45-billion loss last year.</TE>
<TE>   Generous financing incentives and cash rebates have helped sustain
auto sales, which account for about one-fifth of U.S. retail sales.
But discounting has cut into razor-thin profit margins at Ford, which
booked just $38 in profit for every vehicle it sold in North America
in the second quarter. That contrasts with $529 at Chrysler and $800
at GM, which has held the momentum on incentives since it introduced
no-interest financing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to stay aggressive," Paul Ballew, GM's chief of industry
analysis, said in a conference call. "We're playing to win, and that
requires us to grow this business and reach out to customers we've
lost over the past couple of decades."</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler said Wednesday that it was matching GM's deal on most of
its 2003 models, and analysts said Ford probably would follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign auto makers, including Detroit's key Japanese rivals,
reported double-digit U.S. sales gains in August, with Toyota Motor
Corp. posting a 13.2% increase. Honda Motor Co. was up 12.9%, and
Nissan Motor Co. posted a 19.8% gain.</TE>
<TE>   Import auto makers, led by the Japanese and South Koreans, have
been waging an intensifying battle for U.S. market share, with the
largest Japanese companies keeping incentives to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Among luxury foreign nameplates, the biggest winners were Land
Rover and Jaguar, both of which are owned by Ford and have surged on
the back of new U.S. vehicle launches this year.</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the few current bright spots for Ford, which was
founded in 1903 and reported selling its 150-millionth vehicle in
August. It also reported record sales of its Explorer sport utility
vehicle in the month, with 51,000 units moving through dealerships,
thanks to high incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the slide in confidence over the summer and the weakish
labor markets, consumer spending is resilient," said Ford's senior
U.S. economist, Jarlath Costello.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is likely to grow in the 2.5% range in the second
half of the year, while most fundamentals for vehicle buying--mainly
interest rates and low inflation and good income growth--remain very
supportive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Ford shares rose 11 cents to
$11.05, DaimlerChrysler gained $1.65 to $41.52, and GM rose 25 cents
to $45.75.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann's First-Half Profit Rises</HD>
<DH>Media: Earnings at the German company more than double on
sale of AOL Europe stake. The firm plans to focus on its BMG music
unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German media conglomerate Bertelsmann reported Tuesday that its
first-half profit more than doubled, owing in part to the sale of its
remaining stake in AOL Europe, but said it plans to retreat from
online ventures and focus on its older businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Bertelsmann, which owns publisher Random House Inc. and record
company BMG, said net income for the first six months of the year
surged to $1.6 billion, up from $575 million for the period a year
earlier. Six-month sales declined to $8.8 billion, down 5% from $9.3
billion a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the profit surge came from proceeds of Bertelsmann's sale
of shares in online service AOL Europe. Profit would have been
higher, but Bertelsmann said it set aside about $1 billion for a
possible write-down of its purchase of Zomba Music Group, which
distributes music by acts such as Britney Spears and 'N Sync.</LD>
<TE>   Bertelsmann is purchasing the remaining 75% stake in Zomba for
about $3 billion as a result of a deal it agreed to a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase is by far the most expensive record label acquisition
in music history, and analysts say the exorbitant price virtually
ensures that Bertelsmann's long-suffering music division, which
appeared poised for a turnaround this year, will be swimming in red
ink for years.</TE>
<TE>   European regulators, who rejected Bertelsmann's planned merger
with rival music company EMI Group last year, signed off on the Zomba
deal Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's financial report came amid an abrupt strategy shift
that began five weeks ago with the unexpected ouster of Chief
Executive Thomas Middelhoff, who had been leading the privately
owned, conservative media giant to invest in emerging technology and
undertake a public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Gunter Thielen, Middelhoff's replacement, said Tuesday that "after
years of dynamic growth and exceptional gains from the Internet
sector, Bertelsmann is now in a brief phase of consolidation."</TE>
<TE>   Thielen's management team has swiftly retreated from much of
Middelhoff's strategy and reportedly is close to selling BOL.com, its
online bookselling unit.</TE>
<TE>   Thielen is expected to put extra pressure on the firm's two
worst-performing operations: the BMG music division, home to such
acts as the Strokes and Christina Aguilera; and DirectGroup, its
direct-marketing arm. Bertelsmann said BMG lost about $44.8 million
in the first six months of the year, while the direct-marketing
operation lost about $118.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   There are already indications Bertelsmann plans to keep a closer
eye on the music division. The company named Thomas Hesse, formerly
Bertelsmann's head of corporate strategy, to the newly created post
of chief strategic officer for the BMG operation.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is devoting special attention to its music business
in view of great uncertainties in the market and radically changing
customer needs," Thielen said.</TE>

<HD>Sunbeam's Dunlap to Settle Charges</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Ex-CEO of appliance maker will pay $500,000
over allegations that he used illegal techniques to hide financial
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Sunbeam Corp. Chief Executive Albert J. Dunlap, known as
"Chainsaw Al" for cutting thousands of jobs in the 1990s before the
appliance maker filed for bankruptcy reorganization, will pay
$500,000 to settle charges he used accounting techniques that hid
Sunbeam's financial problems, regulators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Former Chief Financial Officer Russell Kersh will pay $200,000.
They also were barred from serving as officers or directors of any
public company, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   They did not admit or deny the charges in settling the case and
neither sold Sunbeam stock nor received performance-related bonuses
during the allegedly illegal accounting activity, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   Dunlap already has paid $15 million and Kersh $250,000 to settle a
class-action lawsuit similar to the SEC's.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap's attorney, Frank Razzano, said his client has been living
in retirement for the last four years and the agreement "will allow
him to pursue his retirement and, therefore, is a welcome outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Kersh's lawyer, Jeffrey Tew, pointed to the SEC statement that
said his client did not sell Sunbeam stock, which "differentiates him
from some other executives we've been reading about. I think it's an
important distinction."</TE>
<TE>   The allegedly illegal conduct began toward the end of 1996, when
Kersh and others created inappropriate "cookie jar" accounting
reserves that increased Sunbeam's reported loss for 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The reserves then were used to inflate income in 1997, thus
contributing to the false picture of a rapid turnaround in Sunbeam's
financial health, according to the complaint, filed in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap and Kersh also failed to disclose that Sunbeam's 1997
revenue growth was achieved partly at the expense of future results.</TE>
<TE>   The firm had offered discounts and other incentives to customers
to sell merchandise immediately that otherwise would have been sold
later, a practice known as "channel stuffing," the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The improper accounting and channel stuffing in 1997 created the
prospect of diminished results in 1998, when Dunlap, Kersh and others
took "increasingly desperate measures to conceal the company's
mounting financial problems," regulators added.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Expand Lineup of Limited-Edition Vehicles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co., which has won plaudits from automotive and racing
enthusiasts with high-performance models of some of its most popular
cars and trucks, announced plans Wednesday to expand its lineup of
limited-edition vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the world's second-largest auto maker has limited its
performance upgrades primarily to high-horsepower versions of Ford
brand vehicles, such as the F-150 pickup, the Mustang coupe and the
Focus subcompact.</LD>
<LD>   But the company said it was creating a division, Ford Performance
Group, to design a range of muscle cars and trucks for its Lincoln
and Mercury brands as well. A number of other Ford operations, such
as after-market performance parts and accessory sales, also will
become part of the new group.</LD>
<TE>   Company representatives declined to comment on plans for specific
future products, but industry insiders cited the Lincoln LS sedan and
recently introduced Mercury Marauder as among the most likely
candidates for high-performance editions.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, high-performance and niche vehicles are relatively
low-volume products that can command higher prices. General Motors
Corp. and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler arm also have formed units to
design and build high-performance versions of regular models.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said more than 100,000 cars and trucks produced by its
Special Vehicle Team, as its performance division had been known,
have been sold since the division was created 10 years ago. The
division also will be rolled into Ford's new performance group.</TE>

<HD>Fund Advisor Agrees to Pay $10,000 Settlement</HD>
<DH>Securities: SEC fines Davis Selected Advisers unit for
failing to notify shareholders that its 'IPO flipping' led to gains
in 1999, 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that it has
fined the advisor to the Davis Opportunity mutual fund for failing to
tell shareholders in 1999 and 2000 that the fund was rapidly trading
initial public offerings of stock, a tactic known as "IPO flipping."</LD>
<LD>   Davis Selected Advisers-NY Inc., a unit of Tucson-based Davis
Selected Advisers, agreed to pay $10,000 in settling the civil case
without admitting or denying the charges.</LD>
<LD>   The team-managed fund, then called Davis Growth Opportunity, was
not accused of receiving preferential treatment when it got shares of
182 "hot IPOs," as the SEC called them, during the mania for new tech
stocks that enriched many traders during 1999 and 2000.</LD>
<TE>   But the advisor neglected to disclose that IPO flipping--which is
not illegal--led to a big chunk of the fund's gains during those
years.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis cautioned investors at the time that the fund was
high-risk and its annual reports listed all stock purchases and
sales, it did not specify which trades were in IPO shares, nor did it
discuss the overall effect of IPOs on its performance.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC notes in its cease-and-desist order against Davis that
fund prospectuses said the advisor's investment philosophy was to
purchase "common stock of quality overlooked growth companies at
value prices and to hold them for the long-term."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said the message it is sending to fund companies is clear:
Strategy and performance must be fully disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "By taking this action, the commission is reiterating that an
investment advisor must use reasonable care to ensure that it
adequately discloses to mutual fund shareholders the fund's
investment strategy and the source of investment returns," said
Randall Lee, director of the SEC's Western regional office.</TE>
<TE>   The fund earned $6.7 million by IPO flipping in 1999 and $7.3
million in 2000, the SEC said. The fund, which climbed 31.5% in 1999
and 11.5% in 2000, would have risen 23.4% and 6.1%, respectively,
without the IPO profits, according to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Eich, chief operating officer for Davis Selected Advisers,
said, "There was no intent to deceive. We could have litigated this
matter for two more years, but we chose to take our cease-and-desist
order and get on with our lives."</TE>
<TE>   In two earlier cases involving funds and IPOs, Van Kampen
Investments Inc. in 1999 and Dreyfus Corp. in 2000 reached
settlements with the SEC involving penalties of about $100,000 and $1
million, respectively. In those cases, the fund companies were
accused of misleading advertising for failing to disclose that hot
IPOs pumped up performance of two aggressive funds in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc., said
there were differences between those cases and the one involving
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis is low-profile," Kinnel said. "They weren't hyping their
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one industry critic called the Davis settlement small.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between these cases is nowhere near enough to
justify the markdown for misrepresenting your performance," said
Mercer Bullard, founder of Fund Democracy, which bills itself as an
advocate for fund shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Why under [former SEC Chairman Arthur] Levitt does it cost you
100 grand when under [current Chairman Harvey L.] Pitt it only costs
10? Misleading is misleading, whether it's in the prospectus or a
one-page ad in Money magazine."</TE>

<HD>IRS' E-Filing Partnership With Tax Firms Criticized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four national consumer groups blasted the Internal Revenue Service on
Wednesday for the tax agency's proposed plan to partner with
commercial tax preparers to offer online filing for low-income
taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the plan calls for the service to be offered free, the
consumer groups "look at this as an opportunity for the preparers to
offer other high-cost services on a bait-and-switch basis," said Ed
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group. "We urge the IRS to provide e-filing on its own Web
site."</LD>
<LD>   The IRS said last month that it plans to provide links on its Web
site to connect taxpayers to Web sites operated by tax preparation
firms, such as H&amp;R Block Inc. and Intuit Inc., that have promised to
provide free online filing for at least 60% of taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   The details of which taxpayers will qualify for the free filing
and precisely how the programs would work have not yet been revealed.
The programs will go into effect next year for the 2002 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday was the final day to submit public comments on the IRS
plan, Mierzwinski said. His group, Consumer Federation of America,
Consumers Union and the National Consumer Law Center sent their
criticism of the IRS plan in a joint letter to the agency Wednesday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer groups' main concern is that shuttling taxpayers to
the professional preparation firms will allow those preparers to sell
a variety of expensive services, such as refund anticipation loans
and tax advice, before providing the free part of the
service--electronically transmitting to the IRS a tax form prepared
by the taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Intuit said the firm has not seen the consumer
groups' letter and could not respond immediately. H&amp;R Block couldn't
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS and California's Franchise Tax Board had planned to offer
free online filing directly through government-operated Web sites,
but those plans were nixed in the wake of heavy lobbying from tax
preparers, who said the government shouldn't be competing with
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokesman Victor Omelczenko said the agency's goal in
partnering with the preparers was well-intentioned.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective with this program is to help many more people take
advantage of e-filing with all of its benefits," Omelczenko said.</TE>

<HD>Bargain Hunters Boost Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Despite jitters, buyers are lured by Tuesday's
sharp price drop, helping the market post its biggest one-day gain
since Aug. 19.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks were swept higher Wednesday as buyers waded back into the
market after Tuesday's big washout. But investors remained jittery
amid persistent worries about the strength of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   Just a day earlier, news of weak manufacturing activity drove the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index to its biggest one-day percentage loss
since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. The sharp drop in prices
lured bargain hunters, helping the market post its biggest one-day
gain since Aug. 19.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a lot of stocks that have turned around and traded a
little bit higher after the sell-off," said Tim Smalls, senior equity
trader at SG Cowen. "It's not with any strong conviction; it's just
that you see a little bit of bottom fishing."</LD>
<TE>   There was good news late in the day from car makers, who reported
that August was a another red-hot month for U.S. auto sales.</TE>
<TE>   But investors were on edge in anticipation of a mid-quarter update
due today from tech heavyweight Intel and key U.S. labor market data
due Friday. Wall Street is concerned that a tepid economic rebound
will crimp corporate profits, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 climbed 15.38 points, or 1.8%, to 893.40, after
plunging 4.2% on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrials rose 117.07
points, or 1.4%, to 8,425.12. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index
gained 28.47 points, or 2.3%, to 1,292.31.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading remained on the light side.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of a U.S. military strike against Iraq was on
investors' minds. President Bush said he would call on world leaders
next week at the United Nations to recognize that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein is "stiffing the world" by developing weapons of mass
destruction and that the United States must act.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some optimism that President Bush isn't going to act
unilaterally on going into Iraq," said Todd Clark, head of listed
trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "To the extent that we have a
well-thought-out policy is probably making the markets feel a little
better."</TE>
<TE>   Bargain hunters stepped in to snap up shares of telecom equipment
makers, and chip-related companies staged a rebound despite soggy
results from National Semiconductor and more gloomy analyst calls on
Intel.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies surged 24 cents, or 13%, to $2.03, while rival
Nortel Networks jumped 17 cents, or 17%, to $1.18.</TE>
<TE>   The Amex North American telecom index rose 4.1%.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications helped lift the Dow with a gain of $1.20 to
$24.30.</TE>
<TE>   Intel, the world's largest chip maker, climbed 25 cents to $16.11,
after sinking 5% on Tuesday. Investment banks Merrill Lynch and
Credit Suisse First Boston cut their 2002 and 2003 earnings-per-share
forecasts in advance of the company's financial update today, adding
to Tuesday's bearish call from Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Custom chip maker LSI Logic rose 74 cents, or 11%, to $7.70. The
company unveiled its biggest new-product push in eight years and
stood by earlier guidance that third-quarter revenue will rise about
10% from the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   National Semi posted results that met diminished forecasts, hurt
by a slow personal computer market. Despite the soft results, its
shares reversed early losses to rise 23 cents to $15.20.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar rose against the euro and the Japanese yen. Bond yields
were little changed.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, oil ticked up 48 cents to $28.27 a barrel
after falling 4% on Tuesday. Gold rose $1.50 to $314.90 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose after Glenn Tilton, its new
chief executive, met with union leaders and said bankruptcy is "not a
foregone conclusion." UAL shares surged 56 cents, or 19%, to $3.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotechnology stocks rose. Amgen gained $1.18 to $44.12, and
Biogen added $1.30 to $33. The Nasdaq biotech index rose 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   * After the news of higher auto sales, GM rose 20 cents to $45.75,
Ford rose 11 cents to $11.05, and DaimlerChrysler gained $1.65 to
$41.52.</TE>
<TE>   * Cigna fell $2.65 to $80 the day after it said it would take a
$720-million third-quarter charge to strengthen its reserves for
reinsurance contracts. On Wednesday, Standard &amp; Poor's said it may
reduce Cigna's A+ credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   * Hershey Foods slid after a state judge put the sale of the
company on hold, delivering a setback to a planned auction. The candy
maker fell $3.09 to $72.51.</TE>
<TE>   * Japanese stocks continued to struggle. The Nikkei average
finished down 141.95 points, or 1.5%, at 9,075.09--its lowest close
since Aug. 17, 1983.</TE>

<HD>Motorcar, SEC Reach Tentative Settlement</HD>

<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorcar Parts &amp; Accessories Inc., a Torrance-based auto parts maker,
said Wednesday that it reached a tentative settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which began investigating the
company's financial statements more than two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Motorcar's shares plunged in May 1999 after the company said it
expected to report a large loss for the previous fiscal year. On Aug.
1, 1999, the company said it would have to restate 1997 and 1998
results because of "accounting irregularities." The stock was
suspended for one month by Nasdaq and lost 70% of its value when it
resumed trading Sept. 2, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The company said that, under the terms of the proposed civil
settlement with the SEC, the firm would be subject to a permanent
injunction barring it from violations of the anti-fraud and financial
reporting provisions of securities laws. It was unclear if there
would be a monetary fine.</LD>
<TE>   Motorcar President Anthony Souza did not return a call for comment
Wednesday. Officials at the SEC in Los Angeles said they could not
comment on any tentative settlement. The company said the SEC staff
did not say when the settlement would be put before commissioners for
approval.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Motorcar said the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles
was conducting a criminal investigation of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcar shares closed at $3.05 in the so-called pink sheet market
Wednesday, down 5 cents. The announcement was made after the market
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcar remanufactures alternators and other parts for cars and
light trucks.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Judge Decides Against Madster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The music industry Wednesday won a preliminary injunction against
Madster, an Internet file-swapping service that record labels allege
is used by millions to trade pirated songs.</LD>
<LD>   The order by Chief Judge Marvin Aspen of the U.S. District Court
in Chicago is the latest in a series of legal victories for the
Recording Industry Assn. of America, a group representing more than
two dozen major record labels and media companies.</LD>
<LD>   Aspen said that the RIAA proved Madster users engaged in copyright
infringement and that Madster executives knew or should have known of
the infringement. "Defendants manage to do everything but actually
steal the music off the store shelf and hand it to ... users," Aspen
wrote.</LD>
<TE>   "This unequivocal ruling today underscores that companies and
individuals will not be permitted to build a business on music they
do not own," RIAA Chief Executive Hilary Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   Madster, founded in 1998, has 5 million to 10 million users,
founder Johnny Deep said. Originally known as Aimster, the Albany,
N.Y., company operates a free instant-messaging service that lets
users swap files over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Deep said his company is not capable of monitoring the encrypted
messages that go through the Madster service.</TE>
<TE>   "Every message on our service goes through an envelope so we never
see what's in those messages," Deep said. "How does the post office
prevent bootleg CDs from being mailed in plain envelopes? That's our
problem."</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Aspen ordered the RIAA to propose the wording for a
final injunction. The order mirrors the legal path traveled by
Napster, a controversial file-sharing service that has shut down.</TE>
<TE>   When Napster complained of the difficulty of monitoring its
members' files, the judge in that case refused to allow the service
to continue.</TE>

<LD>ABB Ltd., Europe's largest industrial engineering group, said it will
sell most of its leasing and financing business to U.S. rival General
Electric Co. for $2.3 billion in cash, to reduce its mounting debt
load.</LD>
<LD>   The deal helps the Swiss-Swedish industrial group cut its
$5.2-billion debt to a more manageable $2.9 billion.</LD>
<LD>   For GE, this marks the first major acquisition since splitting its
profit-driving finance arm into four parts in July.</LD>
<TE>   The conglomerate touted the deal for broadening the scope of its
European finance operations and specifically expanding its financing
relationship with Xerox Corp. and its operations in Italy.</TE>

would be shut down for about two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The rack price for regular gasoline, which is a wholesale price

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. said it isn't searching for a
new chief executive to replace Martha Stewart, who founded the media
company.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Times reported that the company began looking for an
executive to replace Stewart, citing people who had been briefed on
the search, after allegations of insider trading led to a plunge in
its stock.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart Living shares have plunged 60% since June 6, the
day before a House panel said it was investigating Stewart's sale of
ImClone Systems Inc. shares.</LD>
<TE>   Given the investigations centering on Stewart, a former
stockbroker and board member of the New York Stock Exchange, the
company would be better off waiting to search for a new chief
executive until after the probes are resolved, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock rose 15 cents to $7.80 in NYSE trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction spending was unchanged in July as single-family-home
building and government projects offset weak commercial development,
the government said.</LD>
<LD>   Outlays for building were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$834.1 billion in July, a statistically insignificant rise from an
upwardly revised $833.8-billion pace in June, the Commerce Department
said.</LD>
<LD>   Nonresidential construction, hit by a lag in business spending,
fell to a $162.1-billion annual rate, the lowest since September
1996.</LD>
<TE>   Residential construction fell to a $408.6-billion pace on a
decline in apartment building and remodeling, but the broader
single-family housing sector rose to a $262.6-billion level, a 0.4%
increase.</TE>

<HD>SEC Reaffirms Fraud Charges Against Execs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission, operating with a full slate
of commissioners, reaffirmed fraud charges against former Waste
Management Inc. executives that first were lodged by a single
commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC revealed its action in a letter Aug. 21 to the federal
judge presiding over the Waste Management case in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The six former Waste Management executives are contesting the
legality of the charges on grounds they were levied by a single
commissioner, Isaac Hunt, violating federal rules. When Hunt voted in
February, the SEC had only three commissioners.</LD>
<TE>   Two of them, Chairman Harvey Pitt and Commissioner Cynthia
Glassman, had conflicts of interest and sat out the vote, leaving
Hunt to bring the charges.</TE>
<TE>   After all five SEC seats were filled, commissioners again voted in
August.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had argued in court that Hunt's vote was proper because
he was acting as a duty officer when he approved the enforcement
action.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleges that the six executives failed to report expenses
on financial statements and postponed costs while they filed false
accounts from 1992 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The agency accused the men of inflating Waste Management's profit
by $1.7 billion in an accounting fraud that cost shareholders about
$6 billion. The executives illegally made $28.5 million, the SEC
alleged.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge blocked any sale of Hershey Foods Corp. without court
approval, after Pennsylvania officials said a sale would cause
"irreparable harm" to the candy maker's home community.</LD>
<LD>   The judge issued a temporary order barring sale of the biggest
U.S. chocolate-candy maker without court approval and notification of
the state attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   The charitable trust that controls Hershey said in July that it
would put the maker of Hershey's Kisses up for sale to diversify its
more than $5 billion in holdings.</LD>
<TE>   One potential buyer is Nestle, which said last week that it hadn't
ruled out making an offer for Hershey.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Hershey Trust spokesman Rick Kelly said the trust is
disappointed with the court's decision and intends to appeal it.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the candy maker declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey shares fell $3.09, or 4.09%, to $72.51 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Semiconductor Corp. swung to a fiscal first-quarter profit
from a loss a year earlier as higher demand from wireless-device
makers offset weak demand in the personal-computer industry.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, National tempered expectations for the current
quarter, forecasting revenue to be little changed to down 5% compared
with the first quarter, below analysts' forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based National Semiconductor posted net income
in the first quarter ended Aug. 25 of $1.3 million, or 1 cent per

<HD>More Companies Raising Dividends</HD>
<DH>Securities: Pickup in increased payouts in July and August
could be sign of sustained upswing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. companies raised cash dividend payments to shareholders at a
brisk pace in August compared with a year earlier, the second
consecutive month of strong year-over-year increases, Standard &amp;
Poor's said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The trend could be a sign that dividends are in a sustained
upswing after more than three years of skimpier payouts by companies.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P said 90 companies raised their dividends last month, up 38%
from the 65 firms that raised dividends in August 2001.</LD>
<TE>   In July, 131 firms raised dividend payments, up from 100 a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time we've had back-to-back, year-over-year
increases since March 1998," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&amp;P's
Outlook investment newsletter in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 and 2001, dividend increases were a victim of declining
profits at many companies, as firms sought to conserve cash. With
earnings improving this year, more companies have the ability to
boost dividend payments.</TE>
<TE>   Also, more investors may be clamoring for cash dividends. In the
late-1990s, the heyday of technology stocks, dividends fell out of
favor with many investors. Most were much more focused on earning big
capital gains on hot stocks as the bull market roared.</TE>
<TE>   But after the longest bear market in a generation, "I think there
is more demand for dividend payments now," Kaufman said. Dividends
can provide a steady cash return on stock investments even when share
prices languish, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kaufman said the dividend trend among the biggest U.S.
companies--those in the S&amp;P 500 index--isn't yet confirming an
upswing. He said actual dividend payments made by the S&amp;P 500
companies have totaled $10.50 per S&amp;P 500 share so far this year,
down from $10.65 in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller companies, particularly regional banks, have been much
more generous in terms of dividend increases this year than bigger
firms, Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   In August, for example, United Bankshares Inc. of Charleston,
W.Va., raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share from 23
cents. First Bell Bancorp of Wilmington, Del., raised its quarterly
payment to 15 cents a share from 12 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Some blue-chip firms have been lifting dividend payouts. Philip
Morris Cos. last month raised its quarterly dividend to 64 cents a
share from 58 cents, a 10.3% increase.</TE>
<TE>   An S&amp;P study showed that, since 2000, shares of S&amp;P 500 companies
that pay dividends have performed better than those that don't pay
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of dividend-paying companies fell an average of 9.2%
between Jan. 1 and July 29 of this year. By contrast, shares of index
companies that don't pay dividends plunged 31.8% in that period.</TE>

<HD>Pensions Straining Civic Coffers</HD>
<DH>Finance: As stocks fall, some municipalities cut services
in order to fund retirement plans. Bills on Gov. Davis' desk may push
costs even higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Generous retirement plans for California public employees, approved
during the 1990s stock boom, now threaten to burden state and local
governments with huge new debts as the stock market declines.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999 and 2001, Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation--backed by
unions for police officers, firefighters and other public
employees--that allowed local governments to negotiate pension
increases of up to 50%.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' administration granted better retirements to members of the
California Highway Patrol and other state workers. Under pressure
from unions--and buoyed by high stock prices that had fattened
pension funds--more than half the state's local governments did so as
well. Some of the contracts provide pension benefits of up to 100% of
a retired worker's salary.</LD>
<TE>   Now the bills for the higher benefits are starting to come due
even as the declining stock market has reduced the value of state
pension funds by 5% to 10% over the last year. The state government's
bill for its workers has doubled in the last year to $1.2 billion. On
the local level, the California Public Employees' Retirement System
sent a letter to city administrators in June warning that benefit
payments by many cities could rise by 20% over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS invests pension funds and pays benefits on behalf of the
state and local governments. Because the benefits are guaranteed, if
the return on pension funds falls short, local governments must make
payments from general tax funds to cover what they have promised.</TE>
<TE>   That is what is now happening in Contra Costa County in the Bay
Area. Officials there expect to cut $17 million from programs and
services this year and $37 million next year to pay for worker
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single county department has been hit," said John Sweeten,
a Contra Costa County administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Monterey County's pension payment rose from zero to $6 million for
law enforcement employees this year. That is about 26% of payroll.
The debt is expected to peak at 30% of payroll by 2007, which would
force serious reductions in county services, said County
Administrative Officer Sally Reed.</TE>
<TE>   The effects won't be felt in Los Angeles because county and city
leaders haven't approved pension increases. But dozens of other local
governments--including Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties and
the cities of Oxnard, Long Beach, Anaheim and Garden Grove--are
bracing for steeply higher costs.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in Orange County's pension benefits illustrate the
changes. Under the old system, a sheriff's deputy with 30 years'
experience could retire and receive at least 60% of his pay. Under
the new system, he would receive benefits equal to at least 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the new benefits say the unions' financial support for
Davis and labor's nearly nonstop lobbying of the Democratic majority
in the state Legislature opened the door to fiscally unsound
decisions by local governments.</TE>
<TE>   Labor groups have given Davis at least $9.7 million since 1999,
with more than a quarter of that amount coming from public employee
unions whose members have benefited from the enhanced retirement
packages.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokesman said labor's financial support played no role in
his decision to sign the legislation, and noted that both bills had
broad legislative support. Indeed, the bills passed the Legislature
on lopsided votes with little public debate.</TE>
<TE>   Public employees were asked to sacrifice during the down times of
the 1990s, and the pension bills were designed to "make up for the
many, many years they were neglected," spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
"We do these things so we can keep and retain employees and remain
competitive. I wouldn't characterize them as excessive."</TE>
<TE>   California's pension benefits for public safety employees are
substantially higher than the average among the states, according to
figures from the National Assn. of State Retirement Administrators in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the motivation, passage of the legislation has set
off political fights across the state over benefit levels.</TE>
<TE>   A CalPERS spokeswoman, Pat Macht, said cities and counties had
been given full disclosure about the effect of approving the higher
benefits for employees.</TE>
<TE>   "No one twisted their arms," Macht said. "The Legislature allowed
the opportunity if it seemed appropriate. Any increase in benefits
was fully analyzed and provided to their staffs."</TE>
<TE>   But once the first city approved the pension increases, "the
pressure to do the same was enormous," said Long Beach City Manager
Henry Taboada. "It was a feeding frenzy."</TE>
<TE>   Often, public employee unions are in a strong position to put
pressure on county or city officials sitting across the table from
them in bargaining sessions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in 2001, Ventura County supervisors resisted
increasing pensions for sheriff's deputies. The board's refusal to
grant the benefit increase almost cost Supervisor Judy Mikels, who
represents the Simi Valley area, her seat. Union members picketed
Mikels' campaign events and backed her opponent, a former Los Angeles
police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels, a two-term incumbent, squeaked by with 51% of the vote.
After 18 months, the deputies union gave up and accepted a contract
that does not include the higher retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels, a Republican who had been one of law enforcement's closest
allies on the board until the benefit issue arose, called the
proposed pension increases "obscene."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the pension increases argue that retirement plans for
public employees already were more generous, and more secure, than
the up-and-down 401(k) plans increasingly offered by private sector
employers.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people have been able to retire at 50, period, let alone
get most of their salary?" said Dave Thompson, legislative consultant
for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. "It does exactly
what you don't want to do as an employer: It encourages people to
leave early."</TE>
<TE>   But union officials say public employers must offer improved
benefits to attract good men and women.</TE>
<TE>   For people like police officers, the job is often difficult and
sometimes fatal. When officers have a choice, they will go with an
agency that will guarantee them an early and livable retirement, said
Clancy Faria, president of the Police Officers Research Assn. of
California, based in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Recruits today are very savvy about what's out there," Faria
said. "They shop areas for cost of living, housing, salary and
retirement benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some public employees don't get Social Security, noted
Terry Brennand, a lobbyist for the Service Employees International
Union. Government officials weren't complaining in the late 1990s
when the stock market carried pension funds so high that local
governments were not required to make any payments at all, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a lot of empathy for them," he said. "When they had
excess dollars, nobody set any money aside. Nobody planned for the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, public employee unions have succeeded in pushing
several new bills through this year's legislative session that could
raise costs further.</TE>
<TE>   * SB 1024 and SB 1409 would allow police and firefighters to
"retire" but continue working for as long as five years, earning a
salary during those years and collecting retroactive retirement pay
for that period when it ends.</TE>
<TE>   * AB 2023 would allow state and local prosecutors and deputy
public defenders to be classified as safety employees, allowing them
to negotiate for pension benefits greater than they currently are
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   * AB 2792 would eliminate local government's ability to reduce or
modify benefits, without employees' consent, for newly hired
employees. That bill would eliminate one potential avenue for local
governments to help remedy their current problem by cutting back on
pensions for newly hired employees.</TE>
<TE>   All four measures have been approved by the Legislature and are
awaiting Davis' signature.</TE>
<TE>   The current problem, meanwhile, is only likely to worsen, pension
experts say. The steepest increases in payments won't be seen until
next year because it takes two years for the stock market's
performance to show up in pension bills, said Dallas Salisbury,
president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a
Washington-based organization financed by employers, unions and
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you increase benefits based on short-term market factors, and
those factors suddenly reverse, the cost quickly catches up with
you," Salisbury said. "I always say be cautious with benefits. What
you think you have today could go away tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>Glut of Grapes Threatens to Dry Up Raisin Business</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: San Joaquin Valley farmers are forced to plow
under their vineyards.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOWLER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Each late summer day, Paul Khasigian puts on his farmer's boots and
heads down the crooked rows of his family's 100-year-old vineyard.
Sinking in the powdery soil, he pops a Thompson seedless grape into
his mouth and lets his tongue tell him if it's time to make raisins.</LD>
<LD>   But this season of harvest has left another footprint in the grape
fields of the San Joaquin Valley. Tractors are leveling vineyards in
the prime of their production; entire fields 30 and 40 years old are
wiped clean in a single day.</LD>
<LD>   This town and so many like it along a 75-mile stretch of
California 99, the nation's raisin capital, are choking on surplus
Thompson grapes.</LD>
<TE>   Vineyards have been given over to weeds and bugs because the cost
of farming is more than the price of raisins. Packinghouses have been
mothballed, and the local raisin association, hoping to correct the
glut, is paying growers to prune off the canes that make fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Banks that have propped up the $400-million-a-year industry now
sit coiled to lower the boom on overdue notes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, though, hits the 42-year-old Khasigian harder than the
roar of the giant tractors swallowing vineyards with their grapes
still hanging in fat bunches, full of the sugar that makes these
raisins the world's best.</TE>
<TE>   When the day is done, the tractors stack roots, trellis wires,
stakes and abandoned fruit in huge piles, ready to burn.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many acres of Thompsons, the king grape of this
flat valley, have been plowed under since the raisin went bust two
seasons ago. But it isn't hard to find entire sections of old grape
land now sitting vacant, concrete irrigation valves marking each
vanished row like gravestones.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we farmers are always whining, and people in the city
don't know when to believe us. But believe this: We're dying," said
Khasigian, who is farming the same land his father and grandfather
farmed.</TE>
<TE>   "The talk here isn't how much money we can make, but how little
money we can lose. No one knows where we're going."</TE>
<TE>   Too many raisins made and not enough raisins eaten--it's a story
as old as the first musings of author William Saroyan, the Fresno
native who once answered the farmer's lament with a simple equation:
If only every mother in China placed one raisin in her pot of rice,
he calculated, the glut would forever be gone.</TE>
<TE>   The raisin marketers, it seems, have tried everything short of
that to sell the world on the virtues of the sunbaked Thompson. From
the Sun-Maid girl in her bonnet to the dancing clay figures of TV's
California Raisins to the marketing of raisin butter, the push for
new converts has never ceased.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we get America to eat more raisins?" asked Eddie
Nikssarian, half smiling. The third-generation raisin farmer has torn
out his 20 acres of Thompsons because he would lose less money making
payments on fallow land. He supports his family by selling the very
grape plants that have gotten the farmers into this mess. "There's
only so many raisins that can go into Raisin Bran," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For Armenian American families like the Khasigians and the
Nikssarians who built the raisin industry here, the Thompson grape
had been a wonder. It gave them three options at harvest: size up the
berries and sell them as table grapes; yank off the bunches and haul
them to the winery; or lay the bunches on trays and let them cook in
the sun. (It takes only three weeks of San Joaquin Valley sun to bake
a grape into a raisin.)</TE>
<TE>   For the better part of a century, it was the raisin that gave the
grape grower the steadiest payday.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Rustigian, who still farms the land his father first worked
in 1913, raised three children and built a nice brick house by
turning grapes into raisins. In the good years--and there were plenty
of them--he put away $30,000 at each harvest's end.</TE>
<TE>   Then two years ago, after the price of raisins dropped from $1,425
a ton to $878, he had to dip into his savings to pay his pickers and
pesticide man. Last year, after he received only $554 a ton--$250
below the break-even point--Rustigian had to do the unthinkable: He
laid off his oldest son, Dennis, the only one who had followed him
into farming.</TE>
<TE>   Now Rustigian, pushing 81, is driving his tractor by himself and
watching over the irrigation system. "This is as bad as the
Depression time," he said. "There's no promise here."</TE>
<TE>   He blames imported raisins from Turkey, the land his father fled
more than 85 years ago at the outbreak of the Armenian genocide, for
creating the oversupply.</TE>
<TE>   "My family left the old country to escape the Turks," he said. "We
Armenians came to America and built this raisin industry from
scratch. Now I'm an old man, and the raisin from Turkey is chasing me
out. It's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish raisin, which now accounts for 25% of the world's
supply, has surely made matters worse. But packers and other farmers
say the seeds of this recent glut were actually sown five and 10
years ago--right here in California.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, more than 265,000 acres of wine grapes and table
grapes have been planted throughout the state, a boom that has nearly
doubled grape production. Because so many other varieties are now
being used to make wine and table grapes, the elegant amber-green
Thompson is no longer prized as an eating grape or a grape to blend
into wine.</TE>
<TE>   With nowhere else to go, at least nowhere else that pays much
money, most of the 250,000 acres of Thompson grapes get turned into
raisins. Of the 377,000 tons of the dried berry produced in
California last year, 37% went unsold and had to be stored in
warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   "The abundance of wine grapes is taking a large bite out of the
Thompson market," said Gary Nelson, a state agricultural
statistician.</TE>
<TE>   The Thompson grape's fortunes have sunk so far so fast that the
Gallo winery told farmers that it would be offering only $65 a wet
ton for Thompsons headed to the juice tanks.</TE>
<TE>   The price, down from $200 a ton only a few years ago, is
considered such an insult that 75 farmers gathered recently outside
the giant E&amp;J Gallo plant in Fresno to protest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be losing $300 an acre with the price Gallo is offering,"
said Avtar Gill, a Sikh grower who attended the rally. "It only means
that the Thompsons that used to go to wine will now go to raisins.
The raisin glut is only going to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Gallo blames the oversupply of wine grapes for the low prices. "We
sympathize with the plight of all California grape growers, but the
problem is really beyond our control," said Milo Shelly, Gallo's vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   The glut has suppressed land prices to the point that 40 acres of
Thompson land now sells for nearly the same as 40 acres of empty
land. A few years ago, farmers were getting $9,000 an acre for prime
Thompson land. Today, they're lucky to get $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been selling farmland for 42 years," said Frank Stepovich of
Pearson Realty, "and this is the worst I've seen it in my time."</TE>
<TE>   No one is having a harder time accepting the raisin bust than the
Armenian American farmers. This is a place, after all, where every
summer both factions of the Armenian church hold separate "grape-
blessing" picnics with priests in elaborate robes giving thanks for
the berries that seem to get bigger, if not tastier, every year.</TE>
<TE>   At this summer's picnic, farmer Khasigian was cooking shish kebab
and trying not to think about the harvest. Most years, the talk among
the farmers in straw hats concerns the sugar content of their
Thompsons, the calculations of when it's best to cut the bunches and
start the drying process.</TE>
<TE>   This year, instead of holding their breath for three weeks and
praying that it doesn't rain, some farmers are praying that it does.
Rain insurance will likely guarantee a higher price than the market.</TE>
<TE>   To slash costs, Khasigian and his neighbors have cut out
chemicals. The glut has turned them all into organic farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no future in raisins, at least not now," Khasigian said.
"Probably never."</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather, Avedis Khasigian, planted his first 20 acres by
horse, the rows crowded and the vines lined up crooked.</TE>
<TE>   Khasigian's father, Amos, eventually left the farm to go to school
and teach economics at Pierce College. Khasigian himself grew up in
Los Angeles and earned a chemistry degree at UCLA and a pharmacy
degree at University of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   He married a Southern California girl and, in 1987, moved back to
the farm in Fowler to raise their five sons and serve as a
Scoutmaster for Troop 390.</TE>
<TE>   He and his father, who also returned home, began buying up more
land. They planted table grapes and three kinds of apples and, of
course, more Thompsons.</TE>
<TE>   The apples were Khasigian's attempt to not lean so heavily on one
crop. For awhile, the Granny Smiths and Galas did well. But like
everything else, so many other California farmers also converted to
apples that they soon found themselves chin-high in surplus.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his 200 acres afloat, he works full time as a pharmacist
at the local poison control center. He said he pays for the privilege
to live out in the country and farm.</TE>
<TE>   "My in-laws in L.A. can't understand how I can own so much land
and cry poor," he said. "They ask me, 'Why don't you just pull out
the crops that don't work and plant new ones?'</TE>
<TE>   "What they don't understand is there's no magic crop out here. And
you don't just yank out something that you've put all this time and
money and sweat into."</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to this harvest, Khasigian found himself
doing just that. A big diesel tractor showed up one morning at his
30-acre vineyard. It took less than eight hours to clear the entire
field, sweet grapes and all.</TE>
<TE>   All that's left are 13 stacks piled high and waiting for the
strike of a match.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more farmers will have to do the same if we're going to
turn this around," Khasigian said. "I'm afraid the worst is yet to
come."</TE>

<HD>No Settlement Yet in Church Sex Scandal, Lawyer Says</HD>
<DH>Abuse: Attorney for 86 alleged victims of priest challenges
the Boston Archdiocese's announcement of a tentative pact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The lawyer for 86 alleged victims of the priest whose conviction
launched the sex scandal now roiling the Catholic Church said
Wednesday that a settlement announcement by the archdiocese here was
premature.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a done deal," attorney Mitchell Garabedian said at a
news conference. "There is an offer of $10 million. There has been no
acceptance." Garabedian, who has spent more than a year negotiating
with church officials, challenged a church lawyer's assertion late
Tuesday that a tentative deal was in place.</LD>
<LD>   "To call it tentative would be inaccurate," Garabedian said.
Outside the archdiocese chancery Wednesday, Father Christopher Coyne
said the two sides were "pretty close" to an agreement. But the
church spokesman added that he could not say that "everyone is on
board" with a new settlement, "because that is just not the case."</LD>
<TE>   In March, both sides heralded a deal that reportedly would pay the
86 alleged victims of former priest John J. Geoghan from $20 million
to $30 million. But weeks later, the church summarily backed out,
saying the accord was too expensive. After first praising that
agreement as an important step toward healing, Cardinal Bernard Law
declared that his financial advisors said it was unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   A church finance officer recently confirmed that the nation's
fourth-largest archdiocese was exploring bankruptcy, among other
"possible options."</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian has pressed the court here to enforce the March pact as
a contract in good standing. Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney
is expected to rule shortly on the viability of that deal.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Garabedian's own client roster, hundreds of adults have
stepped forward to say they were sexually abused by Geoghan or other
priests from the Boston Archdiocese. More than 300 are said to be
seeking financial restitution from the church here.</TE>
<TE>   The 66-year-old Geoghan, convicted in January of fondling a boy at
a community swimming pool in the early 1990s, is serving a nine-to
10-year prison term. He is scheduled to be tried as early as next
month on more serious charges of child rape. Documents obtained by
the Boston Globe in the course of Geoghan's trial showed that church
officials here were aware for decades of sexual abuse complaints
against him. Rather than removing Geoghan from work involving contact
with children, the archdiocese transferred him from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   A similar pattern emerged when the church released nearly 1,000
pages of records this spring showing that another priest, Father Paul
Shanley, also had a long history of sexual abuse accusations. Shanley
too was routinely transferred--ultimately to a parish in Southern
California. Now retired, Shanley, 71, was extradited to Massachusetts
and is in jail awaiting trial on child rape charges.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian stressed Wednesday that financial compensation was only
part of what his clients are seeking. Many also have requested the
opportunity to address the court so their recollections will become
public record. "What you have to understand is that these cases are
about more than money," the lawyer said. "People want closure. That's
the main theme. They feel as though they've been dragged into this
darkness and can't get out of it."</TE>
<TE>   He would not say how many of his clients have agreed to the new
church offer. All 86 must sign for the deal to go forward, Garabedian
said. J. Owen Todd, a lawyer for the archdiocese, said the funds for
the $10-million settlement would be covered by liability insurance.
He said plaintiffs could receive payouts by the end of this month if
the deal met court approval.</TE>

<HD>Ageism in the Media Is Seen as Harmful to Health of the
Elderly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Television ads depicting aging baby boomers as "greedy geezers" and
news stories calling older audiences "a bad omen for advertising
revenues" pose serious risks for the elderly and may even shorten
lifespan, a panel of experts on aging testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The panelists, appearing before the Senate Special Committee on
Aging, castigated media and marketing executives for bombarding
audiences with what they said are negative images of aging in print,
on television and on the big screen. What's worse, they said, is most
people internalize these images without realizing how damaging they
can be on an older person's finances, relationships and physical and
mental health.</LD>
<LD>   "Extolling youthfulness while demeaning the old helps to generate
images that, as our research suggests, may have devastating
consequences," Becca R. Levy, an epidemiologist at Yale University,
told committee Chairman Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) and other
senators at the hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Levy presented the findings of a 20-year study published last
month in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that found
that older people with positive perceptions of aging lived 7 1/2
years longer than those exposed to negative images of aging.
Researchers interviewed 660 people over the course of the study,
tracking longevity and how participants' self-images were affected as
they grew older.</TE>
<TE>   Levy acknowledged that media and marketing are not solely to blame
for promoting ageism. But Levy and the other panelists agreed that
the two industries are the most pervasive, systematic and
identifiable sources of images that are detrimental to older
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings come as 77 million baby boomers--those born in the 18
years after World War II--reach retirement age. With birthrates on
the decline and life expectancy increasing, this population is poised
to become the largest group of consumers, especially in the
pharmaceutical market.</TE>
<TE>   Panelist Robert Snyder, a senior partner at Mature Market Group, a
Dallas research and marketing firm, stressed the importance of
catering to the longevity needs of older consumers who hold
substantial purchasing power.</TE>
<TE>   Television commercials shown at Wednesday's hearing, however,
depicted older Americans in sometimes deplorable ways. One
commercial, for example, showed an older woman exposing herself after
an auto parts employee tells her the shop offers a lifetime guarantee
on certain auto parts.</TE>
<TE>   Breaux expressed dismay at seemingly contradictory marketing
strategies that target younger consumers while neglecting older
Americans who compose a major segment of the market. "The media and
marketing industries ignore the purchasing power and preferences of
millions of baby boomers and seniors across the country--a population
that controls three-fourths of the nation's wealth."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing took on a sympathetic tone when Emmy-winning actress
Doris Roberts, 71, who stars as the sharp-tongued, nosy mother in the
television series "Everybody Loves Raymond," told the committee she
thought society considered her opinions "irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   "My peers and I are portrayed as dependent, helpless, unproductive
and demanding rather than deserving," she said. "This is not just a
sad situation.... This is a crime."</TE>
<TE>   Panelists and committee members said more public awareness and a
reevaluation of American values are needed to begin embracing older
Americans.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The powder found in threatening letters received Wednesday by at
least 11 Massachusetts police stations is not anthrax, state health
officials said, dispelling fears of a new letter-borne attack.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears to be a hoax," said Roseanne Pawelec, a spokeswoman
for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</LD>
<LD>   Ralph Timperi, director of the department's laboratory, said it
would take more tests to determine what the powder was, but he
stressed there was little reason to believe the letters contained any
credible threat.</LD>
<TE>   "We've done rapid tests on three of the letters and ruled out
anthrax," Timperi told a local radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Pawelec and Timperi said that since all 11 envelopes were
identical, there was no need to do any more rapid tests. Instead,
health officials will move on to a more detailed examination to
determine the nature of the powder.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI was investigating the source of the letters, Pawelec said.</TE>

<HD>Bird Killed While Trying to Save Its Owner May Be a Star

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>A heroic cockatoo slain trying to protect its master from
knife-wielding assailants may prove to be the star witness in the
trial of its owner's suspected killers.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas prosecutors showed a grand jury Wednesday DNA evidence from
blood samples found at the scene they say links two men arrested in
the case to the home of the bird's owner. The blood apparently came
from a wound the bird pecked on the head of one of the suspects, said
prosecutor George West.</LD>
<LD>   West expects to receive an indictment this week on capital murder
for the suspects, Johnny Serna, 22, and Daniel Torres, 30, for
allegedly killing Kevin Butler last December over a dispute about
money.</LD>
<TE>   According to evidence presented to the grand jury, the two men
allegedly broke into Butler's home. During a violent struggle in
Butler's living room, the white-crested cockatoo named Bird, after
former pro basketball great Larry Bird, swooped down on the attackers
and clawed at their skin and pecked at their heads, West said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bird was valiant," West said.</TE>
<TE>   Bird apparently wounded Torres, but the protective member of the
parrot family paid the price for trying to take on two armed foes.</TE>

<LD>State game officials sprayed enough poison to kill every fish in a
murky pond to get rid of a foreign predator that infiltrated suburban
Washington: the voracious, land-crawling snakehead fish.</LD>
<LD>   The state dispatched two boats to spray 16 gallons of suffocating
poison on the Crofton pond, where game officials feared the
snakeheads that lived there would threaten native fish and possibly
migrate to other waters.</LD>
<LD>   Two hours after the poison was applied, fish came to the surface,
struggling for air.</LD>

<LD>Teen girls who are close to their mothers are more likely to stay
virgins longer, researchers reported.</LD>
<LD>   The key for parents, experts say, is not just talking about sex,
but being involved in their kids' lives.</LD>
<LD>   "The message to parents is: You matter," said Sarah Brown,
director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.</LD>
<TE>   By the ninth grade, 34% of teens have had sexual intercourse, and
that rises to 60% by 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said 50% of moms of sexually active teens didn't
realize their kids were having sex. "Perhaps it's because they don't
want to know," the University of Minnesota's Dr. Robert Blum said.</TE>

<HD>Convicted Mayor Out of Favor, Not His Issues</HD>
<DH>Politics: Rivals vying in Providence, R.I., back causes
that made the incumbent popular.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>With Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci looking at the possibility of
prison, the Democrats vying to succeed him are distancing themselves
from him while embracing some of the causes that made him so popular.</LD>
<LD>   The four candidates face off in a primary Tuesday, four days after
Cianci is to be sentenced. He could get up to 20 years for his role
in a scheme in which city jobs, contracts and tax breaks could be had
for bribes.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic mayoral contenders are championing such causes as
urban renewal and gay rights that won such support for Cianci. He has
been mayor since 1974, except for a six-year absence in the 1980s
prompted by an assault case.</LD>
<TE>   A recent poll showed that 50% of voters favored state Rep. David
Cicilline to replace Cianci, while 32% support former Mayor Joseph
Paolino Jr.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. David Igliozzi was backed by 10%, 4% favored lawyer
Keven McKenna, and 4% were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 1/2 percentage
points.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins the nomination will be the favorite in November in
this heavily Democratic city.</TE>
<TE>   The three terms since Cianci returned to office in 1990 have
brought a renaissance downtown that the Democratic candidates have
promised to extend into blighted neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Paolino has said he wants to rebuild those areas by cleaning up
parks and schools and adding community police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Cicilline is advocating the arts--much like Cianci--and supports
renewing neighborhoods in part by making gallery and studio space
available to more people.</TE>
<TE>   Paolino has taken another page from Cianci's playbook by seeking
the support of gay voters. Cicilline is openly gay.</TE>
<TE>   Cicilline and McKenna declared their candidacy before Cianci was
convicted in June, and both have publicly upbraided the mayor.
Paolino and Igliozzi entered the race after the verdict and have not
openly criticized Cianci.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to kick somebody when they're down, but I decided that
I'm not going to do that," said Igliozzi, a former city councilman
who worked in the city solicitor's office under Cianci.</TE>

<HD>25 Years Later, Miami Again Has Gay Rights Fight on Its
Hands</HD>
<DH>Politics: In 1977, Anita Bryant led move that overturned
anti-bias law. Now, a similar campaign is targeting an ordinance
adopted in 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The county where orange juice spokeswoman Anita Bryant mounted a
crusade against gay rights 25 years ago is taking up the issue again.</LD>
<LD>   In 1977, Miami was the site of one of the biggest battles of the
gay rights movement when Bryant, then a successful pop singer, led a
drive that repealed a Miami-Dade County ordinance protecting gays
from discrimination. A new such ordinance was passed in 1998, and now
gay rights opponents again want to overturn it.</LD>
<LD>   The repeal measure is on Tuesday's ballot.</LD>
<TE>   This time, though, the fight is not nearly as furious as it was a
generation ago. Gay rights supporters have higher-profile backing
than they enjoyed back then. And a poll released Wednesday by the
Miami Herald found that the repeal effort is likely to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone poll of 600 probable voters found 54% against
repeal, 34% in favor and 12% undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Gay rights activists are fighting the measure and similar ones on
the November ballot in Tacoma, Wash., and Ypsilanti, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we beat back these repeal attempts," said
Seth Kilbourn of the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. "All
we're asking for is to be treated equally."</TE>
<TE>   Corporations such as BellSouth and Carnival Cruise Lines have
contributed tens of thousands of dollars to preserve the ordinance,
and 18 of the county's 32 mayors, including Miami-Dade Mayor Alex
Penelas, have expressed support.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Democratic National Committee have warned that
repealing the ordinance could hurt Miami's chances of hosting the
party's 2004 convention.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a world-class city and we can't allow a small minority
painting us as a community that favors discrimination," said Georg
Ketelhohn, co-chair of the No to Discrimination/Save Dade campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gay rights opponents say homosexuals are seeking special
treatment, not equal rights. "There's no ordinance protecting people
with three nostrils," said Matt Dupree, director of the Florida
Christian Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, from 66,000
to 85,000 gays and lesbians live in Miami-Dade County.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade's ordinance was reinstated at the end of a decade that
saw the passage of gay rights measures in cities across the country.
Florida is one of 38 states without a state law banning
discrimination against gays.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1998 ordinance was adopted, Miami-Dade's Equal
Opportunity Board has received nearly 70 complaints of anti-gay
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Rodil of Miami filed a complaint in 2000 when she was
fired from a real estate firm two days after her employer learned she
was a lesbian. The board sided with Rodil, and she reached a
settlement with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about special rights, this is about equality," Rodil
said. "Am I not the kind of person who deserves a job?"</TE>
<TE>   Miami lawyer Rosa Armesto de Gonzalez, an opponent of the gay
rights ordinance, said gays have not proved a need for special
protection as have blacks and others covered by civil rights laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything they've asked for, they're given," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Months of campaigning by conservatives returned the issue to the
ballot despite the arrests of four people--including that of the
county's Christian Coalition leader--on charges they submitted false
signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere around the country, a November ballot measure in Nevada
will ask voters to ban same-sex marriages. In Oregon, conservatives
want to put a measure on the ballot to prohibit any discussion in
public schools that casts a positive light on gayness.</TE>

<HD>From Waitress to an 'American Idol'</HD>
<DH>Culture: Texan Kelly Clarkson beats Justin Guarini as a
viewer poll logs 15 million calls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a glitzy Hollywood production accented by fireworks, red, white
and blue confetti and wild applause, Texas cocktail waitress Kelly
Clarkson was crowned "American Idol," the winner of the Fox
Television talent show that has become a cultural phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   Clarkson beat out runner-up Justin Guarini by 58% to 42% in a
viewer poll that registered more than 15 million calls Wednesday
night after a singing showdown between the two.</LD>
<LD>   During the nationally televised variety show broadcast live from
the Kodak Theatre, an overflow, wildly enthusiastic audience roared
with approval as Clarkson was named winner. Her eyes welling with
tears, Clarkson said, "I don't know what to say," then let out
several shrieks of delight as she belted out one final song.</LD>
<TE>   The two faced off with each taking a turn singing the two songs
slated for the first single--the ballad "Before Your Love" and the
more up-tempo love song "A Moment Like This"--as well as a song of
their choice. The showdown was witnessed by a capacity crowd at the
venue, and a national TV audience of more than 18 million, the show's
largest audience since its June debut.</TE>
<TE>   Though the performances by Guarini and Clarkson were greeted with
loud cheers and standing ovations, Clarkson appeared to have the
edge. The 20-year-old Texan received the lion's share of praise from
the show's three judges--music executive Simon Cowell,
singer/choreographer Paula Abdul and record producer Randy Jackson.
Cowell declared near the end of the show that Clarkson should be
named "American Idol."</TE>
<TE>   For the season, the interactive show generated more than 100
million calls from viewers voting for their favorite singers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the popularity that has recently surrounded the show,
"Idol"-mania is expected to ramp up even further in the next few
weeks with the release of the winner's first single and a national
tour featuring the 10 finalists. Numerous other "Idol"-related
ventures also are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the inevitable "American Idol 2" are being finalized,
although executives at Fox and FreemantleMedia, which produced the
show, hope to get it on the air as early as January.</TE>
<TE>   Some contract details still need to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Fox had only limited expectations for the show when it went on the
air in early summer. Although its predecessor, "Pop Idol," was a
sensation in Britain when it aired this year, spawning a handful of
No. 1 hit singles, Fox executives had slated the series as a
youth-oriented, low-cost stopgap during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't think they could dare run it during the more
competitive TV season from mid-September until about Memorial Day
each year.</TE>

<HD>Between the Rocks and the Hard Places, a Hospital Finds Its
Niche</HD>
<DH>Health: In a mountain biking mecca, 90% of ER's cases in
season can involve torn, shredded skin. 'These guys can sew,' one
nurse says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOAB, Utah</DL>
<LD>Mike Gostlin hikes up his baggy shorts to reveal tight, shiny patches
of skin along both knees, souvenirs from his mountain bike rides
along the red sandstone mesas here.</LD>
<LD>   "This isn't Disneyland," he warns the biking daredevils who come
from around the world to careen down this region's famed "slickrock"
trails.</LD>
<LD>   Some make it out of the expert trails unscathed, but most do not,
and that has given the town another, albeit more obscure, national
reputation: its hospital's emergency room knows everything there is
to know about putting together ripped and shredded skin.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd put up our ER docs against any of the plastics [cosmetic
surgeons], they're so used to dealing with facial lacerations," said
Tim McGinty, an emergency room nurse. "These guys can sew."</TE>
<TE>   As specialties go, it's not the stuff of medical journals.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say it's a source of great pride, but we do see so much
of it, we're pretty efficient," said Dr. Bobby Hudgins, director of
emergency medicine at Allen Memorial Hospital. "During the busy
seasons--spring and fall--there are times when mountain bikers will
be lined up out the door, holding body parts and dripping all over
our floors."</TE>
<TE>   During those seasons, as much as 90% of the ER's cases come from
bikers--so many that its treatment statistics are being studied by a
Utah group that tracks wilderness injuries.</TE>
<TE>   For most riders in town, the terrain of their lower extremities
tells the painful tale. Andy Adams, who has been riding here all his
life, says he's known on a first-name basis at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, there's a great story to go along with each injury,"
he said, rattling off a list of his own. "Sometimes, people take
poetic license with how the crashes came about."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Moab a unique place to ride is also what creates
skin-peeling crashes. Bikers race high up on mesas across broad, flat
sandstone slabs, called slickrock. Even fat mountain bike tires find
little purchase on the smooth paths. Then, on the way down, sand
coats the trails, which are wall-to-wall rock.</TE>
<TE>   There are few easy trails here and there are no soft landings.
Even the most leisurely rides can end up with a face plant into local
red rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Moab's reputation as a mecca exceeds its accessibility to the
masses--that's the problem," said McGinty, who is also an avid
mountain biker. "People come here, they are not capable of riding the
expert trails, but, by God, they are going to ride it because they
are here."</TE>
<TE>   Around Moab's busy bike shops, locals say they can easily tell
which customers are accidents waiting to happen: Lycra-clad "experts"
who don't sufficiently respect the terrain.</TE>
<TE>   "The big shots are the No. 1 most-injured group," said Gostlin, a
native who rents bikes at Poison Spider Bicycles. "They act like they
know it all and they will be the ones in the next day with their arm
in a sling."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been wearing full pads for two years and I've gotten nothing
worse than a bruise," said Nicholas Badovinac, who was adjusting a
bike at the Chili Pepper Bike Shop. "People come here and don't
realize how difficult it can be. Yesterday a guy came in here and his
whole knee and shin were badly skinned. You'd be shocked what you see
out there. Classic stupidity."</TE>
<TE>   Moab's low-slung hospital is snuggled against the red rock mesas
that are so popular with bikers. Georgia Russell is the emergency
room coordinator and has been an ER nurse for 25 years. Her staff is
the first line of treatment for biking injuries. Invariably, the
injuries require staff time that's all out of proportion to their
severity.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to triage within five minutes of arrival," Russell said.
"These bikers, with an extreme full-body abrasion--it can take 45
minutes to clean them up. We've got patients backing up, and we're
still digging the dirt and grit out of their wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, we have a reputation for getting them in and out. It's a
routine. We're used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Hudgins, the ER physician, said treating skin abrasions is much
like treating burns. And, like burns, abrasions are painful because
of the concentration of nerve endings in the skin.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from skinned areas, the next most common injuries are broken
collarbones, separated shoulders and broken elbows, wrists and other
fractures.</TE>
<TE>   "Injuries from falling and hitting hard rocks, that's what we
see," Hudgins said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hospital's radiology room, where the wounded bikers are
X-rayed, a giant bulletin board asks the question, "Which One Got You
Today?" On the board is a list of trails that indicate where patients
crashed. The more treacherous trails quickly become apparent by the
large numbers next to them.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these guys are dragged in by friends, some are brought in
by search and rescue," Russell said of her patients. "It's not all
abrasions.... Recently some bikers found a guy face-down on one of
our toughest trails. He's in a coma. We transferred him."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, about 206 of the 1,000 mountain bike patients at the
hospital required X-rays. This year, 188 bikers have been
X-rayed--and the fall season is about to begin. It's enough to
convince most of the medical staff here not to join in the town's
favorite pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "Go up there and mountain bike? No way," Russell said, her harsh
laugh echoing in the emergency room. "I'm not going out there and
killing myself. I see too much of that in here."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Charges That Iraq Knew of Attacks Before 9/11</HD>
<DH>Court: Papers allege that Baghdad intelligence had close
links to Bin Laden's network as early as 1992.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of 1,400 victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks charged Wednesday that Iraq had advance knowledge
that Al Qaeda was planning to launch strikes against targets in New
York City and the Washington area.</LD>
<LD>   The court papers alleged that as early as 1992, Iraqi intelligence
established "close working relations" with Osama bin Laden's
terrorist organization and provided it with training, weapons,
supplies, passports and financial support.</LD>
<LD>   "Al Qaeda, backed by Iraq, carried out the September 11th terror
attacks with the financial and logistical support of numerous
individuals and organizations," the suit brought by Kreindler &amp;
Kreindler, a Manhattan law firm specializing in aviation disaster
litigation, charges.</LD>
<TE>   "Since the early 1990s, Iraq and Iraqi intelligence have used both
Iraqi agents and independent contractors to commit terrorist acts
against the United States in revenge for Iraq's Gulf War defeat," the
litigation contends. "Al Qaeda was Iraq's favorite partner in crime
and terror."</TE>
<TE>   The court action, seeking more than $1 trillion in damages from
Iraq and other sponsors of the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and
the World Trade Center, cited an article in an Iraqi newspaper on
July 21, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper was published in Al Nasiriyah, 185 miles southwest
of Baghdad, an area lawyers said contains a military base believed to
include a chemical weapon storage facility. The lawyers also alleged
Al Qaeda terrorists trained in the area for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Written under the byline Naeem Abd Mulhalhal, the article
described Bin Laden as thinking "seriously" about the way "he will
try to bomb the Pentagon after he destroys the White House."</TE>
<TE>   The columnist also predicted tragedy in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "The article expressed Iraqi admiration and support for Bin
Laden's plans and its appearance in the newspaper would clearly have
to be endorsed by Saddam Hussein himself," court papers charged.</TE>
<TE>   Kreindler &amp; Kreindler cited the claims of a former associate of
Mulhalhal that the writer has been connected with Iraqi intelligence
since the early 1980s. In another article in the same weekly
newspaper on Sept. 21, 2001, Mulhalhal was praised by Saddam and
honored for his "documentation of important events and heroic deeds
that proud Iraqis have accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   The suit charged that because Saddam's ruling Baath party tightly
controls the press and other media, Mulhalhal's article could not
have appeared without prior approval by the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq's July 21 public statements also exemplify the Bin Laden
pattern of publicly threatening violent strikes against the United
States prior to and after committing them," the civil suit says.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, weeks before the August 1998 Al Qaeda attacks on the
U.S. embassies in Africa, Bin Laden threatened U.S. civilians and
shortly thereafter bombed the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania within
minutes of each other, killing 223 civilians," the court papers add.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said much of the content of the suit was collected using
investigators who worked with published reports and other
information.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers filed in Manhattan say that Israeli intelligence
sources verified for the last two years that Iraqi intelligence
officers traveled back and forth between Baghdad and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers claimed that over the years, Iraqi intelligence officials
met with Bin Laden several times in Afghanistan and a group of Al
Qaeda operatives from Saudi Arabia were trained in Iraq on techniques
to smuggle weapons and explosives into Saudi Arabia and other
countries.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terror Screening Draws Fire</HD>
<DH>Security: Tracking plan angers Muslim nations. State Dept.
fears an erosion of U.S. support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A new anti-terrorist tracking system that will require fingerprinting
and photographing tens of thousands of visitors to the United States
is prompting an angry outpouring from Muslim nations.</LD>
<LD>   The measures set to begin Sept. 11 have aroused concern inside the
State Department that they could antagonize some of the very people
whose backing the United States hopes to enlist in its ongoing war
against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   State Department officials said the visitors most likely to be
fingerprinted are males between the ages of 16 and 45 from 26 nations
where terrorism is deemed to be a concern.</LD>
<TE>   The names of the 26 countries are classified, but they are widely
believed to be mainly Muslim nations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to create three lines at the airport: a U.S. citizen
line, a non-U.S. citizen line, and a dark people/Arab line," said
James J. Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute in Washington.
"It's going to contribute to the perception that it's Muslims we're
after."</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official conceded that there had been
"friction" with the Justice Department over the issue, adding: "The
State Department is concerned with how this procedure will be
perceived overseas, particularly in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   There also are growing concerns that tougher scrutiny of thousands
of foreign visitors, if not performed quickly and discreetly, could
depress tourism, trade and business.</TE>
<TE>   Already, more stringent visa regulations imposed since Sept. 11
are causing delays of six weeks or more in issuing U.S. visas,
causing headaches for the travel industry, international students and
even hospitals that are seeing a drop in patients from the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Martinez, a spokesman for the Justice Department, which has
been battling the State Department over how to implement the tracking
system, vigorously defended the new procedures--imposed under the
Patriot Act enacted by Congress after the terror attacks on New York
and the Pentagon last Sept. 11--as essential for keeping tabs on
foreigners who might do America harm.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez emphatically denied that the National Security Entry-Exit
Registration System, or NSEERS, will discriminate against any
particular group.</TE>
<TE>   But Martinez refused to say what criteria will be used to single
out visitors who deserve extra scrutiny. He would only describe the
two main categories: any non-immigrant alien the State Department
defines as an elevated national security risk; or any alien the
Immigration and Naturalization Service says is a national security
threat, based on the latest intelligence about terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   An INS spokeswoman, who declined to give her name, said the agency
did not expect delays at airports starting Sept. 11, contending that
the beefed-up inspection process for certain visitors will only take
about 10 minutes per person.</TE>
<TE>   But diplomats and travel industry officials are worried about the
potential for long lines and the reaction of foreign travelers who
may be unprepared when INS agents take them aside for fingerprinting
and further questioning. Some are concerned that other countries may
retaliate and impose reciprocal fingerprinting and other restrictions
on Americans who travel abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians question whether U.S. intelligence is equipped
to analyze all the fingerprints and information it collects or will
drown in the data.</TE>
<TE>   And some Arab Americans fear the process could reinforce the
perception that America doesn't want Muslim visitors and that the war
on terrorism is being waged through racial profiling that sees all
Arabs as potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Editorialists from Egypt to Malaysia are decrying the long waits
to obtain U.S. visas, condemning the U.S. decision to fingerprint,
and declaring that the policy means Arab visitors--and Arab
capital--are not welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Fingerprinting is a procedure that is normally applied to
prisoners, criminals and those with past records," said the columnist
Fahd al-Fanik in Jordan's Al-Rai newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The Dubai Gulf News in the United Arab emirates blasted what it
called U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's "Big Brother" approach to
fighting terrorism as naive and racist.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's English-language Arab News, referring to the U.S.
government's detention of immigrants after Sept. 11, declared:</TE>
<TE>   "Coming after 1,200 Arabs and Muslims have been detained without
due process of law, another 8,000 who are legal visa holders
questioned, and thousands of cases of individual discrimination, this
ill-thought-out, squalid little proposal, which can do nothing to
actually improve U.S. security because real terrorists will not
register, serves only to convince Arabs and Muslims that the U.S. is
targeting them."</TE>
<TE>   The toughened process is intended to address Congress' concern
that terrorists could come to the United States on student or tourist
visas and then disappear into American society, as happened with the
Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Already, INS border agents photograph and fingerprint citizens of
Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria--states deemed to sponsor terrorism--upon
arrival in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Sept. 11, a small percentage of other entering foreign
visitors will also be asked to step aside into the "secondary
inspection" area where INS agents will record digital images of both
index fingers, take a digital photograph, and have visitors fill out
an extended form detailing where they plan to stay in the United
States, what they will do, and when they will leave, said the Justice
Department's Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The fingerprints will be matched against databases of known
criminals and terrorists, and the records will be used to ensure that
the visitor departs the U.S. as scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria for deciding who will get the extra screening are
classified, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't discriminate or target anyone because of their race,
religion or ethnic heritage," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you assume that terrorists who come to attack our country
are going to be Middle Eastern people? I understand that the Middle
Eastern community is concerned, but this is the farthest from the
truth," he said. "If you pose an elevated national security risk, you
will go through the ... system whether you're a white person with
blue eyes or a Middle Eastern person or a Hispanic person or
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Citing security reasons, the Justice Department would not say
which airports will be the first to implement the new system, but
Martinez said all ports of international entry will have it running
by Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, a huge effort has been made to expand
and improve the databases, which include FBI data and sanitized
intelligence information that might have been obtained covertly, that
consular officials use to check out visa applicants.</TE>
<TE>   About 135,000 men from the 26 suspect nations were affected by an
automatic 20-day waiting period for visas imposed during the summer
to allow more time for background checks of applicants.</TE>
<TE>   However, about 25,000 of these visa applicants, whose files caused
no concerns but fit certain classified criteria, were sent to
Washington between July 1 and Aug. 2 for a further "security advisory
opinion request" under a program called "Visas Condor," State
Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Condor applications are circulated to the FBI and various
intelligence agencies whose analysts attempt to "connect the dots" to
uncover suspected terrorists or associations that might not pop up in
records checks, officials said. It is the Condor visa applicants who
will likely be targeted for secondary inspection at the airport,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the time this type of analysis needs, the State
Department has been warning foreign nationals to expect delays of six
weeks or longer in getting visas. And U.S. embassies cannot say for
sure how long it will take to give applicants any answer at all.</TE>
<TE>   The delays are creating problems for some travelers, including
students and people coming to the U.S. for medical treatment, though
it is difficult to quantify the extent of the situation. The State
Department does not release statistics on the number of people denied
visas from each country, and it is impossible to confirm or refute
anecdotal reports that a disproportionate number of Middle Easterners
are being refused visas or made to wait so long they abandon their
travel plans.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, international travel to the U.S. was down 11% in 2001,
nearly all of it in the fourth quarter, representing a loss of nearly
$10 billion in revenue, according to Cathy Keefe, spokeswoman for the
Travel Industry Assn. A slight rebound was forecast for 2002, but the
number of international visitors is not expected to recover until
well into 2003, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mayo Clinic, which provides medical care to up to 10,000
foreigners a year, has seen a 50% drop in the number of patients
coming from the Middle East--about 1,000 people since the visa
restrictions were imposed, said the clinic's Stephen Gudgell.</TE>
<TE>   Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and
development at the University of Maryland, said that even prominent
Middle Easterners who have been frequent visitors to the United
States have had trouble securing visas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become so difficult for them ... and some are so disgusted
by the process itself that they don't want to come, and some are
genuinely fearful," said Telhami, who was part of a recent Council on
Foreign Relations task force that concluded the U.S. was losing the
international public relations war.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable that you want to make it harder for the bad
guys to come in ... yet these steps are alienating them and making it
harder to build ... bridges," Telhami said. "You don't want in the
process of fighting terrorism to take steps that will play into the
terrorists' hands."</TE>

<HD>Suspect in '97 Glendale Slaying to Be Tried in Mexican
Court</HD>

<LD>A Mexican national wanted in a 1997 fatal shooting at a Glendale
restaurant faces prosecution on a murder charge in a Mexican court
based on evidence gathered by Glendale police investigators,
authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Adrian Ramirez Gutierrez, who was arrested on a provisional arrest
warrant issued by the U.S. attorney's office, is being held in a
Mexico City prison, said Glendale Robbery-Homicide Det. Mike Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican authorities initially declined extradition because Mexico
does not extradite its citizens to the U.S. to face criminal charges
that could result in life imprisonment or the death penalty, Toledo
said.</LD>
<TE>   United States authorities, however, invoked a section of the
Mexican federal penal code that provides for prosecution of Mexican
citizens using evidence collected by foreign governments, Toledo
said. The murder charge could bring a sentence of one to 60 years
under Mexican law.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez Gutierrez, 33, is accused of shooting to death an
acquaintance, Jose Catalan, during an argument in December 1997
outside the Taco Naco restaurant in Glendale, Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez Gutierrez fled to Mexico shortly after the shooting,
Toledo said.</TE>

<HD>Retail Boom Underway in Ventura</HD>
<DH>Business: New shopping centers are going up and some
existing ones are getting face-lifts. Supermarkets are also being
expanded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with an increase in new homes, Ventura is undergoing a spurt of
retail growth as several shopping centers are being built and
existing ones receive major face-lifts.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the Barnes &amp; Noble at the Ventura Gateway Plaza, at
the site of the former 101 Drive-in, opened its doors one day after a
Vons on East Thompson Boulevard in midtown Ventura closed to make way
for a larger Vons.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a boom going on right now," said Stratis Perros, an
associate planner with the city. "There have been a lot of
demographic changes with people from Santa Barbara and Los Angeles
moving to this area.</LD>
<TE>   "Overall, Ventura is becoming more of an affluent community.
Retailers recognize that trend and with the population rising you
need more shopping," Perros added.</TE>
<TE>   Montalvo Square on South Victoria Avenue north of the Ventura
Freeway has all of its major anchors in place--including a Longs
Drugs and LA Fitness spa--with only a few small retail spots
remaining to be leased.</TE>
<TE>   The center includes a Ralphs grocery store that moved in May from
its previous location across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Another Vons, in the Victoria Plaza on Telegraph Road, also in
midtown, will be expanding next year.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, instead of relocating the supermarkets, the company
is demolishing the existing buildings and replacing them with a
bigger store on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Remodeling was considered for both sites, but because of the ages
of the buildings--the Telegraph Road store was built in the
mid-1950s--it was more cost-effective to start from scratch, Perros
said.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the shops surrounding the grocery stores will
receive exterior face-lifts that will match the designs of the new
markets.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ventura Gateway Plaza, Barnes &amp; Noble becomes the second of
the center's three anchors to open its doors. Pier One, which also
moved from a smaller nearby site, held its grand opening Friday. A
Kohl's department store is expected to open by spring.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants Macaroni Grill and Applebee's are expected to open by
year's end at Gateway Plaza, and the center should have a Linens N
Things and smaller retailers opening by spring.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new center has attracted tenants from a competitor,
Perros said the former sites will most likely be leased soon.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that residential vacancies are tight in this area;
well, so are commercial ones," Perros said. "I can't imagine spaces
staying open too long, especially the ones with good visibility."</TE>
<TE>   Bookstore manager Stephanie Krueger said the Barnes &amp; Noble was
nearing its ninth anniversary at the old site, 4360 E. Main St., and
needed room to expand.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a community full of readers that are every age, sex and
ethnic background. Ventura has needed a larger bookstore for years,"
said Krueger, who has managed the Ventura store for three years.</TE>
<TE>   And a number of those customers turned out Tuesday night to
preview the new store. For three hours, employees dressed in evening
attire greeted those getting a first look at the two-story,
30,000-square-foot bookstore that is twice as large as the one it
replaces.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping a car ride would lull their 9-month-old son to sleep,
Martina Migenes and Scotty Morris were cruising by when a full
parking lot and a steady stream of people entering the brightly
lighted building caught their attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea that it was already open but it's pretty great,"
said longtime Ventura resident Morris, the lead singer for the band
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. "I know a lot of people are bummed out about
the city's development but I like it. It's great to have some place
in Ventura that stays open until 11 every night."</TE>
<TE>   Along with more books, the new store adds a large cafe and a
music-listening system that lets customers listen to any CD in the
store by passing it under a scanner.</TE>
<TE>   Customer Joan Barminski of Ventura said she was most impressed by
the children's section on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a treat to have such a large kids' section. The
one at the other store was so small," Barminski said. "I just hope
[Ventura] can support a store of this size."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Councilman James Monahan said that he has no doubts
the Gateway Plaza development will succeed as well as the other
commercial developments in town.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finally catching up with the growth of the population. It's
been tight. The positive changes that have been made in the downtown
area are finally spreading to other areas," Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all good for the city."</TE>

<HD>Former Trojan Charged With Felony DUI</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former San Francisco 49er and USC All-American lineman Jeff Bregel
was charged Wednesday with felony driving under the influence--his
sixth such arrest since 1988, according to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Bregel, who is to be arraigned Sept. 18, faces up to four years in
state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Diamond said.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old Granada Hills resident also could have his
probation revoked in an unrelated misdemeanor case in which he
threatened to injure a prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   Early Monday, Bregel was returning home in his mother's car when
he rear-ended another car traveling east on Rinaldi Street at Balboa
Boulevard in Granada Hills, prosecutors and police said.</TE>
<TE>   The second car overturned and the driver reported neck and back
pains, Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Bregel refused to take a sobriety test, Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   According to defense attorney Carey Caruso, Bregel said he hit the
other car after it left a service station without its lights on.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol certainly wasn't the major factor," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Bregel was an All-American offensive guard for the USC Trojans in
1985 and 1986 as well as an Academic All-American.</TE>
<TE>   He was picked in the second round of the 1987 NFL draft by the
49ers and played with them for three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Bregel was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.</TE>

<LD>A statewide "Be a Patriot" billboard campaign was unveiled Wednesday
to build awareness of a license plate that memorializes victims of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue generated by the plates will go toward scholarships for
children of about 200 Californians killed in the attacks, as well as
anti-terrorism programs. Thousands of license plates have been issued
so far, said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who wrote
the legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Registered drivers can fill out application forms for the new
plates at DMV offices statewide, online at www.dmv.ca.gov, or by
calling (800) 777-0133.</LD>

<LD>A 55-year-old tree trimmer was crushed to death Wednesday in the Hyde
Park area as he was working 30 feet above ground on a palm tree when
part of the tree came down on him, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, who was working for a private company, died as
firefighters tried to bring him down from the tree, said Bob Collis
of the city Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities withheld the victim's name, pending notification of
relatives. It appears he cut an upper section of the tree, which then
slid down, striking the man and possibly crushing him against the
trunk of the tree, Collis said.</LD>

<LD>A self-described psychic and her husband admitted in federal court
Wednesday that they concealed more than $850,000 in income earned
over a five-year period while operating a fortune-telling business in
Manhattan Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Pleading guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service, Sonia Merino, 50, and her husband, Steve, 44, each
face possible sentences of 18 to 24 months in prison under terms of a
plea agreement with prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   They also will be required to pay more than $316,000 in
restitution to the IRS. The couple were named earlier this year in a
12-count indictment that accused Sonia Merino of also bilking
clients.</LD>
<TE>   Those other charges are expected to be dropped when the Merinos
are sentenced Nov. 18, but the couple must make $60,000 restitution
to those victims.</TE>

<HD>Legislature's Budget Process Needs to Be Torn Down and
Rebuilt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Can the Legislature be fixed so it no longer plays fiddle-faddle and
rants rubbish all summer? So it stops blowing off the California
Constitution and the public and passes a budget on time?</LD>
<LD>   Of course. Some tinkering would help. But what this structure
really needs is outright demolition.</LD>
<LD>   There's increasing talk about it after the
Legislature--specifically the Assembly--postured and vacillated for
62 days into the new fiscal year before finally passing a $98-billion
budget.</LD>
<TE>   Without a budget, private vendors were stiffed millions. Services
were pared for the elderly and disabled. Schools were left hanging.</TE>
<TE>   So the first thing that's needed is to inflict even greater pain
on legislators. Change their behavior with a nasty deterrent that
whacks the lawmakers' own budgets.</TE>
<TE>   If there's no state budget by the start of the fiscal year, July
1, the lawmakers' $99,000 salaries--$113,850 for leaders--should be
docked each day that a budget isn't passed. No retroactive pay later.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, they should permanently lose their $121 per day,
tax-free expense allowances for each day there's no budget.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis actually endorsed that idea when he first ran for
governor in 1998. "We're sent [to Sacramento] to do the work of the
people," Davis asserted during a debate. "When people don't work,
they're not paid. That same rule should apply to those of us in
Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   OK, dock the governor's $165,000 salary too.</TE>
<TE>   Also, focus the lawmakers' minds: Forbid them from voting on any
other bill after July 1 until a budget is passed.</TE>
<TE>   And don't allow either house to recess. If the Senate again passes
a budget first, it should stick around to offer the Assembly mature
guidance.</TE>
<TE>   But this is mostly tinkering.</TE>
<TE>   The big culprit is the two-thirds majority vote requirement for
passage of a budget. It should be scheduled for demolition at some
future state election.</TE>
<TE>   The two-thirds requirement was the brainchild of do-gooders in the
1800s. They theorized that if the Legislature were straitjacketed,
spending would be held down. Right!</TE>
<TE>   It "has just as often actually increased state spending," a
bipartisan citizens commission reported in 1995. "Stories abound of
'buying' votes to reach the two-thirds."</TE>
<TE>   Few other states require super-majority votes for a budget.</TE>
<TE>   In California's Capitol, it gives minority Republicans relevance.
Although badly outnumbered in both houses, at least some
Republicans--four in the Assembly, one in the Senate--must be
romanced by Democrats to help pass a budget.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans have abused this power by tying up the Democrats'
budget proposals without offering alternatives. By not negotiating
realistically. Or at all.</TE>
<TE>   The majority party should be empowered to govern and then be held
accountable by voters. Now, lines of responsibility are blurred.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits is another wicked culprit. It's even worse than people
think.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly members are inexperienced in crafting deals. Many also
are ignorant of state government.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the "veteran" Assembly members about to be termed-out
are treated as has-beens and not used in budget talks. Veterans like
former Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and former
Appropriations Committee head Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) sat on
the sidelines in their sixth year. A waste of experience.</TE>
<TE>   Don't demolish term limits. But expand them to practical lengths,
like 12 years in each house.</TE>
<TE>   Do demolish the primary election system.</TE>
<TE>   This system--combined with the incumbent-friendly redrawing of
legislative districts--has led increasingly to the election of
extremists, Republican and Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Supreme Court abolished California's open primary
system, only party members and independents now can vote in a
primary. That bars moderates of the other party. And because these
districts were drawn to be slam-dunks for the incumbent party in
November, all the action is in the primary. Republicans run to the
right and Democrats to the left.</TE>
<TE>   Once elected, Republicans must guard their right flanks against
future primary challenges. So they refuse to vote for a tax increase
to balance a budget. Similarly, Democrats resist deep cuts in social
programs.</TE>
<TE>   A solution is being developed by the state Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   It's contemplating a ballot measure that would make all
legislative, congressional and statewide primaries similar to mayoral
races: They'd be open to all voters and not be party primaries.
Candidates could run with party designations, but there'd be no party
nominees. Instead, the top two vote-getters--regardless of
party--would compete in November.</TE>
<TE>   That is major demolition. And overdue.</TE>
<TE>   But let's start by cutting off the dawdlers' pay.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Accuser Held in Stockton</HD>
<DH>Crime: He is charged with extortion in alleging molestation
by the L.A. cardinal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who accused Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of molesting him two
decades ago has been charged with extortion of the Catholic Church,
filing a false police report and other crimes, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Loren Mitchell Saffels, 34, told Stockton police in June that he
had been molested in 1982 by Mahony, who was bishop of Stockton, and
a local priest.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate case, Fresno police in April dismissed as
unsubstantiated a woman's allegations of personal misconduct against
Mahony.</LD>
<TE>   After a three-month investigation by Stockton police, prosecutors
decided to charge Saffels, who was described in an arrest warrant as
a con artist with a criminal history of fraud, theft and
impersonating a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased that we were able to apprehend this suspect,"
said San Joaquin County Dist. Atty. John D. Phillips. "There are
legitimate victims of this type of crime, and this makes it more
difficult and burdensome for people that may have a legitimate case."</TE>
<TE>   Saffels had presented officials of the Stockton Diocese on May 31
with a journal that he said detailed the alleged misconduct. He
demanded $1 million for "past, present and future" damages and a
written apology, according to a sworn statement filed with the
request for a warrant for Saffels' arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, a Mahony spokesman, said the cardinal was pleased.
Tamberg said Mahony, head of the nation's largest Roman Catholic
diocese, had maintained that the charges were baseless. "As I said
before, it was a false allegation," Tamberg said. "We are pleased
that the Stockton Police Department has followed up on this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Saffels, who was being held in lieu of $200,000 bail, appeared
briefly in San Joaquin County Superior Court to plead not guilty to
the charges, which included embezzlement, grand theft from an
employer not connected with the church and passing worthless checks.</TE>
<TE>   The case became public in June, when the Los Angeles Archdiocese
issued a news release announcing Saffels' allegations and the
cardinal's denial.</TE>
<TE>   Saffels told Stockton police that he was first victimized in 1982,
when he was 13 and doing part-time work at two Stockton churches,
according to a sworn statement filed in the criminal case by Stockton
Police Det. Grant Bedford.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin County prosecutors said they had doubts about his
story from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   From interviews and a criminal background check, they determined
that Saffels was a con artist who had left a trail of fraud and theft
victims in Hawaii and Oregon in the last three years, according to
the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Saffels also is wanted in Illinois on suspicion of impersonating a
police officer, the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Police interviewed the defendant's father, who said that neither
he nor his son was Catholic, and that his son had no Catholic
orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Saffels' allegations against a parish priest, Father Oliver
O'Grady, also were dismissed by police.</TE>
<TE>   "[Saffels' father] considers his son to be a con artist, and he
could not think of any connection between Father O'Grady, the church
or his son," according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a Fresno woman with a history of mental illness
claimed that Mahony molested her 32 years ago. The cardinal, who
denied the allegations, was cleared by police within a month.</TE>

<HD>330-Acre Project in Camarillo Advances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developers seeking to put more than 1,000 homes on strawberry fields
at the foot of the Conejo Grade have received the go-ahead from the
Camarillo Planning Commission.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the City Council, the development would be built on
one of the largest remaining pieces of farmland in the city. Called
Village at the Park, the project would cover 330 acres bordered by
the Ventura Freeway to the north and Pleasant Valley Road to the
south, east of Lewis Road and west of Calle de la Rosa.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners on Tuesday unanimously recommended changing the
land's zoning to allow for the first phase of the project, which
would ultimately include 1,060 homes, a 55-acre park, retail space, a
five-acre YMCA site and 10 acres for a new elementary school.</LD>
<TE>   The commission's recommendation will be forwarded to the Camarillo
City Council, which approved the project's environmental impact
report in September 2001 and is expected to approve the project at an
upcoming meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners received their first look Wednesday at details of
the proposed development, viewing sketches of housing styles and
floor plans for the subdivision's 672 single-family homes, which
would range in size from 1,760 to 3,575 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hardgrave, a representative of the developers, said
architects had designed the homes to de-emphasize garages along the
fronts of the houses and make the neighborhood more
pedestrian-friendly. "We wanted to create character and a sense of
identity in the neighborhoods," Hardgrave said. "This project will
add a great deal to the community."</TE>
<TE>   The commission opted to postpone a recommendation on the
subdivision maps and floor plans until its Sept. 17 meeting, to give
the city planning staff a chance to fine-tune the project
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the single-family homes, developers plan about 380
townhouses and apartments. Although specific plans are yet to be
ironed out, Camarillo Planning Director Bob Burrow said the city
hopes to work out an agreement that would designate some of the homes
as affordable housing. "We don't have an ordinance, but we do have a
policy that says we strive for that," he said.</TE>

<HD>Newport Harbor Crossing Is Also a Voyage Through Time</HD>
<DH>Landmarks: Balboa Island commuters and visitors rely on
ferry to get around. Some hope it will just keep going and going and
going, say its operators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Balboa Island Ferry has been the workhorse of Newport Harbor
since 1919, moving folks slowly but surely between the peninsula and
the island.</LD>
<LD>   Service has been halted only a few times--mostly for bad weather,
but occasionally for accidents, such as the one Labor Day in which a
driver lost control of her car while trying to board the barge.</LD>
<LD>   Ferry service was halted as 13 people were injured in the
accident. But only briefly.</LD>
<TE>   The ferry fleet consists of three 65-foot boats that chug 900 feet
each day every five minutes from 6:30 a.m. until midnight--24 hours a
day during peak summer seasons--transporting locals and tourists
between Agate Avenue on Balboa Island and Palm Street on the Balboa
Peninsula. The diesel-fueled boats connect an estimated 2.5 million
people with work, beach homes, school and stores each year.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 mph top speed, the ride won't generate much of a thrill. But
the three-minute crossing provides a breathtaking view of a bay
filled with sails and yachts and lined by beautiful homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does give you [an] identity when you own a ferry,"
said Seymour Beek, 68, whose family's name has been synonymous with
the ferry for 83 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind being identified with some other characteristic,
like being a great sailor or something," he said, "but people
remember [me] by saying, 'Oh, there's Seymour. He's the ferry guy.'
That's my identity."</TE>
<TE>   Beek, who retired as a program manager at Ford Aerospace in
Newport Beach 10 years ago, manages the ferry part time with three
others. He and his older brothers, Allan and Barton, grew up two
blocks from the ferry and worked on the boats during their school
years.</TE>
<TE>   They also make up the board of directors for the ferry
corporation. Seymour Beek, who lives in the old family home on Bay
Front, has served as president since his father Joe's death in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the boats have been hit by tough times, heavy
weather and errant yachts.</TE>
<TE>   But they've also had their moments in the limelight, such as
serving as backdrop for an Abbott and Costello movie and for
weddings.</TE>
<TE>   For locals, the ferries provide not only a needed service, but
also a link to the past. As a result, there is always an undercurrent
of concern over whether they will cease operation.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to be assured that the ferries will keep going, so we
reassure them just by keeping the ferries going," Beek said. "It's
convenient for a lot of commuters, but there's a whole contingent of
people who ride it like an amusement ride. For some people, part of
the tour of Newport and Balboa is a ride on the ferry."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the ferry's charm is its bulky, tugboat appeal and the
fact that it's one of the few such turn-of-the-last-century services
still operating. Plus, its fare is a bargain: $1.25 for a car and
driver, 50 cents for walk-ons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live and drive around the peninsula, you take the ferry,"
said Marcus De Chevrieux, curator of the Newport Harbor Nautical
Museum.</TE>

driver lost control of her car while trying to board the barge.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen people were injured in the accident, and ferry service
was halted.But only briefly.</LD>
<TE>   The ferry fleet consists of three 64-foot boats that chug 900 feet
each day every five minutes from 6:30 a.m. until midnight--24 hours a
day during the peak summer season--transporting locals and tourists
between Agate Avenue on Balboa Island and Palm Street on the Balboa
Peninsula. The diesel-fueled boats connect an estimated 2.5 million
riders with work, beach homes, school and stores each year.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 mph top speed, the ride won't generate much of a thrill. But
the three-minute crossing provides a breathtaking view of a bay
filled with sails and yachts and lined by beautiful homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does give you [an] identity when you own a ferry,"
said Seymour Beek, 68, whose family's name has been synonymous with
the ferry for 83 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind being identified with some other characteristic,
like being a great sailor or something," he said, "but people
remember [me] by saying, 'Oh, there's Seymour. He's the ferry guy.'
That's my identity."</TE>
<TE>   Beek, who retired as a program manager at Ford Aerospace in
Newport Beach 10 years ago, manages the ferry part time with three
others. He and his older brothers, Allan and Barton, grew up two
blocks from the ferry and worked on the boats during their school
years.</TE>
<TE>   They also make up the board of directors for the ferry
corporation. Seymour Beek, who lives in the old family home on Bay
Front, has served as president since his father, Joe, died in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the boats have been hit by tough times, heavy
weather and errant yachts. But they've also had their moments in the
limelight, such as serving as backdrop for an Abbott and Costello
movie and for weddings.</TE>
<TE>   For locals, the ferries provide not only a needed service, but
also a link to the past. As a result, there is always an undercurrent
of concern over whether they will cease operation.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to be assured that the ferries will keep going, so we
reassure them just by keeping the ferries going," Beek said. "It's
convenient for a lot of commuters, but there's a whole contingent of
people who ride it like an amusement ride. For some people, part of
the tour of Newport and Balboa is a ride on the ferry."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the ferry's charm is its bulky, tugboat appeal and the
fact that it's one of the few such turn-of-the-last-century services
still operating. Plus, its fare is a bargain: $1.25 for a car and
driver, 50 cents for walk-ons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live and drive around the peninsula, you take the ferry,"
said Marcus De Chevrieux, curator of the Newport Harbor Nautical
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just what you do. It's so well-known, it's taken for
granted. It's been a landmark to Newport Harbor since the turn of the
century. It's like everyone's third-favorite thing to do in Newport
Harbor. It's unique."</TE>

<HD>Blazes Disrupt Road, Rail Traffic</HD>
<DH>Fires: Flames stall I-15 traffic in Norco and trains in
Canyon Country. A woman thanks deputies who saved her from killing
herself as fire advanced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New fires in Norco and Soledad Canyon disrupted traffic on a busy
freeway and an important rail line Wednesday as firefighters
continued to battle two much larger blazes in the mountainous
backcountry north of Los Angeles, including the 16,000-acre Curve
fire north of Azusa.</LD>
<LD>   A woman who was rescued from the Curve fire Sunday by two Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said she will be forever grateful
to them.</LD>
<LD>   "They are just like angels," said Sigrid Hopson, who was about to
shoot herself when the officers burst through the smoke. "They have
so much to live for yet, and I just don't think it would have been
right if they died for me."</LD>
<TE>   Hopson, 60, said she has taken solace in the San Gabriel
Mountains, living year-round in a cabin at Soldier's Creek since her
son was killed in a car crash 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire raced toward her refuge on Sunday, she was prepared to
commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   She released two of her dogs and shot her crippled dog, Donnie,
because she didn't think he could survive. She was sitting on the
floor of her cabin wearing her sister's jewelry and with the gun in
her lap when Deputies John Rose and Paul Archambault arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The two men had come for her after she called her ex-husband and
told him she planned to commit suicide to avoid burning to death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a miracle," she said of their daring getaway. "There
was just a solid wall of fire ... then the wind blew from behind them
and made a tunnel of fire, and they just stepped on the gas and drove
through this tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies spirited Hopson to safety, and she is now staying at
an Azusa motel, waiting until she can return to her home, which she
said was not destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "I protected this forest for so many years," she said. "So maybe
God is paying me back and let my cabin stand."</TE>
<TE>   The Curve fire broke out Sunday afternoon beside California 39
near Rincon. Officials said fire investigators had concluded that
"candles associated with a ritual involving the use of fire and
animal sacrifices started the fire."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was about 15% contained by Wednesday night, with full
containment not expected for about a week.</TE>
<TE>   It was burning beneath major transmission lines delivering
electricity to Southern California from the north.</TE>
<TE>   The California Independent System Operator, which matches supply
to demand in much of the state, reduced the power flow on the lines
as a precaution, so that a sudden loss from a line failure would not
disrupt the entire system.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that no blackouts were anticipated, but that the
reduced flow could jeopardize the ability to respond to an unexpected
surge in electricity demand.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Norco fire broke out beneath the Interstate 15
bridges over the brush-choked Santa Ana River bed. The flames, which
were knocked down after charring about four acres, halted freeway
traffic in both directions for more than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol said several motorists attempting to
double back to nearby exits triggered minor traffic accidents,
turning what at best is a slow drive home into a traffic jam for
thousands of evening commuters.</TE>
<TE>   A 60-acre blaze straddled the railroad tracks about three miles
east of Canyon Country Wednesday afternoon, briefly blocking
Metrolink commuter and Union Pacific freight traffic on the main rail
line between Los Angeles and Palmdale. No structures were endangered
and no evacuations were ordered.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was contained Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the big fires in the hills near the Leona Valley
and north of Azusa were have blackened more than 20,000 acres,
destroying at least 78 buildings and forcing the evacuation of
thousands of residents and campers.</TE>
<TE>   The fires were burning in brush and timberland parched by one of
the driest years on record, but forecasters said clouds spun off by a
rapidly deteriorating tropical storm off the coast of Baja California
will bring a 50% chance of rain by this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Leona Valley fire, which destroyed four homes and two
outbuildings on Bouquet Canyon Road on Tuesday afternoon, was 40%
contained Wednesday night after burning about 4,500 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County fire officials said that although diminishing
winds had slowed the spread of the blaze toward Palmdale, several
residential areas, including Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde,
Desert View Highlands and Lost Valley, were still in danger.</TE>
<TE>   That fire started Tuesday afternoon beside Bouquet Canyon Road,
spreading rapidly through heavy brush and quickly enveloping several
homes in the heart of the Leona Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At least 250 residents fled the advancing flames, but many of them
had returned by Wednesday afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Beating of Actor Is Investigated as a Hate Crime</HD>
<DH>Violence: Victim is in a coma after he and friend were
attacked in West Hollywood by two men.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 people attended a candlelight prayer vigil Wednesday
for a 33-year-old West Hollywood man who was critically wounded by a
bat-wielding attacker in an assault being investigated as a hate
crime, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Treve Broudy, a 33-year-old actor, was struck in the back of the
head, kicked and punched as he and a friend walked in the 8900 block
of Cynthia Street near San Vicente Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Broudy was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was
listed in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery to
stop bleeding around the brain. He has been unconscious since the
attack.</LD>
<TE>   Edward Lett, 22, of Los Angeles was treated for minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "We are treating this as a high priority, not only as an assault
but as a hate crime," said Capt. Lynda R. Castro, of the West
Hollywood Sheriff's Station. "This involves two gay men in a city
with a significant gay population. Any attack like this is horrific.
You have to treat it as an ugly incident."</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred about 12:20 a.m. Monday as the two friends
said goodbye after having dinner, she said. As they embraced, a car
pulled up with three men inside. Two men jumped out--one with what
was believed to be a baseball bat. Words were exchanged and the men
were attacked, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant smashed two windows on Letts' car and struck him on
the arm as he managed to speed off, Castro said. Two witnesses
driving by saw Broudy punched and kicked. They flashed their lights
and the attackers fled, she said. The witnesses called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators plan to release a sketch of the suspects today.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen detectives and deputy sheriffs have been
canvassing the West Hollywood community for witnesses. News of the
beating spread quickly through the community, where hate crime
incidents such as inflammatory e-mails and graffiti are regularly
reported to officials. The city recently dedicated a small park in
memory of hate-crime victim Matthew Shepard, who was killed in 1998
in Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's vigil, friends, city officials and neighbors
gathered to celebrate Broudy's life and to bring attention to the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   They talked about his career as an actor and his love for hiking
and travel.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a beautiful spirit," said Roberta Farkas, a friend. "He had
a wonderful voice. He loves to sing. He should be on Broadway."</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Joy Verner, of Little River, Calif., urged the
gathering to pray for her son.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the least violent person you would ever come across," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Sherrill Broudy, of Santa Barbara, also was at the
vigil.</TE>
<TE>   "He just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time," he
said. "I just hope they catch whoever did it, not just so they can be
punished but to make sure they don't do something like this again."</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Agrees to Pay Fine for Care Lapse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California HMO regulators have fined Kaiser Permanente $100,000 for
failing to provide a disabled member with home health-care services
despite agreeing to do so, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In levying the fine, the state Department of Managed Health Care
cited the experience of Alex Stoyanovsky, a Fairfield resident with
Lou Gehrig's disease, who received inconsistent home health-care
services from a Kaiser contractor between February 2001 and March of
this year.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said Kaiser violated a decision by an independent panel
of medical experts requiring the HMO to provide 12 hours of home
health care each day to Stoyanovsky, who died in July at age 41.
Regulators did not, however, contend that Stoyanovsky died as a
result of deficient home health care.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Zingale, director of the managed-care agency, said Kaiser's
failings extended beyond Stoyanovsky's case. A survey conducted by
the agency found other patients who did not receive home health-care
services as promised.</TE>
<TE>   "The fine was magnified by the fact that it wasn't an isolated
case," Zingale said. "It's a very positive sign that Kaiser is
willing to accept responsibility for failing in the area of home
health care and working with us to do better."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser officials said they chose not to contest the state's
findings and instead would work to correct them. In particular, the
HMO agreed to create a system to monitor the performance of home
health-care agencies that provide services under contracts with
Kaiser.</TE>
<TE>   "We're satisfied with how this whole process worked," said Kaiser
spokesman Tom Debley. "There's certainly work to be done, but we are
underway."</TE>
<TE>   Lina Stoyanovsky, Alex's wife, said she hopes no other family has
to go through the ordeal of caring for a terminally ill loved one
without enough support. When home health-care nurses didn't show
up--sometimes because the agency didn't have enough
staff--Stoyanovsky was her husband's only caregiver. "At one point, I
was suicidal. I couldn't handle it," said Stoyanovsky, who emigrated
from Russia 15 years ago. "There were weeks when I couldn't wash my
hair ....I just couldn't leave the room."</TE>
<TE>   Stoyanovsky said she hopes the insurer will improve its system
soon. "I still believe that even one person can make a difference,"
she said. "I hope ... that in the future, other people can benefit
somehow."</TE>

<HD>Redondo Police Get New Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redondo Beach reached outside the city for a new Police Department
leader, on Wednesday announcing the hiring of former Long Beach Chief
Robert M. Luman.</LD>
<LD>   After retiring from a 32-year career in Long Beach, Luman served
for several months in 2000 as interim chief in Riverside, where the
department was trying to recover from fallout from the 1998 police
killing of a young black woman who had passed out in her car.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing his appointment of Luman to the $132,780-a-year
post, Redondo Beach City Manager Lou Garcia cited the new chief's
"sterling reputation as a policeman and as an innovative police
executive."</LD>
<TE>   Luman, 55, will start his new job Monday. Over three decades with
the Long Beach department, he served in nearly every role, beginning
as a patrol and juvenile officer in 1968 and moving through the ranks
with duties that included leader of the SWAT team, acting commander
of special investigations and deputy chief.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, four years after the city manager fired Chief Lawrence
Binkley, Luman, who had earned a reputation as a reformer and a
builder of community trust, got the department's top job and held it
until his retirement three years later.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside, trying to turn around its department after the shooting
of 19-year-old Tyisha Miller brought national outrage and a probe by
the U.S. attorney's office, soon coaxed Luman out of retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He was widely credited with stabilizing the department and
implementing reforms during his eight months as interim chief.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he also considered Capt. Steve Murdoch, saying he had
done a "fine job" as acting chief since Mel Nichols' retirement last
year, and was a "great policeman with a long, distinguished career of
service to the department and the community." But Garcia said he
opted ultimately for Luman's "broad experience."</TE>
<TE>   The department's 108 sworn personnel and 81 other employees serve
an ethnically and economically diverse city of about 63,000.</TE>

<HD>Marblehead Project Would Devastate Site, Scientists Say</HD>
<DH>Environment: Coastal Commission staff urges panel to deny
the San Clemente development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful state agency's staff is urging rejection of a proposal to
turn 250 acres of sandstone coastal bluffs in San Clemente into a
tony subdivision and commercial center.</LD>
<LD>   The California Coastal Commission's staff said the revised plan
for Marblehead is improved over one that commissioners were poised to
veto last year. But staff scientists concluded that the downsized
project still would have devastating impacts on coastal canyons and
sensitive habitats on the prime real estate.</LD>
<LD>   Once the proposed site for a Nixon library, Marblehead is among
the last large, undeveloped coastal parcels in Southern California.
The Lusk Co. now proposes building 351 homes and 671,506 square feet
of commercial space--down from 424 homes and 700,140 square feet the
developer sought in the plan it presented last year.</LD>
<TE>   Even with more open space added to the new plan, commission
employees said the project would harm the area's water quality,
wetlands, coastal sage and rare flora and fauna such as Blochman's
dudleya plants and the coastal California gnatcatcher. And proposed
grading of nearly 2.5 million cubic yards of soil and the filling of
canyons "would dramatically transform the natural landscapes on the
site," according to the report, which was released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Lusk Co. officials about the staff
recommendation were unsuccessful Wednesday. The commission is
scheduled to vote on the proposal Tuesday when it meets in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Lusk Co. and the Coastal Commission have battled before. At
the March 2001 meeting, the state panel reacted with such vitriol to
a prior proposal--admonishing Lusk Chief Executive Jim Johnson to
"try and be a little less greedy"--that the company withdrew its
plans rather than face a vote. Commissioners also gave the developer
a laundry list of project features to be modified to make the
proposal consistent with the state's Coastal Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the proposed project is notably improved compared with
the previous project, the current proposal still raises significant
issues," the staff report says.</TE>
<TE>   The grading has been reduced by a third and the number of homes
has been decreased, while the amount of open space has increased to
77 acres from 58 acres. Park space increased to 14 acres from 12.</TE>
<TE>   The overall square footage of commercial development planned for
22 acres of the property has been decreased, but the density of shops
and businesses that would be clustered nearest the ocean has nearly
doubled to 141,506 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's so disappointing about it--they think by fudging
the numbers a little bit, they'll be able to essentially build the
same project" that was rejected previously, said Mark Massara,
coastal programs director for the Sierra Club. "This is one of the
last remaining open spaces in Orange County in an otherwise
overbuilt, overcrowded and exceedingly polluted corridor. No coastal
community deserves a project like Marblehead."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente officials beg to differ. The city, which repeatedly
has approved the project in its various forms over the years, is
relying on it to plump up its coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for this property to be developed," Councilwoman Susan
Ritschel said. "The city has planned on that property being
developed, and has been looking forward to the sales-tax revenue
generated from it."</TE>
<TE>   Marblehead was expected to generate $2 million a year in sales
taxes and account for 51% of the city's new retail sales tax business
growth over the next 10 years. When the developer withdrew its
project last year rather than risk a commission veto, the city
delayed a number of local projects, including a new senior center and
a fire station. "It's a local-control issue," Ritschel said. "Right
now, it looks like we have no control over what happens on that piece
of property, and it's frustrating."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The son of an Orange County assistant sheriff has accused
investigators of interfering with his ability to defend himself on
gang rape charges after they seized fliers that sought information
about the alleged victim.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Haidl, one of three teenagers accused in the July 5
videotaped drugging and rape of a 16-year-old girl at Haidl's
father's Corona del Mar home, made the allegations in a claim filed
against San Bernardino County and obtained by the Inland Valley Daily
Bulletin of Ontario. Haidl lives with his mother in Alta Loma.</LD>
<LD>   He is seeking up to $100 million in damages, according to the
claim, often a precursor to a lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   The claim alleges that San Bernardino County deputies seized the
fliers from a store window and other locations.</TE>
<TE>   Haidl, Kyle Joseph Nachreiner and Keith James Spann, all 17, were
charged as adults and have pleaded not guilty to 21 felony counts
that include rape, rape by a foreign object and administering a drug
to incapacitate the victim.</TE>

<LD>The Los Alamitos News-Enterprise said that officers checked out a

more than a woman singing.</LD>
<LD>   Modern living:</LD>

<TE>   A condo whose amenities include a dad (Valerie Anne Bishop).</TE>

where it's OK to shoot yourself in the foot (Michael Meyer of Palm

<TE>   Nosing out the competition: The 2003 Guinness Book of Records is
out, and it contains much for L.A. to be proud of. Daredevil feats
accomplished in the City of Angels include:</TE>
<TE>   * Fastest consumption of a bottle of tomato ketchup, 33 seconds,
by Dustin Phillips. He sucked down 14 ounces through a straw that was
a quarter-inch in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   * Longest "spaghetti strand blown out of a nostril in a single

<TE>   * Fastest backward run from L.A. to New York City, 107 days, by

<TE>   * Fastest chowing-down of wristwatches, one hour and 34 minutes,
by Kim Seung Do, who "ate five watches (the entire watches with the
exception of the wristbands)." I dunno. The fact that he passed on
the wristbands marred the performance for me. He could have put some
ketchup on them.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe a new Valley city should be run by a pharaoh, not a mayor:
Some descriptions of the San Fernando Valley on the colorful

<TE>   * "Putting me in a closed car and stewing me in the sun is not the
right way to guarantee my safety" (Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev

<HD>Accord Reached on Cost of Fires</HD>
<DH>Railroad: Company will pay settlement of more than $3
million over blazes near Oregon border allegedly caused by poor
maintenance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A railroad company that operates in a remote corner of Northern
California pleaded no contest Wednesday to inadvertently setting
numerous brush fires along the dry tracks because of poor train
maintenance.</LD>
<LD>   The Central Oregon &amp; Pacific Railroad, owned by Florida-based
RailAmerica Inc.--the world's largest short line and regional freight
railroad operator--agreed to pay more than $3 million in a civil
settlement stemming from years of persistent fires, Siskiyou County
Dist. Atty. Pete Knoll said.</LD>
<LD>   A December hearing was set to determine further restitution for a
2001 blaze the California Department of Forestry says cost more than
$500,000 to douse.</LD>
<TE>   The criminal pleas and civil settlement--completed in Superior
Court in Yreka--come during one of the West's worst fire seasons and
amid nationwide calls for corporate responsibility. The prosecution
was part of an effort by the California District Attorneys Assn. to
help underfunded rural counties battle environmental crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Siskiyou County has had dozens of blazes along the once-dormant
lines since the Roseburg, Ore.-based company began hauling timber to
the town of Weed in 1995, fire officials and prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Constrained by a statute of limitations, prosecutors filed felony
charges against the company last summer for recklessly starting 10
fires the preceding year. The civil settlement covered 37 fires over
a four-year period, because of a longer statute of limitations in
civil cases, Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Allen said. The 10 criminal
counts were reduced to misdemeanors as part of the plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and fire officials said years of efforts to prevent
the fires, allegedly caused by carbon-clogged spark arresters on
aging locomotives, yielded little. But after the felony criminal
complaint was filed, the company began upgrading and maintaining
equipment and running trains during cooler hours, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen said the criminal filing may have averted disaster during
two of the driest fire seasons in years.</TE>
<TE>   The company will be placed on three years' probation and assessed
$29,000 in fines and penalties. Although it admitted no liability in
the civil settlement, the company agreed to pay $175,000 in penalties
to Siskiyou County, an additional $29,000 to the California forestry
department for fire suppression costs, and restitution to private
property owners for at least $200,000 in damaged timber. The company
will also implement a $2.9-million fire safety plan over the next
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Hutchinson, the rail operator's attorney on the case, did
not return a call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Disease Adds Redwoods to Its Victims</HD>
<DH>Flora: Sudden oak death is found in coastal varieties and
in Douglas firs. The contagion has attacked 16 species of trees and
shrubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers have confirmed that one of California's most treasured
trees, the coast redwood, has been infected with a highly contagious
disease that has killed tens of thousands of oaks in the last several
years.</LD>
<LD>   Testing by University of California scientists shows that the
Douglas fir also is susceptible, bringing to 16 the number of species
of trees and shrubs that have been attacked by the disease--sudden
oak death--in California.</LD>
<LD>   Redwoods and Douglas firs are by far the most commercially
valuable of the infected species, although the fungus-like disease,
for which there is no cure, has so far been detected only in saplings
and sprouts of the two species.</LD>
<TE>   "What we think it means for commercial timberlands is nothing at
this point," said Donn Zea, president of the California Forest
Products Commission. "We haven't found anything."</TE>
<TE>   The two tree types will immediately be subject to state and
federal quarantine rules governing the movement of plants and tree
products affected by sudden oak death. But it does not appear that
the regulations will interfere with commercial lumber production to
any significant degree.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists said it was too soon to predict the disease's long-term
impact on redwoods, which grow to towering heights and can live for
two millenniums.</TE>
<TE>   "By looking around, we have no indication this is really killing
mature trees," said Matteo Garbelotto, a UC Berkeley adjunct
assistant professor and a leading researcher on sudden oak death.</TE>
<TE>   Testing by Garbelotto and UC Davis plant pathologist David Rizzo
found infected redwood saplings at Jack London State Park in Sonoma
County and Henry Cowell State Park in Santa Cruz County. The infected
Douglas fir saplings were found on state research station land in
Sonoma County. Researchers also have found DNA evidence of the
disease on redwood sprouts in Marin, Alameda and Monterey counties,
suggesting that it is in a number of locations.</TE>
<TE>   "We think on redwood it's quite widespread," Garbelotto said.</TE>
<TE>   Since it was discovered in Marin County tanoaks in 1995, sudden
oak death has been found in a variety of trees and shrubs growing in
the coastal forests of Central and Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We have rarely seen a pathogen affecting so many different host
species in the ecosystem and so many different parts. So what is the
cumulative effect in time?" Garbelotto wondered. "Is it going to
affect the overall productivity of the forest?"</TE>
<TE>   The infected species have exhibited varying degrees of resistance
to the disease, with tanoaks appearing to be the most susceptible.
The infection could greatly reduce the tanoak population, which,
though not commercially valuable, is important to wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Sudden oak death has been found in 12 counties, extending south
from Humboldt to Monterey. The farthest inland it has been detected
is Solano County.</TE>
<TE>   Among other species affected are coast live oak, Shreve oak, big
leaf maple, manzanita, madrone and California bay laurel.</TE>
<TE>   Bay, madrone and tanoaks seem to play the greatest roles in
spreading the disease, which is carried by spores that can travel
through the air or in moist soil.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators for months have been trying to iron out differences
between federal and state quarantine rules on sudden oak death. So
far neither set has had a major commercial impact.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a very workable situation, and we want to do
everything to make sure the disease is not spread into our commercial
timberlands," said Zea of the Forest Products Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Federal rules require logs to be debarked and certified free of
the disease before they can be shipped out of state. Zea said
inspections for the disease are already a standard part of timber
harvest plans. And mills, where logs are usually debarked, are
typically in the same county as logging sites. Some companies, such
as Pacific Lumber, one of the state's leading producers of redwood,
burn the bark to produce electricity, something they would still be
allowed to do.</TE>
<TE>   Selling bark for use as commercial garden cover may be another
matter, but regulators could not say Wednesday exactly how that
market might be affected.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Wednesday's infection news, Gov. Gray Davis said he
was asking President Bush for $10 million in federal funds to fight
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's announcement about sudden oak death in Douglas fir and
coast redwoods significantly raises the stakes," said Davis, adding
that the state is allocating $2 million this year to supplement $3.6
million approved last year.</TE>

<HD>Woman Files Civil Suit Against Boss Who Admitted Molesting
Her</HD>
<DH>Law: Plaintiff says sexual harassment began when she was
16. The businessman has pleaded guilty to eight felony charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura businessman who pleaded guilty to eight felony counts for
molesting a teenage girl who worked in his office is now being sued
by her in civil court.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, now 19, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit this week
against Peter Remedios, 64, and his Ventura-based property management
company, Intercontinental Realty.</LD>
<LD>   The suit accuses Remedios of fondling and performing sex acts on
the girl while she worked as a clerk in his office between December
1999 and October 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the incidents occurred at the Telegraph Road office,
according to the lawsuit, and began when she was 16.</TE>
<TE>   "This harassment took the form of unwanted sexual requests and
sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant," the suit alleges, " ...
and created a work environment that was hostile."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court, seeks
unspecified damages for sexual battery, sexual harassment, wrongful
termination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It also
seeks compensatory damages for lost wages and benefits, medical
expenses and punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   However, the woman said Wednesday that money can never compensate
for the abuse she endured.</TE>
<TE>   "Money will never replace the life that you've lost or being able
to trust people," she said. "I think he deserves all the punishment
he can get."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit comes nearly six months after Remedios, a longtime
friend of the girl's family, pleaded guilty to eight felony counts of
genital penetration and two counts of misdemeanor sexual battery.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Remedios was placed on five years' probation and ordered
to serve 300 days in jail. However, court records show that the jail
sentence has been stayed three times and Remedios remains free. He is
scheduled to turn himself in later this month.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the woman suing Remedios said she turned to the
civil courts after Remedios "got away" with what she believes was a
lenient sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Emotionally and financially, she said, she continues to suffer
from the abuse and resulting job loss. "I lost my job references,"
she said. "I could never work in an office again. I could never have
a male boss again."</TE>
<TE>   Remedios did not return calls for comment Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Federal Officials Fail to Protect Salton Sea, Suit Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Environmental groups, tribe sue to block plan to
reduce safeguards for birds, fish to spur sale of Colorado River
water to San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two environmental groups and a Native American tribe filed a lawsuit
Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles alleging that the federal
government has failed to protect the Salton Sea and its many
imperiled species of fish and birds.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit was filed by the Sierra Club, the Center for
Biological Diversity and the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians and
threatens to complicate plans by water officials to ensure that
Southern California has a sufficient supply.</LD>
<LD>   The suit challenges governmental efforts to reduce costly
environmental protections afforded the Salton Sea in order to
persuade Imperial County farmers to sell water to arid San Diego
County.</LD>
<TE>   That sale is a key component of the state strategy to reduce the
amount of "surplus" Colorado River water the state uses and avoid a
mandatory cutback by the U.S. Department of Interior.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District controls 75% of the state's
assured allocation from the Colorado River, and voluntary sales from
Imperial to coastal cities and suburbs is seen as a way to wean those
regions from surplus water that, in fact, belongs to other states.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Daniel Patterson, a biologist with the Center for
Biological Diversity in Tucson, said environmentalists are concerned
that the Imperial-San Diego water deal will hurt the already ailing
Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration's Interior Department is very
behind-closed-doors," Patterson said. "They're moving full speed
ahead with this major water transfer without much consultation and
without a plan to restore the sea."</TE>
<TE>   Although it has a host of environmental problems, the Salton Sea,
which straddles Imperial and Riverside counties, is a vital stopping
spot for millions of migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit asks the court to order Interior Secretary Gale Norton
and the Bureau of Reclamation to comply with the 1998 Salton Sea
Reclamation Act.</TE>
<TE>   The act calls for the federal government to devise a plan to
stabilize the sea's rising salinity level and prohibit the continued
loss of flora and fauna.</TE>
<TE>   When farmers reduce the amount of water used for irrigation on
Imperial Valley land, they reduce the drainage that sustains the
Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   With reduced runoff, the sea is in danger of becoming so saline
that it cannot sustain populations of fish and birds.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sticking points in a tentative agreement between the
Imperial Irrigation District and the San Diego County Water Authority
is who will pay for damage done to the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates on how much restoration will be required at the sea run
to the hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from other states that depend on the Colorado
River, California agreed to end its use of surplus water from the
river within 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   But if it cannot meet a Dec. 31 deadline for the Imperial-San
Diego deal to be finalized, the Department of Interior has threatened
an immediate cutback, which could prove crippling to the state's
economy and to the lifestyle of coastal cities and suburbs.</TE>

<LD>A six-man, six-woman jury began deliberations on whether David
Westerfield should be executed or imprisoned for life without parole
for kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek told jurors not to be swayed by
sympathy for the Westerfield family and instead to bring back a
recommendation for death to "protect the weak and the young."</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Robert Boyce said Westerfield, who had no
previous criminal record except a drunk-driving conviction, does not
fit the "worst of the worst" of killers who deserve to be executed.</LD>

<HD>Secession Too Big a Risk, Says Ex-Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said Wednesday he
opposes San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession, labeling the
proposed breakup a financial risk and threat to public safety.</LD>
<LD>   Parks is a Los Angeles City Council candidate, so his position in
favor of keeping the city together is not surprising. But
secessionists had hoped at one point to secure his endorsement, which
many consider valuable because of his law enforcement credentials and
growing role as a leader of the African American community.</LD>
<LD>   "Secession is too risky for the city of Los Angeles and
particularly the community I'm going to represent," said Parks, who
is running for the council's 8th District seat in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no guarantee how secure the city will be financially,
how secure city jobs will be," Parks added. "I just don't think you
can run a city based on promises with no guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   He said he also is worried that a new city would contract out
policing to the lowest bidder, instead of paying for the services of
the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he plans to formally announce his position today and
will concentrate his campaigning against secession in South Los
Angeles. But he will not join the anti-secession committee headed by
Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Parks lost his bid for a second term as police chief after Hahn
refused to support him. On Wednesday, he denied that his dispute with
the mayor delayed his decision. Parks said he needed time to study
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn camp welcomed Parks' decisions. "Mr. Parks is a very
significant voice," said advisor Kam Kuwata.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leader Richard Katz, however, said Parks'
position will not add much to the anti-secession effort. "He's
running for office. He was fired by the mayor. It's an endorsement,
but people see him as being connected to the downtown power
structure," said Katz, co-chairman of the Valley Independence
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Katz also said Parks is wrong about any financial and public
safety risks. He noted that a study by the Local Agency Formation
Commission found a Valley city and the remainder of Los Angeles would
not be financially harmed by the split.</TE>
<TE>   A Valley city would have enough money to maintain police services
at their current level or increase them, Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Fernando Guerra said Parks' views on secession
will likely resonate among African American voters citywide and
Valley residents concerned about crime. "I think people who are
interested in public safety might be influenced by what the police
chief has to say," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters have argued that, if a breakup happens,
African Americans in the remainder of Los Angeles will gain clout in
a smaller city. Parks said he was unconvinced.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a city that is crippled and unable to generate
revenue, you may have more clout, but over less resources," Parks
said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Ordered for Man in Wife's Death</HD>
<DH>Court: He is accused of slashing her throat with a box
cutter in their Port Hueneme home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unemployed Port Hueneme construction worker was ordered Wednesday
to stand trial on a murder charge for allegedly using a box cutter to
slash his wife's throat as she lay in bed.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Solis, 41, is accused of killing his 51-year-old wife
inside their Bard Road home April 14. Solis told police after his
arrest that he and his wife had been having marital problems.</LD>
<LD>   The couple's troubles, according to Solis, involved finances, his
struggle with alcohol and their inability to have children. Olga
Solis had two miscarriages, according to police.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody in the world has marital problems but it doesn't come
to this," prosecutor Miles Weiss said Wednesday after the preliminary
hearing for Solis.</TE>
<TE>   According to Weiss, Solis and his wife awoke about the same time
that Sunday and talked in bed briefly before Solis went outside and
saw the box cutter.</TE>
<TE>   Solis then reentered the bedroom and attacked her, Weiss said,
using the weapon to slice his wife's throat so deeply that her
jugular vein was struck.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Solis retrieved another knife from the kitchen and
returned to the bedroom, where he inflicted superficial stab wounds,
according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in an apparent suicide attempt, Solis used one of the knives
to slash his wrists and consumed a combination of laxatives and
rubbing alcohol, according to testimony. He was later treated for
minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's hearing, Solis, clad in a blue jailhouse
uniform, listened to the proceedings with the help of a translator.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's sister, Maria Gomez, testified she went to the
couple's home April 14 and found her brother shaking and acting
nervous. Gomez said she also saw blood on her brother's neck.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez's daughter, Lourdes Gomez, had accompanied her mother to the
Solis house that day. Gomez testified Wednesday that Solis came out
of the house and into the backyard and told her to call the police
because her aunt was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, a senior deputy district attorney, asked Lourdes Gomez if
she remembered Solis saying, "I did it. Everybody knew this was
coming." Lourdes Gomez said she could not recall her uncle making
that remark.</TE>
<TE>   The Gomezes called police, who arrived at the house about 4 p.m.
Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Janice Frank testified the exact
time of death is unknown but that the victim died during the midday
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme Police Officer Paul Gomez, not related to Maria and
Lourdes Gomez, also took the stand Wednesday and testified that Solis
said during an interview with police after his arrest that he wanted
to die.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Gomez also said there was a psychologist present during
the interview. The officer said the psychologist asked Solis if he
thought he was insane, and that the defendant indicated he was not.</TE>
<TE>   "He was calm ... he kept saying he wanted to die," Officer Gomez
testified.</TE>
<TE>   During the police interview, Solis wavered between calmness and
tears, Officer Gomez testified. He made statements about his wife
trying to kill him so he, in turn, killed her, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Olga Solis had been a nine-year employee of Moorpark-based Kavlico
Corp., working on an assembly line making automotive sensors. Several
of her relatives sat behind the prosecutor in court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Solis, whose criminal record is limited to a drunk-driving
conviction, remained jailed Wednesday on $520,000 bail. He will be
arraigned Nov. 11 on one count of murder with a special allegation of
using a deadly weapon. If convicted, he faces 25 years to life in
prison.</TE>

<HD>Clement Stone, 100; Self-Made Millionaire, Philanthropist</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>W. Clement Stone, a onetime Chicago newsboy who turned a $100
investment into a multibillion-dollar insurance business and
enthusiastically preached the gospel of achieving success through a
"positive mental attitude," has died. He was 100.</LD>
<LD>   Stone, who gave more than $275 million to various philanthropies
and was a major Republican Party supporter who donated more than $5
million to Richard Nixon's presidential campaigns, died of natural
causes Tuesday at a hospital in Evanston, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   From a single agency he founded in Chicago in 1922, Stone by the
mid-1930s had built his Combined Insurance Co. of America into a
major force in the industry.</LD>
<TE>   In 1982, Combined merged with Ryan Insurance Group and five years
later, when its name was changed to Aon Corp., Stone became chairman
emeritus. Last year, Aon reported total revenues exceeding $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Short and stocky, with slicked-down hair and a pencil-thin
mustache that he kept perpetually black, Stone cut a jaunty figure
with his wardrobe of colorful bow ties, pinstripe suits and gold
cufflinks the size of quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Stone once drove a gold Cadillac and he continued to smoke Cuban
cigars, which he had stockpiled in pre-Fidel Castro days.</TE>
<TE>   But as much a trademark as his flamboyant appearance was his
ebullient, think-positive attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the most positive-thinking person I ever knew," the
Rev. Robert Schuller, a 40-year friend who will speak at Stone's
funeral in Evanston on Friday, told The Times on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was also a great believer in possibilities, and was one of the
first persons to believe in my dream of a Crystal Cathedral,"
Schuller said. "Without his major seven-figure gift, this building
would not be standing here today."</TE>
<TE>   Members of Stone's insurance sales force were schooled in what
Stone called PMA: positive mental attitude.</TE>
<TE>   They were instructed in "how to keep a smile in the voice" and
when to make eye contact with a prospective customer.</TE>
<TE>   And they were encouraged to declare their PMA daily with catch
phrases such as, "What the mind can conceive and believe, the mind
can achieve" and "Do it now."</TE>
<TE>   At sales meetings around the country, Stone would stand on stage
and ask his audience, "How do you feel?" They'd respond with the PMA
mantra: "I feel healthy. I feel happy. I feel terrific."</TE>
<TE>   Stone, who began developing his self-motivation philosophy during
his early days selling insurance, would pass out coins bearing his
likeness on one side and on the other, the words "Study. Think. Plan.
Act." His sales stationery read, "Hit the target. Aim higher."</TE>
<TE>   Stone's self-motivation philosophy was influenced in part by
Napoleon Hill's 1937 book "Think and Grow Rich."</TE>
<TE>   Stone later collaborated with Hill in writing the 1960 book
"Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude." He also wrote "The
Success System That Never Fails" and co-wrote, with Norma Lee
Browning, "The Other Side of the Mind." And he was editor and
publisher of "Success Unlimited," a monthly magazine founded in 1954
and sold in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a remarkable individual who could motivate and enthuse
individuals and audiences to overcome adversity, to succeed and to
give back to the world," Warren Hendriks, Stone's former vice
president of corporate relations, told The Times on Wednesday. "Just
being around him was a huge motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his life, Stone maintained that any man can become
wealthy, "no matter how poor his start in life."</TE>
<TE>   His early days read like the Horatio Alger stories he devoured as
a youth.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago on May 4, 1902, Stone was not quite 3 when his
father, a gambler, died and left his family impoverished.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 6, Stone was helping his dressmaker mother pay
the rent by selling newspapers in his south-side neighborhood. By 13,
he owned his own newsstand.</TE>
<TE>   At 14, he worked summers helping his stepfather in a small
insurance office and at 16, after his mother moved to Detroit to
establish another insurance office, he began making cold sales calls
in Detroit's Dime Bank Building.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 20, Stone used $100 in savings to launch his own
insurance agency in Chicago. Eight years later, in 1930, he had 1,000
salesmen around the country working for him. He also owned a home in
Evanston and was making payments on a pair of big Lincolns and a
30-foot cabin cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   Although the country was in the throes of the Great Depression,
Stone wasn't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Money didn't mean anything.... I knew I could go out and make
it," he told the New York Times in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, he said, the Depression was the "best thing that
happened" to him: "It forced me to develop good work habits and be
more scientific in training men so I could pay off my debts."</TE>
<TE>   Stone dropped out of high school in Detroit to spend more time
selling insurance.</TE>
<TE>   He later obtained his diploma by taking night classes at the
Chicago YMCA's Central High School.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, he attended the Detroit College of Law. But he dropped out
after a year when he realized he couldn't make a large enough income
as a lawyer "until I was at least 35."</TE>
<TE>   He also attended Northwestern University from 1930 to 1932 and,
though he never graduated, he eventually received 20 honorary
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Stone continued to devote his time and money to
philanthropy, civic activities and political causes.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he donated millions to numerous civic and
charitable groups, including the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, with which he
had a 50-year involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Party candidates also benefited greatly from his
largess.</TE>
<TE>   Stone became a close friend of Nixon in 1964 after they met as
members of the national board of the Boys' Club of America. Stone
reportedly gave more money to Nixon's 1968 campaign than anyone else,
and he said during Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign that he was
determined that the president "wouldn't lose because of a lack of
funds."</TE>
<TE>   "Clem was one of the first influential Americans to believe that
my father could make the impossible comeback to become president,"
Julie Nixon Eisenhower told the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was truly an inspiration to the president."</TE>
<TE>   Stone, who later donated $2 million to the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace in Yorba Linda, continued to support Nixon after his
resignation in 1974, believing that Nixon "is going down as one of
the greatest presidents that we ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Stone is survived by his wife of 79 years, Jessie; a son, Norman;
12 grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren. A son, Clement, and a
daughter, Donna, are deceased.</TE>

<HD>Hernan Sends It, Surfers Ride It in South O.C.</HD>
<DH>Sport: The tropical storm powers the best waves in years,
some as high as 18 feet. The shores crowd with spectators, the brave
and the foolhardy.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of spectators gathered at southern Orange County beaches
Wednesday to watch in awe as die-hard surfers braved the biggest
waves in at least five years.</LD>
<LD>   The most dramatic scene was at the Wedge, Newport Beach's
legendary surf spot at the tip of Balboa Peninsula, where some waves
towered as high as 18 feet.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been rather impressive," said Capt. John Blauer, a spokesman
for the Newport Beach Lifeguard Department.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran surfer John Mayo, 59, of Huntington Beach came to watch
the action. "On really big days it can take your breath away," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The enormous swells were the result of Hernan, a tropical storm
about 850 miles southwest of San Diego that is forecast to produce
big waves through Friday as it moves northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "It mainly means high surf and a 40% to 50% chance of showers and
thunderstorms on Friday, with lessening chances into Saturday," said
Noel Isla, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San
Diego. "We're just advising the public that there'll be
higher-than-usual waves, and to be careful if they're out in the
water because there could also be rip currents."</TE>
<TE>   That certainly was the case at Huntington Beach, where relatively
few surfers entered the water despite 6-to 9-foot swells--three times
higher than normal. The reason, lifeguards said, was a strong side
current at 5 to 7 mph. "The way the waves were breaking in our area
... wasn't conducive to surfing," said Lt. Kyle Lindo, a spokesman
for the city's Lifeguard Department.</TE>
<TE>   In Newport Beach, where the surf was 8 to 10 feet, lifeguards
pulled 30 to 40 people out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of it was proactive," Blauer said. "We were preventing
people from getting into trouble. Today was one of those days
reserved for experienced surfers."</TE>
<TE>   That was especially true at the Wedge, where waves tend to hit a
jetty, bounce off and collide with the waves behind them, doubling
their height, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other place like this in the world," said Marvin
Wilson, 48, a veteran bodysurfer, as he prepared to swim out and test
his skills. "You've got to take advantage of this while it's here."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Students call it "ditching." Authorities call it truancy, illegal and
a pitfall to crime and poverty.</LD>
<LD>   Announcing a new program Wednesday to combat truancy in Los
Angeles schools, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and leaders of the Los
Angeles Unified School District warned parents who fail to send their
children to school that they risk their children's futures.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with 22 middle schools in the city, "Operation Bright
Future" will mail letters and brochures--in multiple languages--to
parents and guardians of nearly 17,000 sixth-grade students, spelling
out California's truancy laws and acceptable reasons, such as
illness, for students to miss school.</LD>
<TE>   The parents of students who are habitually absent will be directed
to attend assemblies conducted by the city attorney's office.
Counseling, health care and other resources will be available to get
children back in class, officials said. Parents and guardians who
flagrantly ignore truancy laws could be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it doesn't come to that, and we expect that it very
rarely will," Delgadillo said Wednesday at Mulholland Middle School
in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-truancy program targets students in their first year of
middle school because at that age they are beginning to flirt with
diversions from school, Delgadillo said. Students who ditch class are
likely instead to spend their days committing crimes and joining
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "By allowing our students to skip school, we are handing gangs a
victory," he said. "An educated child will make a community safer."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles students have actually improved their attendance in
recent years, according to the school district. On average, about 7%
of students, or 50,000, are absent each day, but district officials
said it is difficult to distinguish excused from unexcused absences.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming to school is absolutely critical. Eighty percent of life
is just showing up," Caprice Young, Los Angeles Board of Education
president, told an assembly of Mulholland's 600 sixth-graders. In
addition to enforcing truancy laws, schools should strive to be
places that children enjoy, Mulholland Principal John White said.
Existing after-school sports, arts and tutoring programs can help.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to have our school so exciting and moving forward that
the students will want to be in school, because when you miss school,
you miss out," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo's mild threat to Mulholland's sixth-graders that he can
be a "tough guy" who might prosecute their parents seemed to affect
the students on their second day of school.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really want to start that with my parents," said
Catherine Ray, 11. She does not skip school because "my parents trust
me, and I want to show respect for them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Guatemala, 11, predicted that if his parents received a
letter from the city's lawyer, "I'd be grounded for a long time."</TE>

<LD>A liquor store was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money by a man
carrying a long-barreled handgun, Port Hueneme police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The holdup occurred at the House of Spirits on West Channel
Islands Boulevard shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday, police said. No one
was injured and the gunman remained at large Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the gunman walked into the shop and demanded
money from the cashier while holding the black pistol. After the
cashier handed over the money, the robber fled east on foot, police
said. The gunman was described as Latino with a medium build,
cleanshaven, 20 to 25 years old and about 5 feet 8. He was wearing a
black beanie, a black jacket and dark pants.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While stalled talks between dockworkers and shipping companies
threaten the entire West Coast, the tiny Port of Hueneme secured a
bit of labor peace Wednesday night when its unionized employees
overwhelmingly approved a three-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   The contract with the Service Employees International Union Local
998 covers two clerks, eight maintenance workers and eight
wharfingers, who coordinate vessel traffic through the port. The
contract was approved by a 13-4 vote.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, members of the larger International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, who are not employed directly by harbor districts,
are working without a contract. Negotiations with the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which represents shipping companies and importers,
have broken down.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new Port of Hueneme contract, wages for the average
wharfinger or maintenance worker will rise from $23.40 an hour to
$26.80 and hour in the final year of the agreement.</TE>

<HD>Zoo Plans New Primate Habitat</HD>
<DH>San Diego: The project to replace Monkey Quadrangle will
cost $26 million. The design is based on Asian and African rain
forests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>With the help of some pacaranas and meerkats and a North American
porcupine, San Diego Zoo officials Wednesday broke ground on the
largest and most expensive animal habitat project in the acclaimed
zoo's 86-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed the New Heart of the Zoo, the $26-million project will take
the place of the Monkey Quadrangle, the collection of cages that have
served as the entryway to the zoo since 1922. Though other parts of
the zoo have been modernized to provide more spacious and realistic
settings for animals, the monkey habitat has largely been unchanged.</LD>
<LD>   Now the primates are slated for a habitat fashioned after Asian
and African tropical forests. The new surroundings are meant to be
more comfy and to allow the zoo to keep a larger number of
animals--an important consideration as the number of certain species
dwindles in the wild.</LD>
<TE>   One of the more delicate parts of the project will be relocating
an 80-foot tall, 50-year-old, multi-trunked ficus tree estimated to
weigh 1 million pounds. The tree has been near the zoo entrance but
will become the centerpiece of the new exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The old cages--which provided shade and trees and other
necessities--were once considered the state of the art for housing
animals for exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years their age and maintenance problems had raised
concern among zoo officials and representatives of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which inspects zoos.</TE>
<TE>   "The cages were old and starting to fall apart," said Karen
Killmar, the zoo's assistant curator of mammals. "Our zookeepers
spent a lot of time trying to improve the cages, but a concrete box
just does not give you everything you need."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the cages gave the primates little privacy. The new
habitat will allow them to hide if they tire of the steady stream of
visitors. "The animals need an opportunity to at least feel like
they're not in front of people all the time," Killmar said. "They
need to feel safe."</TE>
<TE>   The cages were torn down a year ago, after temporary quarters were
found for the orangutans, siamangs, mandrills, guenons and others in
an area of the zoo off limits to the 3.5 million people who visit
each year. Most of those animals will remain in the temporary holding
areas until construction ends.</TE>
<TE>   With the summer tourist crush over, construction can begin on the
first phase, targeted for completion by Easter.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the USDA's animal and plant health inspection
service has ordered a number of zoos to improve their facilities,
including the Los Angeles Zoo, which was told to upgrade its gorilla
exhibit or face penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Department spokeswoman Laura Reiser said the San Diego Zoo was
inspected in April without any citations being issued.</TE>
<TE>   But older facilities such as the Monkey Quadrangle pose potential
problems with sanitation and visitor safety, and the department
recommends that they be improved or replaced, Reiser said.</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Larsen, vice president of the Zoological Society of San
Diego, said during the groundbreaking that one reason for building
the three-acre exhibit is to keep the zoo from falling out of
compliance with federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   New primate facilities have been on the zoo's agenda for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," said Doug Myers, the zoo's executive director. "We've been
planning this project forever."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the orangutans, siamangs and mandrills, other animals
will be relocated to the habitat: clouded leopards, bearded pigs and
numerous other mammals, birds and reptiles.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Embery, the zoo's longtime goodwill ambassador, known for her
many appearances on "The Tonight Show," noted that the Monkey
Quadrangle was home to some of the zoo's more famous animals,
including the late Ken Allen, an orangutan who became a local legend
with his many escape attempts.</TE>
<TE>   This being San Diego--the late Times sportswriter Jim Murray once
called San Diego "a zoo with a city attached"--zoo animals have not
just names but support groups and constituencies. Many primate lovers
attended the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about the mandrills," said Jim Lockwood, a retired
Navy chief petty officer and longtime zoo patron. "My wife is more
interested in the orangutans."</TE>

<HD>Israel Conned Rich Recluse, Relatives Say</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Leisure World millionaire was promised burial in
Haifa in exchange for his fortune, family says. Israeli government
denies wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To his Leisure World neighbors, Simon Lechtuz seemed the penniless
eccentric--a disheveled lifelong bachelor who seldom changed clothes
and sought treasure in trash containers around Laguna Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Little did they know Lechtuz was a millionaire who, in the final
years of his life, had agreed to leave his $5-million fortune to the
government of Israel in exchange for his burial there with full
religious observance.</LD>
<LD>   But when the 88-year-old died shortly after collapsing over a
grocery store garbage bin, there was no trip to Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, he was buried unceremoniously in a secular Orange County
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Lechtuz's distant relatives went to court Wednesday,
claiming that Israel and lawyers representing its Los Angeles
consulate conned the retiree into willing his fortune to Israel by
falsely promising him a proper Jewish burial in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The family, which has members in Southern California and Israel,
exhumed his body from Orange County and reburied him in Israel. But
they maintain the government broke its contract with the Polish
immigrant. They are demanding that Judge James P. Gray void the will,
a move that could clear the way for the family to receive the
proceeds of his estate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous what they did," said plaintiff Yoseffa Teitel, a
niece from Woodland Hills. "They preyed on this man. They pursued him
relentlessly and waited until he wasn't well to get him to sign.
Then, when he dies, they don't even give him the one thing that he
wanted: burial in Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing Israel deny any wrongdoing, saying they
talked to Lechtuz about his funeral plans but never promised to bury
him in Israel. They say opportunistic relatives are now foiling
Lechtuz's final wishes, which were to give roughly $1 million each to
the Israeli army, navy, air force, the Israel Institute of Technology
and the Hadassah Medical Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, the people who are bringing this suit never met Mr.
Lechtuz," said attorney Michael Greene, one of the group representing
Israel. "Mrs. Teitel never had any communication with him in his
life. It's incredible they're pursuing this. It's a shame."</TE>
<TE>   Greene said the last thing Lechtuz wanted was for his family to
inherit his fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not want them to benefit," he said. "He stated that he
wanted them to earn it."</TE>
<TE>   The case marks a rare instance in which a U.S. citizen agreed to
will his estate directly to the government of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   While testamentary gifts to Israeli organizations are common, they
usually involve donations to intermediaries connected to Israeli
veterans, health organizations or social service groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real surprised to hear that someone actually made a bequest
to the government," said Chelle Friedman, director of the Leisure
World Region of the Jewish Federation of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Even here, people may think the Marines are wonderful, but who
leaves money to them in their will?" Friedman said.</TE>

<HD>Project for Farm Acreage Advances</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: City planners back a 1,000-home development.
Council approval is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developers seeking to put more than 1,000 homes on strawberry fields
at the foot of the Conejo Grade have received the go-ahead from the
Camarillo Planning Commission.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the City Council, the development would be built on
one of the largest remaining pieces of farmland in the city. Called
Village at the Park, the project would cover 330 acres bordered by
the Ventura Freeway to the north and Pleasant Valley Road to the
south, east of Lewis Road and west of Calle de la Rosa.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners on Tuesday unanimously recommended changing the
land's zoning to allow for the first phase of the project, which
would ultimately include 1,060 homes, a 55-acre park, retail space, a
five-acre YMCA site and 10 acres for a new elementary school.</LD>
<TE>   The commission's recommendation will be forwarded to the Camarillo
City Council, which approved the project's environmental impact
report in September 2001 and is expected to approve the project at an
upcoming meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners received their first look Wednesday at details of
the proposed development, viewing sketches of housing styles and
floor plans for the subdivision's 672 single-family homes, which
would range in size from 1,760 to 3,575 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hardgrave, a representative of the developers, said
architects had designed the homes to de-emphasize garages along the
fronts of the houses and make the neighborhood more
pedestrian-friendly. "We wanted to create character and a sense of
identity in the neighborhoods," Hardgrave said. "This project will
add a great deal to the community."</TE>
<TE>   The commission opted to postpone a recommendation on the
subdivision maps and floor plans until its Sept. 17 meeting, to give
the city planning staff a chance to fine-tune the project
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the single-family homes, developers plan about 380
townhouses and apartments. Although specific plans are yet to be
ironed out, Camarillo Planning Director Bob Burrow said the city
hopes to work out an agreement that would designate some of the homes
as affordable housing. "We don't have an ordinance, but we do have a
policy that says we strive for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Developers expect that the project would be completed in the next
several years. Though the city currently has enough single-family
housing, the Village at the Park development would help the city meet
future housing needs, Burrow said.</TE>
<TE>   The project has been in development for more than three years. No
one spoke during the public comment session Tuesday, but at public
hearings last year, some residents of the nearby Lamplighter Mobile
Home Park expressed fears of increased traffic and noise from the
development. Traffic and environmental impact studies eased some of
their concerns, but some residents still felt the city was losing its
semirural feel by developing too much of its already limited
farmland.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Mike Morgan, a fierce slow-growth proponent who
generally opposes farmland development in Camarillo, said Village at
the Park is an example of well-planned growth.</TE>
<TE>   Because the proposed 55-acre park will abut the Ventura Freeway,
the subdivision should not affect the sweeping farmland view as
drivers travel down the Conejo Grade, he said. And the developers
have shown they're willing to devote parts of the land to the
community for a new elementary school and YMCA, as well as landscaped
berms along roadways and bike paths.</TE>
<TE>   "Their plan had everything I hoped for," Morgan said. "We can't
stop any kind of growth at all. But if we do it in our fashion, and
get a lot of benefits from it as a community, I think we can't ask
for much more."</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Tie DNA to Child Support</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the hundreds of bills piled on Gov. Gray Davis' desk is one
that delves into one of the most tangled issues of family law: Should
men who have been treated as fathers by the courts but are later
proved to have no biological relationship to children still be
required to pay child support?</LD>
<LD>   AB 2240 would allow men to extract themselves from some
child-support judgments if they can prove they are not the biological
father. The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Legislature. It follows
a nationwide trend in states rewriting laws to let men escape support
obligations if they can prove, using DNA technology, no biological
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   "Both houses of the Legislature, in excess of two-thirds, said
this is just and fair," said Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los
Angeles), the bill's author. "Why should a guy who's not the father
of a child be forced to pay for something he's not responsible for?"</LD>
<TE>   But some advocates for women and children say the bill is poorly
written and does not correctly address the knotty problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill is not ready for prime time, and we hope the governor
will veto it and direct the Department of Child Support Services to
come back with a more workable version," said Lenny Goldberg, a
lobbyist for the Assn. of Children for the Enforcement of Support and
for the National Youth Law Center.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor said Davis has yet to take a position
on the bill. He has until Sept. 30 to veto it or sign it into law.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a tradition in civil litigation holding that a court
judgment becomes permanent if it is not swiftly challenged. In
child-support cases, that means that when men do not answer summonses
to court, they can be ruled the father of the child in question
through a default judgment. DNA tests that show they are not related
are not admissible after 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Default judgments represent 80% of all child-support judgments in
Los Angeles County, and there have been repeated complaints about
shoddy serving of court summonses by child-support agencies. Groups
that advocate for fathers' rights argue that the system is rigged to
ensnare men; those organizations have succeeded in persuading eight
states to alter their laws on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   But some women's groups give examples of men who have acted as
fathers for years suddenly being freed to abandon the child because
of a blood test. That, they say, is too disruptive to children,
depriving them of the only father they have known.</TE>
<TE>   Wright's bill, which went through many revisions, allows default
judgments to be challenged up to three years after the man becomes
aware of their existence, and requires that all targets of
child-support complaints be personally served with their court
summons. It also allows judges to maintain the judgment if they
decide it is in the child's best interests that the man keep
paying--regardless of what the DNA test establishes about paternity.</TE>
<TE>   Those provisions worry some critics of the legislation, who say
the standards allowing judges latitude are ill-defined.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably going to be open to a tremendous amount of
interpretation from the judges," said Geraldine Jensen, head of the
Assn. of Children for the Enforcement of Support , which backed a
bill in Ohio to allow some men wrongfully identified as fathers to
escape support orders. "Certainly, something needs to be done about
this issue, because technology has sort of caught up with society."</TE>
<TE>   Carson resident Bert Riddick, who has been dunned for tens of
thousands of dollars in child support for a girl he is not related to
and has never seen, said that despite the amendments, the bill would
still remedy injustices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a good bill," he said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Conned Recluse, Family Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Leisure World millionaire was promised burial in
Haifa in exchange for his fortune, but the government never came
through, relatives allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To his Leisure World neighbors, Simon Lechtuz seemed the penniless
eccentric--a disheveled lifelong bachelor who seldom changed clothes
and sought treasure in trash containers around Laguna Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Little did they know Lechtuz was a millionaire who, in the final
years of his life, had agreed to leave his $5-million fortune to the
government of Israel in exchange for his burial there with full
religious observance.</LD>
<LD>   But when the 88-year-old died shortly after collapsing over a
grocery store garbage bin, there was no trip to Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, he was buried unceremoniously in a secular Orange County
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Lechtuz's distant relatives went to court Wednesday,
claiming that Israel and lawyers representing its Los Angeles
consulate conned the retiree into willing his fortune to Israel by
falsely promising him a proper Jewish burial in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The family, which has members in Southern California and Israel,
exhumed his body from Orange County and reburied him in Israel. But
they maintain the government broke its contract with the Polish
immigrant. They are demanding that Judge James P. Gray void the will,
a move that could clear the way for the family to receive the
proceeds of his estate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous what they did," said plaintiff Yoseffa Teitel, a
niece from Woodland Hills. "They preyed on this man. They pursued him
relentlessly and waited until he wasn't well to get him to sign.
Then, when he dies, they don't even give him the one thing that he
wanted: burial in Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing Israel deny any wrongdoing, saying they
talked to Lechtuz about his funeral plans but never promised to bury
him in Israel. They say opportunistic relatives are now foiling
Lechtuz's final wishes, which were to give roughly $1 million each to
the Israeli army, navy, air force, the Israel Institute of Technology
and the Hadassah Medical Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, the people who are bringing this suit never met Mr.
Lechtuz," said attorney Michael Greene, one of the group representing
Israel. "Mrs. Teitel never had any communication with him in his
life. It's incredible they're pursuing this. It's a shame."</TE>
<TE>   Greene said the last thing Lechtuz wanted was for his family to
inherit his fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not want them to benefit," he said. "He stated that he
wanted them to earn it."</TE>
<TE>   The case marks a rare instance in which a U.S. citizen agreed to
will his estate directly to the government of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   While testamentary gifts to Israeli organizations are common, they
usually involve donations to intermediaries connected to Israeli
veterans, health organizations or social service groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real surprised to hear that someone actually made a bequest
to the government," said Chelle Friedman, director of the Leisure
World Region of the Jewish Federation of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Even here, people may think the Marines are wonderful, but who
leaves money to them in their will?" Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the dispute focuses on Lechtuz's state of mind when he
signed the will, as well as the motivations of Israel's lawyers.
Lechtuz did not use his own lawyer to draft the document. Instead, he
had lawyers working for the consulate draft the document and create a
trust for his holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing Israel argue that certain documents and
correspondence between the consulate's lawyers and Israel's Ministry
of Justice cannot be admitted into court because they are protected
by diplomatic immunity. Lawyers for Lechtuz's relatives said the
documents are crucial to understanding the behind-the-scenes
maneuvering by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Determining Lechtuz's thoughts could prove equally difficult. Even
close friends describe him as a recluse who rarely discussed his
personal life and rebuffed those who inquired about it. Friends who
knew Lechtuz as a 15-year resident of Leisure World said they were
shocked to learn that he had amassed such a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt sorry for him," friend and neighbor Jonel Konstanin said
in court documents. "People avoided him because of his dirty
appearance, his difficult foreign accent, his lack of personal
hygiene and his odd, even weird, behavior. He looked like he didn't
have a dime and he wore the same clothes day after day."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Poland in 1912, Lechtuz moved to Palestine when he was 12
and later enlisted in the British Army during World War II. The two
sides dispute portions of his history. His family says Lechtuz served
in India during the war; the Israeli government said he also served
with the Israeli Army.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950 he immigrated to the United States, where he earned a
living by bartering and trading leftover flour sacks and steel drums
he collected from bakeries, and later he owned a furniture business,
according to relatives. Eventually, he owned a number of properties.</TE>
<TE>   Never married and without children, Lechtuz called the Israeli
consulate in Los Angeles in July 1994 to discuss the possibility of
making a bequest to the Israeli military and Hadassah Medical
Center--the beginning of on-again-off-again negotiations that would
last almost four years and frequently mentioned Lechtuz's desire to
be buried in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Those discussions are detailed in documents filed by the
plaintiffs with the court.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1995, a consulate lawyer, Susan Greenberg, wrote back
saying that burial in military cemeteries is restricted to service
personnel, but that "we are still checking with the Israel Defense
Forces authorities on your behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Later that month, Greenberg wrote again to say "there are no mixed
civilian and military (cemeteries) in Israel. However, my colleagues
in Jerusalem suggested the purchase of a burial plot geographically
adjacent to one for the military cemeteries."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Lechtuz wrote back to propose a new avenue, that he be
flown to Israel "for final" and that the consulate take care of his
will and his holdings. "The will is millions, 90 percent for Israel
... I am sure it will pay."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg responded back that "it would be an honor to help with
the matters discussed in your letter."</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Lechtuz met with another lawyer for the
consulate, Marc Stern, to draft a will. It states:</TE>
<TE>   "It is my wish that I be buried in a military cemetery in the
state of Israel. If, however, only active members of the military can
be buried in such a cemetery (as I have been advised is the current
policy), then I wish to be buried in accordance with Jewish law in a
cemetery in Haifa, Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Lechtuz, however, returned the copy of the will with one
correction. Instead of stating that he "wished" to be buried in
Israel, he said he "must" be buried there. The final will, however,
did not include this wording.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1998, Lechtuz suffered a stroke. Lechtuz's doctor
observed in February 1999 that he suffered from dementia.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, Lechtuz told Stern that he was "ready to sign,"
but turned the lawyer away at the Leisure World gate. After another
visit, they met in the recreation room and Lechtuz signed the
document.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 9, 2000, Lechtuz was found slumped over a garbage can in
front of a supermarket in Laguna Hills. He was taken to a hospital
and died Nov. 1. Because he had no immediate family and no one came
forward, a county official ended up arranging burial at a local
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the defendants say the government never formally
promised to bury Lechtuz in Israel. Officials said they accepted his
estate with no strings attached.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, the attorney representing the defendants, said the
correspondence also shows that Lechtuz was clear-headed when he wrote
the will and was not being pressured by the consulate lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Lechtuz was a strongly independent guy," he added. "He knew
what he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Family members didn't know Lechtuz had died until lawyers for the
Israeli government informed them while adjudicating the will. Teitel
and other family members said they were angry after learning that the
government would collect his estate even though it didn't bury him.</TE>
<TE>   Teitel said that after contacting other relatives in Israel, the
family pooled resources and paid $15,000 to have Lechtuz's body
removed from Orange County and transported to a burial site in Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   Teitel acknowledged that she had never met her uncle, but she said
she felt it was her duty to act on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he was reclusive and we respected that," Teitel said.
"But for these people to say there was no agreement to bury him,
that's just baloney."</TE>

<HD>Jesuits Settle Case With Abused Men</HD>
<DH>Courts: Society of Jesus will pay two mentally retarded
victims, who worked at a Bay Area retreat center, a total of $7.5
million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Province of the Society of Jesus agreed Wednesday
to pay a total of $7.5 million to two mentally retarded men who said
they were sexually abused for years by Jesuits at a retreat in
Northern California, according to sources who participated in the
negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which followed more than a year of talks between
the Jesuits and attorneys for the two men, is among the largest
out-of-court agreements of its kind reached by the Catholic Church.
Dioceses in Boston, Dallas and Santa Fe, N.M., have agreed to pay
larger amounts, but they were distributed among many more victims.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very happy," said Holly Ilse, the Los Gatos dress shop
owner who fought on behalf of the two victims and initially reported
the sexual abuses to police. "I think no amount of money can
compensate for the torture my friends have been through. But this
will give them enough money to live as normal life as they can for
the remainder of their years."</LD>
<TE>   Father Thomas H. Smolich, head of the California Province,
declined to state how much of the $7.5 million would be paid by the
Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the province would pay a "significant contribution"
and that the remainder would be covered by an insurance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the settlements were in the best interests of all
parties," Smolich said. "We've been working on this settlement for
well over a year. We began wanting to settle, we continued to want to
settle and we settled."</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits were facing an Oct. 15 civil trial if they had not
agreed to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed June 19, 2001, in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, alleged that four Jesuits subjected the two victims to
repeated acts of sodomy, molestation and false imprisonment for "as
long as 30 years" at the Sacred Heart Jesuit Center.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs sought more than $10 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   One of the defendants, Father Edward Thomas Burke, 81,
was sentenced in June to two years in state prison for molesting one
of the victims for several years. Burke had pleaded guilty to
committing a lewd act on a dependent adult, a felony.</TE>
<TE>   The case came to the attention of authorities in March after The
Times reported that top Jesuit officials quietly relocated Burke in
April 2000 after he admitted engaging in sexual misconduct. Instead
of notifying authorities, the Jesuit leaders moved Burke to a
residence on the campus of Santa Clara University.</TE>
<TE>   Burke was the fifth Jesuit in Northern California in recent years
ordered to register as a sex offender for life. All five have resided
at Sacred Heart. Brother Charles Leonard Connor was convicted last
year of committing a lewd act on the other victim. He is free after
serving six months of home detention.</TE>
<TE>   The victims, described as "John Doe" and "James Doe" in court
papers, both have been diagnosed as mentally retarded. At Sacred
Heart, they were employed as dishwashers responsible for cleaning,
drying and storing pots and pans used in preparing meals for the
Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>   John, 56, was born in San Francisco and contracted polio as
a child. He was raised in foster homes and moved to Sacred Heart on
Oct. 8, 1969, at the age of 24.</TE>
<TE>   James, 51, was born in Germany and adopted from an orphanage as a
toddler by a U.S. Air Force officer and his wife. He never attended
school and spent his teenage years in a state mental institution. He
arrived at Sacred Heart on Aug. 26, 1970, at the age of 19.</TE>
<TE>   The two were paid a starting salary of $150 per month.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement negotiated Wednesday, the Jesuits will
deposit the money into an annuity that will pay each victim $13,000
per month, said M. Jean Starcevich, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
Over the next 30 years, the two men will each receive an estimated
$7.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that [John and James] will be able to stay in Los Gatos,
get themselves in a secure living situation and receive the
psychological counseling that both of them will need for some time,"
Starcevich said. "They will be able to live very happy and
comfortable lives."</TE>
<TE>   The sister of one victim, Debra Sullivan, said her brother was
relieved after learning of the settlement: "He kept saying he was
glad it was over. My overriding emotion is just one of gratitude for
all the people who stepped forward in various ways during this long,
painful ordeal and were willing to actually do something to help."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan singled out Ilse--the only daughter of a retired San Jose
police officer--who repeatedly pushed law enforcement authorities to
investigate the allegations of sexual abuse at Sacred Heart, located
just a few minutes from her store. "I am deeply thankful for her
persistence and courage in pressing on for five years and working as
hard as she did," Sullivan said.</TE>

<HD>LAX Shooter Motivated by Personal Woes, Probe Finds</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Federal agents say Egyptian man acted alone
when he opened fire at El Al counter on July 4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal investigators have all but concluded that Hesham Mohamed
Hadayet was motivated more by personal woes than by political anger
when he shot and killed two people at the El Al Airlines ticket
counter at Los Angeles International Airport on July 4.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapping up their investigation of a tragedy that drew worldwide
attention, FBI agents, working with other federal agencies, have
determined that Hadayet chose an Israeli target because of his
disdain for that nation's policies toward Palestinians. But he acted
alone and was not connected to any terrorist groups, investigators
say.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, sources say, the Egyptian immigrant's rampage--on his
41st birthday--was sparked by despondence over a financially troubled
limousine business and the infirmities of his aging parents, as well
as his anger over Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Ultimately,
sources say, those factors led Hadayet to open fire near an El Al
counter before being gunned down by a security guard for the airline.</LD>
<TE>   "He created an act of terror," said one source. "But we don't
believe it would have happened were it not for the other personal
issues like his finances."</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary conclusion is still under review by FBI
headquarters in Washington and by other federal agencies, and will
not be finalized until authorities are certain that all leads have
been exhausted, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, federal documents made public this week show that
Hadayet requested political asylum in the U.S. in 1992 because of his
strong Islamic religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the shooting, FBI officials were careful not to
preclude any motive, including an act of terrorism or a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Just two weeks ago, in a letter to a congressman, Assistant FBI
Director John E. Collingwood wrote that the case was being pursued as
a terrorism investigation and that "the FBI has not ruled out any
possibilities with regard to our investigation of this terrible
incident."</TE>
<TE>   During its probe, which has extended from Hadayet's Orange County
residence to his birthplace in Egypt, FBI investigators--working with
agents of the CIA, National Security Agency, INS and other
agencies--have become convinced that Hadayet was, as several agents
described, "a lone wolf."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found that Hadayet, a devout Muslim, had been
depressed for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Once a successful accountant in Cairo, Hadayet had been struggling
for years as the owner-operator of a limousine business in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   And though he was only about $10,000 in debt, one source said, the
financial burden weighed heavily on Hadayet.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to his depression, according to the investigation, were the
infirmities of his parents and Hadayet's concern that his family was
being too influenced by Western culture.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation, one internal debate has been whether to
classify the shooting spree as a hate crime or a terrorist act. And
that debate, sources said, was continuing in Los Angeles and
Washington two months after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have found, for example, that although Hadayet had
voiced increasing anger over Israel's policies in the Middle East, he
did not let that derail the relationships he and his family had with
Jewish friends in the U.S. "That tells you he didn't have political
hatred for a race or religion," said one source. "It was more hatred
for the policies of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, investigators believe Hadayet may have been planning
some sort of violence for weeks since he went to a shooting range in
May.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, authorities developed timelines that combined all the
evidence they had collected--from Hadayet's financial problems to
e-mail and other data found on the hard drive of his computer.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of the computer determined that Hadayet had accessed
Web sites that carry pro-Palestinian messages about the conflict in
the Middle East. But those Web sites, according to one source, were
hardly the stuff of terrorism and could be readily accessed by anyone
upset about Israel and/or U.S. policy in the region.</TE>
<TE>   After locally-based federal agents investigated Hadayet and the
shooting for weeks, additional agents specializing in behavior
analysis arrived in Los Angeles from Washington in mid-July, hoping
to pinpoint what may have triggered Hadayet's crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It was his birthday. He was depressed, [and] he knew there would
be higher security at the airport" because of the July 4 holiday,
said one law enforcement source. "And he thought, 'Why not?' "</TE>
<TE>   Friends said that Hadayet, who had been in the United States for a
decade, had largely failed in his original dreams of building a
successful business.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in 1992, he sought political asylum, alleging that
he had encountered discrimination in Egypt for his staunch religious
beliefs, according to federal immigration court papers.</TE>
<TE>   In his application, made available to The Times under a Freedom of
Information Act request, Hadayet wrote that he joined a Muslim mosque
association in Egypt in 1984 "to understand truly and apply Islamic
law in the 20th century under any circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   "I am always being arrested by government agents" whenever there
is an emergency or political event in Egypt, Hadayet wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I am always [being] followed, jailed, threatened by phone [or]
letter for no reason, just because I am a religious individual who
has a strong belief in my religion and God," Hadayet wrote.</TE>
<TE>   And in a section of the asylum form that asks what an applicant
believes might happen if he or she is deported home, Hadayet said he
and his family would be persecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be arrested for no specific reason and for unknown
duration of time," he wrote, adding, "My family will be exposed to
persecution, torture and maybe jailed and framed for crimes they did
not commit. Their only crime is that they are too religious and close
to God."</TE>
<TE>   Although Hadayet's application says that he and an uncle were
arrested and tortured, one law enforcement source said the federal
investigation had not turned up any evidence to support that claim.
Likewise, the source said, authorities had not substantiated
Hadayet's assertion that he had been persecuted for his religious
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities checked the Cairo mosque mentioned in
Hadayet's letter and could find no evidence that it was linked to
extremists, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Egyptian consulate in San Francisco said he
was not familiar with Hadayet's asylum application and could not
comment on its claims.</TE>
<TE>   Two federal officials said that the sorts of statements made by
Hadayet are common to many applications for political asylum in the
U.S. "That is what people always say" when they are seeking to avoid
deportation back to their homeland, said one source.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's asylum application was filed in December 1992, only
weeks before his visitor's visa was set to expire. The asylum request
was eventually denied, but Hadayet's application and a later appeal
of an immigration judge's ruling allowed him to remain in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Then in August 1997, his wife won an INS lottery that granted
legal residency for the family.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's wife and two sons were on vacation in Egypt when he
entered the Tom Bradley International Terminal and got in line at the
El Al ticket counter, armed with a .45-caliber pistol, a .9-mm
pistol, a hunting knife and an extra magazine for each of his
handguns.</TE>
<TE>   Without saying a word and with three or four passengers in front
of him, Hadayet fired one round from the .45-caliber handgun toward
the El Al sign, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 30 seconds or so, Hadayet emptied the 10-round
revolver before being shot once--and mortally wounded--by an El Al
security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he was wounded, Hadayet continued to struggle with the
security guard and a passenger who joined the fray, according to
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a doubt," said one law enforcement source,
"that he knew he wouldn't survive."</TE>

<DH>Politics: Questions about candidate's gay rights stance
dominate Bay Area campaign stops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. struggled Wednesday
to contain the damage from his repudiation of his campaign's response
to questions on gay rights, saying he would "try to reach out to all
Californians."</LD>
<LD>   On a campaign swing through San Francisco and San Jose, Simon was
swamped with scores of questions on gay rights. Even supporters
voiced dismay at the latest self-imposed distraction for a campaign
already in turmoil over staff shakeups, a fraud verdict against
Simon's investment firm and other troubles.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Rodgers, host of a conservative San Francisco radio show, told
morning rush-hour listeners that Simon, his guest Wednesday on
KSFO-AM, needed to "explain this latest mess he's gotten himself
into."</LD>
<TE>   "Let's get right to it," he told Simon. "What did you say? What
did you sign? What do you mean on this whole gay rights thing that's
blowing up all over the place in the media today?"</TE>
<TE>   "Lee, I haven't changed my position in the slightest," Simon
replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you saying that somebody sandbagged you or what?" Rodgers
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes positions get distorted," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged that his campaign had sent a completed
questionnaire to a gay rights group with his signature at the bottom,
but denied that he read, approved or signed it. The biggest problem
with the unauthorized response by his top advisors, Simon said, was a
pledge that he would sign a Gay Pride Day proclamation as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over during his morning visit to San Francisco--home to
one of the world's most visible and politically influential gay
communities--Simon was pressed to explain his rationale. "Obviously,
they are free to do what they want," Simon said on another San
Francisco radio show. "Any group can get together and have a
celebration if they wish to, but to have the state recognize it with
a proclamation--no, I wouldn't support that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon declined repeatedly to say why.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign's response last month to 24 questions from the
gay rights group, Log Cabin Republicans of California, outraged some
conservatives, who accused the candidate of duping them into
supporting him. The Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values
Coalition and other conservatives welcomed Simon's Tuesday disavowal
of the signed questionnaire, but the candidate said their complaints
had nothing to do with his repudiation of the response.</TE>
<TE>   To some political analysts, Simon's troubles on gay rights seemed
emblematic of a stumbling campaign that has failed to set the agenda
in the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a bunch of incompetents running his campaign," said Dick
Dresner, a GOP pollster who worked for former Gov. Pete Wilson. "On
something this important, you shouldn't be making those kinds of
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Dresner said it was absurd that Simon was "trying to solidify his
base on the right" at a time when he must court Democrats and
independents.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's chief strategist, took the blame for the Log
Cabin mishap, saying that he failed to ask the candidate to review
the questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   "It never got past me," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   Russo said he glanced at it quickly and approved the use of
Simon's signature, which is stored on a campaign computer system. He
said there was no formal list of people who had permission to use
Simon's signature.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kind of knows what their authority is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rogers, a senior Simon advisor and former manager of the
campaign, supervised the response to the Log Cabin questions. In an
Aug. 9 e-mail, he sent a draft response to Log Cabin member Don
Genhart of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to get this version to Bill now," Rogers wrote. "Please
review and let me know if you have any MAJOR objections. Again,
please do not share with anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers declined to comment on whether he gave the draft response
to Simon. But Russo said Rogers did not.</TE>
<TE>   Genhart, who also is the Simon campaign's regional director for
San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said he was sticking with
Simon, but "the radical religious fanatical right has sort of entered
this thing."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel there's been some deception, not by Bill Simon, but maybe
by some people in our campaign," Genhart said.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, the gay rights controversy made it difficult to draw
attention Wednesday to his efforts to focus on schools, tax cuts and
questions about the ethical standards of his Democratic rival, Gov.
Gray Davis. A banner headline at the top of the San Francisco
Chronicle's front page blared: "Simon backs off on gay rights; GOP
candidate for governor recants under pressure from religious right."</TE>
<TE>   On a visit to a San Francisco elementary school, Simon told
reporters that gay people work for his campaign, though he did not
specify who they were or what positions they held. And after a speech
at a Rotary Club luncheon in San Jose, he said he had not
"flip-flopped" on gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   On a KGO-AM radio show in San Francisco, host Ronn Owens told
Simon that he seemed like "a guy who just doesn't like gays" or who
is "surrounded by people who don't like gays" and would do nothing to
foster acceptance of gay Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's just not true, Ronn," Simon said. "The fact is that
I met with a group of gay people in the beginning of August. We had a
good meeting. We had a good dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Simon declined to name any of the people with whom he met.</TE>
<TE>   Simon told Owens that he would "work to find the common ground,"
but the host responded, "This comes off so right wing, it's scary."</TE>
<TE>   "Ronn," Simon said, "I just think we have to continue the
dialogue, and when you talk about terms like centrist and right wing,
you know, I want to talk about things like jobs, taxes and schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got 2 millions kids trapped in failing schools, and people
are focused on a questionnaire," Simon told another interviewer on
KFOG, a San Francisco FM station. "It's so silly."</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / SIGNAL HILL</KH>
<HD>A Garden Spot Rises From Longtime Oilfield</HD>
<DH>Where wells once sprouted like weeds, Hilltop Park now
blooms. It is known for its whimsical sculpture and spectacular
views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Los Angeles' oldest oilfields has turned into something slick.</LD>
<LD>   That's the consensus of visitors to Hilltop Park in Signal Hill,
where old derricks and petroleum tanks have been replaced by a garden
and innovative sculpture that frame one of Southern California's most
sweeping vistas.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old park is perched on the western edge of
365-foot-high Signal Hill--named for the smoke signals that Puvuvitam
Indians used in the 1500s to communicate with tribal members living
on Catalina Island.</LD>
<TE>   These days, the unusual park is more of a signal that land-use
experts have finally come to make peace with old oilfields--not the
controversy, for example, that Los Angeles school officials became
immersed in over the site of the Belmont Learning Center in downtown
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of oil production, the top of the hill was not subdivided
and open space was preserved, ultimately allowing for the creation of
Hilltop Park," proclaims a marker at the park.</TE>
<TE>   On clear days, park visitors can gaze southeast, over Huntington
Beach, out to Catalina Island, across Long Beach and San Pedro, over
the South Bay and into downtown Los Angeles and eastward toward Big
Bear and the San Gabriel Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   On the left, they look down on ships being unloaded in Long Beach
and Los Angeles harbors. Below them on the right are jetliners taking
off from Long Beach Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The park was created by Signal Hill officials as a way of
camouflaging a new 1.2-million gallon drinking water reservoir on the
hilltop. Covering 3.2 acres, the park cost $414,000 and was paid for
by local development fees.</TE>
<TE>   Using a design by Long Beach landscape architect Jon Cicchetti and
artists T.W. Weir and Craig Stone, workers spread a thin layer of
soil over the top of the huge tank, and then built walkways and
decorative ledges and installed landscaping. They capped it with a
whimsical sculpture depicting a signal-fire pyre that actually spurts
a smoke-like water mist every half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   If water is at the center of Hilltop Park, oil remains at its
edges.</TE>
<TE>   A 74-year-old petroleum well next to the park's main entrance
silently pumps 29 barrels of oil a day from a pipe sunk 2,800 feet
into the ground. It's one of 450 oil wells operated by Signal Hill
Petroleum Co., said Ron Bates, a production engineer for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen other wells are visible from the park observation
walkways. Down the hill is the "discovery well," the shaft that
started it all. Drilled by Shell Oil Co. in 1921, it produced a
first-day gusher that attracted 15,000 cheering spectators. Today
Bates' company runs it.</TE>
<TE>   There were 160 oil derricks on Signal Hill by 1922. For a time,
there were so many of the spindly wooden towers crowding the ridge
that locals renamed it "Porcupine Hill." From a peak of about 3,000
wells, about 600 remain in use in the 2.2-square-mile city.</TE>
<TE>   Hilltop Park's interpretive sculpture serves as physical "picture
frames" that identify distant views for visitors. Short historical
notes explain Signal Hill's timeline.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors on Wednesday strained to see downtown Long Beach through
midday haze, however. A layer of smog obliterated the Palos Verdes
Peninsula. A glimpse of Los Angeles' downtown high-rises was out of
the question.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, we don't have a whole lot of clear days," said Dorothy
Friday, a Gardena resident who works for Signal Hill's Black Gold
Pump and Supply Co. She and a friend, Donna Kellner, were picnicking
on a summer fruit salad that Kellner had brought from Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought my mother up here one Sunday after church. We could
only stay 20 minutes, the wind was so cold. Actually, we don't want
the secret out about this place. It'll be too crowded at lunch," she
said. Nearby, Carlos Pimentel of Carson was eating a roast beef
sandwich and talking on his cell phone. Because of the hill's
height--or perhaps because of the cellular antennas lining a nearby
hilltop tower--reception was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "I come up here three or four times a week. I've told all my
co-workers about this place. The scenery is nice and you get some of
the stress out up here," said Pimentel, an executive with a wheel
accessory company.</TE>
<TE>   Park visitor Landon Richardson, a 19-year-old cashier from Long
Beach, said Hilltop Park has developed a reputation as a nighttime
date destination. That's because of the sparkling lights below, and
the fact that it's open until 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   For others, it's turned into an eye-opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I never realized Signal Hill was this pretty," said Michelle
Gray, a 14-year-old Lakewood resident who trotted through Hilltop
Park Wednesday with fellow Wilson High School cross-country runners
Bina Gold, Tracey Morgan and Ashley Hobelman. The team regularly jogs
up the hill during practice runs, stopping at the park's
reservoir-fed drinking fountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I came to this park, my impression had been it was a
trashy, industrial place."</TE>
<TE>   All of which proves that oil and water can mix. So can old
oilfields and people.</TE>

<HD>A Scene Right Out of 'Moby-Dick'</HD>
<DH>Accident: Skipper Jerry Tibbs dies at sea after his boat is
struck by a breaching whale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the stuff of hackneyed adventure fiction. A creature rises out
of the murky depths to attack hapless seafarers tottering about in
their frail boats.</LD>
<LD>   Haven't we heard this somewhere? Not this time, you haven't.
Believe it or not--and some marine experts have a hard time believing
it--a whale damaged a 22-foot fishing boat and killed the boat's
skipper in the waters off Central California this week.</LD>
<LD>   The way it happened is almost as astonishing as what happened. The
whale, variously described as a humpback or a gray, didn't just bump
into the boat. It landed on top of it while breaching in the waters
off the popular fishing port of Morro Bay.</LD>
<TE>   "In my almost 20 years in the Coast Guard, I have never heard of
anything like this happening," said Lt. Stephen LaLonde of the Coast
Guard station in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the accident knocked overboard the boat's owner,
Jerry Tibbs, 51, a popular restaurateur from Bakersfield. Tibbs was
lost at sea seven miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   His body was recovered Monday after search vessels and rescue
helicopters had scoured the sea for nearly 18 hours, according to
Michael Saindon, who is in charge of the Coast Guard station in Morro
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Hampering rescue efforts, Saindon said, were foggy weather and the
fact that the three passengers on board did not know how to use the
emergency equipment to alert the Coast Guard. "Time is everything" in
an accident, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous fish story of all time, "Moby-Dick," involves a
whale's battle with a sea captain, but marine experts say whales are
not known for being aggressive with boats. "That kind of thing just
doesn't happen," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist for the
National Marine Fisheries Service in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   However, fisheries spokesman Jim Milbury said he heard earlier
this summer that a baby whale had jumped on the transom of a boat off
Hawaii and broken a girl's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   And in January, an Alaska whale hunter died in the Bering Strait
when his boat was overturned by a harpooned gray whale.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in the fog--visibility was only 50 feet in Morro Bay on
Sunday--the whale didn't know the boat was there. A breaching whale
thrusts itself out of the water, sometimes exposing most of its body.
The enormous creature falling back into the water--humpbacks and
grays can weigh up to 40 tons--causes an explosive splash that makes
for some of the world's most impressive wildlife photography.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows why whales breach. Cordaro said there are several
theories: that they are trying to slough off barnacles and the whale
lice that attach to them, that it's some kind of signal to other
whales nearby, or that they do it just for fun.</TE>
<TE>   "They just may enjoy jumping out of the water," Cordaro said.</TE>
<TE>   It's likely that the whale didn't enjoy landing on the fiberglass
roof of Tibbs' boat, the BBQ, any more than those on board. Some
wildlife authorities speculate that the animal probably was injured
by its encounter. The damaged boat was towed back to shore by the
Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs was well known in Bakersfield as the owner of Mr. Tibbs
Ribs, a barbecue and Cajun restaurant that drew patrons from around
the southern San Joaquin Valley, according to his daughter, Tracy,
23.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew him," said Tracy Tibbs. "Flowers galore are piling
up outside the restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   But if Tibbs was popular in Bakersfield for his food and his
friendly smile, he may have been even more popular--and unusual--in
Morro Bay, where he and his wife had a condominium. Tibbs was the
rare black fisherman out in the deep water, his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than feel ill at ease, Tibbs was proud of it. "He liked
starting a trend," she said.</TE>
<TE>   His popularity was seen in the reaction of the fishing community
when word got out on Labor Day that he was missing at sea. "No one
fished that day," Tracy Tibbs said. "There must have been 50 surplus
boats out there looking for my dad."</TE>
<TE>   According to his family, fishing was more than an avocation with
Tibbs, a balding bear of a man. It was an obsession. The BBQ was his
third boat.</TE>
<TE>   "He had everything on that boat: a GPS [global positioning
satellite device], a fish finder," his daughter said. "He loved to go
40 to 60 miles out and then navigate his way back."</TE>
<TE>   He also was realistic, even sanguine, about the dangers. "The sea
was his friend," she said. But he had suspicions that it would get
him in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew anyone who was not afraid of death like him," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither did he court death. He observed safety procedures and knew
how to deal with weather. The others aboard the boat were less
well-schooled. The Coast Guard identified them as Charles and Alan
Brim, and Richard Arrington. Tracy Tibbs said they were friends who
just wanted to go fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach them Wednesday were unsuccessful. A relative said
they were "too traumatized" to discuss the accident.</TE>
<TE>   When Tibbs was knocked out of the boat by the whale, the others
struggled to get help. Coast Guard officials said the survivors
managed to get the radio working, but their unfamiliarity with the
boat's equipment delayed the rescue as much as an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Tibbs is not cursing her father's rare bad luck to have been
in a boat hit by a whale. She takes it as a sign that it was his
time. It was just too weird, she said. A whale jumps into the boat
and takes only him, a Jonah who did not come back.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Tibbs' best friend died a year ago and his ashes were
scattered at sea near Santa Catalina Island. Tibbs programmed the
exact location into his GPS.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, the Tibbs family will scatter his ashes at the
same spot.</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Gift Stirs Hope for 2 Ill Brothers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because of a $1-million research donation from Kaiser Permanente, two
Amador County boys with a rare genetic disease may soon get
experimental transplants that offer the only chance to save their
lives.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser, the state's largest HMO, had refused for months to pay for
umbilical cord-blood transplants for Hunter Bennett, 4, and his
2-year-old brother, Tommy. Their 6-year-old sister, Ciara, also has
the disease, but is not eligible for the transplant because the
illness has progressed too far.</LD>
<LD>   The HMO argued that the transplants themselves could be
life-threatening and had not been proved to work. But, after an
onslaught of media coverage, Kaiser agreed to donate $1 million to
Duke University in North Carolina for research into the children's
condition, known as Sanfilippo syndrome. Duke can use the money to
cover the boys' medical costs there.</LD>
<TE>   Technically, the HMO's decision does not set a precedent or change
its position on covering the experimental treatment--but it allows
the family to pursue its only hope.</TE>
<TE>   "As an organization made up of parents, grandparents, siblings and
children, we know exactly how you feel," wrote George Halvorson,
Kaiser's new chief executive, in a letter hand-delivered to the
Bennett family Wednesday. "We realize and appreciate that the
family's hope now rests beyond the realm of proven science and
evidence-based medical judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Sanfilippo patients lack a key enzyme needed to break down chains
of sugar molecules. The sugar molecules build up over time, causing
progressive organ damage and, ultimately, death. Most Sanfilippo
patients don't live past their mid-teens.</TE>
<TE>   A Duke researcher believes that the transplants using babies'
umbilical cord blood may be able to stop the progression of
Sanfilippo by replacing defective cells and providing the enzyme that
its victims lack.</TE>
<TE>   The boys' parents, John and Alicia Bennett, learned of Kaiser's
$1-million gift several minutes before the start of a prearranged
news conference Wednesday morning at Kaiser's national headquarters
in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than criticizing the HMO, as they had planned, the Bennetts
thanked them.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a light at the end of our tunnel," said Alicia Bennett, who
began crying when she learned of Kaiser's decision. "At least the
boys have a future now."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, director of the pediatric stem-cell
transplant program at Duke, said she was elated to hear about the
contribution. But she said she is still "a little bit gunshy,"
because she has not spoken to Kaiser officials directly.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly grateful that they would do this, and we will use
the money to treat these kids," she said. "If this gets worked out in
the next day or so, we'd have them come next week or the week after
to get the ball rolling."</TE>
<TE>   The parents had been frantically trying to raise $1.5
million--through raffles, dinners and community fund-raisers--to pay
for the experimental treatments. The parents had not even heard of
Sanfilippo until after all three of their children were born.</TE>
<TE>   The Times profiled their story last month, after which the family
received about $75,000 in donations.</TE>
<TE>   Although other insurers have covered cord-blood transplants for
Sanfilippo patients in the past, ethicists said Kaiser should not
necessarily be faulted for balking at an expensive, unproven
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   And a panel of independent medical experts hired by California's
HMO regulators upheld Kaiser's refusal this summer.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bennetts persisted. Because no other treatments are
available for Sanfilippo patients, the children's alternative was
death. Researchers have not devoted as much attention to Sanfilippo,
which affects just one in 70,000 children, as they have to more
common diseases.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's letter, Halvorson wrote that the HMO's action
doesn't change its contention that the "proposed experimental
treatment is both without any substantive evidence of value and too
risky for the children."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "We deeply hope that we are wrong ... and that our
contribution to Duke University will both help your children and
advance the medical community's understanding of how best to
eventually treat this insidious disease."</TE>
<TE>   Kurtzberg examined the boys in March, a month after the Bennetts
learned that their sons had the disease. Before proceeding with the
transplant, she needs to run a battery of expensive tests on them to
determine if they are good candidates.</TE>
<TE>   If they are, the boys will be admitted to the transplant unit,
where they will receive nine days of high-dose chemotherapy. On the
10th day, they will get the cord-blood transplant, which is
essentially a blood transfusion.</TE>
<TE>   Because the chemotherapy and transplant obliterate the body's
immune system, patients develop side effects including low blood
counts, fevers, sores in the mouth, diarrhea and vomiting.</TE>
<TE>   Patients are provided pain medicine, intravenous feeding and
antibiotics. The children must stay in the hospital four to six weeks
after the transplant, and then visit an outpatient clinic every day
for 100 days.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts, who have argued their case on television and in
newspaper articles, have made some important allies, including
California state Sen. Rico Oller (R-San Andreas), who has been
pushing Kaiser to change its position.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely tickled," Oller said of Kaiser's donation to Duke.
"They really wanted to do the right thing.... This is what we hoped
to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   The state's top HMO regulator also praised Kaiser's action.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a compassionate response given that their
doctors and independent doctors weren't willing to endorse this as a
medical procedure," said Daniel Zingale, director of the California
Department of Managed Health Care. "It sounds to me like that
contribution has the potential to accelerate the day when there is a
real treatment."</TE>
<TE>   John Bennett said he remembers how depressed he felt upon learning
that all of his children had this incurable disease. On Wednesday, he
said he felt "almost the opposite"--at least in the case of his two
sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's starting to look a lot better to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To cover remaining costs for their children's treatment, a Web
site is soliciting donations: www.helpachild.net. Donations also may
be sent to the Bennett Children's Fund, P.O. Box 1826, Jackson, CA
95642.</TE>

<HD>Angels, Kennedy Stay Hot</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Second baseman gets three hits, winning RBI in
4-2 victory over Devil Rays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The American League batting leaders, in
order:</LD>
<LD>   First, Mike Sweeney of the Kansas City Royals, a three-time
All-Star.</LD>
<LD>   Second, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees, a five-time
All-Star.</LD>
<TE>   Third, Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners, the defending most
valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   And, fourth, Adam Kennedy of the Angels, a guy who can't even get
a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, the hottest hitter in the major leagues, cranked out
three more hits and drove in the winning run Wednesday in the Angels'
4-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Kevin Appier won his fifth
consecutive start, and the Angels jumped 3 1/2 games ahead of the
Mariners in the wild-card derby.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (84-54) are 30 games over .500 for the first time in
franchise history. They can lose as many as 14 of their last 24 games
and still set a club record for victories in a season. The 1982
division champions won 93 games.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is hitting .324 overall, .416 since Aug. 1 and .511 during
his 12-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   "He's, like, 20 for 15, or something like that," Appier said.
"It's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy who platoons at second base with Benji Gil. The
platoon is over, at least for a day. Kennedy is expected to start
tonight, against Tampa Bay left-hander Joe Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   It's about time. Kennedy hit .242 in 99 at-bats against
left-handers last season, but he's hitting .293 in 58 at-bats against
them this season. Gil is hitting .274 against left-handers, in 73
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia repeatedly stressed that Gil won playing
time against left-handers last season more than Kennedy lost it, but
a platoon by any other name still is a platoon. Kennedy bristled
about the platoon last year but kept quiet and hit this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The platoon thing, he could easily have had a bad attitude about
that," outfielder Darin Erstad said. "He took it to heart. He went
out there to prove everybody wrong, and he's done a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kennedy: "I've always felt I could play like this. I got a
little frustrated. Now I'm starting to play well on an everyday basis
the past couple weeks, and at an important time."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy figured prominently in the rally that moved the Angels
another day closer to their first playoff berth in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied 2-2 and one out in the seventh inning, Bengie
Molina singled. Molina took second on a wild pitch, and Kennedy
singled him home with the winning run. Kennedy then stole second, and
David Eckstein singled him home with an insurance run. Eckstein had
three hits too and is batting .412 during his 11-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   That hitting made a winner of Appier again. He gave up two runs
and six hits, all singles, over seven innings. In his last five
starts, Appier is 5-0 with a 1.09 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia told Kennedy that the surest way to more at-bats was
better defense, and he took that to heart too, working with his
double-play partner, Eckstein, and with infield coach Alfredo Griffin
for endless hours during spring training. The Angels rank among the
top three teams in the league in double plays, and only the Mariners
have given up fewer unearned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, 26, is not the most valuable player in the league, but he
might be the most improved. He has displayed dramatic gains on
offense and defense in his third full season in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "You say improved, but he's still young," Erstad said. "He's still
getting comfortable in the big leagues. You have to find your groove,
and he's in the process of finding it."</TE>
<TE>   If he's grooving with Williams, Sweeney and Ichiro, he's pretty
close to finding it.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to say 'wow' about it," Kennedy said. "You see stuff
in this game turn around quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys are up there every year. It's nice to be near the top,
but I have to try to keep on like that."</TE>

<HD>Pinch Them: A's Win Record 20th in a Row</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Hatteberg hits pinch homer in the ninth for 12-11
decision after Royals rally from 11-0 deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>It wasn't pretty, but the Oakland Athletics clubbed their way into
history Wednesday night, and Billy Beane, the general manager who
makes a mockery of baseball's so-called competitive and revenue
disparities, suggested there's no way to know where this will end.</LD>
<LD>   "The great thing about being young and talented is that there's no
ceiling to what you can accomplish," Beane said. "I mean, these guys
have proved it the last two years."</LD>
<LD>   Well, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen may be
long gone from the team that roared through the second half to win
102 games last year, but the A's continued to extend the ceiling by
outlasting the Kansas City Royals, 12-11, to stretch their improbable
win streak to an American League record 20 games.</LD>
<TE>   A pinch-hit homer by Scott Hatteberg in the ninth inning after the
A's had blown an 11-0 lead enabled Oakland to register the longest
win streak in 67 years.</TE>
<TE>   The home run was Hatteberg's 13th of the season, a career high and
his first pinch-hit homer in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "My first hit in the big leagues was pretty emotional, but this
was as big as they come," he said. "This whole 'streak' has been like
a fairy tale, and this was just one more chapter."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's feat should be savored, if the A's had more than today's
off day to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can really appreciate it right now because of
the race we're in," Beane said. "Even last year, when we also had a
historic second half [going 65-17], it didn't really hit you how well
we played because we were fighting for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation now is that we have the media and television to
remind you of what we've accomplished historically, but we don't have
the time to enjoy it because we're looking over our shoulder at the
Angels and [Seattle] Mariners."</TE>
<TE>   For a sellout crowd of 55,528 at the Network Associates Coliseum,
the largest ever for a regular-season game, history overshadowed the
race in the AL West--temporarily, at least.</TE>
<TE>   Many in a walkup crowd of 20,514 were still at the ticket windows
when the A's seemed to remove much of the suspense from their bid,
attacking 15-game winner Paul Byrd for six runs in the first inning
on two triples, two doubles, two singles and an array of Kansas City
pratfalls.</TE>
<TE>   The lead was 11-0 after three innings, at which point A's starter
Tim Hudson, who was 5-0 with a 1.80 earned-run average in August and
is a cornerstone of Oakland's vaunted young rotation, started to lose
interest, giving up five runs in the fourth before struggling through
5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Mike Sweeney hit a three-run homer off Jeff Tam to
highlight another five-run Kansas City outburst in the eighth,
leaving history hanging by an 11-10 thread before Billy Koch gave up
the tying run in the ninth on a pinch single by Luis Alicea.</TE>
<TE>   There was one out in the home ninth when Hatteberg connected to
bring his teammates roaring from the dugout to celebrate the pivotal
blast and the history that came with it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hudson's struggle, A's starters are 20-4 in the last 30
games, which helps explain their amazing streak, or as Manager Art
Howe put it, "this is mostly about pitching. When you run the horses
that we do out there, you have a chance to win every night."</TE>
<TE>   Only two American League teams--the 1906 Chicago White Sox and
1947 New York Yankees--had won 19 in a row, and there are only two
teams who won more than the A's 20 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The 1916 New York Giants won 26 in a row, and the 1935 Chicago
Cubs won 21 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The A's can match the Cubs' streak Friday night, when they play
the first of 14 consecutive games against the Minnesota Twins, Angels
and Mariners, a telling stretch in their bid to reach the playoffs
for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   They have opened a seven game lead over the Mariners but can't
shake the Angels, who have gone 14-6 during Oakland's streak and are
only 3 1/2 games back in second place.</TE>
<TE>   "We've needed all 20," said Beane, paying tribute to the Angels'
determination. "I'd hate to think where we'd be if we had only split
them. However, the big thing to me at this point is that every win is
like taking the mortgage on a piece of turf that can't be reclaimed.
We want to make every game the last two weeks of the season as
meaningless as possible, and every win now diminishes the importance
of the games at the end of the year. The streak is a great means to
that end."</TE>
<TE>   It is that and more.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours before the harrowing finish of Wednesday's game, the
A's talked about their pride in achieving history.</TE>
<TE>   They also talked about retaining their focus, insisting the streak
is only a milepost in what Howe called a larger agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's good about having players who have tasted the
postseason is that they want to get back," Howe said. "This has been
a tall accomplishment amid a playoff atmosphere, and the energy and
focus have been outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident they'll stay focused on what they have to do. I
don't think they're looking at any other teams, and I don't think
they're worried about any other teams."</TE>
<TE>   Ringleader Giambi left as a free agent, but the A's clubhouse is
still one of the loudest and looniest.</TE>
<TE>   Beane made key acquisitions before the season (Koch and David
Justice among them) and key acquisitions (Ray Durham and John Mabry
among them) during it.</TE>
<TE>   Rescued from the White Sox, Durham shook his head and said,
"winning 20 in a row is just crazy. Maybe it happens in high school
or in basketball, but it's unheard of in professional baseball."</TE>

<LD>Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald writes that baseball is an
antiquated sport compared to football: "Baseball ruled this land
once, but now our national pastime feels past its time in more ways
than one, especially when juxtaposed with the spectacular
testosterone bursts football weekends provide....</LD>
<LD>   "Football, big and loud and violent, fits the America that
surrounds it. It is by far the most television-friendly of our
sports, and it requires very little attention span from the
generation raised on MTV, video games and the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   "Helps, too, that you get spectacular and choreographed violence
when your attention does happen to be engaged."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first UCLA player to be included in the
top 10 in Heisman Trophy voting?</TE>
<TE>   Stubborn: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "They can burn
their bras and brassies all they want but Augusta National's Chairman
[Hootie Johnson] isn't going to let the fairer sex in as members. No
sir....</TE>
<TE>   "Augusta will carry on as first conceived [interesting word], and
men will continue to belch the alphabet and water the trees without
worrying about offending women's sensibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Traveling winner: Tim Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
writes that the Oakland Athletics' winning streak is a feat of
staggering proportions.</TE>
<TE>   "But one thing about the amazing A's is not the least bit
surprising: David Justice is on the team. That figures, given his
penchant for turning up on winners. If the A's win the AL West this
season, Justice will have been on 11 consecutive division
championship teams."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you say: Philadelphia Eagle receiver Freddie Mitchell, on
his team's future: "You can't control the storm, you've just got to
adjust the sails."</TE>
<TE>   Game plan: From comedy writer Earl Hochman: "Penn State football
Coach Joe Paterno, 75, says his goal is to coach until he's 80, then
celebrate by sailing on his second ocean cruise, his first being
aboard the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Confusing: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News on the NFL:
"The new nearly correct geographical alignment that kept Dallas in
the East, St. Louis in the West and put Indianapolis in the South is
another result of males refusing to ask directions."</TE>
<TE>   Do they buy it? Bob Molinaro of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot: "I
don't trust the accuracy of those radar guns used to clock tennis
serves and fastballs. I'm convinced they register a little high. This
is the same argument I use on state troopers."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, UCLA routed San Diego State,
47-14. Five years later, on the same day, USC played to a 31-31 tie
with the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tailback Kenny Washington, who was sixth in the
voting in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Abe Lemons, former college basketball coach who died
Monday at 79, had a one-liner for every occasion.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, on disgruntled alumni at Oklahoma City University:</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to buy out my contract, but I couldn't make change
for $20, so they let me stay."</TE>

<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Terrell Davis, who in mid-August announced he was retiring from
the Denver Broncos, is profiled in the latest edition of "Beyond the
Glory."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a Super Bowl most valuable player, had problems with
injuries throughout his career. His first setback came during his
senior season at Lincoln High in San Diego when he suffered a
separated shoulder. He got passed over by major colleges and ended up
at Long Beach State. After one year there, the school dropped
football.</TE>
<TE>   From there, he transferred to Georgia, where his career was
hampered by migraine headaches and pulled hamstrings. He was drafted
in the sixth round by the Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' story is an interesting one, and is well told. Among those
interviewed are Davis' mother, brother and half brother. Davis'
father was a tough disciplinarian who one night got so angry he fired
gunshots over his sons' heads.</TE>
<TE>   Of his father, Davis says: "He wanted his children to grow up to
be tough. Bottom line, he didn't want any sissies in the family."</TE>

<HD>Johnson Delivers in Big Way</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He throws three-hitter, moves into fourth in
strikeouts in 7-1 Arizona win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Several Dodgers believed Monday night's 18-run demolition of Arizona
and Tuesday night's one-run victory over the Diamondbacks sent a
strong message to the defending World Series champions, that the
Dodgers posed a serious threat for the National League West title.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday came Arizona's reply to all: Randy Johnson dominated the
Dodgers, giving up one run and three hits and striking out eight in
nine innings to lead the Diamondbacks to a 7-1 victory that
reestablished Arizona as the division favorite and humbled the
surging Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Though the Dodgers won their ninth series in a row and were
pleased to complete a six-game trip through Houston and Arizona with
a 4-2 record, Wednesday's loss resulted in a significant swing in the
standings.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers trail the Diamondbacks by five games--they could have
trimmed the lead to three with a win Wednesday--with 23 games to
play. They remain 2 1/2 games ahead of San Francisco in the wild-card
race.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it a missed opportunity? Yes and no," Dodger catcher Paul Lo
Duca said. "They just beat us, and Randy was tough. Had we lost, 5-4,
maybe we would have looked at it as a missed opportunity. But they're
the world champions, so everyone has to go through them."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has rolled through the Diamondbacks lately--Arizona had
lost six of seven before Wednesday's game, scoring two runs or fewer
in five of the losses.</TE>
<TE>   But Matt Williams' three-run home run and Steve Finley's solo
homer helped stake Johnson to a 5-0 lead in the first inning, and the
6-foot-10 left-hander was almost untouchable as he improved his
record to 20-5 and lowered his earned-run average to 2.57.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who leads the major leagues with 293 strikeouts this
season, passed Bert Blyleven and moved into fourth place on
baseball's all-time strikeout list with his sixth-inning whiff of
pinch-hitter Jolbert Cabrera, which gave him 3,702 strikeouts in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson started the year in ninth place on the strikeout list, but
he has passed Walter Johnson, Gaylord Perry, Don Sutton, Tom Seaver
and Blyleven, pushing his total to 3,705 strikeouts Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Johnson and Arizona right-hander Curt Schilling
(21-5) also became the first teammates to win 20 games in consecutive
seasons since 1970-71, when Jim Palmer, Dave McNally and Mike Cuellar
each won 20 games for the Baltimore Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked up the paper [Wednesday morning] and everyone was
ripping [the Diamondbacks]," Lo Duca said. "Give me a break. They're
just going through a dry spell right now, but they're not going
anywhere, believe me. They're a good club, a veteran club."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers feel the same way about themselves, especially after
going 8-4 during a 12-game stretch against NL East-leading Atlanta,
Arizona and NL Central-contender Houston. The Dodgers won four of six
against the Diamondbacks in that span.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt we know we can beat them," Dodger third baseman
Adrian Beltre said. "We won the season series (10-9) against them, we
beat Randy Johnson before. If we go to the playoffs, we know we can
beat this team."</TE>
<TE>   Not if they stumble out of the gate the way they did Wednesday.
Dodger right-hander Andy Ashby's ERA did not take a beating--all five
Arizona runs in the first were unearned--but Ashby did.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Womack opened with a single and was initially ruled out on a
stolen-base attempt, but he kicked the ball out of shortstop Cesar
Izturis' glove with his slide and was safe.</TE>
<TE>   David Dellucci lined Ashby's next pitch into center field for an
RBI single. Junior Spivey popped out and Luis Gonzalez struck out
looking, but Ashby, who walked nine in nine innings of his last two
starts, lost his control and threw six straight balls, walking
Erubiel Durazo and falling behind Williams, 2 and 0.</TE>
<TE>   Williams sat on a fastball, Ashby threw one up and over the middle
of the plate, and Williams lifted a towering three-run home run to
left for a 4-0 lead. Finley then ripped an 0-2 pitch deep into the
right-field seats for his 21st homer of the season and a 5-0 lead.
Johnson padded the lead with a two-run double in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green hit his 40th homer with two out in the ninth. Green,
who hit 49 homers in 2001, became the first Dodger since Duke Snider
(43 home runs in 1955, 45 in 1956) to hit 40 homers or more in
consecutive seasons.</TE>

Unit Measure
Before Wednesday, Randy Johnson had experienced
only marginal success against the Dodgers this
season:
Date                                              IP  H  R  ER  BB  SO
May 26                                            5   8  7  7   2   5
Decision: None. Despite getting his 3,059th
strikeout to move to eighth on the all-time
list, Johnson gave up three home runs and
couldn't hold a four-run lead. But Arizona came
back ton win, 10-9
May 31                                            8   6  3  0   1   4
Decision: Win. With the exception of a
three-run home run given up to Marquis Grissom
in the seventh, Johnson was in control through
eight innings of a 6-3 Arizona victory
July 1                                            7   9  4  3   0   6
Decision: Loss. A run-scoring double by

<HD>U.S. Gets Rude Awakening</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Argentina gives so-called U.S. 'Dream Team'
made up of NBA players its first loss after 58 wins, 87-80.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM SMITH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Does anyone know how to say "Do you believe in miracles" in Spanish?</LD>
<LD>   Once considered invincible, the USA basketball team composed of
NBA players, the so-called "Dream Team," lost, 87-80, to Argentina on
Wednesday night for the first time in international competition at
the World Basketball Championship.</LD>
<LD>   The loss, at least for the rest of the world, produced comparisons
to the U.S. hockey team that defeated the Soviet Union's hockey giant
in the 1980 Winter Olympics. That game produced broadcaster Al
Michael's famous declaration about what often has been called the
greatest moment in U.S. Olympic history.</LD>
<TE>   "Personally, I'm embarrassed to be on a team that took the first
loss," said Paul Pierce, who led the U.S. team with 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   But he was among the American players to lose composure early in
the game when the United States fell behind 15 points in the first
quarter and 20 late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we can still go out and win the gold medal, but I'm
still on that team [that lost]," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States still can win this tournament with victories in
the quarterfinals Thursday against Yugoslavia and over the weekend in
the semifinals and finals. But the U.S. team of NBA players, put
together after teams of college players lost here in the 1987 Pan Am
Games and in the 1988 Olympics, was 58-0 before Wednesday's game
against Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   But the clever Argentinian team, which featured only one player,
Emanuel Ginobili, who will play in the NBA next season, clearly
outplayed the NBA team that featured seven All-Stars though none of
the league's few elite.</TE>
<TE>   Coach George Karl went to the bench early with the U.S. team being
outrebounded, and removed Pierce four minutes into the game after he
tried to trip one Argentinian player and to push another from behind.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustration came from what we were doing," Pierce said. "We
got kind of frustrated with the calls by the referees. We let it
affect us in the first half. We did not play our game. We did not
keep our composure and it hurt us. We dug ourselves a hole we could
not get out of."</TE>
<TE>   But it was evident the Argentine team was better prepared. They
repeatedly picked off the NBA players, who seemingly had their heads
spinning. It seemed more like a basketball clinic with the smaller,
smarter team outwitting the bigger, more talented team. Argentina
outscored the U.S. inside, 46-32, primarily on layups, and 18-6 in
the first quarter. The U.S. shot 37.5% and missed 12 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina reacted better to the international rules, several times
knocking away balls that bounced on the rim, which is legal, while
U.S. players watched. Even in the second half, when the United States
played with more desperation and closed within 64-58 late in the
third quarter, Argentina twice scored layups on inbound plays while
the United States continued to go one-on-one or shoot off one pass
with little offensive movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I said the only weak point they have is they don't know each
other," said Ginobili, who led Argentina with 15 points. "They are
not accustomed to team defense. When we made the pass with the small
guy to the big one, they didn't know whether to change, to switch or
not, who's going to go on top for the three. I think they were
confused with all the picks and moving game."</TE>
<TE>   The loss raised key points about whether the concept of putting
together a U.S. All-Star team is workable anymore against national
teams with more skilled players. Does the United States need its best
players now to win? Or does it need better team makeup? With Reggie
Miller limping on a sore ankle, the United States had no great
perimeter shooter with Ray Allen's withdrawal. There was no post-up
offensive player to challenge the defense and it is a relatively
small team with no true center.</TE>
<TE>   Although the American team had been considered vulnerable after
narrow victories over Lithuania in the 2000 Olympics and Brazil in
the 2001 Goodwill Games, the victory by Argentina was of worldwide
basketball significance.</TE>
<TE>   So where were you when the United States loss its first Dream Team
game?</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at each other and saying, 'Can you believe this?'
" said Ginobili, who will play in the NBA for San Antonio this
season. "Everyone was shocked. Now we are happy. It is really big. It
was close in the Olympics and the Goodwill Games. The big thing for
the world is someone beat them. Now we can believe it. Many have been
close, but no one ever did that. It will give hope to many teams.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't think we are really close to the States. They
definitely are much better. But in a single game in this kind of
tournament we can win. Many people say this wasn't a Dream Team. But
if you look at them you can say they are a Dream Team too. If they
had good preparation and stay together the time we do as a national
team, we can never beat them."</TE>
<TE>   Now for this team, there is just one chance for redemption,
winning the gold medal. When the game ended, Miller, the team's
captain, gathered the players.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the world is against us," Pierce said. "The referees, the
stands, everyone. The only thing we can do is go out and play hard
and win the gold medal. Everyone wanted us to fail. But we still have
a goal."</TE>
<TE>   And an unfortunate distinction.</TE>

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>BLACK September</HD>
<DH>Long before the Twin Towers fell, dream of security at
Games toppled when Arabs murdered 11 Israelis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Shiran Shamam is 16 years old, black-haired, sensitive, sweet. She
never got to touch her grandfather, kiss him, squeal for joy in his
big arms. All she knows of him is a grainy black-and-white photo, the
official one from the Israeli team rosters, that shows him with a shy
smile and raccoon-like circles under his eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Yoseph Gutfreund, Shiran's grandfather, a wrestling referee, was
one of 11 Israelis kidnapped and murdered by Palestinian terrorists
at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the games that forever changed the
Olympic movement. "All my friends have grandfathers. I don't," she
said. "I don't understand that the price he needed to pay for his
identity was his life."</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years ago today, the attack unfolded live, televised to a
worldwide audience. Overnight, the terrorists achieved their
political objective, elevating the Palestinian cause from virtual
obscurity. Afterward, the Israeli government spent years tracking
down, and killing, anyone it believed connected to the attack; only
one of the eight terrorists, Jamal al-Gashey, is believed to be still
alive, and living somewhere in the Middle East. At the Olympics,
security belatedly became priority No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the world has seen another televised terrorist attack, last
Sept. 11, and now, it is important to remember what happened in
Munich--to understand for the future the mistakes of the past and to
understand the terrible human toll a terrorist attack exacts. It
rips. It sears. It never goes away.</TE>
<TE>   "When they are born, they know about their grandfather," said
Shiran's mother, Yael Shamam. "We tell them the story."</TE>
<TE>   It never goes away. Last Sept. 9, the father of Shiran's best
friend was killed by a suicide bomber at the railway station in
Nahariya, a coastal Israeli town near the Lebanese border. When
Shiran came home from the funeral, on Sept. 11, she turned on the TV,
only to see the World Trade Center towers burning, then crashing to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The horror, one thing on top of another, was awesome.</TE>
<TE>   "I really felt like, I can't have my children here in this world.
It's crazy. I didn't know how to explain it to myself. I asked my
mother, have I gone crazy?" she said. Then she paused, and added:
"Thirty years have passed. But the hatred still continues."</TE>
<TE>   A Premonition of Danger</TE>
<TE>   The 1972 Olympic Games were billed as the "Games of Joy." In
Munich, the idea was to show the world how things had changed since
1945 and the end of World War II, a war in which the German
government had overseen the execution of 6 million Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights before the 28-member Israeli delegation departed for
the Games, Ilana Romano and her husband, Yossi, which is what
everybody called him, threw a party. She was 26, he was 32. She had
seen him on the beach seven years earlier, "someone so strong and so
gentle," and now they had three daughters, the oldest 6, the youngest
5 months old, and Ilana Romano was scared--afraid of what might
happen, again, to Jews on German soil.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Yossi I was so afraid," Ilana Romano said. "Yossi said,
'Ilana, you are crazy. If Germany prepares something, they do it
100%.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Games began Aug. 26. The Israelis marched in to the Olympic
Stadium behind the blue-and-white flag emblazoned with the Star of
David, a nation among nations. What was to fear?</TE>
<TE>   For the next few days, as Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut tumbled and
American Mark Spitz swam to glory, much of Israel remained consumed
with the exploits of Esther Shakhamorov Roth, a sprinter and hurdler.
Israel had been sending athletes to the Games for 20 years, since the
1952 Olympics in Helsinki; Roth represented Israel's first legitimate
chance for a medal. The thought of a Jew winning a medal at an
Olympics in Germany was so delicious the entire country seemed on
edge with delight.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 1, Roth, racing in a field of eight, won her first-round
heat in the women's 100-meter dash. In the second round, later that
day, she finished fourth, advancing to the semifinals. In Jerusalem,
Tel Aviv, Haifa, everything stopped when she was running, even the
government. Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister, said things could
wait a minute while they found out how Esther was doing.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, in the second of the two semifinal heats, Roth
finished fifth. Only the top four made the finals. Just that fast,
she was out.</TE>
<TE>   But only in the dash. The 100-meter hurdles were still to come.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 4, Roth finished fourth in the first round, good enough
to move on to the second. Her longtime coach, Amitzur Shapira, was
waiting for her at the finish line, joy spread wide across his face.
Roth was 19, Shapira 40. He had discovered her six years earlier,
nurtured her talent, driven her to and from practice because her
parents didn't have a car.</TE>
<TE>   Shapira was more than her coach. He was like a father to her, and
he was waiting for her expectantly at the finish line. He told her
this was the "happiest day of my life."</TE>
<TE>   That night, much of the Israeli team went into town to see a
production of "Fiddler on the Roof," starring Shmuel Rodensky, a
renowned Israeli actor. The play was in German, but Shapira knew
Yiddish, close enough, so he could translate for Roth, sitting beside
him. At intermission, the team was invited for a glass of wine. Group
photos were taken. There were cheers all around.</TE>
<TE>   "From the first steps I took in athletics," Roth says, "I was
told, 'We will prepare you for the Olympic Games.' And here I was at
the Olympic Games. It's not a thing you can describe in words."</TE>
<TE>   She tries: "I feel I'm in paradise.... Everything for me was like
making dreams real. I was like a child, giving [Shapira] everything
he wants."</TE>
<TE>   After midnight, the delegation returned to the Olympic village.
Shapira told Roth he would see her the next morning at breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   She slept soundly. After dawn, there was an urgent knock on her
door. It was Shlomit Nir, a swimmer, the only other woman in the
Israeli delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry, Nir said, now, get out of bed, hurry, fast. We have to
move. There are terrorists. We know one or two on our team may
already be in trouble but we don't know who.</TE>
<TE>   Shots at 31 Connollystrasse</TE>
<TE>   Around the Olympic village stood a chain-link fence. It was about
6 1/2 feet high, not topped with barbed wire, easy to scale.</TE>
<TE>   Just after 4 in the morning on Sept. 5, a group of men carrying
sports bags and wearing sweatsuits bearing the names of Arab
nations--Libya and Saudi Arabia, and others--approached the fence
near Gate 25A, which was routinely locked at midnight but left
unguarded.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a group of American athletes, coming back to the
village after a late night out, approached the same stretch of fence.
One of the men wearing an Arab-team uniform helped one of the
Americans over the fence; the American returned the favor.</TE>
<TE>   Several officials, including half a dozen German postmen, saw the
people climbing the fence. Nothing seemed remarkable--athletes had
been climbing the fence throughout the Games, especially those who
had been out drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the fence, the Arabs--in all, eight terrorists--headed
toward the housing complex at 31 Connollystrasse. Of the 28 members
of the Israeli team, 21, all men, were living there. The terrorists
headed to Apartment 1 and slipped a key, a copy they had somehow
obtained, in the door.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the lock wouldn't budge, and the sound of the key
scraping against the lock alerted Gutfreund, the 40-year-old
wrestling referee. He crept out into a communal lounge. The door
yielded. In the dim light, he saw gun barrels. He screamed, "Take
cover, boys!" and threw his 6-foot, 290-pound frame at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Wrestling coach Tuvia Sokolovsky, who shared Gutfreund's room,
broke open a window and ran out as the terrorists forced their way
into the unit.</TE>
<TE>   As the leader of the terrorist group, later known to the world as
Issa, entered another room, 33-year-old Moshe Weinberg, another
wrestling coach, lunged at him with a fruit knife. Another terrorist
fired a single shot; it ripped into Weinberg's cheek.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists pulled Weinberg off the floor and rounded him up
with Gutfreund and four other Israelis: Shapira, the track coach;
Andre Spitzer, a 30-year-old fencing coach and the father of a
newborn; Kehat Shorr, a 53-year-old rifle coach of Romanian descent
who had fought the Nazis during World War II; and Yaacov Shpringer, a
52-year-old weightlifting judge who was born in Poland and who had
been the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberg was still conscious. He was pushed and shoved to another
apartment--Unit 3, the terrorists inexplicably passing up Unit 2,
where five other Israelis were sleeping, among them Shaul Ladany, a
race walker who as an 8-year-old had been liberated from the
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   Still asleep in Unit 3 were three weightlifters and two wrestlers.
The weightlifters were David Berger, 28, a 180-pound
light-heavyweight who had grown up near Cleveland; Zeev Friedman,
also 28, born in Siberia; and Romano. The wrestlers: Eliezer Halfin,
24, and Mark Slavin, 18. Slavin, born in Russia, had arrived in
Israel four months before the Games. He was a real talent, perhaps a
medal threat; his Olympic debut was scheduled for later that day,
Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   There was another Israeli wrestler in Unit 3, but he was
awake--Gad Tsobari, who a few days before had completed his
competition in Munich in the light-flyweight freestyle event, for
wrestlers 106 pounds or less. He'd been woken by the shot fired at
Weinberg. Curious, careful not to wake up Berger, his roommate,
Tsobari opened the door to see what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   He was met by a terrorist in a bright yellow sweater who turned a
gun on him. Issa.</TE>
<TE>   A few seconds later, Berger appeared at the door. "He made the
same mistake I did," Tsobari says. "He was trapped like I was."</TE>
<TE>   Slavin, Halfin, Romano and Friedman had already been captured.</TE>
<TE>   "They were without masks," Tsobari recalls of the terrorists.
"They looked Arabic. They were poker-faced."</TE>
<TE>   Guns aimed at their chests, the six Israelis were ordered out to
join Weinberg. He was clutching a handkerchief tied under his chin,
as if this were a surreal cartoon and he had a toothache. "I've been
shot," he said to the others.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, Issa asked in exasperation, speaking in English,
"Where are all the Israelis?" Tsobari says, "He didn't even know this
building housed [most of] the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists--there were five of them at Unit 3--pushed the
seven Israelis into a line. The prisoners were ordered to put hands
on heads, even Romano, who had torn a ligament in one leg during
competition and was on crutches.</TE>
<TE>   Berger, speaking in Hebrew, said, "Let's get them! We don't have
anything to lose." One of the terrorists apparently understood,
however, and raised his gun at the group.</TE>
<TE>   As they were led into the foyer of Unit 1, Tsobari, the first in
line, was met by a rifle pushed into his stomach. Acting on instinct,
"I pushed [the rifle] over the wall," Tsobari says. "And I ran,"
toward a basement and an underground parking lot, where he zigzagged
through a warren of concrete pillars.</TE>
<TE>   At least one terrorist chased him, shooting. Tsobari felt two or
three shots whizzing past.</TE>
<TE>   As Tsobari made his break, Weinberg punched and tackled one of the
terrorists, then made a grab for a gun. One of the terrorists firing
at Tsobari wheeled on Weinberg. He shot straight into Weinberg's
chest, killing him.</TE>
<TE>   One Israeli dead. The other 10 were herded into Unit 1.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that Romano would die. The other nine spent most of
their final few hours there, arms bound, bullet holes marking the
walls, their friend Romano on the floor in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Tsobari, 5 feet 4, dressed in only pants, no shirt, no
shoes, within a few minutes reached the Olympic press center and a
CBS camera crew. He didn't know they were a U.S. TV crew, only that
they were speaking English. Tsobari speaks English poorly. He tried,
saying, "I coming from the group of Israelis. Terrorists come to my
house. They shoot after me."</TE>
<TE>   For a full 20 seconds, Tsobari says now, the camera crew laughed
at him.</TE>
<TE>   A Corpse in the Street</TE>
<TE>   The first call to Munich police came at 4:47 a.m., from a cleaning
woman who phoned to say she'd heard shots at 31 Connollystrasse.</TE>
<TE>   About 5:10, as a Munich police officer walked outside the
three-story building at 31 Connollystrasse, Issa dropped a typed
communique from a second-story window. It called for the release of
234 prisoners in Israeli jails as well as two behind bars in Germany,
radicals Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. Authorities had until 9
a.m., or the terrorists would start executing their Israeli hostages.</TE>
<TE>   As proof of their determination, Weinberg's corpse was thrown into
the street.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorists called themselves Black September. The name came
from a battle in Amman, Jordan, on Sept. 17, 1970, between
Palestinian guerrillas and the Jordanian army; at least 4,000
Palestinians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 yards away from where Weinberg's body came to rest, in
Unit 5, Shmuel Lalkin, the head of the Israeli delegation, saw the
corpse and began calling Olympic and Israeli officials and Israeli
journalists. About 6:30 a.m., German police took him to the office of
Walther Troger, the head of the Olympic village. Lalkin immediately
got back on the phone to Israel, on a direct line to the prime
minister's office.</TE>
<TE>   What, however, could be done? Meir had announced many times before
that Israel would not bargain with terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Tsobari finally had been taken under protective armed guard. After
being given some clothes, he sketched out what he remembered--where
he was, how many terrorists he saw and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the Israeli delegation arrived. They listened to
the radio, sweated, worried, tried to comfort each other.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what was going on," Roth says.</TE>
<TE>   Swimmer Nir's fiance was a member of Sayeret Matkal, the elite
Israeli commando team that at the time was one of the few military
squads in the world trained in counter-terrorism tactics. Its leader
then was Ehud Barak, the future Israeli prime minister. "I said, I'm
sure [they] will come over to Germany and do something," Nir says.</TE>
<TE>   While the hostages remained at the Olympic village, however,
nothing was done. This was the result of an unbelievable lack of
preparation combined with spectacular bungling by German authorities
and pressure from Olympic officials, in particular outgoing IOC
President Avery Brundage. He wanted the crisis resolved. He wanted
the Games to continue.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans were ill-prepared and ill-equipped to do anything,
however. For instance, no armed police officers patrolled the Olympic
village and surroundings. Why? Because German authorities, eager not
to evoke memories of the Nazi years with armed guards in dark
uniforms, had stationed about 2,000 "security officers" in light-blue
uniforms on patrol in Olympic Park, but none at the village. And
these officers were "armed" with walkie-talkies, no guns.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't the Germans send a SWAT team to 31 Connollystrasse?
Because they didn't have one. It wasn't until after the Games that
the German authorities acknowledged the need for an on-call SWAT
team. A late-afternoon plan to storm the compound came to an abrupt
halt when police realized that people all over the world--including,
most probably, the terrorists inside the Israeli units--were watching
live TV shots of German police, lamely affecting a disguise as
athletes in sweatsuits, moving into position on the roof of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   A Face in a Window</TE>
<TE>   The 9 a.m. deadline was unrealistic, and even Issa had to know it.
The first deadline was extended. New deadlines were posted, then
passed, amid frantic negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   It was during the siege of 31 Connollystrasse that ABC went live
from the village, with Peter Jennings on the scene and Jim McKay
anchoring coverage. ABC was feeding its coverage worldwide, and thus
the world caught sight of the image that has since come to symbolize
the day--a hooded terrorist moving along a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   About 5 p.m., fencing coach Andre Spitzer was brought to the
second-floor window. In his undershirt, arms behind his back, Spitzer
spoke briefly to German officials standing below. Then one of the
terrorists whacked him on the back of the head with a gun butt. A few
moments later, he was hauled away.</TE>
<TE>   In Holland, Spitzer's wife, Ankie, watched the episode on TV.
Spitzer had just returned to Munich the night before. He had been in
the Netherlands, where his wife's parents lived; he was visiting
Ankie and their sick newborn daughter, Anouk. When he had reached
Munich, Spitzer had called his wife from a pay phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I have only 50 pfennings left," he had told her. "I have to talk
fast." A few moments later, he said, "I have only 10 pfennings left."
Then, in Dutch, "I love you." Ankie Spitzer recalls, "I didn't even
say it back because the phone clicked," the connection dead.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes after Spitzer appeared at the window, Troger, the
mayor of the Olympic village, and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German
interior minister, were allowed into Unit 1. They saw nine living
souls and one corpse, Romano's.</TE>
<TE>   Troger has said many times since that the mood inside the room was
"not very hopeful."</TE>
<TE>   Photographs taken a few hours later make clear just how desperate
the situation must have seemed to the Israelis. One of the photos,
obtained by The Times, shows Yossi Romano's body, face-up, blood
stains on the floor under him. His arms are limp above his head,
hands near his ears. His torso is covered in a white tank top. He has
no pants on. His blue underwear is torn in front; his groin is a
bloodied mass.</TE>
<TE>   Around him are markers of the sort typically used by police to
locate shell casings or bullet holes. Eight are easily visible. In
another photo, taken from a different angle, the number of shot
markers--this in a small dormitory-style room--climbs to 15.</TE>
<TE>   The photographic record strongly suggests that Yossi Romano was
castrated. But such evidence is not definitive, and the truth may
forever remain in dispute. In the book "One Day in September," which
relies in part on interviews made for an Oscar-winning movie of the
same name, Al-Gashey, the sole surviving terrorist, is quoted as
saying that any suggestion Romano was tortured is a "complete lie."</TE>
<TE>   Ilana Romano, Ankie Spitzer and a very few others who have seen
the photos, however, are convinced that Yossi Romano was tortured. "I
never forget, the terrorists said, 'We had a friendship in the room
[with the hostages],' " Ilana Romano says. "Ask me what kind of
friendship. And after this, some people have the nerve to call them
'freedom fighters.' "</TE>
<TE>   After Genscher and Troger left the apartment, the plan to storm 31
Connollystrasse was put into play. Then, on live TV, aborted.</TE>
<TE>   According to an English-language summary of legal documents filed
years afterward in a Bavarian court, German officials said that the
IOC, particularly Brundage, exerted intense pressure at that point to
get the Israelis out of the village.</TE>
<TE>   The minutes from the IOC's executive board meeting, which for
years remained confidential, indicate the board's feeling: " ... the
Games must continue at all costs." In fact, the Games had carried on
for most of that day, Sept. 5, a postponement not imposed until 3:51
that afternoon--at which time IOC officials had known for hours that
at least one Israeli, Weinberg, was dead. They had scheduled a
memorial service for the next morning and anticipated resumption of
events later in the day, Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, as night drew near on the 5th, the stage shifted from the
village to the military airfield at Furstenfeldbruck, about 14 miles
west of Munich.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans tried pretense. They told the terrorists they had
agreed to a demand issued late in the afternoon by Issa, to fly the
terrorists and Israelis to Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   The real plan, however, was to try to ambush the terrorists at the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Terrorists, Not Five</TE>
<TE>   During the day, thousands of Olympic athletes--and others--had
gathered around the village. Now, as night fell, they were able to
see the hostages with their own eyes. The Israelis were led, heads
down, hands tied, out of 31 Connollystrasse.</TE>
<TE>   The scene turned even more surreal. "I'll never forget this," Roth
says. "It was like a picture from the cinema. I kept seeing
flashbulbs," photos taken by the gathered thousands, "rat-tat-tat,
like in a stadium."</TE>
<TE>   She adds, "I didn't see Amitzur going to the bus." She thought,
"Maybe he's alive."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli team doctor gave Roth two sleeping pills. If the
hostages were rescued, she would still compete in the 100-meter
hurdles. She went to sleep dreaming of Shapira: "If Amitzur is alive,
I run for him. I win for him."</TE>
<TE>   Two buses took the terrorists and Israelis to two gray-green
Iroquois Bell helicopters. The choppers would ferry them to the
airfield at Furstenfeldbruck.</TE>
<TE>   Into the first chopper went Shapira, Spitzer, Slavin, Shorr and
Gutfreund, sitting left to right on a bench, as well as Issa and
three other terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Into the second went Berger, Friedman, Halfin and Shpringer, and
four terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans were stunned to learn there were eight terrorists.
They were operating on the assumption there were only five. The plan
for the ambush at the airport had factored in five terrorists, not
eight.</TE>
<TE>   It took about 20 minutes to fly the Israelis and terrorists to the
airport. No one managed in that time to tell the five German riflemen
waiting at the airport to expect eight terrorists, not five.</TE>
<TE>   According to an English-language summary of legal documents filed
in German court, which cites German after-action reports, as well as
other sources that have sought to re-create what went awry at the
airfield, there was a litany of other errors as well:</TE>
<TE>   The shooters were not specially trained or qualified marksmen.
They were not told where the helicopters would land. They were not
given bulletproof vests or steel helmets. They did not receive night
scopes for their rifles. Nor, in an amazing breach of police
standards, were they even given walkie-talkies to communicate with
each other, or their commanders--even though thousands of
walkie-talkies were available from the "security officers" in the
village.</TE>
<TE>   Because there were no walkie-talkies, snipers 3, 4 and 5--who were
positioned on top of the control tower building--did not know where
snipers 1 and 2 had been placed. Incredibly, sniper 2 was positioned
directly in what became the firing line.</TE>
<TE>   Also, improbably, armored cars that could have helped at the scene
were delayed en route to the airport by a traffic jam that developed
when it became clear to the curious multitudes where the helicopters
were headed.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, onboard the Lufthansa Boeing 727 already parked at the
airfield--the plane purportedly due to take the terrorists and
Israelis to Cairo--there was another problem, a huge breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   The first element of the German rescue plan involved the placing
of police officers, posing as an airline crew, inside the 727. There,
they were to overpower however many terrorists--probably two, most
probably Issa and his deputy, Tony--who, it was accurately believed,
would have gone to check out the plane before the hostages were
brought on board. The plan called for the snipers to then take out
the remaining terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   A team of 17 heavily armed German police officers was assigned to
the plane. Upon arrival, they observed that the front of the plane
offered little cover for an ambush and that a single hand grenade
thrown at the back--where the officers would have had to hide--would
be lethal to many, if not all of them. It was also observed that the
plane was loaded with nearly 10,000 gallons of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before the helicopters arrived, the officers--having
decided that it would be suicidal to stay on, orders be damned--left
the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the helicopters landed, about 10:40 p.m., the order
was given to the German riflemen: "Fire!"</TE>
<TE>   Here came one more mistake. Only two snipers fired--thus depriving
the Germans of the opportunity of taking out as many terrorists as
possible with the first volley of shots.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing firefight lasted more than an hour, ending shortly
after midnight. One of the terrorists threw a grenade that exploded,
setting one of the helicopters ablaze, with Berger, Friedman, Halfin
and Shpringer captive. The five Israelis in the other helicopter were
shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   Berger, who had initially been hit by gunfire in the thigh, not a
mortal wound, died from smoke inhalation, according to an autopsy
report cited in legal papers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Israelis, five of the terrorists, among them
Issa, were killed. Also killed was one German policeman, Anton
Fliegerbauer.</TE>
<TE>   Lalkin, the chief of the Israeli delegation, identified the bodies
at the scene. "Horrible," he says, particularly those that were
burned.</TE>
<TE>   Photos of the Israelis in the other helicopter, the one not
burned, show the dead Israelis handcuffed and bloodied. Autopsy
photos, also obtained by The Times, make plain the savagery of the
attack; one photo shows an Israeli corpse with wrists bound together
with red cord, chest and left wrist marked by bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   Troger, who has been an IOC member for many years, has said of the
German efforts: "It was just one mistake. We were unprepared."</TE>
<TE>   Ilana Romano says, "That's a big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Lalkin says, "I brought [10] coffins back to Israel. What should
they tell me, they're sorry? Maybe they're sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the night, erroneous reports had gone out on several
newswires indicating that the hostages had been saved. At ABC, none
of those reports were read on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, early in the morning of Sept. 6, Jim McKay told American
viewers, "We've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my
father used to say our greatest hopes and worst fears are seldom
realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They have now said that there were 11 hostages. Two were killed
in their rooms this morning--excuse me, yesterday morning. Nine were
killed at the airport tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all gone."</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, the sun rose, illuminating the carnage at the
field; the night had been moonless and the extent of the destruction
had to wait for dawn. Back at the village, Esther Roth opened her
eyes. "People know what happened," she says. "They don't know how to
tell me. But I understand."</TE>
<TE>   'You Don't Have a Father Anymore'</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, earlier in the evening, Meir, the prime minister, had
called Rachel Gutfreund to say everything was all right. "My mom
said, 'If he doesn't call us, it's not OK,' " Judith Salman, the
older of Rachel and Yossi Gutfreund's daughters, recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Judith and her sister, Yael, had been pulled from school the day
before. Classmates had come up to them and said, "They killed your
father." The girls, then 14 and 12, ran home to find their mother
crying. Throughout the 5th, mother and daughters knew he was a
hostage, still alive, but little more.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 in the morning on the 6th of September, someone knocked on
the front door of the Gutfreund residence. Judith recalls: "My mother
said, 'That's it, you don't have a father anymore.' "</TE>
<TE>   Judith plunged into disbelief: "I started laughing. He was such a
big guy.... They couldn't shoot him." This, she says, was a man who
loved his wife, his daughters, life. "He would get a raise in his
salary, say, 'Let's go!' And we'd be on vacation for three days."</TE>
<TE>   In Munich that morning, a crowd of 80,000 people jammed the
stadium. In the front row sat the Israeli delegation, 17 of 28; 11
seats remained empty. No Arab delegation sent a single
representative.</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Brundage declared, "The Games must go on." Which
they did, at 4 p.m.--after a moratorium that lasted 24 hours 9
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Lalkin also spoke. "I remember sitting in the field, we were
crying, listening to the voice of Shmuel Lalkin saying, Israel must
continue, no one will scare us, we will continue," Roth says. "We
came back to Israel. But there was no one to continue."</TE>
<TE>   After the memorial, the Israeli team went back to the village to
get their belongings--as well as those belonging to their 11
teammates. On his way to get his things, as well as those of his
friend David Berger, Tsobari says, "I walked by the stairs to No. 1
that I'd escaped from. I started sweating. I stopped. I felt like I
was still in front of the terrorists. I felt so bad. It's a moment I
can't forget, like I'm inside a dream."</TE>
<TE>   Someone got Yossi Gutfreund's things. Some of his clothes were
stained with Yossi Romano's blood, "so you know he had tried to
help," Judith Salman says. Also recovered was Gutfreund's camera, his
sunglasses, his referee's whistle, his Olympic village keychain. Film
in the camera, developed later, shows the Israeli team marching into
the opening ceremony of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Gutfreund's daughters say their father had the camera and
sunglasses with him in the helicopter. "He was so positive all the
time," Judith says, adding, "He thought he was going to go visit an
Arab country," so he'd need sunglasses, of course, and a camera might
be handy.</TE>
<TE>   At the airport near Tel Aviv, the Israeli delegation, and the 10
coffins--Berger's body was sent back to the United States--were met
by a weeping mob. When Tsobari got home, there were 500 people
waiting for him.</TE>
<TE>   He could barely cope, that night and for some time to come. Lalkin
says, "Gad Tsobari for two years was not in his mind," and Tsobari
agrees. For a while, Tsobari says, he drank to try to forget. But he
couldn't. He couldn't sleep, and when he could, he was plagued by
nightmares, running away, always running away.</TE>
<TE>   Shlomit Nir, now Shlomit Nir-Toor and for the past nine years a
deputy in the Israeli Ministry of Science, Culture and Sport, also
had nightmares. For a year she kept dreaming she was like Tsobari,
"running away from the Arabs," underneath the Olympic village. "I saw
this place, the same location all the time, I couldn't run out of
it."</TE>
<TE>   About a year and a half after the attacks, Yossi Romano's mother,
unable to cope with the loss of her son, committed suicide. She
burned herself to death, Ilana Romano says.</TE>
<TE>   Within five years, his brother also committed suicide. He hanged
himself, she says.</TE>
<TE>   After the knock on the door at the Gutfreund residence, Rachel
Gutfreund "didn't eat for two weeks," her younger daughter, Yael
Shamam says. "We had to force her."</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a great love," her sister, Judith says. Rachel and
Yossi were married in 1956, he never finishing university but
excelling in sports, she a secretary. Since she'd been a teenager,
her health had never been quite right. Even so, they were blessed
with two healthy daughters. A terrier named Doobie rounded out the
family. People still laugh at the memory, the funny picture they made
walking down the street, Gutfreund, a gentle bear of a man, his
diminutive wife, and their small dog.</TE>
<TE>   After Yossi's murder, Rachel Gutfreund was so lonely, she was
virtually unable to function. Although diabetic, she would secretly
go on chocolate binges. "She wanted to die," Judith says.</TE>
<TE>   The two young sisters, meantime, were left to cope with their
mother, and to fend for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You ask, 'Why me?' " Judith says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was jealous of my friends that had fathers," Yael says. "I was
jealous. I didn't want to go to their house and they had a father
there. Why did they have a father and I don't have?"</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Gutfreund died in 1986 of complications from diabetes. To
this day, though Judith has lived in Canada for 12 years, Yael has
stayed in Israel, the two sisters talk by phone two, three times
daily, sometimes more.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of abandonment remains vivid. The sisters have nine
children between them--Yael has five, Judith four--and while the
older ones are now in their teens and early 20s, all the children
know that Rule No. 1 is to check back home with a frequency that
would drive most kids crazy--no more than an hour without checking
in.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say I'm with friends," says 18-year-old Lihi Salman,
Judith's third child. "If I don't call her, she assumes the worst. If
my [cellular] battery is dead, I go to a pay phone and call her."</TE>
<TE>   "I know if I go downtown or something," particularly to the
pedestrian mall in Jerusalem, long a favored Israeli hangout but the
scene in recent months of suicide bombings, "she will kill herself,"
Shiran Shamam says. "So I just don't do it."</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, the Gutfreund grandchildren helped fill the stage when
the Israeli Olympic Committee threw a party to commemorate 50 years
of taking part in the Games. The celebration was shown live on
Israeli TV--and once again, the nation was captivated by Esther Roth.
She cried, the camera zooming in on her, as the names of Amitzur
Shapira and the others murdered in 1972 were read aloud.</TE>
<TE>   In Munich, she says, "All my ideals were killed. All the innocence
inside me was killed, the justice in the world."</TE>
<TE>   For her, it was a struggle to resume running. A few months after
the Games, she was married; then she became a mother. She started
training again, reluctantly at first, motivated not by romance or
idealism or personal glory. "My goal," she says, "was to finish the
mission I started in Munich and I was not allowed to finish."</TE>
<TE>   She also says, "I was among the best in the world so [meet
organizers] must take me. But I feel they don't want me, don't want
the security risk," adding, "If I go to the toilet, people come with
me."</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, at the Montreal Summer Games, the Israeli team was led
into the stadium at the opening ceremony by Esther Roth. She not only
made it to the hurdles finals, the first Israeli finalist at the
Olympics, she finished sixth--behind five women from the Eastern
Bloc. Her time, 13.04 seconds, would have won her bronze in Los
Angeles in 1984; it's still so fast she would have placed seventh in
Sydney two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   'We Can Remember'</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, at the Barcelona Games, two Israeli judo experts, Yael
Arad and Oren Smadja, won Olympic medals, Israel's first. "A medal
can't bring them back from the dead," Arad said of those slain in
1972, when she was 5 years old. "But we can remember."</TE>
<TE>   As Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, put it, "This is a trauma
that will stay with us forever. Of all the modern terrorist events we
have had, the one in Munich remains the worst. The idea that they
were in the helicopters, and just massacred, helpless, and on German
soil, some 25 years after the end of the Holocaust," he pauses and
clenches his fists, "it is absolutely shocking to us.</TE>
<TE>   "And to think this was done in the midst of the Olympic Games, and
to think that one day later the Games resumed as if nothing happened,
it is intolerable for us."</TE>
<TE>   On the anniversary of the slayings, which falls just before the
start of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year and one of the holiest
days in the Hebrew calendar, there are memorial services in various
cemeteries in Israel. Five of the 11--Shapira, Shorr, Halfin, Slavin
and Spitzer--are buried at the Kiryat Shaul cemetery in Tel Aviv, and
Lalkin says, "I've been to [that] cemetery more than I've seen my
dead parents."</TE>
<TE>   September is still hard for Ilana Romano. Her eldest daughter,
Oshrat, was married 10 years ago on Sept. 8--sticking to the date
despite her mother's concerns. As she told her mother, "In September,
my father is here with me, and I want him at my wedding."</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years after, I feel September in the air," Ilana Romano
says, and this September promises to be particularly difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in 1972," she says, "opened the door to terror, and
nobody has come to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sept. 11 of last year, I felt so sick. I didn't sleep for
three nights. I told myself, God help the widows and the children and
the mothers and the fathers. I know everything within the hearts of
what these families feel."</TE>
<TE>   She also says, "For me, it's so symbolic. September is September,
and 11 is 11," the date of the attacks the same as the number of
slain Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   What sense is there in all of it? Shiran Shamam can only touch her
grandfather's Olympic keychain, look at the old photos, imagine what
might have been, what could be.</TE>
<TE>   "Questions arise in my head," she said. "Does he know that I
exist? Is he looking at me sometimes? I know that if he is looking,
he is very proud of my mom, the life and the family she has built for
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about what will be 20 years from now, I fear that
the world will forget what happened at those Olympic Games in Munich,
and thus it is very important for me to continue and to tell as much
as possible about the story of my grandfather, so that they will
know, will remember and will not forget for an instant.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the largest lesson that can be learned from that
event is the fact that it could have taken place," she said, adding a
moment later, "We must all pray and hope for better days, open our
eyes to wider horizons so that we may all live, all people, in peace
and quiet, and know no more sorrow."</TE>

<HD>Officials Like India's Potential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next potential soccer giant is a sleeping giant, according to
soccer officials who this week visited India, the second-most
populous country in the world.</LD>
<LD>   "India has a large pool of soccer players and the sport has a long
history in this country," Paul Mony Samuel, who is coordinating a
FIFA project to promote soccer in developing countries, told
Associated Press. "It just needs to reorient itself. The leading
clubs need to be encouraged to lay stress on their youth programs."</LD>
<LD>   Samuel is part of a team studying the status of Indian soccer,
which was one of Asia's leading powers until the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   India won the Asian games in 1951 and 1962 and made it to the
semifinals of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   India has been an afterthought in its continent of late, though.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel said that India's decline is in part because of the
country's best teams "poaching" players from smaller clubs and not
developing new talent.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested a countrywide program to encourage youths to
participate in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment," Samuel said, "too little is being done by too few
people here."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Soosay, a senior official from the Asian Football
Confederation, joined Samuel on the tour and scolded India, telling
reporters that the country needs to "wake up from the slumber of the
last three decades" and "adopt a more professional outlook" toward
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "India remains a high-potential country," Soosay said. "Ours is a
mission to reinvent Indian soccer. You've seen what South Korea,
Japan and China have achieved in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "[India] can be at par with the best and [women's soccer] has
scope for tremendous growth."</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal Takes Financial Pounding</TE>
<TE>   Premier League and FA Cup champion Arsenal said Monday that it had
lost $33.88 million) in the last financial year and blamed it on an
increase in player wages.</TE>
<TE>   "The new players added to the squad in preseason ... meant our
playing staff was 71 compared to 63 for the previous year," Arsenal
chairman Peter Hill-Wood told Associated Press. "We also negotiated
new contract terms with a number of first-team players and team
management.</TE>
<TE>   "We are actively pursuing a policy to control and reduce our wage
bill while maintaining a playing squad capable of bringing further
trophies back."</TE>
<TE>   The financial losses were caused by a $32.02-million increase in
player wages with the acquisitions of Sol Campbell, Francis Jeffers,
Richard Wright and Giovanni van Bronckhorst.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to curb its losses, Arsenal has released Wright and
allowed Lee Dixon, Gilles Grimandi and Junichi Inamoto to leave, and
longtime captain Tony Adams retired.</TE>
<TE>   A $23.1-million stadium project also contributed to Arsenal's
financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   More Power to Sermanni as Coach</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sermanni, an assistant with the San Jose CyberRays of the
WUSA, was named coach of the New York Power on Wednesday. Sermanni
replaces interim coach Charlie Duccilli, who took over for the fired
Pat Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   The Power finished last in the eight-team WUSA this season, going
2-1-9 under Farmer and 1-8 under Duccilli.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Power went 7-5-5 and advanced to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Nyet Go for Sychyov</TE>
<TE>   Russian striker Dmitry Sychyov, a rising star in his country's
soccer program, will not play for the Russian national team in its
opening European Championship qualifier against Ireland on Saturday
after Coach Valery Gazzayev blasted Sychyov's physical and
psychological conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "If a player lacks in playing practice, his physical condition
does not allow him to play for the national team," Gazzayev, who took
over as the Russian coach following the World Cup, was quoted as
saying by the news agency ITAR-Tass. "Psychologically, Dmitry is not
fit for challenging tasks."</TE>
<TE>   Gazzayev has intimated that Sychyov's woes were because of the
player's quarrels with his club team, Spartak.</TE>

<HD>Reed Puts an End to Twins' Skid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Minnesota Twins needed to get out of their funk, Rick Reed's
big-game experience showed.</LD>
<LD>   Reed outpitched Jamie Moyer and the American League
Central-leading Twins ended a season-high five-game skid with a 3-2
victory over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "He's proving why he's been an All-Star," Minnesota Manager Ron
Gardenhire said. "He is proving now why he has been around for so
long. He's a veteran who knows how to compete and get people out."</LD>
<TE>   Jacque Jones had three hits for the Twins, who won the season
series (5-4) against Seattle for the first time since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Reed (13-7) gave up six hits, struck out five and walked one in 7
1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   When Edgar Martinez walked in the fifth, it was only the fifth
walk given up by Reed since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit his spots, he's done a great job hitting his spots," said
Bret Boone, Seattle's No. 3 hitter who was 0 for 3 against Reed.
"Look at the success he's had.... It just goes to show you don't need
to have a 95-mph fastball to be successful in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Third-place Seattle fell 3 1/2 games behind the Angels in the
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth inning and got his AL-leading
39th save in 45 opportunities despite giving up a leadoff home run to
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Boston 1--Jason Giambi put host New York ahead with an
opposite-field, two-run homer against Derek Lowe (18-7), and Andy
Pettitte rebounded from a sore back to lead the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   After the Yankees lost the series opener, Roger Clemens and
Pettitte (9-5) defeated Boston on consecutive games, increasing New
York's AL East lead to eight games over the second-place Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte, scratched from his previous start because of a stiff
lower back, is 10-4 against Boston in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, Texas 3--Tony Batista had three hits at Baltimore,
including a two-run homer, and the Orioles ended a 10-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Texas right-hander Aaron Myette, who was ejected after throwing
two pitches behind Melvin Mora on Tuesday, became the first major
leaguer to start games on consecutive days since Oakland's Steve
McCatty in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Myette (2-5) lasted only three innings, giving up five runs, five
hits and six of the 11 walks given up by Texas pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Rodriguez and Todd Greene homered for the Rangers, giving
Texas a club-record 22 consecutive games with a home run.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Detroit 3--Jaret Wright won for the first time in
nearly 15 months, and the Indians took advantage of sloppy fielding
by the Tigers at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, one of the most promising pitchers in the game before
being plagued by injuries, had been 0-5 with a 17.83 earned-run
average since defeating Minnesota on June 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He spent much of the last three seasons on the disabled list or on
rehabilitation stints in the minors after surgery on his right
shoulder in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Wright (1-3) gave up three runs and six hits in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians needed only three hits to break open the game with a
six-run sixth inning as the Tigers committed several blunders.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Chicago 2--Pete Walker (8-4) pitched seven effective
innings at Toronto, where the Blue Jays ended Chicago's seven-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Valentin homered for the White Sox, who went 5-1 on a
six-game trip to Detroit and Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays supported Walker with three double plays.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, a 33-year-old journeyman claimed off waivers from the New
York Mets, has the second-most victories on the team.</TE>

<HD>Cook Getting Near the End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>If this is the last month of Dennis Cook's career, his kids will grow
up with a pretty good idea of what dad did for 18 summers of his
life. When he pitched an inning at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga last
week, he set up three chairs in the bullpen so his 4-year-old
triplets could watch him warm up. Before the game, when he ran on the
field, his kids ran with him.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to have those memories," Cook said. "I want them to have
them. That was kind of cool."</LD>
<LD>   Cook did his best to rehabilitate his damaged left shoulder, and
the Angels activated the reliever for the last month, but for now
they are not inclined to use him in a close game. He said he would
have surgery to repair his torn labrum and rotator cuff "as soon as
we win the World Series or get eliminated" but said he would defer
any decision about retirement until January. He turns 40 next month.</LD>
<TE>   "If I feel like playing, I can make some calls and see if I can go
to camp with somebody," he said. "If I'm having fun staying home with
the kids, I'll do something else."</TE>
<TE>   Cook, a former Dodger teammate of Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, has
pitched for four playoff teams and won a World Series championship
ring with the 1997 Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's over," Cook said, "I'll tip my hat and thank everybody."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The announced crowd of 10,146 Tuesday was so small and so quiet
that shortstop David Eckstein said his college guidance counselor,
listening to the game on radio, could actually hear conversations of
fans in the stands.... The Angels do not plan to promote any
additional players from triple-A Salt Lake until the Pacific Coast
League playoffs end, barring an injury to a major league player. The
playoffs started Wednesday and could extend through Sept. 15. Among
the players under consideration: outfielder and PCL MVP Robb Quinlan,
who hit .333 with 20 home runs and a league-leading 112 runs batted
in, shortstop Alfredo Amezaga and right-handed reliever Francisco
Rodriguez, who has 59 strikeouts in 42 innings.... The Angels
extended the contract of Rex Hudler, their television analyst. Steve
Physioc, the television play-by-play man, received a three-year
extension when his contract expired last year. Hudler, whose contract
was up this year, is believed to have received a three-year
extension.</TE>

batting order in his first few games back. The Angels are 16-6 since
Salmon last started Aug. 10, when his left hand was hit and badly
bruised by a pitch.</TE>

<LD>Boston right-hander Pedro Martinez probably won't pitch against
Toronto on Sunday, the second consecutive start he won't make because
of an injury.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to let him pitch if he can't pitch," Red Sox
Manager Grady Little said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-time Cy Young Award winner rode a bicycle for about a
half-hour before Boston's game against New York on Wednesday, but it
was unclear whether he would throw.</LD>
<TE>   He played catch Monday for the first time since starting against
the Yankees on Aug. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Little said Martinez has a hip injury and Martinez said his groin
is bothering him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle utility player Mark McLemore will have surgery today to
remove bone chips in his right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mariners said they hope to have McLemore back this season.
They said he could return in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The regular season ends Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore, who will be 38 on Oct. 4, is batting .272 with a
career-high seven homers, 41 runs batted in and 18 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   He can play third base, second base, shortstop and the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said right-hander Joel Pineiro has a
sore left hip, and that his next start will be delayed two days until
Tuesday at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto pitcher Chris Carpenter will sit out nine to 12 months
after having surgery on his right shoulder to repair a small tear.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter has been on the disabled list since Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst-case scenario is that he'll be out a year. The
best-case scenario would be eight to nine months," General Manager
J.P. Ricciardi said.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter, 27, said he hurt the shoulder during a start at Oakland
on August 13.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter had a 4-5 record and a 5.28 earned-run average in 13
starts. He pitched the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays also said right-hander Luke Prokopec will have his
sore right shoulder examined by an orthopedic surgeon today.</TE>
<TE>   Prokopec is on the 60-day disabled list. The former Dodger hasn't
pitched since Aug. 23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego released right-hander Bobby J. Jones because they need
his rotation spot to continue auditioning young pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who was 7-8 with a 5.50 ERA, wouldn't have started again
this season and would have gotten little work out of the bullpen,
General Manager Kevin Towers said.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres had a $6.125-million option on Jones for 2003.</TE>

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>Greenspan Show Airs Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Olympic filmmaker Bud Greenspan and his late wife Cappy worked the
1972 Munich Olympic Games for NBC Radio. Greenspan, then 44, went
from reporting on athletic achievements to a major news event once
Palestinian terrorists took 11 members of the Israeli delegation
hostage in Building 31 of the Olympic village on the morning of Sept.
5.</LD>
<LD>   Using his radio reports as a backdrop, Greenspan has compiled a
100-minute documentary to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the
Munich massacre.</LD>
<LD>   "The 1972 Munich Olympics: Bud Greenspan Remembers" will be
televised on Showtime tonight at 10.</LD>
<TE>   The film, narrated by Will Lyman, features comments from
Greenspan, newly discovered archival footage and interviews with
about 30 Olympic officials, athletes, politicians, journalists and
relatives of those killed.</TE>
<TE>   Those interviewed include Shmuel Lalkin, head of the 1972 Israeli
Olympic team, Walter Troeger, mayor of the Olympic village in 1972,
and Gen. Ulrich Wegener, who became the head of Germany's GSG-9
counter-terrorism force when it was created after the Olympics.
Wegener was candid in discussing all the mistakes the German police
and security forces made.</TE>
<TE>   Gad Tsobari, an Israeli wrestler, talked about his escape after 10
minutes as a hostage.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured are many athletes in the spotlight during the 10
days of the Munich Games leading up to Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's film will be the second documentary on Munich to be
shown on national television this week. Sunday, ABC aired "Our
Greatest Hopes, Our Worst Fears: The Tragedy of the Munich Games." It
featured many of the ABC personnel who covered the Games, including
Jim McKay and Peter Jennings.</TE>

<HD>Her Master Plan</HD>
<DH>Martha Burk takes on Augusta, CBS and Hootie as she seeks
to end discrimination</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She is the leader of a women's group that has zeroed in on forcing
the most powerful and historic golf club in the nation to admit its
first female member. And now, if that weren't enough, Martha Burk is
threatening to add a new, auxiliary target in her fight: CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The network that has broadcast the Masters the last 46 years has a
simple choice, the chairwoman of the National Council of Women's
Organizations said: "They will come down on the side of bigotry, or
they can reconsider their position."</LD>
<LD>   In a Wednesday conference call with the NCWO's 10-member board of
directors, Burk received approval to appeal to CBS and the USA
Network that they drop coverage of the Masters "and stop underwriting
discrimination."</LD>
<TE>   And the married, 60-year-old mother of two boys isn't stopping
there. She wants to examine the makeup of the decision-making group
at CBS that has said it plans to go ahead and televise the Masters
when it is played at the private Augusta National Golf Club next
April.</TE>
<TE>   "How many women are in top management as opposed to the clerical
pool, and how much are they paid?" Burk said in a telephone
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports, declined to comment when
reached at his home Wednesday night. Earlier in the day, CBS issued a
statement that it plans to continue televising the event--news that
came as no surprise to the many media insiders who seem convinced
that another network would quickly move to pick up the coverage if
CBS backed out.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday, Burk and her group had, with some success,
concentrated their efforts in trying to dissuade sponsors Citigroup,
IBM and Coca-Cola from supporting the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Hootie Johnson, Augusta's president, responded last Friday by
dropping television sponsorship for 2003. That way, he said, the
sponsors wouldn't be "pressured" by the women's groups.</TE>
<TE>   But that announcement, and the timing of it, has only raised
Burk's ire. She suggested that by choosing the start of a holiday
weekend to make his proclamation, Johnson was trying to avoid a
spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought it would be all over by Tuesday, they could hit when
the other guy can't hit back, that this would die a natural death,"
Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   Burk, who advances her case with a wit as dry as the summer in her
East Texas hometown of Tyler, hasn't let that happen. And as the
point person of a crusade backed by an umbrella organization that
represents some 160 women's groups, she now has other targets in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   She intends to contact Augusta National members and find out who
pays their dues. If it's a corporation, she said she will contact it.
She also expressed optimism that some members of the men's
professional tour might speak out against the private club.</TE>
<TE>   Those hopes took a hit Wednesday when former Masters champion Mark
O'Meara and three other PGA Tour players said they would not pressure
the 70-year-old club to admit women as members.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta "is a private club and they can choose who they want to
include," said O'Meara, the 1998 Masters and British Open champion.
"If you don't like the policy, don't go to the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Tway, Mike Weir and Scott Verplank, in interviews at the
Canadian Open, also defended Augusta. Verplank said the NCWO should
be concerned with more important women's issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Why aren't they doing more for women in Afghanistan?" Verplank
said.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said her group has raised millions in support of women's
rights in Afghanistan, but that it is also interested in breaking
bastions of all-male clubs. "Nobody can accuse me of not dealing with
real issues," Burk said. "If [golfers] don't want to step across the
line for women, that's sad."</TE>
<TE>   So far, support has been no less forthcoming from the women's
tour. Amy Alcott, a member of the LPGA's Hall of Fame, said the two
times she has played Augusta are "a true highlight" of her career. "I
was treated with the utmost respect," Alcott said</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it would be great, and also keeping with the times, to
have women as members. But it's not easy for a man to be admitted
either. It's a private club that should be able to have its own
guidelines for membership."</TE>
<TE>   Tour veteran Dottie Pepper, interviewed by Dan Patrick on ESPN
radio on Wednesday, also defended Augusta's right to remain private.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect such comments to deter Burk, who, despite some early
setbacks, still considers the stance taken by Johnson and Augusta to
be an unpopular one. "I'm at a loss [to explain it]," she said. "And
I've got a PhD in psychology."</TE>
<TE>   Burk has been an available, quotable news subject since the issue
of whether all-male Augusta National, where the Masters is played
each April, ought to admit women as members was raised earlier this
month. Women are allowed to play the course only as guests of a
member.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the 21st century," said Burk, who played golf as a
youngster but no longer does. "These guys need to come into it."</TE>
<TE>   Burk and the NCWO, which represents such women's groups as the
League of Women Voters, the National Organization for Women, the
Assn. of Junior Leagues International, the American Assn. of
University Women and the YWCA, are offering a push.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old NCWO is "a well-respected umbrella of women's
activism in social and political issues," according to Richard
Lapchick, chairman of the Devos Sport Business Management Program at
the University of Central Florida and Director Emeritus of the Center
for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University.</TE>
<TE>   Burk graduated from the University of Houston in 1962 and earned
her Masters degree at the University of Texas at Arlington, where she
also earned her doctorate. She is a licensed psychologist in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   A democrat, Burk was on the national board of directors of the
National Organization for Women from 1988 to '90 and served on the
National Task Force on Pay Equity. She also was president of the
Center for the Advancement of Public Policy until she became chairman
of the NCWO.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization of Women, said
Burk is a skilled administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a very good negotiator," Gandy said. "She's just so good
about handling all the various concerns in our organization. And
we're all concerned with making women's lives better."</TE>
<TE>   Gandy says that Burk's fight is not hers alone, but belongs to all
the women's groups in the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important," she said. "Somebody asked me, 'Doesn't
the movement have bigger fish to fry?' Bigger fish to fry than
discrimination against women? These people discriminate against women
and they do it quite blatantly."</TE>
<TE>   Burk was once editor of a newsletter called the Women's Action
Connectiv, formerly Washington Feminist Faxnet, which encouraged
"action" to advance women's equality.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Burk is intent on trying to earn her second Masters degree,
although certainly a different one than before. She points out that
Augusta National has a legal right to exclude women.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a legal issue," she says. "This is a moral issue."</TE>
<TE>   And Burk clearly intends to press on and take the fight wherever
necessary. She was in rural Maine attending a conference when Johnson
announced Augusta would exclude its Masters television sponsors.
Burk's cellular phone had no service, but when she finally could use
it, her message box was full.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to respond to Johnson's move, Burk drove 90 minutes early
Saturday morning to a town with a television station equipped to
conduct a satellite interview.</TE>
<TE>   Said Burk: "I think it was the biggest thing in town for quite a
while."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Larry Stewart and Peter Yoon contributed to
this report.</TE>

<LD>Nebraska running back Thunder Collins was charged again with
assaulting his girlfriend, and the team suspended him for the next
three games because of an unrelated NCAA investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, a former East Los Angeles College and Manual Arts High
standout, was charged last year with pushing his live-in girlfriend
several times, putting her in a headlock and grabbing her by the
throat. The charges were dropped after he entered a domestic violence
prevention program.</LD>
<LD>   Lancaster County prosecutor Gary Lacey refiled the two misdemeanor
assault charges last month because Collins failed to complete the
program and pay $200 in fees.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Twelve of the more infamous characters in NFL history, in no
particular order:</LD>
<LD>   Conrad Dobler (offensive lineman, Cardinals, Saints and Bills,
1972-1981)--His bite was as bad as his bark. No joke: Minnesota
defensive players actually asked for rabies shots before facing him.
He reserves his most biting comments for defensive linemen: "If you
can understand a 3-year-old, you can understand most defensive
linemen."</LD>
<LD>   John Henry Johnson (running back, 49ers, Lions, Steelers and
Oilers, 1954-66)--When they were facing Johnson, every Cleveland
player would pitch in $50 for the guy who landed a crushing hit on
Johnson. No one ever collected the cash. "I can remember going in on
a Monday morning in our training room and there would be five or six
guys on the table," longtime Cleveland tackle John Wooten said. "And
each one of them was cursing John Henry."</LD>
<TE>   Andre Waters (defensive back, Eagles, 1984-93)--Nicknamed "Dirty
Waters," he was always looking for the hit that would send someone
off on a stretcher. Said Dallas running back Emmitt Smith after a
1993 game against the Eagles: "I didn't even know he was in the game,
but then one time I carried the ball and heard him saying, 'Hold him
up, hold him up, I want to get a shot at him.' He was saying, 'I'll
break your leg.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jack Tatum (defensive back, Raiders, 1971-79)--Most famous for his
hit that paralyzed New England receiver Darryl Stingley in 1978,
Tatum also put Hall of Fame receiver Lynn Swann in the hospital with
a crushing blow. Tatum wasn't necessarily dirty, but his collisions
were so brutal they should have been outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Runyan (offensive lineman, Oilers/Titans, Eagles,
1996-present)--Every member of the Philadelphia offensive line was
fined for illegal hits last season, and this summer Runyan was
slapped with another $7,500 tab for spearing. He recently said he has
the "perfect job"--instead of going to prison for doing what he does,
he gets paid.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Wisniewski (offensive lineman, Raiders,
1989-2001)--Astonishingly friendly and arrow-straight off the field,
Wisniewski was one of the NFL's meanest players during his career. He
claimed he simply played until the whistle blew, but league officials
said otherwise. Once, on a trip to New Zealand, he was asked by the
All Blacks to join their rugby squad. He politely declined. "They
wanted me to be their secret weapon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Williams (offensive lineman, Cowboys, Ravens, 1991-2001)--The
king of the head slap, Williams was caught on tape in a 1995 playoff
victory over the Packers when he cut blocked defensive tackle John
Jurkovic and blew out Jurkovic's knee. The hit was ruled legal--no
flag was thrown--but it was far outside the moral bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Romanowski (linebacker, 49ers, Eagles, Broncos and Raiders,
1988-present)--TV cameras caught him spitting in the face of San
Francisco receiver J.J. Stokes, and that was only one of many
Romanowski transgressions. "Let's just say guys always hated playing
against me, but they loved having me on their team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lester Hayes (cornerback, Raiders, 1977-86)--One of the best
bump-and-run defenders of all time--with or without stickum--Hayes
also knew how to get in a shot when the refs weren't looking. "If I
accidentally made contact with your eye or throat or knocked out your
bicuspids or accidentally punched you in the gonads, there were no
rules of engagement."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Lambert (linebacker, Steelers, 1974-84)--The meanest guy
around, especially when he popped out his front teeth, Lambert--like
Tatum--was more vicious than he was dirty. Once, though, he was
thrown out of a game at Cleveland when he plowed into quarterback
Brian Sipe along the sideline. Asked later why he got the boot,
Lambert said: "The official said I hit him too hard."</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Turley (offensive lineman. Saints, 1998-present)--As nasty as
he wants to be, especially when it comes to cut blocks. "I don't

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>Oscar-Winning Film Told Story of Terror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In awarding the Oscar for best documentary two years ago to "One Day
in September," many Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
voters clearly sought to send a message--to revive interest in how
and why the Palestinian terrorist attack on 11 Israelis at the 1972
Munich Olympic Games came to be, and in the sheer brutality of the
way the Israelis were attacked, held hostage and, ultimately, died.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the movie has been seen worldwide. In Sydney, for
instance, during the 2000 Summer Games, it was shown in a theater in
Circular Quay, steps from the famed Opera House</LD>
<LD>   The movie has served as a training film of sorts: Craig Arnold,
the leader of the Kansas City FBI unit that served as the SWAT team
on call during the 2002 Winter Games, made certain his 12-man squad
watched it before taking up positions in Salt Lake.</LD>
<TE>   In Germany, where the story of what happened in 1972 had for years
been muted, the film in February 2001 was awarded that nation's
Golden Camera award for best international film. Two months after
that, a negligence lawsuit brought by families of the 11 slain
Israelis against German authorities was settled.</TE>
<TE>   The movie traces the story from the initial hostage-taking through
the firefight. It also includes interviews with, among others, the
sole surviving Palestinian terrorist, Jamal al-Gashey, who has been
in hiding for more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Army Archerd, the longtime Variety columnist, said in a reference
to producer Arthur Cohn, "He and the academy stood alone on the
mountaintop proclaiming what an injustice had been done and that such
injustice should never be done again. Those scenes from that movie--I
don't think we can ever eradicate them from our minds, how those
athletes were massacred and how that was allowed to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Of Oscar voters, Archerd added: "There is a very large percentage
of voters of the academy who are most interested in seeing that films
say something of import. Film is the most powerful tool the country
has internationally, and the sincere members of the academy--and
there are many--want to see those products receive their due."</TE>
<TE>   Echoed Tom O'Neil, an author and expert on Oscar voting, "In a few
categories--like documentary and foreign film--the voters actually
have to see everything nominated to vote. There are screenings set up
that are policed and monitored. These are races where buzz and
popularity and sentiment have no effect at all. If something wins, it
wins because it has merit, impact and relevance."</TE>
<TE>   Cohn, who lives in Basel, Switzerland and whose other
Oscar-winning films include "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis" and
"Black and White in Color," said: "People around the world ... think
the academy is there to honor Julia Roberts or Barbra Streisand or
Steven Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   "What is overlooked, and not known, is that the academy ... has an
absolute desire to push those films not recognized so they should be
seen and recognized worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "For the Germans to honor a film that is so critical of
Germans is incredible." It shows, he said, "decency and a respect for
a story that needed to be told."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Johnson Paying Off for Arizona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown got the seven-year, $105-million contract
before the 1999 season, a perk-filled deal that includes 12 round
trips per year on a private jet, but the Diamondbacks are getting a
far greater return on a smaller investment in Randy Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson signed a four-year, $52-million deal with Arizona on Dec.
1, 1998, a few weeks before Brown signed with the Dodgers, and the
Diamondbacks exercised a 2003 option for $13.5 million, bringing
their total investment in Johnson to $65.5 million in five years.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers were one of four teams to make Johnson an offer in the
four-year, $50-million range, but many criticized then-general
manager Kevin Malone for not pursuing Johnson as vigorously as he did
Brown.</LD>
<TE>   Who got more bang for the buck? In the four years since Brown and
Johnson headed that winter's free-agent class, Johnson is 77-27 with
a 2.54 earned-run average and 1,376 strikeouts, and Brown is 44-22
with a 2.92 ERA and 595 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has won three Cy Young awards, has two 20-win seasons, and
he has led the Diamondbacks to one World Series championship and two
National League West titles. Brown's Dodgers have not reached the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 37, has been on the disabled list six times as a Dodger and
has undergone two major surgeries; Johnson, who turns 39 on Tuesday,
has not gone on the disabled list as a Diamondback.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who threw a three-hitter with eight strikeouts and no
walks Wednesday, also improved to 10-1 in 16 starts this season
following a loss. Arizona won each of those games in which Johnson
had a no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan did his best Spiderman impersonation Wednesday,
scaling the wall in an attempt to rob Matt Williams of a first-inning
home run, but the Dodger left fielder wound up on a training-room
table instead of a highlight reel.</TE>
<TE>   The ball nicked off the tip of Jordan's glove and landed in the
bullpen, part of a five-run first that catapulted Arizona to a 7-1
victory. Jordan, who was sidelined for three weeks in August because
of a protrusion in his lower back, aggravated the injury and left the
game in the bottom of the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Jordan, who was listed as day to day, nor Manager Jim
Tracy believed the injury was serious, and Jordan expects to play
when the Dodgers begin a three-game series against Houston on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tweaked it, no doubt about that," Jordan said. "It wasn't worth
it, because I didn't come down with the ball. I could have stayed in
the game, but [Dodger trainers] wanted me to get some treatment and a
day of rest. I should be ready Friday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek sat out Wednesday's game because
of a tender right hamstring, a condition that has bothered him for
about a month. But the injury is not serious, and Grudzielanek is
expected to return for Friday night's game against Houston.... Las
Vegas Manager Brad Mills, in his first year in the Dodger
organization, has been named Pacific Coast League manager of the year
after guiding the 51s to a league-best 85-59 record.</TE>

<HD>They Want to Continue Their Run of Titles</HD>
<DH>Prep cross-country: Riverside Rubidoux's boys' team is
favored to repeat as Southern Section and state Division II champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Riverside Rubidoux High boys' cross-country team
didn't fall off the face of the Earth during the 2002 track and field
season.</LD>
<LD>   It just seemed that way, especially when one looked for their
names among the top performers in the 800-, 1,600-and 3,200-meter
races.</LD>
<LD>   Rubidoux, which romped to Division II titles in the Southern
Section and state cross-country championships last year, is looking
to do the same this year under its longtime coach, Sam Gee. The
Falcons earned a No. 19 ranking in Harrier magazine's final national
poll.</LD>
<TE>   However, no Rubidoux cross-country runner was listed among the top
100 in the state in any middle-or long-distance running event during
track season.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that was because runners Mobin Ghoury and Jose Lopez
simply didn't perform as well in track as they had in cross-country.</TE>
<TE>   But runners Lino Flores and Antonio Jimenez chose not to compete
for their school because they felt they wouldn't receive the type of
training they were used to from Victor Centeno, the track team's
distance coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt that I wouldn't really be comfortable with the
training," Jimenez said of his decision. "I knew that if I ran track
[for Rubidoux] I wouldn't run that well."</TE>
<TE>   Flores, who is now at San Bernardino Valley College, ran a
noteworthy 4 minutes 16 seconds in the 1,600 last season. And
Jimenez, who finished 12th in the Southern Section Division II
cross-country final last year, clocked 4:19. But those efforts came
while competing unattached in invitationals.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Maimbourg, track and field coach at Rubidoux for the last
seven years, says what happened with Flores and Jimenez was nothing
new.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I've been here, there have been kids who run
cross-country but don't come out for track," he said. "Part of that
is because the cross-country and [distance coach in track] are
different people.</TE>
<TE>   "And part of that is because some runners try to run the
three-mile pace they do in cross-country on the track and end up
getting their butts kicked. The longest race in track is two-miles so
you have to be able to run a faster pace to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Maimbourg, who has more than 30 years of coaching experience at
the high school and collegiate level, said he has no ill feelings
toward Flores and Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez, a senior, doesn't intend to run track for Rubidoux next
year either. But he and his cross-country teammates are excited about
trying to duplicate their section and state cross-country
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel good," Jimenez said. "We're not feeling pressured or
nothing like that.... I feel like we can be better than we were last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running faster than Lino was [at this time last year] and our
second and third runners are going to be pretty strong."</TE>
<TE>   Gee isn't quite so confident.</TE>
<TE>   He says that Jimenez and senior Victor Ortiz, Rubidoux's Nos. 1
and 3 returning runners, are fit. But Ghoury and sophomore Jose
Maganda, the Falcons' Nos. 2 and 4 returnees, are still rounding into
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling nervous because the polls have us ranked so high to
start the season," Gee said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're already talking about us winning the state title again
and about how much depth we have. I kind of liked it better last
year, when people didn't know that much about us."</TE>

<TE>   THE TIMES' RANKINGS</TE>
<TE>   A preseason look at the top 10 boys' cross-country teams in the
Southland:</TE>
<TE>   1. Dana Hills (SS-Division I) - Dolphins are ranked fourth in

first state title since 1988 after placing third in the state meet
last year with a team that included only two seniors.</TE>
<TE>   2. Long Beach Poly (SS-Division I) - Jackrabbits should battle for
fourth state title in six years as they return six of top seven

<TE>   3. Rubidoux (SS-Division II) - Falcons return four of top seven
runners from last year's section and state champions and have
talented transfer in Adam Heredia.</TE>
<TE>   4. Barstow (SS-Division III) - Adam Rodriguez is expected to lead
Aztecs to their second consecutive section and state titles.</TE>
<TE>   5. Canyon Country Canyon (SS-Division I) - The Cowboy duo of Luke
Llamas and Jameson Mora graduated in June, but Ryan Morgan gives
defending state champions another elite runner.</TE>
<TE>   6. Placentia Valencia (SS-Division II) - Juan Robles will lead
Tiger team that placed a surprising second in state championships
after finishing fifth in section finals.</TE>
<TE>   7. Orange (SS-Division II) - Panthers return six of seven runners
from team that finished third in section and eighth in state
championships.</TE>
<TE>   8. Temecula Valley (SS-Division I) - Golden Bears could reach
state championships for first time since 1997 if they can avoid the
injuries that hampered them last year.</TE>
<TE>   9. Loyola (SS-Division I) - Cubs return top three runners from
team that placed seventh in section championships.</TE>
<TE>   10. Murrieta Valley (SS-Division I) - Kellen Acosta will try to
lead Nighthawks to their third state-championship appearance in four
years.</TE>

<LD>One of the perils of future betting was made apparent again earlier
this week. Street Cry, the favorite for the Breeders' Cup Classic
which will be run Oct. 26 at Arlington Park near Chicago, was retired
because of a problem in his right front ankle, so all of those who
bet on him in recent months are out of luck.</LD>
<LD>   Street Cry, the 4-year-old son of Machiavellian who is owned by
Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's Godolphin Racing, was scheduled to make
his next start in the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Sept. 28 at Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   Second behind Left Bank, who has also since been retired after a
near-fatal bout with colic, in the Whitney on Aug. 3 at Saratoga,
Street Cry earned his biggest win in the $6-million Dubai World Cup
this year.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Saeed bin Suroor, Street Cry finishes his career with
five wins, six seconds and a third in 12 starts and earnings of more
than $5.15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Nepenthe is among eight fillies and mares going 1
3/8 miles on turf in the $75,000 Thoroughbred Owners Of California
Handicap at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Vladimir Cerin. The trainer has won with seven of 28
runners.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bruce Jackson. The trainer, who has Excellentcharacter
in today's first and Sheza Gladiator in the eighth, is winless at Del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A place pick all singling Dog Days in the
first, the entry of Dream Day-Speed To Speed in the second, using
Magic Mission and Quick To Please in the third, singling Tejan in the
fourth, using Groom On The Run and the entry of Noble Kinsman-Scotty
Wotty in the fifth, Honest Answer and Red Hot Kitty in the sixth,
Tropical Lady, Nepenthe and L'Emeraude in the seventh and singling
Life Estate in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/74. Money: Previous day/meet

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>Israelis Still Seeking a Moment of Silence</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Mentions have been made by IOC presidents, but
relatives of victims want closure from massacre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Four years after Munich, at the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, the
relatives of the 11 murdered Israelis began a campaign that so far
has proved fruitless--requesting that the IOC honor the memory of the
11 dead at the Games with a moment of silence dedicated solely to the
Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, according to confidential minutes from IOC
executive board meetings obtained by The Times, senior IOC delegates
have made it plain they do not want to risk causing offense to Arab
interests.</LD>
<LD>   Jacques Rogge, the current IOC president, said, "The memory of the
victims of Munich will never be forgotten out of respect for them and
as a message for the future," maintaining that the dead have indeed
been honored--in 1972, just hours after the Israelis were attacked,
and on various other occasions, at the 1996 Atlanta Games and, most
recently, at the Salt Lake Winter Games in a speech Rogge gave that
touched briefly on events 30 years ago. Rogge and other dignitaries
are due to attend a ceremony Friday at the Furstenfeldbruck airport
near Munich, where nine of the 11 Israelis were killed.</LD>
<TE>   The 11 Israelis are also recalled in monuments and plaques at
various sites around the world, including a U.S. National Park
Service memorial honoring David Berger on the front lawn of Mayfield
Jewish Community Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   None of the memorials, however, has been dedicated at the IOC's
instigation. Israel's Olympic committee donated to the Olympic Museum
in Lausanne, Switzerland, a miniature replica of a statue in Tel Aviv
that was dedicated to the 11 who died.</TE>
<TE>   And mentions by Rogge and two of his predecessors--Juan Antonio
Samaranch of Spain and Avery Brundage of the United States--have
offered the relatives little, if any, solace--because, even if well
intended, such gestures are not what they want.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 6, 1972, memorial, for instance, which Brundage presided
over, was scheduled when only two of the 11 had been killed, and it
served as the bridge to resumption of the Games. A 1996 Samaranch
speech during the closing ceremony of the Atlanta Olympics joined a
reference to the Israelis with mention of a woman killed when a bomb
went off in Atlanta's Centennial Park.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge's speech in Salt Lake was given to IOC delegates and invited
guests only, and he paired it with a reference to security at the
Games. On that diplomatically sensitive occasion, he did not use the
words "Israel" or "Israelis," though he has explicitly and
unhesitatingly done so in interviews and on other occasions.</TE>
<TE>   He said that night, "The IOC has devoted particular attention to
the security aspect since the tragic attack in Munich, in 1972, whose
30th anniversary we commemorate with emotion."</TE>
<TE>   It is a measure of the potency of Arab political power within the
IOC that two young Arab royals were made IOC members at the Salt Lake
Games--Sheik Tamin Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani of Qatar and Prince
Nawaf Fahd Abdul Azia of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi prince was born in
1978, the Qatari sheik in 1980. Sheik Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah of
Kuwait, an IOC member since 1992, heads the influential Olympic
Council of Asia; it is widely believed he played a significant
behind-the-scenes role last year in helping secure Rogge's election
as IOC president.</TE>
<TE>   If the IOC were to allow a moment of silence for the Israelis
alone, Ilana Romano asks rhetorically, "What will happen? The Arabs
won't come to the Olympic Games?"</TE>
<TE>   Romano's husband, Yoseph, a weightlifter, was the second of the 11
Israelis to die. "My husband was killed," she said. "He was killed,
and he suffered, and it's not possible to close this story until
someone takes responsibility and there is a minute of silence."</TE>
<TE>   Both Romano and Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli fencing coach
Andre Spitzer, took the lead over the years in pursuing the reports
they suspected that the Germans had produced in the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, they were stonewalled. Then, in 1992, after Spitzer
had appeared on German TV, she received an anonymous package
containing bits of German investigations into the kidnappings and
murders--enough for her to bluff her way through a phone call with
the German Foreign Ministry by quoting, for instance, from portions
of a January 1973 ballistics report.</TE>
<TE>   That call set in motion the release, in August 1992, of the
documents--more than 3,800 files of information, including reams of
testimony and 900 pathology pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of the documents led to a lawsuit filed in a
Bavarian court, the relatives of the 11 slain Israelis claiming
negligence by the German authorities. After many years of legal
sparring, primarily over whether the suit ought to be barred by a
statute of limitations, the two sides reached an out-of-court
settlement in April 2001, according to Pinchas Zeltzer, the Israeli
attorney who has long handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   The families are still waiting for the money, a total of about $3
million. A spokeswoman for the German interior ministry said in a
statement Wednesday that "the last details of the distribution are
presently being dealt with" and "the transfer of the amount should be
processed during this week."</TE>
<TE>   Zeltzer said, "As far as I understand, the people in Berlin,"
meaning federal authorities, "say, 'We don't have any problem, we can
pay the money.' The people in Munich," local or state authorities,
"are asking for some further formalities. I don't understand and I
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer says she's inclined to reject her share of the settlement:
"What, they're going to give me the money and I'm going to buy a
dress?"</TE>

<KH>KING-DUCK NOTES</KH>
<HD>Karalahti Would Put Alcohol First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings were chilled this week by comments out of Finland from
former King defenseman Jere Karalahti that, in essence, he would
rather quit the NHL than have to give up drinking.</LD>
<LD>   Karalahti, traded in March from the Kings to the Nashville
Predators, was suspended by the NHL for six months without pay last
month for a third violation of the league's substance-abuse policy.</LD>
<LD>   Each violation involved alcohol, sources said, and the first two
occurred while Karalahti played for the Kings. Karalahti, who
struggled with drug problems before joining the NHL, played 134 games
in three seasons with the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're worried about him," King Coach Andy Murray said
Wednesday. "It wasn't a good thing to read, that's for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Karalahti, 27, told Finland's TV4 that if he continued playing in
the NHL, "I would have to be a teetotaler."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really believe I can do that," he told the Ilta-Sanomat
tabloid in a separate interview, "and I don't even have the will to
try."</TE>
<TE>   Karalahti, whose drug problems included heroin use, said his
current troubles concern only alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "If I know myself at all, I know that zero tolerance with alcohol
won't work," he said in the television interview.</TE>
<TE>   He told the tabloid: "I'm not ready to go through a treatment
program. There are other leagues in which to play in this world."</TE>
<TE>   One option, he said, would be to have his NHL contract terminated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little disappointed," said King General Manager Dave
Taylor, who helped clear the way for Karalahti to play for the Kings
after the defenseman's 1997 conviction in Helsinki on drug offenses.
"I thought he was certainly going in the right direction. I view it
as a privilege to play in the NHL."</TE>
<TE>   Predator General Manager David Poile told the Nashville Tennessean
that it's unlikely Karalahti will play for the Predators this season
when the suspension ends.</TE>
<TE>   Karalahti was due to be paid $800,000 this season in the last year
of his contract. The suspension is also recognized by the top league
in Finland. If cleared to play in his native Finland after the
suspension, he probably would make less than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks' future, immediate and long-term, will be on
display beginning today, when the team begins its first rookie camp
at Disney Ice in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The camp, which runs through Monday, will also begin the
competition for the backup goalie spot behind Jean-Sebastien Giguere.
Among the 26 players in camp will be Ilja Bryzgalov, J.F. Damphousse
and Martin Gerber, the three other goalies in the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the Ducks' last five No. 1 draft picks will take part:
Joffrey Lupul (2002), Stanislav Chistov (2001), Alexei Smirnov (2001)
and Mikael Holmqvist (1997). Lupul will not skate because of a
hairline fracture in one of his vertebrae.</TE>
<TE>   The workouts are open to the public. Training camp begins Sept.
12.</TE>

<LD>Quarter horse fans will have something special waiting for them when
another week of racing kicks off tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Because no one was able to select all of the winners in Sunday's
pick six, there is a season high carryover of $50,612 and the pool
should increase considerably this evening.</LD>
<LD>   The pick six begins with the third race and all of the contests in
the sequence are for quarter horses. Bettors looking to take
advantage of a hot rider should pay special attention to Sharin The
Cash in the third, a 350-yard dash for 2-year-old maidens entered for
a $16,000 claiming price.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Connie Hall, the Dash Thru Traffic filly will be ridden
by Carlos Bautista. Sharin The Cash was beaten by a nose the last
time she faced maidens and this will be her first claimer.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one allowance race in the pick six. A half-dozen
3-year-old fillies will get together in the seventh at 350 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lucks Flying High. 2. Naskra's Girl. 3. Sharin The
Cash. 4. BW Double Trouble. 5. Murr Key Blurr. 6. Firm Investment. 7.
Fly So Fast. 8. Lord Triagain.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Lucks Flying High and Makin Memories in the first,
Naskra's Girl, Double Gallant and Blue Eyes in the second, single
Sharin The Cash in the third and BW Double Trouble, Jordans Streaker
and Aegeans Effort in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Manhood drops a notch in the fifth for a
winning barn (Adan Farias) and gets a jockey switch to Joe Badilla
Jr. Think Mile steps up in class in the eighth as he makes his first
start since winning Feb. 24.</TE>

<LD>   Nine Olympic Hostages Die in Shootout</LD>
<TE>   In a blaze of gunfire and explosions at a military airport west of
Munich, nine Israeli hostages, all members of the country's
delegation to the Olympics, five Palestinian terrorists and a West
German policeman died. The bloodbath came after West German police
opened fire on the Arabs as they were in the process of transferring
the hostages from helicopters to a waiting transport plane. Two other
members of the Israeli team were killed earlier in the day inside
their quarters at the athletes' village. The tragedy caused the first
suspension in the history of the Modern Olympics and cast in doubt
the final days of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz Hastens Trip Home After Killings</TE>
<TE>   Swimmer Mark Spitz, who a day before had won the seventh of his
gold medals, left Munich within hours of learning of the terrorist
attack. He flew to London and stayed overnight before continuing his
trip home to California. Spitz, who is Jewish, said his trip was
premature, but "I had not planned to stay up to the end of the
Games."</TE>
<TE>   'Great White Hope' Bobick TKO Victim</TE>
<TE>   Almost simultaneous with the announcement that the Games had been
suspended, Duane Bobick, a heavyweight from Bowlus, Minn., took a
savage beating from Cuban Teofilo Stevenson in a quarterfinal bout.
The fight was stopped in the third round. Bobick had won 62
consecutive fights.</TE>

<TE>   QUOTE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We Shall Overcome.''</TE>
<TE>   --Song sung by athletes in the Olympic village while waiting for a
conclusion to the hostage crisis</TE>
<TE>   POSTSCRIPT</TE>
<TE>   It came as no surprise that Avery Brundage's 36 years as an IOC
member, the last 20 as its most influential president since Pierre de
Coubertin, ended in controversy. In his 1972 book published just
before the Munich Games, "All That Glitters Is Not Gold," author
William Oscar Johnson wrote, "Over the years, Avery Brundage has made
hundreds of speeches and uttered millions of words, always in the
manner of a man who cares not a whit where the chips may fall."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps coincidentally, Brundage, a self-made millionaire through
investments in the Depression-era stock market and, later,
construction in Chicago, caused the most irritation on issues
involving the 20th century's two Summer Olympics in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, he triumphed
in a raging national debate, arguing that the United States should
participate in the Berlin Summer Games despite increasing evidence of
the menace threatened by Hitler's Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   He went on a fact-finding visit to Germany in 1934, eliciting a
promise--later broken--by government officials that Germany's Jewish
athletes would be treated equally in efforts to qualify for the
Olympic team. He charged that "certain Jews must now understand that
they cannot use these Games as a weapon in their boycott against the
Nazis."</TE>
<TE>   Olympic historian and filmmaker Bud Greenspan says Brundage, a
member of the isolationist America First Committee until the United
States' entry into World War II, was anti-Semitic. It is not a unique
opinion. Another view presented by historians is that Brundage, like
his mentor, De Coubertin, was so committed to the Olympic Games that
he would abide by no intrusion of politics, no matter how odious
those politics might be.</TE>
<TE>   Author John Hoberman, in his 1986 book, "The Olympic Crisis,"
referred to Brundage's world view as "amoral universalism."</TE>
<TE>   That is consistent with his actions in 1972, when Brundage, 84,
presided over his final Olympics. He suffered a rare loss in the days
before the opening ceremony when the African nation of Rhodesia, now
Zimbabwe, was ousted from the Games because of its policy of racial
apartheid. Other African nations had threatened to boycott if
Rhodesia was allowed to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Then, even after 11 members of the Israeli team were killed,
Brundage decided against canceling the rest of the Olympics, vowing
that the Games must go on. Reaction from around the world was mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have only the strength of a great ideal," he said during a
memorial service the next day. "I am sure the public will agree that
we cannot allow a handful of terrorists to destroy this nucleus of
international cooperation and goodwill we have in the Olympic
movement."</TE>
<TE>   Many, indeed, did agree.</TE>
<TE>   But Brundage again exhibited his misplaced priorities during his
speech when he compared the Palestinian terrorist invasion of the
athletes' village to the campaign to expel Rhodesia from the Games,
claiming that the Olympics had suffered from "two savage attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Brundage later apologized, but U.S. marathoner Frank Shorter
called him a "pompous ass."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. basketball player Tom McMillen later wrote in his book, "Out
of Bounds," that Brundage had tried to "convert the memorial service
into a pep rally."</TE>
<TE>   As Brundage departed from the Olympic stage after the Munich
Games, he stood virtually alone against professionalism and
commercialism. He married into German royalty a year later and died,
in Germany, in 1975 at age 87.</TE>
<TE>   "One can admire the strength of his stance more than the substance
of his views," Johnson wrote.</TE>

<LD>The late Jim Murray was in the athletes' village on Sept. 5, 1972.
This was his column for The Times.</LD>
<LD>   MUNICH--I stood on a rooftop balcony on the Connollystrasse in the
Olympic village Tuesday and witnessed an Olympic event Baron de
Coubertin never dreamed of and the purpose of which is as arcane to
me as the discus, the team foil, the hammer, individual epee, or
Greco-Roman wrestling.</LD>
<LD>   An Arab rifle team, arriving late, scorned the small bore rifle,
three positions, the free pistol (silhouette) and introduced a new
event to the Olympic program--murder.</LD>
<TE>   Dead were Moshe Weinberg, Yossi Romano, both 33, and, maybe, the
Olympic Games, age 30 centuries.</TE>
<TE>   There was great concern the Olympic Games were getting too costly
and they are. When they start costing lives, there's a new name for
them--and it's not "games."</TE>
<TE>   They became a forum for political protest in 1968 and now they've
become a forum for political assassination. Maybe they'll bomb the
next one.</TE>

turned this whole billion-mark festival into a Middle East incident.
They have hijacked the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived at the village at 9:30. Most of the non-German-speaking
people still had no inkling that the Olympic Games were in the hands
of an unofficial, non-sanctioned committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans, who had not halted eight armed, homicidal
uncredentialed terrorists, now proceeded to solve the problem by
barring journalists armed with dangerous pencils.</TE>
<TE>   But the Germans are undone by their own thoroughness in this
Olympics. Obviously under instructions not to betray any
officiousness reminiscent of you-know-who and his brown-shirted
you-know-whats, they have dressed their cops in powder blue suits
with white caps as if they were on their way to punting in the park
with their picnic baskets. Underneath the pansy costumes were guys
who were just as tough and muscular as the rubber truncheon crowd of
1936, but the impossibility of 250 guards sealing off 10,000 people
is apparent. The Germans, as usual, had trouble with their
occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Olympic village, the athletes treated the whole event
as just another heat in the high jump. Bicyclists bicycled. Runners
ran intervals. Occasionally, a crowd would wander out to the
checkpoint on the Connollystrasse or the main forecourt of the
Olympic village, where now were parked armored cars, tanks, fire
wagons, and what seemed like 2,000 guys with walkie-talkies. The
chief of police of Munich was in his command post in an olive green
van crackling with telephones.</TE>
<TE>   But the American sprinters played hard rock music and played cards
noisily by the main gate, the milk bars did a lively business,
shotputters compared pushes and a huge crowd filled the television
center to cheer lustily as the Cuban, Teofilo Stevenson, beat the
American, Duane Bobick.</TE>
<TE>   To most, the affair in Building 31 seemed like a minor affair,
like a divot in the long jump runway. It was something that can't be
decided with a pole, a shoe, a spear, a paddle or a cross-bar, so how
the hell important can it be? If they make it a sanctioned
quadrennial event, the athletes and coaches might explore it. But the
rank-and-file track-and-field man has never had much interest in
nonwinning times in the pistol shoot.</TE>
<TE>   The decathloner, Bruce Jenner, busy getting a rubdown for an event
that may not now take place, looked in annoyance at the Arab lookout
silhouetted on his balcony vigil and said, "It's all a bunch of ...
Why do we have to cancel a day?</TE>
<TE>   "We can walk around that building on the way to the track, can't
we? We don't have to go through it."</TE>
<TE>   The point is, the Olympics may find the event in Building 31 one
they can't walk around. Now that there is blood on the Olympic symbol
and terrorism drew crowds to the Olympic Park the 1,500-meter heats
couldn't dream of, they may have to award iron crosses instead of
gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   And the Olympic motto may have a fourth to go along with "citius,"
"altius," "fortius." It will now be "higher, faster, stronger." And
"slaughter."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Renteria got the St. Louis Cardinals back in the game. Scott
Rolen put them ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Renteria hit a grand slam and Rolen had the first pinch-hit homer
of his career, and the Cardinals rallied from a five-run deficit to
defeat the Cincinnati Reds, 10-5, Wednesday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Renteria set a career high with five runs batted in, Albert Pujols
got a career-best four hits, and Tino Martinez homered for the
National League Central leaders, who have staged 36 come-from-behind
victories this season.</LD>
<TE>   "We never put our heads down," Renteria said. "We know we have a
good team and we have a good bullpen. So if we score some runs, we've
got time to come back. We knew we had to work hard every at-bat.
That's the way we do it."</TE>
<TE>   Jason LaRue hit a grand slam for the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the sixth, Rolen came up to hit for J.D. Drew
against left-handed reliever Bruce Chen (2-5). Rolen hit the first
pitch off the left-field foul screen for a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of those moves where everybody in the ballpark knew
what I was going to do," La Russa said. "He was trying to get ahead
of Scott and Scott was ready to swing."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Pittsburgh 0--Damian Moss pitched seven scoreless
innings and Marcus Giles homered twice in front of 19,525, the
second-smallest crowd at Atlanta's Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (10-5) won his third consecutive start and became the fourth
Brave starter to reach double figures in victories, joining Tom
Glavine, Kevin Millwood and Greg Maddux.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves had gone 16 innings without scoring against the Pirates
until scoring in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   New York 11, Florida 3--Rey Ordonez slapped an intended pitchout
for a go-ahead single and Mike Piazza homered at New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets won consecutive games at Shea Stadium for the first time
since July 22-23.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Philadelphia 5--Andres Galarraga doubled twice and had
four RBIs at Montreal, and the Expos overcame Phillie starter Vicente
Padilla's three-run double.</TE>
<TE>   Galarraga hit a two-run double against Padilla (14-9) and the
Expos scored four runs in the fifth to take a 5-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Houston 1--Brett Tomko (9-8) came within two out of
his first shutout in 120 career starts, giving up six hits at San
Diego for his third complete game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Only one Astro runner made it as far as third base before Jeff
Bagwell's 26th homer in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Milwaukee 0--Carlos Zambrano pitched eight shutout
innings at Chicago to end his five-game losing streak, and Moises
Alou had four hits for the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Zambrano (3-6), who retired 13 of the first 15 batters, struck out
six and walked four in his longest career outing.</TE>

<HD>Giants Have No Answer for Neagle</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander gives up three hits and one run in
seven innings to help Rockies win, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Denny Neagle combined with two relievers on a four-hitter and Todd
Helton singled twice and scored as the struggling Colorado Rockies
defeated the San Francisco Giants, 2-1, on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants, who had won eight of nine, remained 2 1/2 games behind
the Dodgers in the National League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado won for only the second time in 12 games. The Rockies
were swept by the Giants in four games last week at Coors Field.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Walker drove in the go-ahead run in the sixth inning. Juan
Pierre reached on a bunt single with one out, stole second and went
to third on a groundout. Walker followed with his hit to make it 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Zeile also had two hits for the Rockies, who played the
Giants for the final time this season. San Francisco won 11 of 19.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his 36th save in 40
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds went one for four as Colorado held him in check for
the second consecutive game. Bonds, who hit five home runs in three
games last week at Colorado, flied out to left twice.</TE>
<TE>   Neagle (8-9) gave up three hits and one run in seven innings for
another solid outing. The left-hander has given up only 10 earned
runs in his last seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Giant starter Livan Hernandez (9-15) retired 11 of the first 12
batters before giving up a leadoff single to Helton in the fifth.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Andy Roddick is trying to take the night. But Pete Sampras owns it.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick is 20 and wants to be the future of American tennis.
Sampras is 31 and doesn't think he's ready to be America's tennis
past.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick climbs up on a box and high-fives the front-row fans after
he hits a winning shot. In the second set. Of a four-set match. He
cups his hand to his ear and screams so loud that the veins in his
face are bulging, "I can't ... hear you!" and the crowd bellows its
response.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras piles up sopping shirts and leaves wet spots on the court
when he falls. That's not rain, people, it's sweat flying from his
hair as he shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   There is an occasional fist pump and, after these ever-more
surprising wins, a nod of appreciation to the crowds who now stand in
his support, trying to push Sampras forward with their energy.</TE>
<TE>   It is real emotion that Sampras offers and elicits. And tonight,
when Sampras plays Roddick in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open,
there is no question who will be the favorite. Sampras needs the
help, he admits it. "The crowds have been great and it makes a
difference," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The drama of Sampras' quest for a 14th Grand Slam title is not
rehearsed, not an affectation.</TE>
<TE>   Late in his career, after being criticized for so long as
emotionless and altogether too perfect a tennis player, Sampras has
been embraced for his flaws and his willingness to fail.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Roddick has galloped onto the Open show courts with his
hair spiked up with gel and a foot-stomping temper tantrum after
nearly every close call.</TE>
<TE>   It is as if Roddick has watched too much blast-from-the-past
tennis tape over the rain-delayed weekend, when every Jimmy Connors
U.S. Open highlight was rebroadcast.</TE>
<TE>   There's Jimmy making believe he's shooting pistols into the air.
There's Jimmy calling a chair umpire an "abortion." There's Jimmy
pointing his fingers at the crowd and yelling "You, you, you, you,"
at the end of every match.</TE>
<TE>   Connors may have been the consummate tennis actor, a man who
carefully groomed his act by trial and error, but he earned the right
to whip a crowd into a frenzy. Even if his frenzy-inciting antics
were clearly scripted, even if Connors knew that no chair umpire
would dare punish him for screaming obscenely, Connors was still a
champion and deserving of adulation when he was 39 and an Open
semifinalist.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick is overdoing it with the antics too, but without the
Connors accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   After a dramatic rally Tuesday night with Juan Ignacio Chela, one
in which Roddick seemed out of the point on three occasions and which
he saved with running, lunging punches of the ball and scrambles to
swat a drop shot, he won the unlikely point. Then Roddick nearly
leaped into the stands to feel the love.</TE>
<TE>   This would not have been so extraordinary had Roddick not already
had to call for the trainer to massage his back. And then to
manipulate his foot.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick was even asked if he had planned his foray into the
public. "I planned to hit a between-the-leg shot, run down a ball,
run into the crowd. That was all in the works from the beginning,"
Roddick said. Then he smiled. It was a Hollywood smile, half a smirk,
half a grin and all showman.</TE>
<TE>   And it has become common for Roddick to bring trainers onto the
court at points when he is behind. Frustrated opponents are
whispering that Roddick manipulates alleged injuries into timeouts to
discombobulate the other guy.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras has never needed the adulation of the public or such
Machiavellian machinations. Sampras plays. He wins. Or he loses. He
will not be bullied by age or time or even his own diminishing
skills.</TE>
<TE>   He will not decree that tonight's match will crown a new American
best. "Accumulation of years will do that," Sampras says. "We know
Andy is the future."</TE>
<TE>   And soon Sampras will be the past. A year ago, on Wednesday night,
the final Wednesday of the Open, Sampras and Andre Agassi played a
classic match, a match filled with drama and excruciating emotions
and more well-played points of all kinds, than we've seen in all the
other Grand Slam matches since. Sampras won in four tiebreak sets
even though Agassi had the better summer.</TE>
<TE>   Now another big night. "I love the night," Roddick says. Roddick
loves the noise, the crazier fans, the big television audience, the
very theater of tennis under a moon. Sampras loves the night too.
Because the weather is cooler, because his legs don't get heavy so
fast, because the soaking wet shirts don't pile up quite so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras and Roddick have played twice. Roddick has won twice.
Brash has beaten class twice. But never here, never at a Slam, never
when the crowd will be so much against him and so much for the real
theater created by a real champion.</TE>
<TE>   If Roddick wins, he can take the night from Sampras and earn real
respect. He won't have to drive the crowd to frenzied approval. They
will come along with him.</TE>

<HD>Radovich Gives His Game a Lift</HD>
<DH>High schools: Lineman at Mission Viejo went from skinny
freshman to coveted senior through hard work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the classic tale of boy meets weight room. Drew Radovich arrived
at Mission Viejo High three years ago as an awkward, wiry freshman,
fretting every time he looked in the mirror.</LD>
<LD>   "I had this body with no purpose," he said. Today, he is one of
the highest-prized offensive linemen in the country, with eight
Pacific 10 Conference teams among those offering scholarships.
Radovich credits his maturation to an extensive weight-training
program, part of the motivation provided by his veteran line coach.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, Radovich's 6-foot-4 1/2, 270-pound frame is his
most obvious asset, but his quick feet and flawless technique are
what separate him from other top linemen.</LD>
<TE>   "People have asked me how good Drew is compared to some of the
good ones I've coached," Mission Viejo line coach Marty Spalding
said. "I tell them he's as good as anybody. He's very athletic and
fast enough with his feet that he can get off the line quicker than
anyone I have seen."</TE>
<TE>   That quickness helps give Radovich the leverage needed to knock
defenders off balance and move them out of the hole. "You'll give up
60 pounds to a player and still win the battle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Radovich opened running lanes the last two seasons for fellow
All-Southern Section players Robbie Dubois and Ryan Powdrell, who
graduated in June.</TE>
<TE>   Radovich, who didn't play tackle football until his freshman year,
compared his early blocking technique to that of a bowling ball
barreling down a lane.</TE>
<TE>   "I just went out and hit people," he said. "I didn't know who to
block and didn't know the concepts. Sometimes it worked and sometimes
it didn't."</TE>
<TE>   After his uncertain debut, Radovich discovered the rewards of
weight training, which not only boosted his strength and increased
his weight by about 100 pounds during the last three years, but
improved his balance and quickness.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I hit the weight room, everything began to change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Radovich also found a trusting mentor in Spalding, who has coached
alongside the Diablos' head coach, Bob Johnson, during four Southern
Section championship seasons at Mission Viejo and Lake Forest El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "[Spalding] has this presence that when I'm around him, I want to
impress him," Radovich said. "The main thing that made me so good is
his coaching ability. I'm so blessed to be coached by him. I don't
know how my college coaches will be, but I think he'll always be my
main inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Radovich is the physical leader of an offensive line that's
expected to be one of the best in Southern California. The only area
in which Spalding would like to see his protege improve is
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot have a good football team that is not led by seniors,"
Spalding said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it was easy for Radovich and others to work quietly in
the shadows of talented seniors who led the Diablos to an undefeated
season and a Southern Section Division II title. Now that they've
graduated, Radovich understands that he needs to be more vocal.</TE>
<TE>   Radovich has already helped to inspire at least one teammate.
Three weeks ago, he and fellow lineman Nate Wimber were descending
steps leading to the beach when Wimber stepped on hot coals.</TE>
<TE>   Wimber burned portions of his feet, but Radovich talked him into
attending a voluntary conditioning program three days later,
insisting it was the perfect opportunity to make a lasting impression
on the other players. "That showed good leadership on both our
parts," he said. "People were listening."</TE>
<TE>   Wimber said he has been impressed with Radovich's leadership
skills since preseason practices began last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He has become pretty vocal," Wimber said. "He was kind of quiet
last season, but this year he has kind of opened up."</TE>
<TE>   Radovich proved his toughness last season in the Division II
championship game against Chino, playing with a broken hand, suffered
the week before against Alta Loma.</TE>
<TE>   While attending to the hand, doctors took a look at Radovich's
skeletal crystal ball, the space between growth plates that can help
to predict a person's eventual height. Radovich said his doctor
thought he would grow another two to three inches.</TE>
<TE>   That's more good news for the dozen or so schools that have
already offered scholarships, as well as those on the verge of doing
so.</TE>
<TE>   Radovich said he has no timetable for his college decision. He's
just looking forward to his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to stay healthy and have fun," he said.
"Everything else will take care of itself."</TE>

<LD>One of our editors forwarded the following e-mail Wednesday:</LD>
<LD>   "In his Sept. 4 column, Bill Plaschke asks re the Augusta National
stance on not admitting female golfers as members: 'Oh, but because
this is about gender and not race it's different, right?'</LD>
<LD>   "I wonder this same thing every time T.J. Simers writes
disparagingly about female athletes and women's sports in his column.
If Simers were commenting negatively, say, on Jewish or Latino
athletes, I believe the Los Angeles Times would face severe criticism
for publishing such prejudiced viewpoints. But for some reason The
Times thinks women are fair game.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Plaschke, that stink you smell is not just coming from
Augusta, it's emanating from your own sports section's Page 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Best regards, Sarah Kreuzkamp, Senior Associate,
Thurlow/Associates"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS surprised the subject line to Kreuzkamp's e-mail wasn't:
"Keeping Him in His Place."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, I do not always write disparagingly about female
athletes and women's sports, because I'm usually busy writing
disparagingly about women e-mailers, my old male boss and a Grocery
Store Bagger who thinks of himself as a stud.</TE>
<TE>   It's true, I do try to go to a Spark game every two years or so to
confirm my prejudiced viewpoint that the Sparks are uptight and
deadly dull, and I'm happy to report this year's visit did nothing to
alter that prejudiced viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   But I also have prejudiced viewpoints about USC, the Dodgers,
Angels and anyone on skates, the only difference being I've grown to
love them all.</TE>
<TE>   Now I don't want to disagree with Kreuzkamp, but I'm pretty sure
I've commented negatively on Jewish and Latino athletes, because I'm
pretty sure I've commented negatively on just about every athlete in
town at one time or another, including the female athletes.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't very well leave them out, because you know the stink
they'd make if I treated them any differently than the men.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I'd like to think Kreuzkamp and I could kiss and make up, now
that she understands she's way off base, but I'm afraid I'm flirting
with disaster here because I'm about to offer my prejudiced viewpoint
in regard to this Masters' controversy.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest I'm outraged. Until this whole thing became public, I
had no idea women were allowed to play golf at Augusta National, as
if we really need another golf course promoting slow play. (Given the
conniption fit Kreuzkamp is probably throwing right now, I'd offer
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but I have the feeling we won't be
traveling in the same circles any time soon.)</TE>
<TE>   Now if all this fuss was about some rich woman from Georgia being
rejected as a member of Augusta National, I'd probably say something
like "that's outrageous," and then go back to waiting for the wife to
serve dinner.</TE>
<TE>   If it was my daughter trying to gain admittance to Augusta
National, I'd probably be so thrilled she was rich I wouldn't care
whether she got in.</TE>
<TE>   I know it's terrible when anyone is excluded from anything just
because they're not like everyone else. Riviera, Bel Air and the L.A.
Country Club have made it very clear I'm poor and not rich like them,
so I won't be accepted as one of them.</TE>
<TE>   The women are going to argue that gender exclusion is no different
from race exclusion, but we already know there are differences, and I
have the daughters' phone bills to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, when Martha Burk, the chairman of the National
Council of Women's Organizations, walks past a men's room, she's
probably outraged.</TE>
<TE>   But I guess that's the point of having private clubs and shopping
malls so the sexes can go their separate ways at times, and get away
from each other. From everything I've heard about Hootie Johnson,
though, I'd rather go shopping with Kreuzkamp. Of course, I've got no
shot of being accepted, but you don't hear me bellyaching.</TE>
<TE>   This whole debate is crazy anyway. You have a woman who doesn't
care if she plays golf at Augusta fighting for a woman to be a
member, while an old guy lost in time holds the key to the clumsy
chastity belt thrown around the Masters. They don't offer much middle
ground.</TE>
<TE>   None of it has much to do with the golf tournament they play there
once a year, although commercials have now been canceled and pressure
has been put on CBS to broadcast something different, I presume like
the Battle of the Sexes.</TE>
<TE>   I understand Burk is only doing her job, and Hootie could have
solved the whole thing by being politically correct and lying to her,
but these aren't the grounds for such a crusade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I REALIZE, however, that my colleague Bill Plaschke, Times
columnist who has covered the last two Masters, vehemently disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday he wrote passionately: "The impetus for change is with
us. CBS should stop televising [the Masters]. Golf fans should stop
watching it. Golfers should stop playing it," and knowing how he
feels now, I'm sure he won't be going to next year's tournament even
though he's on the schedule to do so.</TE>
<TE>   My suggestion, of course, would be to send columnist Diane Pucin
in his place, because despite what Kreuzkamp might think, I like to
promote women when I get the chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Gale McKim:</TE>
<TE>   "I had to check the author's name after reading [about the old
softball players]. Did you turn into Plaschke for a day? No venom and
only a few cheap shots? Will you soon be closing your columns with
'Have a Nice Day?' "</TE>
<TE>   Get lost.</TE>

<HD>Capriati Goes Home, Agassi Stays a While</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: Third-seeded woman loses to Mauresmo,
sixth-seeded man outlasts Mirnyi.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Her powerful groundstrokes and uncanny ability to hit her way out of
trouble did not suddenly vanish into thin air.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Jennifer Capriati's game has not fundamentally changed
since winning her last tournament, the Australian Open, in January.
Other players, however, have transformed themselves.</LD>
<LD>   And therein lies Capriati's problem. She can't out-hit Venus and
Serena Williams in 2002, not the way she did against Martina Hingis,
Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport last year.</LD>
<TE>   You can add Amelie Mauresmo to her list of problems. The
10th-seeded Mauresmo of France beat No. 3 Capriati, 4-6, 7-6 (5),
6-3, in a 2-hour, 18-minute quarterfinal at the U.S. Open on
Wednesday. Capriati served for the match at 6-5 in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   For Mauresmo, it was her third consecutive victory against
Capriati this year, and two have been in Grand Slam events, the Open
and the Wimbledon quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   She will play two-time defending champion and No. 2 Venus Williams
in the semifinals Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati insisted that some of the pressure is self-imposed now
that she is expected to be around in the later rounds, a contrast to
the early days of her comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this has kind of been a new pressure that I've felt, coming
off being No. 1 and having a great run," she said. "So, I mean, human
beings are the only ones that go over and over and do the same
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, such as always rushing, whether it's between points or
looking ahead to the next round. Mauresmo sensed Capriati's
impatience and was savvy in slowing play between points and changing
the pace during their rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "She likes to play with a lot of pace and the same height,"
Mauresmo said. "When you slice a little bit and you put some topspin,
maybe she's not used to that because on the tour not so many players
play like this. I know what she doesn't like too much. I try to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Under hot, humid conditions, the first men's semifinal was set
when defending champion and No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia
defeated Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco, 6-1, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-2, in the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt will play No. 6 Andre Agassi, who had an unexpectedly
difficult test against Max Mirnyi of Belarus, winning, 6-7 (5), 6-3,
7-5, 6-3. They played almost six weeks ago at UCLA, and Agassi had
little trouble, dropping just six games against him in the
semifinals. Here, Agassi survived Mirnyi's tough serve-and-volley
game, converting six-of-17 break points. Mirnyi, who reached his
first Grand Slam quarterfinal, had 19 aces and double faulted seven
times.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, he's a tough player, and I had to play well tonight,"
said Agassi, who has lost only one set in five matches. "In Los
Angeles once I started seeing the ball well, he pressured a little
bit and double faulted a few times. Tonight, I felt like he served
bigger and volleyed very soundly, dug out some incredible volleys."</TE>
<TE>   The first time Agassi played Hewitt was in 1998 at Adelaide when
the Australian was 16 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember he was wearing a safety pin in his shorts to hold them
up," Agassi said, joking. "I'm not kidding, I actually think it was
one on each side. I didn't know what he looked like. I didn't believe
that that was my opponent. He seemed like he had a couple of strings
hanging in his shoes. He was just very young, went out there and
ended up playing a great match."</TE>
<TE>   Their marathon contest followed the final women's quarterfinal
between Venus Williams and two-time champion Seles. There was
something of a bittersweet quality to the match. The second-seeded
Williams lost just one point on her serve in the first set, defeating
No. 6 Seles, 6-2, 6-3, in 57 minutes. Seles left Arthur Ashe Stadium
with a small wave, leaving spectators wondering whether she would
return in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 28-year-old Seles, who has not reached a Grand Slam
final since the 1998 French Open, has been fielding retirement
questions for the last couple of years, speculation seemed to hit a
new level in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "She was better than I was in every department tonight," said
Seles, who had just one break-point opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the match tells it all. She served too well. I really
couldn't read it at all."</TE>
<TE>   Williams sounded as though she was fighting a cold, as well as her
irritation over the fourth-round struggle against Chanda Rubin on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to get away from my last match," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to watch any tennis or think about any other player
except for me. I had leads and opportunities and I don't like to play
like this, especially at a Grand Slam, especially in the later rounds
and especially against a good player.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a little bit unfortunate that I had to get so
close to being out of the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-seeded Bob and Mike Bryan had one of their biggest wins in
men's doubles, defeating No. 1 Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel
Nestor of Canada, 6-3, 7-6 (5), in the quarterfinals. Knowles and
Nestor, champions at the Australian and French Opens this year, beat
the Bryans in three sets at Wimbledon in the semifinals.</TE>

<HD>He's No Saint</HD>
<DH>Lineman Kyle Turley's rough style of play has fans loving
him, and opponents hating him</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The young Saint ripped the helmet off a New York Jet defensive back
and flung it across the field.</LD>
<LD>   The old sinner once tried that on two Miami Dolphin linebackers at
the same time, latching onto each of their facemasks and trying to
unscrew their heads. It didn't work, so he threw his helmet in
frustration.</LD>
<LD>   The young Saint has the utmost respect for the old sinner: "Conrad
Dobler made the Pro Bowl every year, and he played dirty, nasty."</LD>
<TE>   The old sinner is really starting to like the young Saint: "Kyle
Turley plays the game the way it's supposed to be played."</TE>
<TE>   The young Saint figures he might be the most hated player in the
NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The old sinner never had a doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Dobler, 51, who played guard for the St. Louis Cardinals, Saints
and Bills from 1972 through '81, is widely considered the dirtiest
player in NFL history. He punched, kicked, grabbed, twisted, and once
used his mouth for something far more sinister than talking junk--he
sank his teeth into the hand of a Minnesota Viking defender.</TE>
<TE>   "I did bite his finger, but he was trying to gouge my eyes out,"
he said. "I just grabbed his hand and chomped down. But the legend
has grown through the years. It's gone from a finger to a leg to a
kneecap to an arm to a nose. Like I bit the guy's nose off! One would
think I was related to Jeffrey Dahmer."</TE>
<TE>   At least Dobler didn't wind up on a psychiatrist's couch the way
Turley did last season after he gave Damien Robinson's helmet the
heave-ho. Turley, a standout right tackle for the Saints, was fined
$25,000 by the team and required to attend anger-management classes,
a rich irony for a man paid millions to get Brahma-bull angry every
Sunday. He reasons he was only protecting his quarterback, Aaron
Brooks, whose head was getting the twist-off treatment under the pile
by Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "People down here realize what I did was honorable," said Turley,
26, who has switched to left tackle this season. "Whereas in the
politically correct areas, the major cities of the country, they
viewed me as a menace. Whereas the true Americans, the grass-roots
people of this great country, were like, 'This guy did an honorable
thing here: he stood up for his teammate.' "</TE>
<TE>   The heat Turley took was nothing compared to the praise he got
from Saint fans, who instantly adopted the 6-foot-5, 300-pounder as
their favorite player, if they hadn't done so already. They love his
WWE look--flowing blond hair, wall-to-wall tattoos--and love the fact
he skipped the Pro Bowl so he could appear as a celebrity guest in
the Endymion Parade, a Mardi Gras tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Turley, who was to replace injured Ram tackle Orlando Pace in
Hawaii, instead rode through the French Quarter tossing not beads,
but miniature football helmets to the crowd. His float was adored
with American flags and Osama bin Laden's head on a stick. What could
be better?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't make first-team NFL, but I made first-team Endymion," he
said. "It was a huge honor."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Ku, who works at Sports Avenue, a New Orleans store that
sells official Saint gear, said he sells out of Turley jerseys
several times a season--Turley and Brooks are the biggest
sellers--and gets Turley orders from all over, including the
Netherlands and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "It went crazy after that Jets game," said Ku, who keeps home,
away and alternate (gold) Turley jerseys in stock, including the $250
authentic versions. Some of his customers are "Turley's Girlies,"
possibly the only groupies for an offensive lineman in NFL history</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 10,000 showed up in Thibodaux, La., to watch the
Saints' annual Black-and-Gold scrimmage last month, and about half
those people stuck around to collect autographs afterward. By far,
Turley was the biggest draw; fans were dangling over the railings
from break-neck heights just to get a glimpse of him up close.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, down here football is taken very seriously," Turley
said. "These people are nuts for football. We've got people watching
our one-on-one pass rush drills screaming, 'Let's go, Turley! Kill
him!' You're just like, 'I'm at practice.' They're just so intense
about football. It's wild to see."</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Jay Mohr performed in New Orleans during Super Bowl week,
and ticket sales picked up when Turley agreed to make a cameo. To the
delight of his fans, Turley brought his guitar and sang a ribald song
he wrote about the miseries of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those lyrics are unprintable, as are many of the
invectives Turley gives and receives on game day. A couple of years
ago, San Diego defensive end Neil Smith told Turley he was going to
"come down to New Orleans in the off-season and kill me and kill my
family," Turley said. In the wake of last season's helmet-tossing
episode, New England's Richard Seymour, then a rookie defensive
tackle, warned Turley: "I'm not some defensive back for the Jets."
Turley mocked him, repeating his words in a whiny, singsong voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, I walked up to him and said, 'Just do something, babe,' "
Turley said. "And he was like, 'You crazy, man.' Every one of them
was like, 'Man, you need to be a wrestler. You don't belong here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Raider linebacker Bill Romanowski, himself one of the more loathed
players in the league, said of Turley: "He tries to kill you every
play. Literally."</TE>
<TE>   Turley says he has written off the Pro Bowl, no matter how well he
plays, because "players have the majority of the vote, and players
hate me. They want to vote their buddies in."</TE>
<TE>   That's where he feels a kinship with Dobler, who was a Pro Bowl
regular when coaches made the call but never was invited back when
players got to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "People always hate us," Turley said. "They hate guys like us, but
yet when you ask any of those guys out there when they're going to
put together an offensive line for their team--guys who don't vote
for me for the Pro Bowl--who are they going to put on their list?
They're going to put Kyle Turley on their list. They want Kyle Turley
on their offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be made up of guys like Kyle Turley, [former Raider
guard] Steve Wisniewski, Conrad Dobler. Because they know that's what
it takes to win a football game. You sell out every play. You're
nasty, dirty, whatever it takes to win."</TE>
<TE>   Turley's specialty, the move that got him banned from the
Christmas-card list of every defensive lineman, is the cut block. He
takes guys out at the knees, usually staying within the written rules
but testing the ethical boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "A cut block doesn't hurt anyone, unless you go on the back of
people's legs," he said. "I have done that by accident a couple of
times because a guy turns a different direction and right at the last
second you'll roll up on somebody's legs. It [stinks] and you feel
bad about that. But the block that is initially made is a legal
block. It's not a dangerous block. You're going in front of the legs.
You're not clipping from the side, you're not coming from the back.
The guy's just going to fall over you. Guys whine about that all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Throwing a cut block was second nature to Dobler, who played on a
line that led the NFL in fewest sacks allowed for three consecutive
seasons (1974-76) and in 1975 surrendered only eight sacks,
second-best in league history.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got into the league, offensive linemen were supposed to be
somewhat passive," Dobler said. "We were supposed to round the wagons
and protect the quarterback on a pass play. What I would do on a
pass-rush thing is I would just attack the guy. I wasn't going to sit
there and take his shots; I was going to go after him."</TE>
<TE>   All that took its toll. Dobler, who lives in Leewood, Kan., and
owns a business that supplies nurses to hospitals, has had his right
knee replaced twice and needs his left knee replaced. He jokes his
knees would have given out anyway, football or no football, had he
been a regular Joe who had to wait in line for a table at a
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   His nasty style of play created a place for him in NFL lore, and
he even wrote a book titled, "They Call Me Dirty." Turley, the
modern-day Dobler, has a Web site (www.trenchwarfare.net) on which he
sells Turley hats, T-shirts and, soon, sneakers. His motto: "Battle.
Conquer. Destroy."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Dobler's most memorable battles came against the Los
Angeles Rams' Merlin Olsen, the Hall of Fame defensive tackle and
member of the Fearsome Foursome. Once, the two players nearly came to
blows while getting their ankles taped for the Pro Bowl--and they
were on the same team.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an irritant," said Olsen, a 14-time Pro Bowl player who
lives in Park City, Utah. "Being a very marginal player, his decision
was that that was the only way he could play. And that's probably
true."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Dobler hide his disdain for Olsen.</TE>
<TE>   "He just does not like me, and that's good.... Out of all the
things that I've done in my life, when you have a Hall of Famer, a
great movie actor, a guy that was the No. 1 announcer at NBC, a guy
that has more money than God, and I'm still in his mind? God, that's
exciting."</TE>

<HD>Van Pelt's Arrival Is on His Own Terms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In some ways, Bradlee Van Pelt fits the stereotype of a Left Coast
quarterback as well as the laid-back character of Ron "Sunshine" Bass
in "Remember the Titans." He will feel right at home at the Rose Bowl
on Saturday, leading Colorado State against UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   In other ways, the junior from Santa Barbara has charted a path
that belies his shaggy hair and ever-present skateboard.</LD>
<LD>   Van Pelt is one of 36 Ram players from Southern California. But he
found Fort Collins, Colo., by way of Michigan State, the alma mater
of his father, former Spartan All-American and NFL linebacker Brad
Van Pelt.</LD>
<TE>   Following in his dad's footsteps proved impossible. In fact, Van
Pelt felt out of step from the day he walked on the Michigan State
campus, even though his father was there too, finishing his degree 30
years after completing his football eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted to do when I was growing up was to be a Spartan,"
Bradlee told a Denver reporter. "But as soon as I got there, I had a
pretty good idea it wasn't going to work. Then, when Nick Saban left
and Bobby Williams came in as coach, it got worse. They switched me
to defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They lied to me. Their goal was to mentally break me down, and
they almost did it. I was a very unhappy dude there."</TE>
<TE>   Although he has had other setbacks--his parents divorced and his
brother Justen died two years ago at 23 from mixing alcohol with
painkillers--Van Pelt is a happier dude since arriving at Colorado
State. He started the last nine games last season, rushing for 546
yards and passing for 1,247, nearly half of the Ram output on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Already this season he has passed for 397 yards and rushed for 101
in victories over Virginia and Colorado. He ran 23 yards for the
winning touchdown in the Rams' 19-14 upset of Colorado, spiking the
ball into the face of Colorado defensive back Roderick Sneed in the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably a really stupid thing to do on my part," Van Pelt
said. "And I apologize for that."</TE>
<TE>   However, he relishes the underdog role and offered no mea culpa
for his harsh evaluation of Colorado, which entered the game ranked
No. 6 in one poll.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the sorriest No. 6 team I've ever seen," Van Pelt said.
"I live in the face of doubters, and so does my whole team.
[Colorado] has four times the amount of money we have. They have
everything. You know what, we've got guys with heart."</TE>

<TE>   Shane Lehmann's no contest plea to misdemeanor battery Tuesday
came at the advice of his attorney, William A. Bartz, who did not
want the Bruin guard to risk a trial on a felony charge of inflicting
significant bodily injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen juries do enough strange things that I recommend to any
client to take a reasonable [plea]," said Bartz, who has advised
Lehmann not to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Lehmann was drinking at Madison's
Neighborhood Grill when he and an employee escorted Luis Estrada to
the parking lot at 1 a.m. A fight ensued and Estrada, who is an Army
Reserve, was taken away in an ambulance and hospitalized with head
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman, who was put on three years' probation, has been suspended
for Saturday's game. Bruin players have been banned from frequenting
Madison's, a popular Westwood night spot.</TE>

<TE>   The uniform numbers of four players changed this week. Fullback
J.D. Groves is 31, running back Jason Harrison is 28 and receivers
Junior Taylor and Jacques Lazarus traded numbers, with Taylor now 8
and Lazarus 9.</TE>

<LD>Winston Justice did not play in the season-opening victory against
Auburn, but the freshman tackle from Long Beach Poly High worked with
the first-unit offense during practice Wednesday and is one of
several players who could move up the depth chart during a bye week.</LD>
<LD>   USC, ranked No. 18 in the Associated Press poll, does not play
again until Sept. 14 when the Trojans travel to No. 17 Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Justice, 6 feet 6 and 305 pounds, alternated with starting right
tackle Eric Torres, a 6-5, 300-pound junior, during a two-hour
practice.</LD>
<TE>   "We're rotating him and seeing how fast we can bring him along,"
Coach Pete Carroll said. "We'll try and push a little bit, using this
week to give him some turns and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said competition at several positions would heat up again.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman Matt Leinart was listed as the No. 2 quarterback
for the opener, but he did not play and is once again battling
redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Marcell Allmond and redshirt freshman William Buchanon
began another push for playing time at cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys have got to play a lot during this week and show us they
know what they're doing so we can play more guys," Carroll said.
"It's a long season with a tough schedule and we have to be able to
get a lot of guys in the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore nose tackle Mike Patterson made a team-best seven solo
tackles and assisted on another against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson is starting ahead of Bernard Riley, who is coming back
from knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of forgot what it was like to play a whole game,"
Patterson said Wednesday. "I just kept going and going. I was kind of
hoping for those TV timeouts. But now I have a sense for what it's
like to be out there most of the time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior tailback Justin Fargas, who missed the opener because of a
strained right hamstring, attended practice but will not participate
in drills until next week, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to set him back at all," Carroll said. "He should
be coming out roaring Monday or Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   Senior fullback Chad Pierson also will be held out until next
week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebackers Matt Grootegoed and Melvin Simmons and safety Sandy
Fletcher, who suffered mild concussions against Auburn, participated
in light drills. Cornerback Ronald Nunn (hip) also returned to
practice.... Players will join the Trojan marching band and yell
leaders today in a visit to County-USC Women's and Children's
Hospital.</TE>

<HD>Heisman Hype Can Have Its Cruel Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We can't wait for No. 1 Miami versus No. 6 Florida this Saturday in
Gainesville if only because the game pits quarterback Rex Grossman
against quarterback Ken Dorsey in the season's first Heisman Trophy
elimination match.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, no one asked Grossman or Dorsey if either wanted to be
a Heisman candidate, but what say do they have in this matter?</LD>
<LD>   The Heisman is college football's Academy Award, the kind of
pinnacle prize that would lead Notre Dame to convince Joe Theismann
to change the pronunciation of his name to rhyme with Heisman (it
didn't work; Theismann finished second to Jim Plunkett in 1970).</LD>
<TE>   So, who wouldn't want to be touted for the Heisman?</TE>
<TE>   More players than you would think.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Manning already has informed Mississippi not to promote his
talented quarterback son, Eli, for the award, partly because of the
pressure and backlash that came with son Peyton Manning's
heartbreaking 1997 Heisman loss to Michigan's Charles Woodson.</TE>
<TE>   "After talking with Archie, we took the position that we would not
use the 'H' word around Ole Miss," Mississippi media director
Langston Rogers said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Heisman campaigns can be disasters. Last year, Oregon State pushed
running back Ken Simonton onto the Heisman stage to counter Oregon's
drive with quarterback Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington thrived under the spotlight, led Oregon to a No. 2
national ranking, finished fourth in balloting, and became the third
pick in the NFL draft, signing a $36-million deal with Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Simonton had a sub-par year, was not drafted, and was last seen
back home in Pittsburg, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas quarterback Jason Thomas still hasn't recovered
from last year's decision to promote him for the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was coming off a stellar sophomore season and UNLV was
looking to use the player to gain some national publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to sell tickets," John Robinson, the team's coach
and athletic director, admitted recently. "We never had a player
anyone paid attention to since Randall Cunningham, and I don't know
how much attention they paid to him."</TE>
<TE>   UNLV forged ahead with Heisman campaign 2001 even though Thomas
was coming off surgery on his throwing shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kind of went along with the program," Thomas said. "I was
not comfortable with it. There were times when I even said, 'I don't
look at myself as a Heisman candidate.' "</TE>
<TE>   Thomas felt pressure to carry his team and was a complete flop in
the team's opener at Arkansas, a game UNLV would have won if not for
its quarterback's poor play.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas couldn't grip the ball on a humid night, completing only
four of 13 pass attempts for 40 yards with three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was torture," he said of the game. "I remember going to the
locker room and falling on the floor. I was just apologizing to
everybody, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I blew it, I'm sorry.' I shouldn't
have felt like that. No one player loses the game. That should have
been a sign right there I put too much pressure on myself."</TE>
<TE>   Not the best way to kick off a Heisman campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I'd go to a stadium, that's all fans were talking
about," Thomas said. "They'd say, 'You're no Heisman.' It's tough on
you physically and mentally. Every team wants to hit you and hit you
hard and knock you out of the Heisman race."</TE>
<TE>   In leading UNLV to an 8-5 record in 2000, Thomas completed 52.7%
of his passes for 1,708 yards, with 14 touchdowns and nine
interceptions. Last year, the junior Thomas had more interceptions
than touchdown passes, 12 to eight, and his completion percentage
fell to 42.8%. Worse, UNLV fell to 4-7.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas had a lot of additional responsibilities to handle,
including the impending birth of a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a big slice of humble pie last year," Thomas said.
"Pressure from the media, pressure from my family, pressure from
myself. So many things were coming to a head at one time. It was like
a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson says Thomas probably let the Heisman talk go to his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'd grown up with this 'I'm a superstar' thing and it
causes you to take some things for granted about playing the game,"
Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas originally signed to play at USC out of high school before
transferring to UNLV. Life was good last year when the school
plastered Thomas' picture on a Las Vegas Strip billboard; not so good
when they painted over his face.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to take the going up and you got to take the coming
down," he said of the street-side process.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing Thomas wants to see around town is a picture of
himself next to Wayne Newton's.</TE>
<TE>   "No billboards," Thomas said. "We want team billboards. I think
that was one of the things that separated us from the team. It was
one guy put there on the pedestal. No matter what you say it affects
you in the locker room. Guys treated me differently and I might have
treated guys differently.'</TE>
<TE>   Footnote: Thomas isn't quite out of his funk yet.</TE>
<TE>   In last weekend's 27-7, season-opening loss to Wisconsin, Thomas
had two interceptions and two fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   UNLV has lowered expectations this year, although Thomas is being
promoted for the Davey O'Brien Award, given to the nation's top
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   It's only natural Grossman and Dorsey are getting most of the
attention heading into Saturday's Florida-Miami showdown. Grossman
finished second to Eric Crouch in last year's Heisman balloting and
Dorsey finished third.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another thing to talk about in a huge game," Grossman
said. "Obviously, we don't go head to head."</TE>
<TE>   Miami brings a 23-game winning streak into the game, and Dorsey is
27-1 as a starter. Florida's "Swamp" is arguably the loudest backdrop
in college football, but don't expect Miami to be intimidated by the
crowd. "We've been to Penn State, we've been to Florida State,"
linebacker Jonathan Vilma said this week. "Those are some rowdy
places." In fact, Miami won games at Penn State and at Florida State
last year by the combined score of 82-36.</TE>
<TE>   It's lonely at the top: Four of last year's six major conference
champions already have lost games: Colorado (Big 12), Illinois (Big
Ten), Maryland (Atlantic Coast) and Louisiana State (Southeastern).</TE>
<TE>   Two-minute drill assessment of USC's 24-17 victory over Auburn: If
quarterback Carson Palmer can avoid costly mistakes, and the
offensive line holds up, and tailback Justin Fargas can return from a
hamstring injury to add some pop to the running game, and Troy
Polamalu can pick it up a notch at safety, and the Trojans can
eliminate dumb penalties, and the team can survive a nonconference
schedule that still includes games against Colorado, Kansas State and
Notre Dame, and USC can navigate through a tough Pac-10, this has the
makings of a special year.</TE>
<TE>   After the Auburn game, USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow had
this to say about Palmer, the Trojans' fifth-year senior quarterback:
"He's been very unfairly criticized. Every year he's had a new system
and a new coach. He's finally got the same deal two years in a row."
Chow is in his second year as Trojan coordinator after a
distinguished career calling plays at pass-happy Brigham Young. Chow
thinks this could be a breakout year for Palmer. "You know, Steve
Young sat on the bench for three years," Chow said of the former BYU
and NFL star quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer time: Two teams you wouldn't want to be this week? How
about the states, San Diego and San Jose. San Diego State plays at
Colorado while San Jose State travels to Washington. Colorado and
Washington are coming off stinging losses on opening weekend and are
no doubt looking to release their anger.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State, under first-year Coach Tom Craft, blew a chance
to beat Fresno State on Aug. 31 when a last-second field-goal attempt
was blocked. You wonder how many chances the Aztecs are going to get.
They play 13 games this year, eight on the road, with only 70 players
on scholarship. "That isn't the ingredients of having the chance to
get off to a good start," Craft said.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State won its opener at Arkansas State, but this week's
game at Washington will mark the second of 13 games in 13 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State is playing for more than pride. The Spartans'
Division I-A status is in jeopardy. Under a new NCAA edict, the
football team has to average 15,000 fans a home game in 2004 to
remain Division I-A in football. Last year, the Spartans averaged
10,207 a game.</TE>
<TE>   More on San Jose State: Neil Parry has cleared a major hurdle in
his bid to return to the field two years after an on-field injury
required the amputation of his right leg below the knee. The problem
involved the NCAA's catastrophic insurance policy with Mutual of
Omaha. Under the terms, Parry would have lost future benefits had he
been cleared to play. Mutual of Omaha, though, recently modified its
policy for Parry.</TE>
<TE>   Parry has been fitted with a prosthetic but has not yet
participated in contact drills or been cleared to play by San Jose
State. Parry probably would make an appearance on the Spartan kickoff
team. A school spokesman said Parry would not play this week. One
possible return date might be Sept. 28 at home against Texas El Paso,
the school against which Parry sustained his injury two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This week's stinker matchup: Buffalo vs. Rutgers. The loser ought
to be demoted to Division I-AA considering both "major" college
programs lost last week to Division I-AA schools. Buffalo went over
the falls against Lehigh and Villanova defeated Rutgers.</TE>
