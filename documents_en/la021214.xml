<HD>Arledge no god, but in him we trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Lance</AU>
<BD>Former ABC newsman Peter Lance, a five-time Emmy Award
winner, works as a novelist, screenwriter and investigative
journalist. He lives in Santa Barbara and can be contacted at
www.peterlance.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THE Times edition with the full-page obit chronicling Roone Arledge's
career at ABC -- where he was president of the sports and news
divisions -- had barely begun to turn yellow when Howard Rosenberg
weighed in with a commentary titled "Arledge Was Good, but He Wasn't
God" (Dec. 7).</LD>
<LD>   I agree with him that in the post-Princess Di-JFK Jr. era, the
media hype the celebrity dead far beyond their achievements, but I'd
like to submit a minority report on a little-known side of Arledge,
the brash redhead known for his safari jackets, Churchill cigars and
chauffeur-driven Jag.</LD>
<LD>   During my nine years as a field producer and, later, investigative
correspondent for ABC News, Roone was broadcast news' equivalent to
Ben Bradlee, the famed Washington Post editor who oversaw the paper's
Watergate investigation.</LD>
<TE>   It's true that Arledge kept ironfisted control of all four ABC
news broadcasts. For us, the red "Roone phone" in each control room
might as well have been the hotline to Moscow, with Arledge calling
during live telecasts to dictate graphics or copy changes. It was the
broadcast equivalent of Jack Warner giving script notes to every
writer on the lot four times a day, seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   But the corporate weight he carried, having built the sports
division into a money machine, gave Arledge the power to be a
statesman in news. And while lesser men would have played it safe, he
went out and recruited print reporters and investigative journalists
to fulfill H.L. Mencken's dictum that "the proper role of a newsman
is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable." He hired
Lowell Bergmen of "The Insider" fame; Chris Isham, the investigative
producer who later brokered John Miller's historic "get" with Osama
bin Laden; Brian Ross; and me, an ex-print reporter from a small-town
Rhode Island daily whom Roone sent undercover for six months to break
a Chicago arson ring as a field producer for "20/20."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge was such an outside-the-box thinker that he gave me my
first on-air shot for a "20/20" investigation on unnecessary surgery
in Arkansas. We found that poor and elderly women were routinely
subjected to mastectomies and hysterectomies even though the county
hospital pathologist was finding normal tissue in pre-op diagnoses.</TE>
<TE>   After a difficult week of shooting, the local D.A. called to say
that he was arresting my crew for criminal trespass at the hospital.
I called ABC News and the word came back from Roone: "Get your tapes
out of the state, then surrender." The piece resulted in an Emmy and
a $52-million defamation claim. But when the summons was served on
ABC, Roone didn't blink. "We don't settle libel suits," he shot back.
"Truth is an absolute defense."</TE>
<TE>   And after we won a two-week trial, he called to congratulate me,
saying, "I never had a moment's doubt." Then he added, "Of course, if
you'd lost, your next job in broadcasting would have been at the
Burger King window." I swallowed hard and he hung up.</TE>
<TE>   That was his style. Roone always kept his reporters and producers
on edge. But he continued to back me through stories on Pentagon cost
overruns, Southeast Asia land mines and a probe of mob ties to the
toxic waste industry that produced death threats.</TE>
<TE>   So I beg to differ with Rosenberg, at least on one point: Roone
Arledge wasn't God, but for a while at ABC News, to those of us who
did investigative reporting, he was at least a cigar-smoking,
safari-jacketed archangel.</TE>

<LD>Simone Forti is probably one of the most experienced, interesting
dance improvisers around, often using the spoken word in ways that
make you see that bodies also "speak." She also has evocative stories
in her past, fragments of which provided the very few noteworthy
moments in "War and Variations," on Thursday night at Highways in
Santa Monica. The hourlong improvised work, also featuring Dale
Eunson and Terrence Luke Johnson, is based on her childhood memories
of World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Forti and her Italian Jewish family escaped Mussolini's Italy by
pretending to enter Switzerland to ski. She remembers the smell of
coal back then, the feel of silk brought by a sailor on leave and the
stories about her uncle who fought in the French Underground and died
on the way to Dachau.</LD>
<LD>   On arrival in America, she instantly thought of herself as a New
Yorker. Now, she's worried about the imminence of another war, and
she can make you feel her anxiety by clutching a bag to her prone
body and repeating phrases you think you know how to finish when she
trails off: "As long as my little thing is ... " (safe); "I know what
they're doing ... " (killing); and "We escaped through the mountains
..." (and some didn't).</LD>
<TE>   Forti could sometimes make movement her ally as she used words,
but the evening never really got beyond the partial telling of
stories with words. The prepared text read by each performer was
always stronger than the improvised movement. They tried repetition,
imitation and variation, in an effort to riff on a theme, but things
petered out. Eventually, improvised dialogue trivialized grand
themes, and the whole enterprise was shadowed by one of the worst
results that improvised dance-theater can engender -- the longing for
a script.</TE>

<HD>Roots lead a celebration of positive party hip-hop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The epic, high-energy sound of Philadelphia hip-hop crew the Roots
has proved once and for all that, contrary to the history of rap's
chaotic stage shows, this band stands tall among the best live acts
performing in any genre today.</LD>
<LD>   Even their less than ideal spot at the end of Thursday's four-hour
Holiday Cooldown concert at the Universal Amphitheatre -- an evening
crammed with other good acts playing miniature sets and lots of def
poetry and irritating shout-outs in between -- couldn't diminish the
Roots' impact, or the audience's urgent, honest connection to this
band's great live sound.</LD>
<LD>   This was the 10th annual Holiday Cooldown show for the Beat (100.3
FM), which more typically features the hottest R&amp;B and neo-soul acts
to reflect the bulk of its programming, this year represented only by
the suave, rooster-strutting hit machine Raphael Saadiq. He had the
women on their feet with a medley of his hits, including two times
through "Still Ray," with New Orleans-style marching tuba taking the
bass line.</LD>
<TE>   But this year's Cooldown was dominated by positive hip-hop, and
the crowd was clearly ready to party with the heavier beats.
Detroit's Slum Village and L.A.'s Jurassic 5 set the tone with short,
polished sets that showed off their tight ensemble vocal work.</TE>
<TE>   Jurassic 5 DJs Cut Chemist and Nu-Mark stole the show with a
pyrotechnic extended break that brought roars from the crowd when the
latter created an impromptu beat composition from a child's musical
toy.</TE>
<TE>   A set from New York's legendary old school B-boys Gang Starr
seemed erratic and somewhat dated by comparison, lacking the deft
complexity and message of today's monsters of hop. Guru and a guest
MC did, however, stop their show in the middle to roundly curse the
media for propagating "all this East Coast-West Coast rivalry."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that many of these acts have worked together extensively
seemed to pull the show forward toward the band of live musicians
that at one time or another has backed them all, the Roots.</TE>
<TE>   Working at the height of their powers, the six-man Philly crew,
anchored by drummer ?uestlove and fronted by MC Black Thought and
joined by Frankie Knuckles on percussion and Rahzel as MC, pushed the
manic energy of their seamless and highly musical assault to the
level of the best rock show and then beyond, with the entire house
dancing in the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   Gifted rapper Common was the guest MC on the first three songs,
leading the band along a clean, easy through-line of rhythm and
power, especially on his hit "Light." He re-emerged later with some
impromptu break-dancing. Talib Kweli guested, as did eccentric
neo-funk man Cody Chesnutt, wearing a long quilted skirt and purple
pimp hat and jamming on a hollow-body electric.</TE>
<TE>   A towering version of "Break You Off" ended with MC's Scratch and
Rahzel spitting out some outrageously complex beat-boxing, including
a brilliant, all-vocal dramatization of the light-saber battle
between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader ("I will never join the dark
side!") and a booming rendition of "Planet Rock."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Love may have been exciting and new when "The Love Boat" ruled
Saturday nights in the 1970s and '80s.</LD>
<LD>   Now the actress who played Capt. Stubing's daughter is among the
stars on the latest blind date show trying to prove it's just as
exciting -- if not new -- to watch strangers struggle for small talk
over Cobb salad.</LD>
<LD>   Jill Whelan -- Vicki from "The Love Boat" -- is one of the
celebrities on "Star Dates," which matches stars and singles with
mixed results. The series premieres at 10:30 p.m. Sunday on E!
Entertainment Television.</LD>
<TE>   "Star Dates" combines the fly-on-the-wall element of those
programs with the where-are-they-now nostalgia factor. Besides
Whelan, Gary Coleman from "Diff'rent Strokes," Dustin Diamond from
"Saved by the Bell" and Kim Fields from "The Facts of Life" go
looking for love.</TE>
<TE>   The first episode features Butch Patrick, who played Eddie Munster
on "The Munsters" from 1964 to '66. (Without the widow's peak and
pasty skin from his child actor days, you'd never recognize him -- he
has wavy reddish hair and freckles.)</TE>
<TE>   Now 49, Patrick splits his time between making appearances at
nostalgia conventions and working as a consultant on haunted houses
at Halloween. Having just gotten out of a six-year relationship, he
says he's "looking for someone to fill the emptiness that I have at
the moment."</TE>
<TE>   E!'s vice president of development, Kary McHoul, said everyone's
had that kind of disastrous blind date, and that's why so many of
these shows exist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's relatable, and that's what people like, whether
they're watching a mean-spirited dating show and they can laugh, or
one like this where there's a twist," McHoul said.</TE>

<HD>LACMA's focus needs to be on art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NICOLAI Ouroussoff's commentary ("Prudent Decision for LACMA Is a
Setback for the City," Dec. 10) is entirely off the mark.</LD>
<LD>   The notion of the Los Angeles County Art Museum spending up to
$300 million (and probably more, by the time all the bills would be
paid) to replace fully functional museum buildings was and is
completely misguided, particularly when there is plenty of room for
improvement in the museum's collection and when local artists could
well use some commissions, support and opportunities to show their
work.</LD>
<LD>   Our county art museum is an institution intended, in large part,
to acquire and present artwork. That is where its money should
primarily go, not toward erecting another L.A. architectural monument
that does little or nothing to further the contribution to our
culture of the art within.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Moskowitz</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LACMA board member Walter Weisman's comments about dumping the Rem
Koolhaas redesign of the museum's bewildering, mediocre campus brings
to mind "With friends like these, who needs enemies?" Leadership is
not a reflexive action. Ouroussof's commentary brought it all home.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the board should be reminded how many of our beloved
structures (not just buildings, but bridges, dams and other
infrastructure) were constructed during the Great Depression. Other
options? LACMA already selected Koolhaas' design as the most
cohesive, intelligent and cost-effective solution. Fund-raising
cannot be based on Wall Street's many peaks and valleys. Failure of
the Guggenheim to raise funds for yet another franchise does not doom
us to failure as well.</TE>
<TE>   Perceived "public mindedness" has a great deal to do with the
attractiveness of contributing to a democratic institution like a
museum. Voters saw through the transparent "earthquake retrofit" bond
measure, and so it failed. But they were happy to fork out $3.35
billion in property taxes to build 79 new schools. Folks aren't
necessarily cheap; we are just waiting to be asked the right way.
LACMA's board is not up to the job.</TE>

<LD>WHY did you consign the article on the formation of the Win Without
War Coalition to the Calendar section ("Speaking Against War," by
Hilary E. MacGregor, Dec. 10)? The A section front page carried a
center article and two references to "related stories" reporting on
the administration's unilateral march toward war in Iraq but no
mention of this newest organization in the burgeoning opposition.</LD>
<LD>   The press dutifully reports the administration line and utterly
fails to look behind the doublespeak. The press is complicitous. The
argument is about whether you bomb, not when you bomb. Please afford
the antiwar movement equal coverage.</LD>

<TE>   THERE is a trend to make movies using animation technology. The
technology is improving daily. Soon Hollywood will be able to create
characters that will be so lifelike that moviegoers will not be able
to tell the difference between a digitalized star and a living,
breathing one. Since the digitalized characters will work more
cheaply and will not spend all their spare time bellyaching about how
rotten this country is, the real actors, actresses, singers and
comedians will be replaced by "ones and zeros."</TE>
<TE>   This trend worries me. If these stars are replaced, there won't be
anyone left to correctly determine U.S. foreign policy.</TE>

<LD>FOR the sake of their fine collections, I'm glad to hear the Autry
Museum of Western Heritage and the Southwest Museum will merge ("A
Union of Cowboys and Indians," by Christopher Reynolds, Dec. 11). I
must admit my real concern, however, is that the Autry not expand and
build on the big south lawn off the museum courtyard.</LD>
<LD>   In a city criminally lacking in open green space, the Autry lawn
is one of the best places in Los Angeles for pastoral recreation.
Especially Frisbee. Save the Southwest collection, but not at the
expense of the Autry lawn.</LD>

<HD>Here's a problem he didn't factor in</HD>
<DH>Artist Helaman Feguson, famed for his mathematically
generated designs, may soon find himself literally out in the cold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eugene L. Meyer</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Helaman Ferguson is having a bad day in his unheated studio/barn. His
10-year-old compressor has died; the repairman says it's beyond
fixing. The earliest December snowstorm in 20 years is about to delay
the hauling of his 9-ton granite sculpture to a corporate client
outside Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   To top it off, his landlord has declared him a squatter and is
evicting him from the old dairy barn he converted -- and has toiled
in for four years -- at the Maryland Science and Technology Center in
Bowie.</LD>
<LD>   Others in Bowie regard Ferguson, 62, as a national treasure.</LD>
<TE>   He is the Tech Center's unofficial artist in residence, a
world-renowned research mathematician who uses 3-D computer-imaging
to turn algorithms into sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   His work has been exhibited in major cities, and he has received
national awards. People from all over the world come to Bowie to see
the 45-ton granite fountain he created from a formula devised 800
years ago by Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano, better known as
Fibonacci.</TE>
<TE>   "Math is my design language," said Ferguson, a lanky man with a
trimmed white beard who holds a world's record of sorts for juggling
while jogging 50 miles. In the drafty barn, near two large granite
pieces, equations are scrawled on sheets of insulation and a
chalkboard. The classical music he listens to while he works can be
heard hundreds of yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson's predicament is the latest wrinkle in the saga of the
466-acre office park. Formerly affiliated with the University of
Maryland, it remains largely undeveloped after two decades, having
suffered through economic downturns, political problems and
foreclosures that landed two former developers in jail.</TE>
<TE>   The land for the office park is under covenants that limit
development to research and technology tenants. But Ferguson, who was
working in the basement and garage of his Howard County, Md., home,
negotiated the use of the barn a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson had been hired by one of the park's handful of tenants,
the Institute for Defense Analyses, a private think tank affiliated
with the National Security Agency. In return for rights to the barn,
which he spent $80,000 on to convert it into a studio, he agreed to
design and build the fountain that sits in the middle of a reservoir
at the center, dubbed Lake Fibonacci.</TE>
<TE>   He has worked since without a written agreement but with an
unwritten pledge from one of the property owners that he could stay
while completing his other large granite pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most determined guy I know. He's done some wonderful
things," said Dean Morehouse, the Tech Center partner who suggested
to Ferguson that he use the barn. Morehouse spent "a little over
$500,000" on the fountain, which paid for materials, some equipment
and 28 concrete pilings driven into the reservoir floor.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Morehouse sold his managing stake in the Tech
Center and about half the property -- including the barn -- to the
Baltimore-based MIE Co., a builder of office parks and shopping
centers. MIE specializes in warehouse-style "flex space," which is
what it wants to build where the barn is.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson was given until September to complete his work and leave.
When the deadline came, he said he needed more time, and MIE let him
stay until the end of the year. Now he is between an 11-ton rock --
his latest commission, from Macalester College in Minnesota -- and a
hard place.</TE>
<TE>   The new property owners say they will turn off his electric
service at the end of this month and then tear down the barn.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not staying there," said Ramon Benitez, MIE's development
manager. "He's, frankly, a squatter at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson is no typical squatter. The piece he has just finished
but not yet delivered to pharmaceutical giant Merck, an abstract of
hands almost shaking, drew a commission "in the low six figures,"
Ferguson said.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian film is ineligible for Oscar consideration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Divine Intervention" is a film without a country, at least by the
reckoning of the foreign language film selection committee of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which determines
eligibility for an Oscar nomination.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian movie, honored at numerous international film
festivals, will not be among the 54 entries competing for this year's
foreign-language Oscar, and the movie's producers and some
Palestinian and Arab American organizations are crying foul. The
controversy highlights some of the arcana of the academy's guidelines
as well as the importance for foreign films to have a shot at an
Oscar. A nomination could mean the difference between obscurity and
international distribution.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously we are disappointed," said Feda Abdelhadi Nasser,
counselor for the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the
United Nations. "What it comes down to is that the Palestinian
people, in addition to the denial of other rights ... are now being
denied the ability to compete in a competition that judges artistic
and cultural expression."</LD>
<TE>   Academy spokesman John Pavlik said the film was never submitted
for consideration. Pavlik acknowledged that the film's
representatives contacted the organization's executive director,
Bruce Davis, in September to inquire if the film would be eligible.
Davis then told the producer of the film, Humbert Balsan, that the
academy does not recognize Palestine as a country.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlik said the academy goes by the U.N. list of member nations
when it determines if a film is eligible to represent a country. But
on a case-by-case basis, they are willing to consider territories the
U.N. may not consider countries, such as Puerto Rico, Taiwan or Hong
Kong. "Divine Intervention" also did not fulfill other requirements,
including the formation of a selection committee in its country and
exhibiting the film in a native theater for at least one week.</TE>
<TE>   "This conversation happened with Bruce three days before the
deadline," said Pavlik. "We try to let other people decide for us
what country is a country ... we are not trying to be exclusive. We
are trying to get as many countries in as we can, but we have to have
rules."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Johnson, chair of the foreign language film selection
committee, said the decision on "Divine Intervention" may be
controversial, but the academy has a right to establish rules.</TE>
<TE>   But Keith Icove, vice president of Avatar Films, the movie's U.S.
distributor, said Davis' response prompted the company not to submit
the film for consideration because executives knew it would be
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Since they did not submit the film or fulfill the requirements,
they can now lobby to get Palestine recognized as a country by the
academy and submit it for consideration next year. "When we had that
conversation it was not, 'Well, submit it and let's see what
happens,' " said Icove. The producer "got a very negative reaction,
so we said, 'Let's wait to try to see if we can change the rules
because they are not fair.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hussein Ibish, communications director for the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, D.C., said the academy
needs to review its policies. "They deliberately discouraged the
application of this movie in order not to have to make a decision,"
he said. "That is unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Abdelhadi Nasser of the Palestinian U.N. mission added that
Palestine is recognized as a nation by more than 115 countries and
has had observer status in the U.N. since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "Divine Intervention," the first Palestinian film to compete at
the Cannes Film Festival, also won the international critics' prize
at Cannes and best foreign film at the European Film Awards. It is
scheduled for release in Los Angeles in January.</TE>
<TE>   A dark comedy about a love affair between two people on opposite
sides of an Israeli military checkpoint, the film uses absurdist
humor to illustrate hardships faced by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hubbub over his film, director-star-writer Elia
Suleiman would rather not delve into the controversy. Reached on his
cell phone in Paris, where he lives, he said in an aggravated tone:
"I'm a very tired person who has been touring the world for the last
five and a half months with this film. I would like to talk about my
film and not about political involvements."</TE>

<HD>History prize rescinded for book on gun culture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hillel Italie</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Severe doubts about a book on guns in the United States has led
Columbia University to rescind the prestigious Bancroft Prize for
history.</LD>
<LD>   "Arming America," by Michael A. Bellesiles, received the award in
2001.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released Friday, Columbia said that the school's
trustees had concluded "his book had not and does not meet the
standards ... established for the Bancroft Prize." Columbia has asked
Bellesiles to return the prize money, $4,000.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time in the 54-year history of the Bancroft award
that Columbia has taken such actions. Phone and e-mail messages left
by the Associated Press with Bellesiles were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Bellesiles resigned in October as a professor at Emory University
after an independent panel of scholars strongly criticized his
research. In May, the National Endowment for the Humanities withdrew
its name -- although not its funding -- from a fellowship given to
Bellesiles.</TE>
<TE>   Bellesiles has acknowledged some errors but defends his book as
fundamentally sound. "I have never fabricated evidence of any kind
nor knowingly evaded my responsibilities as a scholar," he said after
announcing his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The historian spent 10 years working on "Arming America,"
published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2000. The book challenges the idea
that the United States has always been a gun-oriented culture and
that well-armed militias were essential to the Revolutionary War.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on numerous sources, Bellesiles wrote that only a small
percentage of people possessed firearms in colonial times and that
militias were mostly ineffective. Only after the Civil War, he
contended, did guns become vital.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three decades of spinning tales about lost ships and sunken
treasures, Clive Cussler, author of bestselling adventure books
"Raise the Titanic" and "Night Probe!," is tired and plans to quit.</LD>
<LD>   In New York recently to promote his latest book, a nonfiction
account of his search for and exploration of underwater wrecks titled
"The Sea Hunters II," 71-year-old Cussler said that after his next
novel he will stop writing.</LD>
<LD>   "The imagination is still working, but the drive is just gone,"
Cussler said in an interview. "I can't explain it. I guess [after] 35
years of this stuff ... I'm tired of it.</LD>
<TE>   "And I have to push to try to maintain the quality because I don't
want to cheat my readers," said Cussler, who has produced 19 fiction
best-sellers and one nonfiction bestseller.</TE>

<HD>Roth is suing Van Halen mates</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Lee Roth has filed a lawsuit against his ex-Van Halen
bandmates, accusing them of conspiring to keep money from him.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges
that Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony diverted
royalties and breached their fiduciary duty to Roth.</LD>
<LD>   The singer claims the band signed a Warner Bros. deal in 1996
without his knowledge or authorization for increased royalties from
album sales. He claims his losses were estimated to be at least
$200,000 at the end of 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Roth was the band's lead singer for eight years before going solo
in 1985. He was reunited with Van Halen briefly in 1996 to record
lead vocals on tracks for a greatest hits album.</TE>
<TE>   Band members said they never promised Roth his old job back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox has canceled "Firefly," the first-year science-fiction series
from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss Whedon.</LD>
<LD>   The program, expensive to produce by TV standards, was troubled
even before its premiere, with Fox opting not to initially air the
two-hour pilot and asking Whedon to draft a new one. "Firefly" has
drawn low ratings in its Friday time slot.</LD>
<LD>   In a message to fans posted on a Web site, Whedon said he was
proud of the show, that the series had been "mistreated shamefully"
and that he hoped to find another home for it.</LD>
<TE>   Fox, which like all the networks will make some scheduling changes
in January, has yet to settle on a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox decision means that the network's two new projects this
fall from pedigreed producers both failed to reach 2003, with David
E. Kelley's "Girls Club" having been pulled in November.</TE>

<LD>Police Chief William J. Bratton's decision to ask ABC network anchor
John Miller to join the LAPD as his special assistant in charge of
homeland security has raised questions about whether the practice of
journalism confers policymaking credentials.</LD>
<LD>   It's a mildly interesting issue -- something to be discussed
politely at a conference, sometime, somewhere. The more serious and
immediate question is whether the journalistic credentials Bratton
believes Miller brings to this assignment are what they seem to be.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the chief told Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein
that Miller's qualifications to advise him include having interviewed
Osama bin Laden in May 1998 -- two months before the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- and co-writing a bestselling book,
"The Cell: Inside the 9/11 Plot and Why the FBI and the CIA Failed to
Stop It."</LD>
<TE>   Friday, when asked about Miller's qualifications on homeland
security, Bratton -- the former New York City police commissioner --
called his longtime friend and onetime spokesman "one of the top
experts on that issue." Bratton told reporters, "John's skills
transcend the skills needed in your profession. He was a key
architect to our crime reduction strategy. He has the best Rolodex in
America."</TE>
<TE>   But a cursory review of the record shows that while Miller
videotaped a statement by Bin Laden, he did not interview him.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cell" contains a lengthy account, including extended
quotations from the Al Qaeda leader. What it does not include are the
questions Miller put to Bin Laden, since he didn't ask any. Unable to
understand Arabic and forbidden simultaneous translation, the ABC
correspondent simply sat through the affair, trying to look engaged
and bobbing his head. Miller gave an account of the incident earlier
this year to Associated Press reporter David Bauder, who wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Not knowing Arabic, and not having Bin Laden's words immediately
translated, Miller tried to keep eye contact by nodding at his words
and feigning fascination at what he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When the interview was over, Miller's translator told him he had
a big story -- Bin Laden had said he was going to kill as many
Americans as he could.</TE>
<TE>   "What was I doing when he was saying that?" Miller asked his
translator.</TE>
<TE>   "You were nodding in agreement," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   If an outtake from "Broadcast News" springs to mind, you are not
alone. All that's missing is the tear.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, by his own account in "The Cell," Miller subsequently
allowed Bin Laden's then-military chief, Mohamed Atef, to edit the
tape, obscuring the faces of anyone Al Qaeda did not want
photographed.</TE>
<TE>   Most working journalists wouldn't call that an interview.
Interviews contain dialogue, and, most crucially, follow-up
questions. The final footage is not edited by the subject. What
Miller describes is a well-managed photo op. If participating in one
is a valid credential, then Bratton might consider recruiting
additional aides from the staff of Al Jazeera, which not only accepts
electronic dictation from Bin Laden, but also understands what he is
saying.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, who knows who's in their Rolodex?</TE>
<TE>   More troubling, at least one of the key chapters of Miller's book,
which was published in June 2002, contains 25 instances in which the
authors' version is remarkably similar to a story by Times staff
writer Terry McDermott, which appeared on Jan. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Even by the slapdash standards of contemporary nonfiction
publishing, "The Cell," which was published by Disney's Hyperion, is
a curious piece of work, lacking much of the normal apparatus of
integrity, such as a bibliography, footnotes or standard
attributions. The importance of such documentation has increased in
recent years, as publishing houses have abdicated nearly all
responsibility for fact-checking nonfiction manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   According to a brief authors' note, Miller and his collaborators
-- New York-based crime reporter Michael Stone and Chris Mitchell, a
writer and editor -- shared "the reporting and writing
responsibilities." Mitchell is credited with digesting "reams of raw
notes from reporting done in the field by colleagues we contracted to
chase down leads in Europe, Egypt and Saudi Arabia." None of those
contract players is named, though a brief acknowledgment preceding
the authors' note names a number of law enforcement sources and some
of Miller's ABC colleagues, who contributed unspecified "notes" and
"sources."</TE>
<TE>   McDermott's name does not appear. However, in the book's 16th
chapter -- titled "Atta" -- a single brief quotation is attributed to
the work of an unidentified Los Angeles Times reporter. In fact, it
was taken from McDermott's exhaustively reported profile of terrorist
Mohamed Atta. There are more than two dozen quotes, descriptions and
characterizations in "The Cell" whose similarity to McDermott's work
ranges from bemusing to disconcerting.</TE>
<TE>   Here is an excerpt from McDermott's profile, which included
firsthand reporting on Atta's life in Hamburg, Germany:</TE>
<TE>   " 'It was a good day when Mohamed wasn't home,' she said."</TE>
<TE>   This is from the book:</TE>
<TE>   " 'It was a good day when Mohamed wasn't home,' she said."</TE>
<TE>   This is from The Times:</TE>
<TE>   "The first roommate tried early on to loosen Atta up. He took Atta
to a showing of Disney's animated film 'The Jungle Book.' Atta became
so upset at the crowd's unruliness before the film began that he
seethed in his seat, muttering over and over in disgust, 'Chaos,
chaos.'</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't speak a word during or after the film, and when they
arrived back at the apartment, he stomped into his bedroom and
slammed the door behind him."</TE>
<TE>   Here are the same events, as recounted in Miller, Stone and
Mitchell's book:</TE>
<TE>   "The first roommate, an immigrant himself, made an effort to
connect, inviting Atta once in the early days to join him at a
screening of the Disney children's movie 'The Jungle Book.' Kipling
koans and singing bears apparently didn't agree with the quiet
Egyptian. Before the film even started, Atta scowled at the
audience's unruliness, muttering, 'Chaos, chaos,' as he huddled
anxiously in his seat. On the walk back to the apartment, he said
nothing, then put a capper on the evening by slamming his bedroom
door behind him."</TE>
<TE>   This is from The Times:</TE>
<TE>   " 'He was reluctant to any pleasure," the roommate said. "We never
shared food. We shared dishes. Mostly, he messed them up and I
cleaned them.'</TE>
<TE>   "Atta sometimes prepared a meal by boiling potatoes whole,
scraping the skins away, then smashing them into a mound. He would
eat this little potato mountain, without reheating it, for a week or
more, sticking his fork into it and shoving the whole assembly back
into the refrigerator when he finished a meal."</TE>
<TE>   This is from "The Cell":</TE>
<TE>   " 'We never shared food. We shared dishes,' said the roommate.
Atta left his, unwashed, in the sink. Frequently, he made only the
barest concession to the necessity of eating. He'd boil a pot of
unskinned potatoes, mash them up, and eat a few warm mouthfuls right
out of the pot. Then the potatoes, pot and fork would go directly
into the refrigerator, the roommate added, where they'd be on call
throughout the week whenever a meal was required."</TE>
<TE>   The net effect of the similar quotes and paraphrases raises many
of the same questions that so damaged the reputation of historian
Doris Kearns Goodwin earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was asked about the appropriated material in a telephone
interview Friday. "I can't speak to that directly," he said. "That
wasn't a chapter I wrote. The process of putting together a lot of
the chapters toward the back of the book involved dumping a lot of
material on Chris [Mitchell], who we brought in to do that writing
because we had a very rushed deadline."</TE>
<TE>   According to Miller, much of the material Mitchell received for
those chapters came from ABC stringers in Germany, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia, who were hired for the purpose. "Their notes and tapes went
to Michael [Stone], who dumped them all on Chris."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the absence of a bibliography, footnotes and index was
"the publisher's call. We'd already missed their deadline three
times, and Hyperion said no footnotes because it would have added
months to the process."</TE>

<HD>Aimard's crystalline portrait of 'Emperor'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pierre-Laurent Aimard was only 19 when Pierre Boulez picked him, in
1976, as the pianist of the elite, newly formed Ensemble
Intercontemporain. It wasn't long afterward that other composers
recognized what an amazing friend they had in this pianist with a
sparkling tone, a keen sense of color, an almost superhuman rhythmic
precision and the ability to make everything he plays seem to leap
off the page. A favorite of Messiaen, he was also taken up by Ligeti,
who wrote several of his nearly unplayable Etudes for Aimard.</LD>
<LD>   Lately, this important specialist in contemporary music has shown
another side as an exceptional Beethoven pianist. A year ago, he gave
a startlingly fresh and exciting reading of the "Appassionata" Sonata
at Carnegie Hall, and Teldec has issued a recording of that live
performance. Soon to be released will be his recordings of the
Beethoven piano concertos with conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Aimard played
Beethoven's Fifth Concerto, the "Emperor," with the Philharmonic and
Esa-Pekka Salonen, and he was as dazzling as ever.</LD>
<TE>   What is most remarkable about Aimard is that he surprises and
astonishes a listener with the self-evident. He does not have
eccentric ways of playing, attention-getting novel approaches to war
horses. But like many French musicians, he presents Beethoven with a
sure sense of structure, treating the composer as a model of
classical, logical thought.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the first, and the lasting, impression of Aimard's "Emperor"
was the way he made every one of these logically expounded phrases in
the music burst into vivid life. Perhaps it's the utter clarity and
brilliance of his playing that does it. But hearing him launch into
Beethoven's glittering runs and trills in the first bars was not
unlike seeing stars in a clear desert night sky. We always know they
are there, but when they are particularly bright they startle anew
every time.</TE>
<TE>   With Salonen as a sympathetic, alert colleague, Aimard was also
able to sound spontaneous, integrating the orchestra's individual,
expressive ticks into his own style. There was a momentary lag in
orchestral energy during the final movement, but as wonderful
compensation pianist and orchestra provided a glowing, sustained,
delicately colored beauty of the slow movement.</TE>
<TE>   A short, convivial program for a harried time of year, it began
with five orchestral excerpts from Mendelssohn's incidental music to
"A Midsummer Night's Dream." Salonen's own music has a lot of the
bright Mendelssohnian qualities to it, especially in its wit, color
and textural intricacies. And he brings to Mendelssohn his own
delight in dramatic rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra was kept small for both pieces. The Nocturne fell
short of dreamy magic -- it was not a perfect night for the horns.
But otherwise this was Mendelssohn with a spring in his step, a head
buzzing with thoughts and lots of enchantment to spread.</TE>

<HD>All alone, creating a world</HD>
<DH>In the desert, Andrea Zittel lives her art: isolated
existence as voyeuristic experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andrea Zittel is a shy, private person whose art invites, even
demands, an almost voyeuristic attention to her life. As a young
artist in New York in the early '90s, she was surrounded by
eccentrics with daring lifestyles, but the art they produced was
often ordinary.</LD>
<LD>   "I just realized, over and over, that I was more interested in
people's lives than I was in their work," says the tall, rail-thin
Zittel, 37, naming several now-forgotten artists whose lives still
compel her attention. "It's all of those weird human idiosyncrasies."</LD>
<LD>   Zittel has taken her own idiosyncrasies, and her angst over
isolation and community, individualism and escape, and built a lively
career in contemporary art. She lives her art to a nearly literal
degree.</LD>
<TE>   Her latest chapter is outside Joshua Tree -- a homesteader's cabin
from the 1930s remade into a kind of high-desert Case Study House,
the post-World War II homes built for middle-class futuristic living.
She's surrounded it with metal plates, mounted on posts and filled
with reconstituted paper she has pulped and dried in the sun. The
refried paper, improbably, resembles travertine marble. Spilling in
eerie geometric intervals down the desert floor outside the house,
the drying racks look as if they were left by a benign alien visitor.
And she's just completed the latest phase of her Uniforms project, in
which she makes her own clothing from felt and, in an exaggerated
back-to-the-land gesture, wears a single "uniform" for six months at
a time.</TE>
<TE>   Zittel calls the whole setup a High Desert Test Site. There's a
lot of terminology to Zittel: The Joshua Tree house, which is down
the street from one of the town's many bail bonds shops, is called
A-Z West, to distinguish it from her Brooklyn apartment-studio known
as A-Z East. Even the initials have a hidden meaning: She broke up
with a serious boyfriend, she says, because she couldn't "A to Z," or
organize, this big, messy guy. In the late '90s, she made everything
she lived in, from her kitchen to her couch; she called the project
"Raugh," which is pronounced "raw." The 25 scorched acres Zittel
lives on, and her clothes and desk and conflicted feelings, are her
artwork. A new show at Regen Projects -- which includes felt dresses
and metal panels of pulped paper -- illuminates some of it, as do the
weekend open houses she's holding in the desert in lieu of an art
opening.</TE>
<TE>   Although most desert art is about the beauty of nature, Zittel's
work is about the strangeness, and the possibilities, of culture. A
utopian from the suburbs -- Le Corbusier with a Valley Girl accent --
she's creating what the Swiss architect called a "machine for living"
on the high desert. She's like the lonely, dreamy kid who makes up an
imaginary world. But this world is real.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of growth</TE>
<TE>   When Zittel was a child, the daughter of schoolteachers, her
chaparral-lined street in Escondido was empty except for one other
house. By high school, she was surrounded by tract housing, a
supermarket and bulldozers. "Pretty weird," she says, looking back.
"Growing up in a community that's growing so rapidly really instilled
a fear of growth. You have no control over it at all. I think I
wanted a place small enough that I could have some control over the
way the entire community developed."</TE>
<TE>   Even early on, she was fascinated by isolation, and some of her
best childhood memories involve being left alone, with food in the
freezer, when her family went away for weeks at a time on a 31-foot
houseboat. She describes her childhood as alienated, a situation made
no better by four aimless, intellectually barren years at San Diego
State -- one long frat party, she calls it, which she had no interest
in attending.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day a college field trip took her to MOCA's Temporary
Contemporary, for a show by Al Ruppersberg. "He had these photographs
of people sitting on couches," she says, her eyes widening as she
remembers realizing that something so commonplace could be art.
Bitten by the art bug, she headed after graduation to the prestigious
Rhode Island School of Design, where she majored in sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Though it expanded her sense of possibility, art school also left
her, upon graduation in 1990, completely dazed. "I went to New York
not knowing what art was," she says. Whatever it was, she wanted to
stretch its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Her first major project was breeding animals. "I was trying to
design my own breed of chickens, after discovering that domestic
breeds were invented over the last 100 years; I just wanted to show
what constructions they were," she says with a laugh. "I jokingly
referred to it as the designer pet of the '90s -- like pot-bellied
pigs in the '80s or miniature horses in the '70s."</TE>
<TE>   Her bantam chickens, a less spectacular batch than she'd hoped
because of recessive genes, never caught on. But one of the breeding
units she made, to give the animals some privacy in a Manhattan
gallery, ended up in the collection of MOCA. "I gave another one to
the bodega next door," she says, "and they used it as a microwave
stand."</TE>
<TE>   Her interest in living things, and the way their lives can be
shaped -- through Darwinian or utopian principals -- fed into her
later work with human environments. The breeding units became living
units.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, she used a grant from the Danish government to
construct and live on a 54-ton cement island in a Scandinavian sea.
"It was like a prototype for a way somebody could live in the
future," she says. "Your land, your dwelling and your vehicle all in
one unit."</TE>
<TE>   During the two years of construction, she looked forward to the
isolation of island living. "And then what happened was that every
Danish guy who has access to a boat bought a six-pack and circled the
island -- drank their beer and waved. I felt like a circus freak."
Finally, the structure sprang a leak that acted like a blowhole,
spurting cold water high into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Zittel also spent two yearlong stints on fellowship in Berlin,
where she was fired by the ideas of European Modernists such as
Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, and the way they worked themselves
out in suburban California culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Price Club and tract housing," Zittel says. "Bauhaus was
about quality goods available for all at an affordable price. Well,
Price Club's kind of like that." She began to build travel trailers
as a statement about the suburbanization of the Bauhaus vision, and
then two years ago, she rented out her Brooklyn apartment and moved
to the desert edge of her suburban past, a place, she says, where she
could get away from it all.</TE>
<TE>   Furniture as art</TE>
<TE>   When Zittel walks through A-Z West, she's one part affectless
homeowner -- complete with a dog named Poppy -- and one part
dead-serious art theorist. She's proud of her place, but each time
she points out a desk, the kitchen, it launches her into another
whimsical idea. Much of her furniture "cycles through," as she puts
it, starting as a concept, becoming a piece she lives with, and
ending up in a gallery or museum; this pays her bills and lets her
make more work. Walking outside through the kitchen, she pets Poppy
and meanders through a collision of boulders, yucca plants, creosote
bushes and hard desert floor parched by an 18-month drought.</TE>
<TE>   She chose Joshua Tree, not far from the home of longtime desert
assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, in part because "I'm sort of inspired
by his whole project," she says of his open-air studio-cum-gallery
nearby. "He said no museum would collect his work, so he made his own
museum."</TE>
<TE>   Here, in her frontyard, the rectangles of paper stare sunward. "No
one would understand how much, like, drama went into making these,"
she says with a laugh as she describes the combinations of cement,
water and wheat paste she had to go through to make the panels look
right.</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the rows, she riffs on her vision of farming for art:
"Mulching my garbage every day, packing it in these huge trays; it
would take about six weeks to dry and then I could just read lots of
books and harvest it afterward."</TE>
<TE>   "I think of Andrea as the quintessential Californian," says New
York artist Allan McCollum, who was born in L.A. "Andrea isn't trying
to deconstruct Hollywood or Disneyland, she's actually capturing some
of the truly wonderful things about California -- the honest,
historical optimism, the utopianism and the progressiveness of the
state. Andrea embraces this California spirit so arduously, even as
she laughs at it and caricatures its excesses."</TE>
<TE>   Now she's putting the ideas of the European avant-garde through
their paces at her desert retreat, inviting the world to peek in.
She's becoming famous, oddly, for being private. But her open houses,
the last of which is this weekend, are pretty conventional. "Just
everybody comes in," she laughs, "and hangs out, and we drink beer."</TE>

<HD>Disney's 'Nancy Drew' uses cell phone, 'Vette</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been many a decade since well-to-do Nancy Drew tooled around in
her blue roadster, going a-sleuthing in frock and pearls. The
post-flapper era heroine's make-overs have been numerous and varied.</LD>
<LD>   So younger viewers probably won't bat an eye at a 21st century
version of the long-lived heroine, but nostalgic fans may get a jolt
when they tune in Sunday to "Nancy Drew," a sleekly produced new TV
movie on "The Wonderful World of Disney" (7 p.m., ABC).</LD>
<LD>   This Nancy (Maggie Lawson), a college freshman, is a
tire-squealing speedster in a baby-blue Corvette; uses a cell phone
while driving with one or no hands on the wheel ("Hey, babe, it's my
other line"); wears tight black leather pants as
breaking-and-entering chic; and urges chums Bess (Jill Ritchie) and
George (Lauren Birkell) to "go kick some sorority butt."</LD>
<TE>   Her know-it-all confidence in her crime-solving, journalistic and
even latte-making abilities seems downright pathological for a time.
Fortunately, writer Ami Canaan Mann and director James Frawley don't
leave it at that sorry note.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in the script mitigates the appalling message sent by
Nancy's risky driving habits, but she's eventually taken down a peg
or two by her exasperated best friends and the crusty journalism
professor (James Avery) she's trying to impress with her reporting
skills.</TE>
<TE>   She also turns out to be a sensitive, passionate crusader for
what's right, and suffers a bruised ego and a painful estrangement
from her lawyer dad (Brett Cullen) for her cause: proving that
officials at River Heights University are encouraging school athletes
to use a performance-enhancing drug that has left one student in a
coma.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional layers, such as they are, would be far less
discernible, however, if not for Lawson, a glowing blond beauty who
brings grace and intelligence to the role and even -- unexpectedly
and against the odds -- a sense of connection to yesteryear's girl
sleuth extraordinaire.</TE>

<HD>Their comfort zone</HD>
<DH>A club that caters to plus-size patrons takes advantage of
a shift in societal attitudes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even Shadoe Gray and Michelle Wilson -- two of the unstoppable forces
behind the Big Beautiful Movement in Southern California -- had no
idea what would follow when they predicted this would be the Year of
the Curvy Woman.</LD>
<LD>   Pop culture seems to have fallen in line with their forecast.
Think of the plus-size actresses stripping down to their skivvies in
"Real Women Have Curves" and the plump bride marrying her Prince
Charming in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Plus-size models in designer
fashions have dazzled on catwalks, a recent People cover story deemed
women of all sizes sexy, and a magazine called Grace -- aimed at
women "who live life to the fullest" -- took its place on the
newsstand.</LD>
<LD>   The year also saw Club Curves, Gray and Wilson's 15-month-old
local nightclub for plus-size women, grow so popular that it expanded
to another location in Redondo Beach. On Nov. 30, the second Club
Curves opened in San Diego, and two more are planned for Las Vegas
and the San Jose area next year. A virtual extension of Club Curves
launched Dec. 9 in the form of an Internet personals site, which
strives to connect plus-size people all over the world. Next up for
Club Curves is franchising. The first one is set to open in New York
City next year.</LD>
<TE>   "We are people like everybody else," says Gray, 38, a size 22. "We
drink and we dance and we do everything everybody else does. We have
women who had never been to a nightclub before come in here and have
men pay attention to them or buy them drinks. It gives them a sense
of self-confidence that they take to their jobs, to their marriages
or wherever."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the success of Gray and Wilson's vision may be emblematic
of a shift in popular culture. While health experts rail against the
increasing rate of obesity in the U.S., a growing number of Americans
who are overweight -- by 20 pounds, 60 pounds or 100 pounds -- are
finding their voice. And those voices are not screaming to let their
"inner thin" out; they are clamoring for acceptance, just the way
they are.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a social movement," says Pam Haldeman,
chairwoman of the sociology department at Mount St. Mary's College
who has supervised several research projects about body image. "When
society tends to go to one extreme, you're going to have an opposite
reaction. There is definitely a rebellion, especially among the
younger generation, and being full-bodied is attractive again. What
the full-figured population is doing is community-building and that's
uplifting."</TE>
<TE>   Determined to be part of mainstream America, Gray and Wilson shy
away from using the term "big beautiful women," or BBW, to describe
themselves and their clientele. The reference to full-figured women
was first coined in 1979 in BBW magazine, a fashion and lifestyle
bimonthly product of the women's movement. "Back then, it was a real
radical concept that plus-size women should accept themselves and
accept their beauty," says BBW editor in chief Sally Smith, who also
served for 11 years as executive director of the National Assn. to
Advance Fat Acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is still a long way to go for this movement because
the social stigma against large people is rampant. But I do think the
public has a better understanding of the fact that losing the weight
on a permanent basis is easier to say than to do. I do think more
plus-size people are traveling the road of self-acceptance."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is it more obvious than the Internet, where plus-size
people have created a vibrant community where they can expect
consistent support and understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet gave full-figured women an exposure they didn't have
before," Gray says. "It gave women a way to get their personalities
across to people and not be judged initially by size. The Internet
let plus-size women put their best face forward without having to put
their face forward.''</TE>
<TE>   The original Club Curves opened in a Culver City shopping center a
few weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks and got off to a slow start.
Then Gray and Wilson threw a New Year's ball called "Curvy Heaven,"
and people lined up for hours waiting for their chance to get into
the 200-capacity space. The new club, which operates on Fridays and
Saturdays in the former Ibiza Beach Club at the Redondo Beach Pier,
accommodates 500 and soon will be open four nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night, the crowd was diverse: black and white,
young and middle-aged; plump and obese. A handful of thin men and
women were in the mix, grooving to hip-hop, reggae and R&amp;B. Men were
dressed casually in button-down shirts and slacks or jeans; women
flaunted their bodies in mini-skirts and halters, fitted jeans and
sheer tops.</TE>
<TE>   Among the men was Alex Davtian, a stocky 29-year-old, who prefers
to go to Club Curves alone than to accompany his buddies to clubs
like Century Club in Century City or the downtown Stock Exchange that
he considers meat markets. "My friends will go to those kinds of
clubs and then they call me at 2 a.m. to see if I want to meet them
at Denny's because they didn't meet anyone, they didn't dance or talk
to anyone," he says. "Why would I go out with them? For somebody to
give me a wrong number or not even talk to me? I feel accepted here.
You don't get any attitude from anybody, and from the second you walk
in, you feel welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Before Club Curves, plus-size men and women in the Southern
California relied on groups, such as the Big Difference, for social
gatherings. Some of those groups were inspired by the networking
events and conventions of the National Assn. to Advance Fat
Acceptance, which formed in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Lynn, founder of the monthly Big Difference parties, likes
to say she "makes a big difference in the thin capital of the world."
At 400 pounds, Lynn, of Lake Forest, says she has dedicated herself
to helping other women break down social barriers. During the last 10
years, her organization has witnessed substantial trends.</TE>
<TE>   The fashion industry, for example, is paying attention to
plus-size shoppers. Recognizing that more than half of all U.S. women
wear size 14 or larger, designers such as Liz Claiborne, Tommy
Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren have quietly created plus-size lines.
SizeAppeal, an online retailer, offers clothing that mimics the feel
of that found at stores such as Rampage, but the sizes are plus.</TE>
<TE>   "The fashion industry has been dragged kicking and screaming into
this market," says Smith, who wears a size 32. "Mainstream designers
are jumping into this market, but there's a hypocrisy to it because
they don't advertise it. But they realize this is the only part of
that market which is growing."</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurs such as Michele Varon of Abundance boutiques in
Sherman Oaks and Beverly Hills have opened shops out of their own
desire to find sexy, designer clothing in the plus sizes. Her stores
carry moderately priced to high-end apparel, and include everything
from jeans to ball gowns with designers such as Steel Pony, Tadashi,
Coco &amp; Juan.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all heard the stories of the big woman who goes shopping at
the market and somebody pulls things out of her cart and yells no!"
says Lynn, 40. "I do see changes taking place. Even men are more
comfortable with their preferences now. The more we get out there,
the better things will get."</TE>
<TE>   For Club Curves' Wilson, 32, confidence was never an issue, even
during adolescence, when teenagers strive to be accepted. A former
administrator for the city of Los Angeles, Wilson says she was never
aware of discrimination against plus-size women until she became
friends with Gray and they began discussing going into business
together.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a part of this has really opened my eyes," says Wilson, a
size 26. "I've always worn the short skirts and the small tops and
been fine with flaunting my sensuality. I've always felt good about
who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Although Wilson and Gray are emphatic that they do not promote
being overweight or obese, "what we're saying is, if you are fat, we
want society to say it's OK for you to go out and dance too," Gray
says. The partners regularly hear from critics who accuse them of
contributing to the nation's obesity epidemic by providing a social
outlet for overweight people.</TE>
<TE>   "When people tell me they can't support us because we are
encouraging women to be big, I always ask them, 'Do you think they
should just stay home?' " Gray says. "Can you think of a better way
to get healthy than to go out with friends and dance and laugh for
four hours? What better way for these women to become part of society
and be encouraged to be healthier?"</TE>
<TE>   For some of Club Curves' most loyal clients, it's still not easy
to find that comfort zone. Instead of dancing or mingling on a recent
Friday night, some women chose to sit on the sidelines, watching the
high-energy party develop around them.</TE>
<TE>   But then there are clients like Davtian, who has yet to persuade
his friends to join him at the club that opened his heart to a simple
truth: "For some men, to date a big girl is not acceptable. But I
tell them to come with an open mind. It's what is inside that
counts."</TE>

<HD>Southwest's safe now, but can it be made great?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A certain relief accompanies Wednesday's news that the Southwest
Museum will merge with the Autry Museum of Western Heritage. But it's
relief that must be tempered with caution.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, the Southwest has struggled in a slow-motion effort
to keep its head above water amid a rising tide of real and potential
disaster for its great collection of Native American art and
artifacts. Inadequate display and storage facilities, employee theft
from the collection, shoddy record-keeping, daunting conservation
needs, a chronic lack of funding and an incompetent board were among
the Himalayan-size hurdles faced by L.A.'s oldest museum.</LD>
<LD>   The Northridge earthquake didn't help either. The temblor created
expensive seismic problems for the Southwest's landmark 1914 building
at the edge of Mount Washington, an issue that remains unresolved.</LD>
<TE>   The holdings of the Southwest, founded in 1907, occupy a top tier
nationally, with hundreds of thousands of baskets, blankets and other
culturally important items, which date from the 18th to the 20th
century. As executive director Duane King once put it, the Southwest
is a great collection, but it has never been a great museum. Now,
with money from the wealthy Autry -- endowment: $100 million -- it
might have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Under existing management, the Southwest had no chance. A shocking
draft of a confidential study commissioned by the museum last year
and obtained recently by The Times paints a blistering picture of
ineffectual, disengaged trustees whose fiscal oversight has been
"well out of the mainstream of how other museums conduct their
financial affairs." The board, except for a few unidentified members,
is further described as unwilling "to provide their own financial
commitment to the museum."</TE>
<TE>   The report was compiled by attorney Daniel N. Belin, former board
president of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and funded by a
$60,000 grant from the Getty Trust. The draft shows how the negative
reputation of the Southwest's board made it even harder to find a
partnership solution for its escalating crisis. Potential suitors,
including the Huntington Library in San Marino and the Heard Museum
in Phoenix, expressed huge enthusiasm for the collection, but they
would only consider options if the Southwest and its board were
dissolved.</TE>
<TE>   Even the eager Autry made no secret of its skepticism. The draft
report says it proposed creation of a special umbrella committee to
oversee financial operations of any joint venture -- with four
members appointed by the Southwest and five by the Autry, assuring
its control. The numbers shifted further in this week's merger
announcement to three from the Southwest and six to nine from the
Autry.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question," the draft bluntly declares, "the Southwest
Museum's board of trustees has lost credibility in the community."
One might reasonably ask how such a board might then be entrusted to
make a credible decision to partner with any institution, including
the Autry.</TE>
<TE>   I've made no secret in the past of my reservations about the
Griffith Park museum as a partner for the Southwest. Welcome,
positive efforts have been made to broaden the scope of its
conception of "the West" and elevate the seriousness of its programs,
such as its April merger with a Denver-based research project that
studies women in the West. But its record is both modest and young.
Merger with the Southwest instantly gives the Autry a stellar
collection, but there is still a long row to hoe.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Autry must find ways to erase its patronizing image
among many Native Americans. L.A. is home to the largest urban Indian
population in the nation, some of whom derisively refer to the late
singing cowboy's museum as "the fort." When partnership talks
collapsed last fall between the Southwest and the Pechanga band of
Luiseno Indians, an unprecedented opportunity was lost for Native
Americans to become major philanthropic caretakers of their own
patrimony. The Autry needs to rekindle that flame.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the Southwest currently occupies an aging but historic
site -- a place where, for example, Jackson Pollock hung out as a
19-year-old aspiring artist, wandering over from his house on nearby
Montecito Drive in 1931. It cannot be abandoned. Soon there will be a
Gold Line Metro stop at its front door, so maximizing its incredible
public potential is essential.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, any plan to build an exhibition center for the Southwest
adjacent to the Autry faces big obstacles. Earlier building projects
at the site have drawn fire from neighbors and the Sierra Club.
However those public land-use issues are resolved, anything less than
architecture whose quality matches the greatness of the Southwest's
collection would be an affront. The Autry's phony Mission-style
building is theme-park design of the worst sort. Putting up another
glorified Taco Bell would only add insult to injury.</TE>
<TE>   So the news is decidedly mixed. A great collection now seems
secure, but a great museum is still a long way off.</TE>

<LD>California's job market showed no improvement in November, posting a
net loss of 10,500 positions, most of them in the slumping
manufacturing sector, the Employment Development Department reported
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A separate survey of households showed that the state's jobless
rate fell to 6.4% in November from a revised 6.5% in October.</LD>
<LD>   But economists put more stock in the payroll survey, which is
considered a better barometer of the job market.</LD>
<TE>   In the last year, the state's employers have added a paltry 2,800
net new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say weak earnings, war jitters and continuing gains in
productivity give employers little incentive to beef up their
payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still skipping along the bottom," said economist Lisa
Grobar, director of the Cal State Long Beach Economic Forecast
Project.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the unemployment rate in California stood at 6.1%. The
pre-recession low of 4.7% came in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the rise in unemployment is mild compared with what
occurred during previous downturns. But the concentration of job
losses in the Bay Area this time around is having far-reaching
effects on the state's economy.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in high-paying technology jobs has left California
much worse off in terms of income than the rest of the country and is
a big reason the state faces a $20-billion-plus budget deficit. From
its peak of 5.7 million jobs in early 2001, U.S. technology
employment has plunged by more than half a million -- one in five of
them in California.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest-hit area has been Santa Clara County, the heart of
Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Nonfarm payroll employment in the county declined by 2,700 jobs
last month, with most of the losses coming in high-tech
manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   The county has lost more than 110,000 jobs since its employment
peaked in December 2000. The November unemployment rate in Santa
Clara County was 7.8%, down from its most recent high of 8.1% in
October but up sharply from its pre-recession low of 1.3% in December
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology sector continues to be a drag on the California
economy," said Michael Bernick, director of the EDD.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has been a bulwark of stability in comparison.
Although growth has slowed markedly since the height of the economic
boom, the five-county region that consists of Los Angeles, Orange,
Ventura, San Bernardino and Riverside counties has managed to eke out
a 0.1% gain in nonfarm payroll jobs in the last year, according to
state data.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some economists predict that the figure will be revised
downward when the EDD completes its annual "benchmark" revision in
February. The yearly revision uses the latest available data from tax
records to update the previous year's employment figures.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to see that the recession was deeper than we
thought" in terms of job losses, said Esmael Adibi, director of the
Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in
Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Only three of the state's industry sectors -- government, mining,
and insurance and real estate -- posted job gains during November.</TE>
<TE>   The losers were led by the manufacturing sector, which shed 9,700
jobs. The state's factories have pared jobs in all but one of the
last 22 months, and manufacturing employment is down 63,100 since
November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County unemployment rate dropped to 6% in November
from a revised 6.2% in October.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's unemployment rate dipped to 3.9% in November from
4.1% in October.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inland Empire, Riverside County's rate dropped to 6.1% from
6.6%, and San Bernardino's eased to 5.4% from 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's jobless rate rose to 5.7% in November from 5.5%
the month before.</TE>

<HD>Coca-Cola to Stop Giving Forecasts</HD>
<DH>The firm calls quarterly profit projections a hindrance.
Corporate reformers hope for a trend, but critics warn of stock price
swings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co. vowed Friday to stop making quarterly profit forecasts,
calling Wall Street's preoccupation with near-term results a
distraction from long-term planning.</LD>
<LD>   Giving short-term guidance to analysts "prevents a more meaningful
focus on the strategic initiatives," said Douglas Daft, chief
executive of the Atlanta-based soft drink giant.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of other corporations already have ceased making earnings
projections.</LD>
<TE>   Some money managers questioned the need for Coke's move, saying it
could make the company's share price unstable.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate reform advocates said they hope the action sparks a
trend similar to the expensing of stock option costs. Coke was among
the first big companies promising to take that step in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporations ought to be in the business of making things, not
counting things," said John Bogle, founder of mutual fund company
Vanguard Group Inc. in Valley Forge, Pa., and a longtime critic of
quarterly earnings guidance.</TE>
<TE>   Investors offered a muted reaction to Coke's announcement. Its
shares slid 2 cents to $45.85 on the New York Stock Exchange after
Coke offered what it said would be its final earnings estimate,
reaffirming profit projections for this year and next. The stock
plunged 10% on Oct. 16 after the company trimmed its forecast, citing
disappointing Latin America sales.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle said companies obsessed with "beating their numbers" can be
tempted to make ill-advised decisions, such as a quick asset sale, or
use overly aggressive accounting techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Others agreed. "The concept of not giving quarterly guidance
anymore is actually a helpful thing," said Bill Nygren, manager of
the Oakmark mutual fund in Chicago, which does not own Coke shares.
"Quarterly guidance is part of the cycle that has focused so much
investor attention on the short term."</TE>
<TE>   Some portfolio managers, however, asserted that strategic planning
and short-term projections are not mutually exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies that have strong internal controls tend to have a good
sense of where the business is heading, and I don't see the harm in
sharing that information," said Larry Puglia, manager of the T. Rowe
Price Blue Chip Growth fund in Baltimore and a Coke stockholder.</TE>
<TE>   Some also warned that maintaining "secrecy" as to where profits
are going could make stocks such as Coke more susceptible to big
swings. "If you save up surprises until the earnings announcement,
that's going to add to the volatility," said Chuck Hill, research
director at Boston-based earnings tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Hill said that if Coke follows the example of chip
maker Intel Corp. and provides enough "tools" for analysts to make
accurate estimates, investors will be well-served. Intel does not
"spoon-feed" analysts an estimate, Hill said, but it provides
guidance about research spending, marketing costs, tax rates and
other items that affect the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Warren Buffett, a Coke director and shareholder, is
being seen on Wall Street as the driving force behind the change,
just as he was in the recent options accounting shift. A Buffett
representative didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   After Coke announced this year that it would expense options --
giving shareholders a more accurate picture of its compensation costs
-- nearly 70 other major corporations followed suit. But it remains
to be seen whether the same thing will happen when it comes to ending
quarterly earnings guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies are reasonably comfortable with their disclosure
practices," Puglia said, noting that many put in safeguards after Reg
FD, the Securities and Exchange Commission ban on selective
disclosure, was passed two years ago. "I'm not sure Coke will be
broadly influential."</TE>
<TE>   But Bogle said he suspects Buffett is leaning on other corporate
leaders. Buffett's investment arm, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is among
dozens of U.S. companies that offer no quarterly guidance, and
Gillette Co., the consumer products giant in which he also owns a
major stake, stopped giving such estimates two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If companies like General Electric Co. and Citigroup Inc. follow
suit, you could start to get a wave," Bogle said.</TE>

<HD>Computer Sciences to Buy DynCorp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer Sciences Corp. on Friday announced plans to acquire DynCorp
in a $677-million deal aimed at expanding its ability to benefit from
the federal government's fight against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In acquiring DynCorp, a private company that provides information
and security systems to government agencies, El Segundo-based CSC
would add $2.3 billion to its annual revenue, for a total of $13.7
billion. Government contracting would make up 40% of that total, up
from about 30% now.</LD>
<LD>   The deal comes as the federal government increases technology
spending to support the fledgling Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<TE>   "With this transaction, we are seizing an opportunity to
significantly strengthen our leadership position in the U.S. federal
marketplace," said CSC Chairman and Chief Executive Van B. Honeycutt.</TE>
<TE>   The deal calls for CSC to pay $15 in cash and $43 in stock for
each share of Reston, Va.-based DynCorp and to assume about $273
million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   CSC shares fell $1.76 to $32.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   CSC said it expects the transaction, subject to approval by
shareholders and regulators, to be completed in the first quarter of
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the acquisition would contribute to its earnings
for the fiscal year ending March 2004, excluding the effect of a
special charge related to the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen McClellan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, said the acquisition would give CSC a solid presence in
security and anti-terrorism work. CSC specializes in information
technology services and consulting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they got a good chunk of federal business for a cheap
price, and it's a healthy market these days," compared with a
stagnant market in the private sector, McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition adds the State, Justice and Energy departments to
CSC's roster of clients and expands its presence abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McClellan said, government security contracting may prove a
tough business in the long run because profit margins tend to be
lower than in the commercial sector.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the DynCorp purchase is "a plus, but not a big plus,"
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   CSC plans to combine DynCorp's operations with its Federal Sector
unit, which is based in Falls Church, Va., and employs about 15,000
people. Honeycutt said an unspecified number of jobs would be cut
after the acquisition. The two companies employ about 88,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks reasonable, but Mr. Honeycutt should have a detailed
plan to integrate the companies quickly," portfolio manager Matt
Kaufler told Bloomberg News. He helps direct about $1.7 billion at
Clover Capital Management, which owns 215,000 Computer Sciences
shares. "They should be able to wring some cost efficiency out of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Paul V. Lombardi, president and chief executive of DynCorp, said
his company began looking for a merger partner because of
consolidation in the defense industry and the difficulty in competing
for government contracts that require more comprehensive packages of
services.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a high-stakes game, and being a private company, we got the
point that even though we're very large, we couldn't grow," Lombardi
said. "We didn't have the market cap to do it."</TE>
<TE>   DynCorp's work for the State Department includes the installation
and maintenance of physical security systems at U.S. embassies.</TE>
<TE>   DynCorp also runs the federal government's emergency telephone
system, which it is converting from a land-line to a wireless system.
It handles the administration of a pecking order that allows
higher-level officials to access phone lines when circuits are busy
for others.</TE>
<TE>   DynCorp was founded in 1946 as an aircraft maintenance company and
shifted the bulk of its business to government contracting about 10
years ago. The company maintains all of the White House's aircraft
except Air Force One.</TE>
<TE>   A combined CSC-DynCorp, Lombardi said, would create the kind of
heft needed to compete for contracts as the White House moves toward
outsourcing more government work.</TE>

<HD>Economic Advisors or Policy Salesmen</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In naming Stephen Friedman to a key post Thursday, President Bush
finished a clean sweep of his bumbling economic team. The question
now is: Will it matter?</LD>
<LD>   The early signals are unpromising, and that's bad for the
administration, the economy and the country.</LD>
<LD>   Conservative activists gloat that they exacted a pound of flesh
for Friedman's appointment, as well as for Bush's choice of rail
executive John W. Snow to replace Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury
secretary.</LD>
<TE>   They say such administration heavies as political advisor Karl
Rove were forced to assure them that both men, but especially
Friedman, will put aside past worries about budget deficits and
fiscal probity in favor of the White House's tax-cutting,
"pro-growth, pro-jobs" agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us [Friedman] will be a solid salesman for supply-side
policies," said Stephen Moore, who heads the conservative political
action committee Club for Growth and spearheaded an anti-Friedman
drive.</TE>
<TE>   But if Friedman and Snow make salesmanship Job 1, at the expense
of serious policy debate, the president will have a big problem. In
fact, the Bush administration would become the first in the
post-World War II era without at least one strong, independent voice
on economics.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be historically unprecedented and very troubling," said
Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the height of the supply-side frenzy in the early 1980s,
President Reagan had in-house critics such as Council of Economic
Advisers Chairman Martin Feldstein and such powers in their own right
as first-term Chief of Staff James A. Baker III and Treasury
Secretary Donald T. Regan.</TE>
<TE>   There would be another difficulty as well if Friedman and Snow
were solely salesmen: They would be selling proposals they had no
hand in designing, an arrangement that people with long Washington
experience say is simply unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   It would reduce the pair to being "stiff-necked ambassadors, more
worried about making a misstep" than about engaging in the
give-and-take that produces policy, said Robert Z. Lawrence, a
Harvard economist and Clinton-era CEA member.</TE>
<TE>   If the advisor-as-salesman arrangement is bad for the
administration, it could prove worse for the economy. That's because
with economic conditions so uncertain, White House fiscal policies
may have to be more than just politically appealing or ideologically
correct; they may actually have to work.</TE>
<TE>   In coming up with such policies, the administration could use some
frank advice from Friedman and Snow. The extent to which the country
must now rely on the administration to prop up growth was driven home
with this week's release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's
November policymaking meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The minutes show that Fed officials took one of the last steps
available to them -- a half-point reduction in their signal-sending
interest rate to 1.25% -- in part to avert the danger of deflation, a
general decline in prices that the country has not experienced since
the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   "We got so enamored of [Fed Chairman Alan] Greenspan and monetary
policy, that's all we used the last few years," said James W.
Paulsen, chief investment officer with Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis. "Now that they've got only a few fractional cuts left,
we've got to depend on fiscal policy" -- the kind of tax and spending
plans that are up to the White House and Congress to devise.</TE>
<TE>   The president already may have made a fundamental -- and
potentially damaging -- decision before naming Friedman and Snow. In
the immediate aftermath of the Republican victory in the November
midterm elections, he declared that the administration's first
priority would be making last year's $1.35-trillion tax cuts, now due
to expire after 2010, permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Given the definitiveness of Bush's statement and the spectacular
fallout that resulted when his father, former President Bush,
reversed himself after pledging "no new taxes," the administration
appears to have boxed itself in on the tax issue.</TE>
<TE>   But making the 2001 cuts permanent will cost Washington hundreds
of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue in the future, without,
according to most analysts, doing anything to help the economy now.</TE>
<TE>   "All it does is balloon the deficits in the out years," said Hank
Gutman, a partner in accounting giant KPMG's Washington tax practice.</TE>
<TE>   Where Friedman and Snow could make a difference is in advancing
the administration's case -- then cutting a deal -- in what is
shaping up to be a battle between White House-sponsored supply-side
tax cuts for investors and businesses and Democratic proposals to
temporarily help lower- and middle-income Americans and cash-strapped
states.</TE>
<TE>   Among the strengths of the Bush White House are political
discipline and unswerving loyalty to the president. Both were on
exhibit in recent weeks as aides protected Bush by giving no hint of
his plans to replace O'Neill and longtime economic advisor Lawrence
B. Lindsey.</TE>
<TE>   But loyalty can go too far.</TE>
<TE>   "Loyalty does not mean slavishly following the party line if it's
not good for the country or the president," said former Rep. Bill
Frenzel (R-Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and Snow "are going to be loyal to the president,"
Frenzel said. "But they have got enough good sense and guts to tell
him when he's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   We had better hope so.</TE>

<HD>Interest Fizzles in All-Electric</HD>
<DH>Carmakers instead are pushing hybrids, and the state may
again ease its zero-emission mandate</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The auto industry is pulling the plug on the all-electric car.</LD>
<LD>   The present generation of battery-powered electric vehicles, with
their limited driving range of about 120 miles before needing a
recharge, have lost favor among automakers and regulators. In turn,
the dream of a California highway system buzzing with clean electric
cars has been put on indefinite hold.</LD>
<LD>   Just this week at the electric-vehicle trade association's annual
convention in Hollywood, Fla., carmakers instead were touting hybrid
gas-electric vehicles, already sold by Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda
Motor Co., as the best answer for the environment.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles -- the next big technology
dream -- still are decades away from mass production.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus now is on hybrid electric cars and then fuel cells,"
said Mike Schwartz, director of Ford Motor Co.'s Sustainable Mobility
Technologies unit. "Hybrids are the interim step that let us use
advanced technologies that will be essential for fuel cells when we
finally get there."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, General Motors Corp. began bailing out of its
$1-billion experiment with its futuristic two-seat EV-1 electric car,
calling it a dismal failure.</TE>
<TE>   Though all 950 of GM's electric models made from 1996 to 1999 were
leased and there still is a waiting list, the company said the
program was not economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago GM began reclaiming EV-1 vehicles as leases
expired, and the last one will be off California roads by August
2004.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Ford ended its Think electric car project in the
summer because it could not find a market for the two- and four-seat
autos.</TE>
<TE>   Even the trade group for all-electric cars is shifting gears. On
Wednesday, the Electric Vehicle Assn. of the Americas was
re-christened the Electric Drive Transportation Assn. The new name
better reflects its mission "of advocating all types of electric
transportation technology," said Co-Chairman John Wallace, a former
Ford executive who ran the Think car unit.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the industry, Wallace said the future is in the
hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   This technology, now being tested in a few cars in California by
Honda and Toyota, relies on a complicated electrochemical process to
produce electricity from hydrogen cells on board the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   But it will take a long time for the auto industry to perfect fuel
cells and develop the hydrogen fuel infrastructure needed to make
them usable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a generational pursuit," Wallace said. "It will be our
children who make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, the California Air Resources Board is preparing
once again to revise the zero-pollution-emission vehicle mandate that
triggered the electric car movement more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its severe air quality problems, California is the only
state allowed to set up emission requirements that are tougher than
those of the federal government. California's pollution rules, in
turn, often force automakers to adopt expensive technologies.</TE>
<TE>   But bowing to economic arguments raised by the auto industry, the
California air board has repeatedly reduced the scope of its Zero
Emission Vehicle Mandate. Years ago, the air board ordered that 4% of
all vehicles sold in California must be zero-emission polluters by
the 2003 model year.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the board reduced that number to 2% and changed the target
date to 2005. Now, the board is considering a proposal from its staff
to cut the required sales figure to just 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers already get credit for a variety of advanced-technology
and ultra-low-emission vehicles they sell, including low-speed,
golf-cart-like contraptions that are limited to 25 miles an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, this means that no new zero-emission vehicles would
have to be introduced until 2007, though the auto industry wants to
do away with the mandate altogether.</TE>
<TE>   As this battle is played out, automakers are counting on hybrid
gas-electric vehicles -- the Toyota Prius, Honda Civic Hybrid and the
forthcoming Ford Focus Hybrid sport utility -- to deflect criticism
of their environmental policies.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota and Honda expect to sell about 25,000 of these hybrid cars
this year and about 44,000 next year. But in California, where 16
million new passenger cars and trucks are sold annually, these
hybrids still account for well under 1% of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's Prius model sells for about $20,000. The company says it
is making a small profit on the car, although others in the industry
believe Toyota is selling it at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrid engines switch from electric- to gas-powered to consume
less gasoline. In Toyota's system, the car runs in all-electric mode
until it hits 20 mph, when the gas engine takes over. The electric
motor also assists the small four-cylinder gas engine when power is
needed for passing or climbing hills.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's hybrid system uses the four-cylinder gas engine all of the
time, with the electric motor providing additional power on demand.</TE>
<TE>   Both vehicles get close to 50 miles a gallon and are rated as
super-low-emission vehicles in California.</TE>
<TE>   They are not zero-emission vehicles, however. And Tim Carmichael,
executive director of the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air,
says that's frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a steady erosion of the ZEV program, and our biggest
fear now is that the Air Resources Board will try to fix it again to
address automakers' concerns," Carmichael said.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, "we'll be left with a program that doesn't
effectively provide incentives for them to do anything."</TE>

<LD>In the latest sign that Wall Street is losing confidence in the video
game industry's ability to continue double-digit growth, a Goldman
Sachs analyst on Friday downgraded three of the largest publishers
and sparked a sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   Citing disappointing November sales growth, Chris DiBiase
downgraded Electronic Arts Inc., THQ Inc. and Activision Inc. to
"underperform" from "in-line." All three companies declined to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of video games grew 7.3% last month compared with November
2001, when Nintendo Co. launched its GameCube console and Microsoft
Corp. released the Xbox. Many analysts had predicted as much as 28%
growth for the month.</LD>
<TE>   The downgrade sparked a sector-wide sell-off. Shares of Electronic
Arts, the world's largest publisher of games, fell $4.65, or 8%, to
$56.70, resulting in a $417-million loss in market value. Activision
shares retreated $1.37, or 8%, to $15.45. And THQ slipped 29 cents,
or 2%, to $14.34. All three companies trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Firms not mentioned by Goldman Sachs also lost ground. Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc. fell nearly 10% to $23.36, and Midway Games
lost 12% to $5.02.</TE>
<TE>   DiBiase wrote in a report to investors that his action was based
on signs that the video game industry may be maturing and that sales
may be peaking earlier than expected. In expressing doubt about the
industry, DiBiase joined UBS Warburg analyst Michael Wallace, who
downgraded four game stocks Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Their pessimism comes even as the industry expects to reap record
sales of $12 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Wall Street analysts have been more cautious in recent
months as their profession faces increasing scrutiny by investors and
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Not all analysts share the negative outlook for the game industry.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Pachter, director of research at Wedbush Morgan Securities
in Los Angeles, vehemently disagreed with DiBiase's assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's sales of $713 million compared relatively poorly with
November 2001, but that number was an anomaly because there were six
fewer shopping days after Thanksgiving this year, Pachter said. In
addition, last year's results were fueled by the launch of the Xbox
and GameCube, many of which came bundled with games.</TE>
<TE>   "Our retail sources tell us that sales for the fourth week of
November and the first two weeks of December are back up by 20%
compared to last year," Pachter said. "We remain confident there will
be growth in December in the range of 20%."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts recorded
$210.3 million in retail sales of console games, up 34% from a year
earlier. Activision, based in Santa Monica, posted $75.9 million in
sales, down 16% from last year, and THQ in Calabasas sold $72.9
million in console games, up 16%.</TE>

<HD>Gap CEO Weighing Brand Licensing, New Marketing</HD>
<DH>Pressler tells analysts he wants to bring 'more theater' to
stores and study customers more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months after taking the helm, Gap Inc. Chief Executive Paul
Pressler is considering licensing the brand internationally and
starting new labels under which to sell apparel, according to an
analyst's report released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler, who has declined media interviews, also told retail
analysts that Gap is looking at ways to market its products better to
customers, including by interacting more with shoppers in Gap stores.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler believes that Gap's customers have an "emotional
connection" to the brand but that the stores need "more theater,"
analyst Joseph Teklits of Wachovia Securities said in his report. Gap
wants to understand its customers' "emotional insights" and will
communicate with them via exit surveys and other means. The company
also believes that it can improve by profiling customers according to
lifestyle and geography, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Gap recently hired advertising agency Leo Burnett USA to evaluate
the "emotional attributes" of Gap's brands.</TE>
<TE>   "In an increasingly dynamic marketplace, Mr. Pressler acknowledges
the need to monitor and carefully listen to its customers," analyst
Jennifer Black, with Wells Fargo Securities, said in another report
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Stores also need to improve selling strategies, such as getting
customers to try on items, which quadruples the likelihood they will
make the purchase, Teklits' report said.</TE>
<TE>   The discussions with investors and analysts were informal and did
not reflect any strategic shift for the San Francisco retailer,
spokesman Alan Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our clear focus now is on our current businesses -- Gap, Banana
Republic and Old Navy -- and continuing the turnaround of those
businesses and restoring" comparable-store growth in those
businesses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the firm has been trying some new initiatives. After
testing the sale of maternity clothes on Web sites and in a few
stores, Gap and Banana Republic will sell maternity clothes in more
stores next year, Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's stock closed Friday down 15 cents at $15.70 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Key Indexes Drop for a Second Week</HD>
<DH>The sell-off continues as investors remain skeptical about
an economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks on Friday ended the week as they began, with a sharp sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   Investors were concerned that a government report showing a drop
in wholesale prices in November could fan worries about deflation.</LD>
<LD>   The news hammered the dollar and took stocks down as well.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials slid 104.69 points, or 1.2%, to 8,433.71, and
dropped 2.5% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite slumped 37.13 points, or 2.7%, to 1,362.42,
and was down 4.2% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second weekly decline for key indexes, after the strong
rally that lifted stocks from five-year lows in October.</TE>
<TE>   The government said wholesale prices as measured by the producer
price index fell 0.4% in November.</TE>
<TE>   Falling wholesale prices -- assuming they show up in lower retail
prices -- are one of the few benefits for consumers during a weak
economy. But businesses whose product prices are declining can feel
even more pressure on already strained profit margins, analysts
noted.</TE>
<TE>   The report overshadowed the University of Michigan's report that
its closely watched U.S. consumer confidence index rose in the early
part of this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic data, you can say, has been mixed. You don't get the
feeling that it is positive" on balance, said Barry Berman, head
trader for Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   With many investors concerned that a war with Iraq is inevitable,
the strength that usually marks stock trading in December has been
missing this year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors appeared to show an aversion to U.S. assets
Friday: The dollar fell to its weakest level in almost three years
against the euro and also dropped against the yen.</TE>
<TE>   The euro ended at $1.02 in New York, up from 99.7 cents two weeks
ago. The dollar ended at 120.47 yen, down from 124.45 two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   But European stock markets were weak as well. The German market
slid 1.1% and the Dutch market lost 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Big-name U.S. stocks closing lower included Microsoft, down $1.67
to $52.50; Target, down $1.73 to $30.97; and General Motors, down 92
cents to $36.52.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, Cirrus Logic tumbled $1.18 to $3.08. The chip
maker said sales this quarter would be below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Some worried investors continued to turn to gold. Near-term gold
futures prices in New York surged $6.60 on Thursday and continued the
advance on Friday, rising $1.80 to $333.20 an ounce, a five-year
high.</TE>
<TE>   That bolstered gold mining stocks. ASA jumped $2.15 to $39.30,
Newmont Mining gained 89 cents to $29 and Placer Dome was up 39 cents
to $11.36.</TE>
<TE>   In other commodity trading, crude oil futures rose to an
eight-week high as a nationwide strike aimed at ousting Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez limited shipments to refineries from the
world's fifth-biggest oil exporter.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is "deeply concerned" about the deteriorating situation
in Venezuela, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, oil futures rose 43 cents to $28.44 a barrel. Natural
gas futures also rallied anew, hitting a 20-month high, on fears that
gas supplies are being drawn down at a rapid pace because of cold
weather.</TE>
<TE>   Most energy stocks, however, failed to get a lift from the gains
in oil and gas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man filed a class-action lawsuit Friday against
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., accusing the company of cheating film buffs
who buy the widescreen versions of the studio's DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint by Warren Eallonardo, an aspiring screenwriter,
alleges that MGM, video rental giant Blockbuster Inc. and four
retailers misled consumers by selling widescreen DVDs that presented
significantly less of the picture than was shown in theaters. Instead
of using the conventional letterbox format, which shrinks a film to
fit the width of a TV, the complaint accuses MGM of cropping all
sides of at least five films into a bogus letterbox format.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for MGM, Blockbuster and the other defendants were
either unavailable or declined to comment because they had not seen
the lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint, which was filed by law firm Wasserman, Comden,
Casselman &amp; Pearson of Tarzana, seeks refunds and punitive damages
for any consumers who bought widescreen DVDs from MGM over the last
four years.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nasdaq Stock Market Chairman and Chief Executive Hardwick Simmons
plans to leave the second-largest U.S. stock market when his
three-year contract expires at the end of 2003, Nasdaq said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The market said it will start looking for a successor in the
second quarter of next year. Once a replacement is named, Simmons,
61, will become non-executive chairman until the end of his contract,
Nasdaq said.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Post reported Friday that Nasdaq's board would ask
for Simmons' resignation.</LD>
<TE>   Nasdaq spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said, "The statement speaks for
itself," and declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq's image has suffered over the last two years with the
collapse of many technology shares. The company repeatedly has
delayed plans to go public.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of Nasdaq's troubles are external to management," Georgetown
University finance professor James Angel said. "The best manager in
the world couldn't have prevented a fall in the [market] as a result
of the Internet bubble" bursting.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, who had headed Prudential Securities Inc., replaced Frank
Zarb in February 2001 at Nasdaq's helm.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said in October that Nasdaq was again postponing plans to
launch an initial public offering of its stock until the second
quarter of next year at the earliest.</TE>

<HD>Studios Ask Court to Block Film Sanitizers</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight major studios filed copyright and trademark infringement claims
against CleanFlicks and other companies that edit Hollywood films for
content they deem offensive.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood companies asked a federal court in Denver to block
the film sanitizers from continuing their activities and to pay for
studio legal costs. The studios didn't ask for monetary damages,
however.</LD>
<LD>   The action bolsters the Directors Guild of America, which has been
seeking studio backing in an ongoing legal fight with those who clean
up movies by altering or masking their content.</LD>
<TE>   The film sanitizers contend that they don't violate copyright laws
because some buy a new copy of a film when they alter a DVD or tape
and others only provide software that lets viewers change or mask
offensive features.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A probe of Qwest Communications International Inc. was closed by a
House panel after it found no evidence to link founder Philip
Anschutz to an accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators' interview with Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's former
chief executive, produced no evidence that Anschutz helped Qwest
overstate revenue, a committee spokesman said. Anschutz has said he
had only a ceremonial role at Qwest, the fourth-biggest U.S.
local-telephone company.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest's revenue overstatement resulted partly from its swapping of
fiber-optic network capacity with Global Crossing Ltd. The Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating both companies' accounting.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Denver-based Qwest fell 11 cents, or 2.5%, to $4.28 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Seminis to Be Acquired in $650-Million Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard-based Seminis Inc., the world's largest seller of commercial
fruit and vegetable seeds, said Friday that it would be bought out
and taken private by units of Mexican agricultural firm Savia and San
Francisco-based Fox Paine &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   Seminis, which is traded on Nasdaq, said the deal was valued at
$650 million in stock and debt, but did not specify details.</LD>
<LD>   Fox Paine would invest $222 million as part of the deal, said Andy
Brimmer, an outside spokesman for the private equity firm. Savia
would exchange its Seminis Class C preferred shares for Seminis
common shares. Seminis shares then would be acquired for $3.40 each
in cash, a 35% premium over their closing price of $2.51 on Friday,
down 4 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Alfonso Romo Garza, who chairs both Seminis and Monterrey,
Mexico-based Savia, would remain as chairman and chief executive of
Seminis, the company said. Dexter Paine, president of Fox Paine,
would become vice chairman of Seminis.</TE>
<TE>   Seminis, founded in 1994 with the acquisition of the Asgrow seed
business from Upjohn Co., sells both hybrid and genetically
engineered fruit and vegetable seeds to commercial growers and
wholesalers in 150 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Although it reported sales of $449.9 million last year -- about
20% of all world sales of fruit and vegetable seeds -- it lost $134.5
million because of restructuring costs and write-downs. For the
fiscal third quarter ended June 28, the company reported earnings of
$4.3 million on sales of $106.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Savia, which is part of a larger Mexican conglomerate, lost $264.9
million on sales of $690.4 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very excited by the prospect of participating in the
future growth of Seminis," Paine said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firm, State Complete Settlement</HD>
<DH>Williams Cos. agrees to trim up to $1.4 billion off a
$4.3-billion electricity contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer decided Friday to complete a
settlement that calls for the state to drop price-gouging lawsuits
against Williams Cos. in exchange for concessions on long-term
electricity contracts valued at more than $1.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative agreement was threatened after disclosures last
month that Williams may have conspired with AES Corp. to cut power
supplies to California in early 2000.</LD>
<LD>   But after lawyers from Lockyer's office made three trips to
Williams' Tulsa, Okla., headquarters to conduct interviews with 45
Williams employees and review 300 boxes of documents, "we came out of
our due-diligence period still feeling comfortable with the
agreement," Lockyer spokesman Tom Dresslar said.</LD>
<TE>   Williams spokeswoman Julie Gentz said concluding the settlement
was "a significant milestone for the company."</TE>
<TE>   Williams will shave as much as $1.4 billion off a $4.3-billion
contract to supply electricity to California and will provide more
than $400 million in other concessions.</TE>
<TE>   The state will drop its civil lawsuits against Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The AES-Williams matter, involving taped conversations between
traders cutting deals to shut down one power plant and to prolong
maintenance on another, was investigated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. Williams settled the inquiry without admitting
wrongdoing by agreeing to pay $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The stock prices of most major power suppliers to California rose
after a decision Thursday by a FERC judge that California utilities
owe generators $1.2 billion after accounting for $1.8 billion in
refunds that generators owe utilities.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Williams gained 48 cents to $2.82
and AES rose 4 cents to $3.25. Among other firms, Reliant Resources
Inc. jumped 50 cents to $2.75; Dynegy Inc. added 15 cents to $1.05.</TE>

<AU>Rebecca Constantino</AU>
<BD>Rebecca Constantino is the founder and executive
director of a nonprofit that works with school libraries. County
regulations do not allow foster children to be named; Aisha is a
pseudonym.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are 568,000 foster children in the United States. There are
more than 110,000 in California and close to 40,000 in Los Angeles
County. In July of 1998, one came to live with me.</LD>
<LD>   I am not sure who was more scared: Aisha, a withdrawn and sullen
1-year-old, or me. I am white. Aisha is black. While I was initially
concerned with learning how to care for an infant and deal with being
a single parent, other issues nagged in my head and heart: How do I
do her hair? Will she feel black? Will she be proud of her heritage?
Will she relate to both a white and a black world? Will she have
friends of many ethnicities? Will she be happy?</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, the number of foster children needing homes
has increased dramatically, while the number of available homes has
stayed relatively the same. In California, more than one-third have
been in three or more homes and fewer than 10% are adopted. African
American children are five times less likely to be adopted.</LD>
<TE>   In an ideal world, Aisha would have stayed with a loving,
nurturing birth parent. In a less than ideal world, she would have
been placed with a nurturing, warm black family. Instead, she came to
live with me.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that we are each other's destiny. We have connected and
are a family. In my heart I could not love her more than I do. I know
she feels loved and safe. She had a turbulent and difficult first
year. She endured what no one should have to but is coming through. I
know she will be fine.</TE>
<TE>   My problem? I guess it could be illuminated best with an event
that occurred several months after I got her. While waiting in line
at my neighborhood Target, I was playing with Aisha. Suddenly, an
African American woman tapped on my shoulder. I turned to her and she
began to scream at me for stealing "the good black men and having
black babies." She went on to yell that I had no right to raise this
child in a white home.</TE>
<TE>   After she finished her tirade, I managed to explain that I had not
slept with any black man and was a foster parent to this child. I
went on to say that there are thousands more children who need foster
parents. "If you are worried about black children being raised by
white people, become a foster parent. There are plenty others, but
this one is mine," I said to her.</TE>
<TE>   By then Aisha was crying, the woman looked a little stunned and
the rest of the shoppers and clerks looked shellshocked. The woman
left. As I purchased my goods, the silence broke and a few people,
including some African American grandmother types, told me I handled
things well. "You just raise that baby, Baby," one woman said. I got
to my car and vomited.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes in the grocery store, white people approach me to say
things like, "Oh, it's so nice of you to take in a child" or "I
always wanted to adopt but, well, you know, they are all black."</TE>
<TE>   I can't count the times I have heard people tell Aisha she is so
lucky to have a mommy like me. These are strangers in the grocery
store. Tasha is not a charity case. She is my child. She owes me no
gratitude. I never want her to feel thankful or indebted. It's cruel
for a child to begin life already indebted to someone.</TE>
<TE>   I have read many African American authors, I spend time in African
American communities, I have many friends who are African American.
But I am not African American. I will never know what it is like to
be a little black girl. Neither will I know what it is like to be a
black woman. I want to provide for Aisha a "black experience," but
what is that? I make sure her hair looks good. I try to send her to
schools with a diverse community. We go to the museums and look at
different art. We read lots of different writers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I know she will question who she is, where she came from
and how she will define herself. I just wish people in the grocery
store would facilitate her finding her way to being a proud and
strong and happy black woman.</TE>

<AU>Torie Osborn</AU>
<BD>Torie Osborn is executive director of the Liberty Hill
Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With shrunken bank accounts and tanking investments, projections for
charitable contributions this year are grim. Last year, private
individuals contributed more than three-quarters of the more than
$200 billion given to charities. On average, families making $100,000
or more gave away nearly $4,000 each. This year, people are worth
less. They face an onslaught of solicitations. Their instincts tell
them to tighten their belts and give less. They should resist that
feeling.</LD>
<LD>   Giving is never easy, even in good years. Each December, I seal my
checks in their envelopes before I give myself time to think: What if
my own situation changes and I'll need that money? This year, faced
with higher personal losses, people are less likely to contribute or
to contribute at previous levels.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, fortunately, not everyone will behave this way. Even
faced with losses, some people want to be fair, so much so that they
will not always act in their own self-interest. Several donors have
told me that they want to give more, despite their losses.</LD>
<TE>   That same capacity to see beyond one year's bottom line may
explain why some foundations faced with declining assets and gifts
last year chose to give out more in grants than they had in the past.
But that resolve to try to meet the need rather than preserve assets
may be short-lived. More than three-quarters of all foundations
included in a Chronicle of Philanthropy survey earlier this year
intended to freeze their giving at last year's level or give away
less. Among them are foundations whose assets doubled or even tripled
in the 1990s boom.</TE>
<TE>   Many individuals, despite tremendous gains in personal wealth in
recent years, will doubtless do the same. The largest income
increases went to the top 20% of income earners. Since the 1970s, the
top 1% of households doubled their share of national wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Despite substantial losses, they are not among the millions of
Americans currently faced with a loss of unemployment benefits,
concerns about making their next month's rent or what to do when
their health insurance runs out.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's first great philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie, knew how
to make money and how to give it away. The same man who advised that
the way to become rich was to put all your eggs in one basket and
then watch the basket also knew that the wealthy person who died rich
died disgraced.</TE>
<TE>   When I write my checks this year, I will try to bear in mind
something written by Helen Keller. "Security," she wrote, "is mostly
a superstition.... Life is either a daring adventure, or it is
nothing at all." This year challenges those of us of means to embrace
what we know: that our truest security lies in a compassionate future
in which all people's most basic needs are met every day.</TE>

<LD>Like most humans, scientists have long believed -- even before the
evidence was in -- that language is a skill unique to their species.
In many centuries of debate, however, they have been unable to agree
on anything else about the nature and evolution of language.</LD>
<LD>   The disagreements became so intense in the 19th century that the
Linguistic Society of Paris, in a desperate attempt to deflect the
rhetorical sticks and stones, went so far as to ban university
debates about the "inconclusive topic."</LD>
<LD>   In a review of the linguistic controversy published in the Nov. 22
issue of the journal Science, Marc D. Hauser and W. Tecumseh Fitch of
Harvard and Noam Chomsky of MIT suggest that most inquiries have
failed because they began from the naive premise that a skill as
complex as language can be localized in a single region of the brain.</LD>
<TE>   Hauser, Fitch and Chomsky are too polite to catalog the failures
of their colleagues, such as the now-discredited "phrenologists" of
the early 20th century, whose thinly scientific attempts divided the
brain into areas responsible for noble traits like literacy and
despised ones such as "destructiveness" and "secretiveness." Their
ideas were twisted by the Nazis to justify racial hatreds before and
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Phrenology -- high-tech style -- has reemerged with modern neural
imaging devices now in most academic psychiatry/neurology
departments. Using scanners with acronyms like CAT, PET and SQUID,
modern science has valiantly tried, but failed, to localize the seats
of language and consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than just disdaining the past, the authors of the Science
article look to the future, calling on scientists to stop searching
for what the philosopher Daniel Dennett calls the homunculus -- a
"little man" in the brain that dutifully assembles speech and sense
of self, among other functions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the authors call for a "substantial collaboration
[wherein] linguists, biologists, psychologists and anthropologists,"
rather than trying to localize language, try to at least arrive at a
common theory of how human expression in general came to evolve.</TE>
<TE>   The Science article is a reminder that science is often less a
quest for objective facts than for affirmative and comforting ones.
As Thomas Kuhn put it in his 1962 classic, "The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions," most science involves puzzle-solving to
discover the expected, not the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   The Science authors offer a way out of a historical impasse,
affirming interdisciplinary research in an era when science is
increasingly stifled by narrow specialization.</TE>

<LD>Good deeds usually do not attract much attention. Horror stories do.
Last month, papers worldwide reported that a local authority in
northern Nigeria had issued a call on Muslims to kill a young woman
journalist. She had written what some considered a blasphemous
comment on the prophet Muhammad, words that sparked riots in which
hundreds of people died.</LD>
<LD>   Less known were the immediate rejection of the murderous fatwa by
Nigeria's Supreme Islamic Council, a group that includes a number of
leading Muslim clerics and scholars from across Nigeria, and the
statements of the secular Nigerian government, which dismissed the
fatwa  as "null and void" and unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of 9/11, moderate Muslims have had trouble
finding their voice. The reaction to the plight of journalist Isioma
Daniel is heartening.</LD>
<TE>   The story began one day in November when the organizers of the
Miss World beauty pageant arrived in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. This
pageant, the organizers said, would "show the world that Nigeria is
safe for tourists and investments."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing fundamentalist Muslim leaders who had questioned the
morality of the contest and the money spent to organize it, Daniel
wrote in a newspaper that the participants were so pretty that even
Muhammad "would have probably chosen a wife from one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between Muslims in Nigeria's northern states and
Christians in the south have been high for years, and the ensuing
riots, in which the newspaper's building was torched, were no
surprise to Nigerians. Just two years ago, more than 2,000 people
died in ethnic and religious clashes in Kaduna state. Daniel has left
Nigeria and is said to be in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim organizations in the United States and elsewhere condemned
the incidents in Nigeria. Some, like the Muslim Public Affairs
Council in Los Angeles, also complained that the media have not
always been receptive to messages from the peaceful side of the
Muslim communities.</TE>
<TE>   "We condemned the 'death sentence' issued by the Ayatollah
Khomeini against writer Salman Rushdie in 1989," says Salam
Al-Marayati, the council's executive director. "Every Muslim
organization in America condemned 9/11 but the myth that we haven't
done either persists."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe not every organization, but he has a point. Muslim
moderates, in the U.S. and elsewhere, need to work harder to be heard
and to stimulate internal debate. Americans, in the media and
elsewhere, need to keep their ears--and minds -- open.</TE>

<LD>Before most people realized Los Angeles had a river, it was City
Councilman Ed Reyes' secret playground. Even now he is as eager as
Huck Finn to show off his old waterhole -- a rare stretch of unpaved
riverbed where palm trees wave between concrete banks.</LD>
<LD>   Technically, the channelized river was and still is off limits, by
city law and mothers' orders. But to a kid growing up in Cypress Park
in the early 1970s, this spot near the confluence of the Golden State
and Pasadena freeways was both an oasis and a refuge from the gangs
that ruled the neighborhood parks.</LD>
<LD>   Today Reyes chairs a newly formed City Council committee on the
Los Angeles River. He looks at the 51-mile concrete drainage ditch
and imagines a greenbelt of nature trails, soccer fields and sidewalk
cafes.</LD>
<TE>   He's not the first. Seventeen years ago, a poet in a pork-pie hat
named Lewis MacAdams launched the crusade to reclaim the river. His
nonprofit Friends of the Los Angeles River drew laughter first -- and
then other artists, environmentalists, neighborhood activists and
politicians. Professors from Eagle Rock's Occidental College to
Harvard University made the river a laboratory for urban planning
classes.</TE>
<TE>   The river today still looks like a concrete ditch, and it's easy
to think that nothing has come of all these plans but little blue
signs proclaiming that it really is a river. But a closer look finds
seeds of progress.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit North East Trees has landscaped a string of
riverside pocket parks from Griffith Park to downtown, with
artist-designed gates that beckon visitors in rather than fencing
them out. A two-mile river parkway with trees, benches, bike paths
and walking trails is taking shape in Studio City, thanks to bond
money from the 1996 Proposition K. Federal transportation dollars
earmarked for alternatives to cars have paid for paved bikeways. The
state recently bought two old industrial sites near downtown to
transform into riverfront parks.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-plus local, county, state and federal agencies oversee some
piece of the river. The problem with working with so many
jurisdictions was underscored when members of the council committee
met recently with Atwater Village residents who wanted to know whom
to call to remove graffiti and repair broken sprinklers along their
river walkway. The city? The county? The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers? No one could answer.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for the new committee, then, is to not only keep the
momentum going but to build bridges between the various projects,
public and private, and the people they serve.</TE>
<TE>   MacAdams took the long view when he started what he then called "a
40-year artwork to bring the Los Angeles River back to life through a
combination of art, politics and magic."</TE>
<TE>   This City Council, under term limits, won't be able to complete
the transformation in the four or eight years its members can serve.
But Reyes' committee helps dispel the fear that term-limited councils
won't take on epochal tasks. It also shows that politicians, like
children and artists, know magic when they see it.</TE>

<HD>'B-Track' Holds Students Back</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Bad Side of 'B-Tracks' Criticized," Dec. 8: Finally, some
media attention to the disparities that exist in three-track,
year-round high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
The problems mentioned are real but are almost superficial in
comparison with the major issue that failed to surface in the
article. Track B students have unequal access to the curriculum and
to graduation because of the placement of their
intersession/remediation opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   In traditional schools, students have their summers to repeat
failed classes before beginning their next school year. On Tracks A
and C, students may remediate after each semester. Any failed class
can be retaken, and the student stays on track toward graduation.</LD>
<TE>   Track B students never have such an opportunity. Their
intersessions always lie in the middle of their semester. If they are
failing Algebra I during their fall semester, they cannot repeat it
during the fall intersession because they still have eight weeks to
pull up their grades. Their spring semester, however, begins the
Monday following the end of their fall semester, with no break
between the two. They cannot continue with algebra in the spring,
having failed the first semester, because the second semester
requires the foundational material learned in the first half. The
student is then programmed into some elective and begins the math
sequence anew the following July. The same problem exists with
foreign languages and chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this unequal access to the high school curriculum,
Track B students have lower graduation rates, and lower percentages
of students meet the four-year college admissions requirements
throughout the district. It is a travesty that has been perpetrated
in the LAUSD for over 20 years.</TE>

<TE>   I was disappointed, but not surprised, to learn that only two of
the LAUSD's 44 magnet schools are on the discredited B-track. Ten
years ago, several dedicated educators at Belmont High School created
the International Studies Academy for highly motivated students. We
purposely placed the program on the B-track to help counter the
negative image attached to that track. When we applied to the
district for our academy to become a magnet, we were refused.
Deprived of the support that came with magnet status, the academy
eventually perished. It was not the first time I had seen creativity
and enthusiasm thwarted by the district's demoralizing bureaucracy,
but it was the last. I took an early retirement in 1999.</TE>

<TE>   As a fourth-grade teacher in the LAUSD, I can tell you about
students who are tracked long before high school or even middle
school. The process begins in elementary school. At my school,
students are tracked by their English-language development levels.
The lowest ELD students are clustered together, along with those who
have been held back. English-only and higher-achieving students are
grouped in different classrooms. Students are rarely moved from their
groups. This tracking starts as early as kindergarten, and it appears
to continue throughout high school. There are many factors that
contribute to low performance. I believe that this lack of academic
diversity in the classroom is just one of them.</TE>

<LD>"Selling Out the Forests," your Dec. 3 editorial on the Forest
Service's draft planning rule, completely misses the purpose of the
Forest Service's proposed rule. Today, the Forest Service knows that
what is left on the land is more important than what is taken away.
Our national forests and grasslands are operating under an outdated
1982 planning rule that does not recognize the shift in public values
that has Americans visiting their public lands in record numbers to
hike, camp, fish, canoe, ski and much more. It does not recognize the
tremendous scientific and technological advances made since that
time. The proposed planning rule allows us to seek more efficient and
more productive ways of working with others to make the best
decisions for our forests and our communities.</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial accused the Forest Service of bureaucratic
gibberish when we said that we planned to address three critically
important aspects of public forests: ecological, social and economic.
These three components are the basis upon which an international
treaty defines sustainability for any healthy ecosystem. The fact
that ecological, social and economic health is integral to any Forest
Service analysis does not "erode" the National Environmental Policy
Act. The proposed rule enhances and is entirely consistent with the
NEPA.</LD>
<TE>   What is eroding the value of our country's important environmental
laws is "process predicament." We have a process that results in
taking 10 years to write a 15-year plan. As a result, important work
isn't getting done -- and it is the land that suffers. The proposed
rule will ease the process and free up resources. In developing the
new planning rule, the Forest Service completed the most
comprehensive look at planning costs ever done. The study predicts
the revised rule could save as much as $300 million over the next
decade. The proposed forest planning rule, now open to public
comment, builds upon the hard work accomplished over the past several
years.</TE>

<HD>Community Input on Reuse of Navy Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following a realignment at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in the early
'90s, Navy housing on Taper Avenue was declared surplus. The federal
government transferred all of this housing to a homeless provider
without informing or involving the community in this decision. In
1994, the federal law was amended to ensure greater citizen input
into land reuse decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The reuse proposal addressed in your Dec. 5 editorial is the
result of the grass-roots process required by law. At numerous public
hearings, the needs of the region's homeless population were
carefully weighed. The requests of other worthy applicants were also
considered. In the end, the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee
recommended that the best use for the surplus Navy land was for 76
units of housing for the homeless, various transitional services for
the homeless, educational facilities and a medical research lab (that
subsequently opted not to relocate). The committee's plan also
required the winning applicants to contribute almost $2 million to
the L.A. Homeless Services Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Conveyance of the surplus property was complicated by the
discovery of an endangered species, the Palos Verdes blue butterfly,
at the housing site. Now another delay -- one endorsed by The Times
-- is likely. Rather than give final approval to the community's
recommended reuse plan, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development has decided to mediate 45 days of negotiations between
the city and a disgruntled homeless advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   If no compromise is reached, the result will be tragic. No one --
not even the homeless living in San Pedro who so deserve the aid of
the providers selected by the reuse committee -- will win. We support
the community process that produced the San Pedro reuse plan and urge
homeless advocates to continue to participate in this process as
additional surplus military housing becomes available. Holding up
this decision much longer undermines the intention of the law.</TE>

<LD>Ronald Brownstein's "Rising Number of Uninsured Is Causing Safety Net
to Unravel" (Dec. 9) does a good job of cataloging the problems with
the U.S. health-care system, including the ever-increasing financial
devastation of our existing doctors and hospitals and the shame of 41
million Americans without access to health care because they can't
afford insurance. He rightly concludes that "much bolder thinking" is
needed than President Bush's do-nothing tinkering with the tax code
but wrongly states that "a lot more money" is needed to fix the
situation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. now spends far more per capita on health care than any
other country; we don't need to spend more money. What we need is to
adopt one of the well-proven national health-care systems in use in
other industrialized countries. Canada's "single-payer" system is one
good model, but there are certainly others. The important thing is to
achieve universal coverage, fair and reliable remuneration to doctors
and hospitals for every patient they treat and effective cost
control. Lots of other nations have done it; it's not rocket science.</LD>
<LD>   Stacy Rosenbaum</LD>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brownstein's column basically pleads for more money to save the
nation's "safety net" rather than coming to grips with the fact that
cheap labor is not cheap. The true cost of cheap labor is transferred
from employers to taxpayers. Millions of illegal aliens, such as
Mixtec workers who are "younger, poorer and more likely to be in this
country illegally" (Dec. 9), have skewed the lowest income levels
from merely being poor to Third World poor. Why hire employees at a
semi-decent wage with health-care benefits when you can hire illegals
at minimum or sub-minimum wages without any benefits?</TE>
<TE>   The cycle has become more vicious as honest employers are undercut
by those who hire illegals. They must now choose to hire illegals or
go out of business altogether. This then dumps more and more people
onto the safety net that they once were holding up. The end result,
at least in California, is to spread even thinner those dollars to
those who should be getting them, as witnessed by headlines like
"Cuts Target Ill and Aging" (Dec. 9). To provide real benefits to a
safety net, get rid of those who don't belong in the system in the
first place.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Universal Coverage Will Take Universal Sacrifice," Commentary,
Dec. 9: After spending 20 real-world years as an "evil" insurance
executive, I always look forward to the utopian meanderings of your
health insurance guru, Jamie Court.</TE>
<TE>   Court has recommended a health-care delivery system that promotes
the oxymoronic idea of organized labor overseeing cost efficiencies;
asks hospitals to "submit to a public process that determines
standardized rates" for treatments; recommends that employers "break
ranks with an HMO lobby" to allow for government administration of
health care; and asks that insurers/HMOs "agree to limits on profits
and strict government regulations of premiums and coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Although all the above very much concerns me, I have an idea.
Court should run a trial program in Santa Monica and let us all know
how it works out.</TE>
<TE>   Tom von Gremp</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here we go again. Universal health-care insurance for all. Suppose
every man, woman and child in California is covered by insurance paid
for in a variety of ways. Utopia for HMOs, doctors, nurses,
hospitals, etc.? Not if they no longer exist. Health costs have
skyrocketed because the demand for health services has far
outstripped the supply of those services. So we have many without
insurance, yet those with insurance have found the quality of health
care in a free fall. Appointments, waiting times and, yes, even
tragic errors point to a system in decline. Will universal coverage
fix all that? Or really exacerbate the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Ask the Canadians. Their wonderful insurance system is fine up
until the time you get seriously ill and actually need timely care.
The quality of health care in Canada is as bankrupt of services and
money as the U.S. system is about to become.</TE>
<TE>   The shortfall of professionals -- that is, doctors, nurses,
technicians, hospitals and the like -- is a ticking bomb. Let's do
all we can to open up the medical schools. Keep the public and
private bureaucrats and the trial lawyers on the sidelines as much as
possible. Universal quality care should be the goal. Debate over
universal insurance as the only solution is a blueprint for
mediocrity or worse.</TE>

<TE>   The time may be approaching when the federal government must
either federalize health care and pension plans or face civil unrest.
The time may also be coming when governments at all levels must make
difficult choices between capitalizing current expenses (read
inflation) or raising taxes to meet current expenses. I have no hope
that any of these things will take place until there is no other
choice, because no system of government that depends upon a vote of
the people can make difficult decisions in the absence of an external
threat.</TE>

these machines and pedestrians will interact on busy city streets,
they have been legalized in 32 states (including California). Have
our politicians totally lost their senses, or has it been that long
since they've walked down a city sidewalk? Or is it possible they
have nothing better to concern themselves with? Just wait until the
accidents start and the liability lawyers get involved; that should
be a real walk (ride?) in the park.</LD>

<LD>On Dec. 8, Steve Lopez's column dredged up Joe McCarthy and his
ranting. Lopez used "pinko politics," home values in Malibu and
weekend movie revenues to describe some people he believes do not
support charities in L.A. Nowhere does he show how he knows that
these people do not support charities. Just because they are in the
entertainment field or just plain wealthy proves nothing.</LD>
<LD>   I thought the "big smear" was long discredited. His poem was a
pitiful attempt to denigrate a particular group of people, while
making no mention of millions of others here in L.A. who do not put
their hands in their pockets.</LD>

<LD>I'll never look at salmon the same way again ("Fish Farms Become
Feedlots of the Sea," Dec. 9). Your article highlighted exactly what
we need to know about the foods we are consuming. I guess when they
offer salmon as an alternative to meat at a charity dinner it would
be better to opt for the vegetarian plate. I am pretty sure the piece
of salmon I cooked the other night took on a grayish hue -- and I
thought it was my cooking. Oh well, what is one to eat, soup and
nuts?</LD>

<LD>I take no position on the merit of Radley Balko's Dec. 9 commentary,
"Targeting the Social Drinker Is Just MADD," but one assertion he
makes is in error. He refers to "driving under the influence -- a
less serious charge than driving while intoxicated." A person who
drives after drinking in California may be subject to prosecution
under one of two provisions: driving with a blood alcohol level at
.08% or more (or lower if the person is under 21) or driving under
the influence, which means that the driver's ability to control the
vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug or a combination of the two
(and "drug" means any drug, not just illegal drugs or those used with
a prescription). Punishment for either is precisely the same and can
be severe. Either will have the same effect on a driver's license and
upon the costs of insurance.</LD>
<LD>   You don't have to be "drunk" to be in violation of the law, and
drivers in California should not be misled into thinking that it is
less serious to be under the influence than to be intoxicated. The
best advice remains: If you drink, don't drive.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Methinks Balko doth protest too much. Pointing out that the number
of people killed by drunk drivers has leveled off at 16,000 a year
hardly is a comforting statistic. If we are expected to give up or
compromise some civil liberties to fight terror, why not do the same
for a "terror" that kills as many as Sept. 11 nearly every two
months? Sobriety checks being too invasive? The folks in the
Washington area didn't complain when roadblocks were used to look for
the sniper.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Rathner</TE>
<TE>   Acton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balko's column disparages the efforts of MADD. Balko states that
the checkpoints "do little to get dangerous drunks off the road." I
serve as a MADD volunteer at sobriety traffic checkpoints in north
Orange County that are conducted by local police. At every stop,
drivers are apprehended who are at or above the legal alcohol limit.
I have witnessed drivers who could barely stagger to the Breathalyzer
test station. I invite Balko to join me at a checkpoint and see for
himself that they are effective.</TE>
<TE>   Balko claims that cell phones, fumbling with the stereo and
disciplining children are more hazardous than drunk driving. These
are obviously bad practices, but they occur for only a few minutes,
whereas drunk driving persists for the entire trip.</TE>

<LD>Re "Court Hands Cheney a Win on Disclosures," Dec. 10: Like many
Californians, I was looking forward to finding out the details of
Vice President Dick Cheney's meetings on energy policy. The General
Accounting Office had the initiative to compel Cheney to turn over
the minutes of these meetings, and it looked as if we were all going
to learn how the federal government was involved in the energy
deregulation fiasco that California continues to pay for.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in the eleventh hour, after Cheney missed his deadline to
turn over the documents to the GAO, a Bush-appointed judge steps in
and rules that the GAO has no authority to force the executive branch
to release any information. Cheney can breathe a sigh of relief, for
now it may never be proved just how cozy the Bush administration is
with big business. We've seen plenty of other examples of this, and
when corporations benefit, it's often the average consumer who pays
the price.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Cheney Wins, Public Loses," editorial, Dec. 11: It's also the
judges, stupid. Connect these dots: Judge John D. Bates, last year's
Bush nominee to the bench, also served as deputy independent counsel
on the Whitewater investigation with Ken Starr. The deputy solicitor
general arguing for Cheney is Paul Clement, who worked for Justice
Antonin Scalia and served as law clerk to Judge Laurence Silberman,
who, according to David Brock, was the alleged go-between for Ted
Olson and Starr on Whitewater. We win or lose? You do the math.</TE>

<LD>Re "What if the Hunt for 'Evildoers' Aimed at Us?" Commentary, Dec.
10: Robert Scheer is perfect evidence that many on the left --
following the lead of Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter -- have
become hysterical, dictator-coddling "America Lasters." With regard
to weapons of mass destruction, Scheer says that Iraq "is now
arguably the most open society in the world." The U.S., by contrast,
is the source of "devilish inventions" of mass destruction. That's
right: Iraq: open society; America: devilish.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing sadder than former idealists reduced to advocating
for the world's most vicious thugs would be if any of us listened to
anything they had to say.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Zak</LD>
<TE>   Sunland</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again Scheer has identified the major source of the world's
weapons of mass destruction -- the United States. Our country's
history of exporting conventional and nuclear arms, fissile material,
land mines and God knows what else, along with the technology needed
by others to produce these devilish materials, screams out
"hypocrisy" to all who have not yet been made deaf by the Bush
administration's continued cries for war.</TE>
<TE>   William O. Straub</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In William Arkin's telling Dec. 8 opinion piece, " 'Sci-Fi'
Weapons Going to War," after describing more exotic means to advance
death and untold suffering, he states: "Most promising is a new
incendiary device that generates a firestorm so intense it cannot be
quenched with water." Well, that is promising.</TE>
<TE>   Thank God the Bush administration's stated aversion to weapons of
mass destruction isn't standing in the way of the further
annihilation of our species and its environs when there's another
dollar (or billion) to be made. It's a good thing that it's so
profitable to destroy life, as we've pretty much given up on
preserving it.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders, though, how President Bush and his dangerous and
extravagant cronies intend on putting out the fires they ignite when
they ultimately bear down on themselves. Water, already in short
supply thanks to "nonexistent" global warming, is apparently useless,
and throwing money at the conflagration will only stoke it. Much like
throwing money at weapons of mass destruction only furthers our
decline while fanning the flames of hatred.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Nukes Part of Terror Policy," Dec. 11: Is Bush insane? Are we?
Bush has essentially declared war with Iraq and is just looking for a
reason to launch. Now he wants to include nuclear weapons in a
preemptive strike. Is Bush returning us to the 1950s, when we ducked
under school desks, tested air raid sirens and built bomb shelters in
our backyards? We have truly met the enemy, and it is us. Today I am
ashamed to be an American.</TE>

<LD>A Burbank mother was sentenced Friday to 22 years and four months in
prison after pleading no contest to charges of corporal injury to a
child, mayhem and assault involving her 12-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Erlinda Reyes Allan, 39, was sentenced at a hearing in Los Angeles
County Superior Court by Judge Janice Croft. Allan's husband, Marcus
Allan, 44, pleaded no contest to criminal charges in August and was
sentenced to 18 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The sentencing concludes a case that began in December 2000 when
the parents told officers responding to a report of child abuse at
their home that the girl wasn't present, because she was living in
her mother's native Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   But an ice-cream truck driver afterward told police that he had
seen the girl with a split lip earlier in the day.</TE>

home.</TE>

<HD>Cartoon Fans Draw a Bead on Glendale</HD>
<DH>A group wants to open an animation center and museum in a
former bank on Broadway. Its members have until May to form a viable
plan.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of a plan to build an animation center and museum in a
landmark Glendale building saw it as a good omen. At a meeting this
week of backers, Tinker Bell sat in the front row, showing her
support.</LD>
<LD>   "Fifty years ago in this city, Margaret Kerry-Willcox was the
model for Tinker Bell [in Disney's 1953 "Peter Pan"], and she's right
here," said Frank Gladstone, a leader of Animation Initiative
Glendale who works at nearby DreamWorks SKG. "Margaret, we're going
to dip you in wax and put you in the lobby."</LD>
<LD>   Project supporters say the animation center and museum belong in
Glendale, which has long been a home for animators and animation
studios. The city could also use a distinctive cultural attraction to
draw tourists.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the city's redevelopment agency gave Animation
Initiative Glendale six months to develop a viable plan for adapting
the historic Fidelity Savings and Loan building on Broadway for use
as an animation center.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also asked to see a plan for raising the $3 million to
$4 million needed to build the center and a plan for running it.</TE>
<TE>   If a proposal is accepted in May, the redevelopment agency is
expected to turn the building over to the group, on terms that are
still to be negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   Used until recently as office space, the bank was designed in the
mid-1950s by architect W. A. Sarmiento. Bought by the city last year
for $1.3 million, the now-empty 65,000-square-foot structure has a
retro look.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 people attended this week's meeting in the building,
first signing waivers absolving the city of responsibility for their
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "When we arrived, it was crummier than it is now," said architect
Michael Pinto, of the Glendale firm Osborn, explaining that he and
others had vacuumed and spruced up the place.</TE>
<TE>   As Betty Boop and Superman cartoons flickered on the walls, Pinto
described different schemes for using the structure's four levels,
including a roof deck. All included a museum, archives and library,
screening facilities, classrooms, offices, retail shops and a cafe or
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Pinto said that the animation theme had piqued the imagination of
the architects. As a result, they dreamed up such amenities as an
elevator with a window that moves past a sequence of images. As
passengers move by, the images would also appear to move. Another
idea -- replacing some of the bricks on the outside wall with small
television monitors to intrigue passersby.</TE>
<TE>   Gladstone said that a group of eight has been meeting weekly to
make sure the proposal is completed by the May deadline. He put the
cost of the project's first phase at $80,000 to $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   At this week's meeting, Gladstone asked everyone to share ideas
with the planning group. "Nothing is off the table," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the museum, the project would include a school to
train and retrain animators, perhaps in conjunction with the
California Institute of the Arts and other area colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "We now live in a world of ones and zeros instead of pencil leads,
and I think that's going to continue," Gladstone said, alluding to
the explosion of computer animation. Having the building will greatly
reduce the cost of the project, but the current economy will
complicate fund-raising, supporters agreed.</TE>
<TE>   To raise money, the group expects to tap Disney, DreamWorks and
the other major animation studios, industry-related businesses, arts
and education funding agencies and private donors. The center's shops
and restaurant or cafe could also make money.</TE>
<TE>   Animators have long talked about having their own place to meet
and socialize. They also hope to see something that attracts tourists
but isn't a tourist trap.</TE>
<TE>   "The vision is that everything we do here will be first class,"
said Gladstone. "I want this to be something that lives on after all
of us."</TE>

<HD>Boyd Pleads Guilty to Felony Conflict-of-Interest Charge</HD>
<DH>Former Seal Beach councilman is fined and placed on
probation for role in trailer park deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd pleaded guilty Friday to a
felony conflict-of-interest charge that will bar him from ever
seeking public office.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, 34, made no comment after his brief appearance before
Superior Court Judge Ronald P. Kreber.</LD>
<LD>   He is the second Orange County politician this year to become a
convicted felon for using his office for financial gain. Former
Huntington Beach Councilman Dave Garofalo pleaded guilty to a felony
and 15 misdemeanors in January for voting on matters benefiting
companies that bought advertising from his publishing business.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Laguna Beach Mayor Wayne Baglin pleaded not guilty to a
similar charge stemming from his work as a real estate broker on
behalf of the sellers of two properties the city bought last year.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd admitted hiding his financial relationship with Richard Hall,
the owner of the Seal Beach Trailer Park, who made a $4.5-million
profit after the city financed the park's sale last year to a
nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   Kreber placed Boyd on formal probation for three years. He was
ordered to pay nearly $50,000 in fines, including $25,000 previously
ordered for eight political reporting violations. He also admitted to
state tax evasion for failing to reveal a portion of his six-figure
income while working as a consultant for Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked to see him do jail time," said Seal Beach
activist Laura Brecht, who filed a complaint against Boyd with Orange
County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. "He's shown no remorse. He owes
the citizens of Seal Beach an apology."</TE>
<TE>   Brecht said she became suspicious after Hall raised his asking
price for the trailer park by $2 million. Investigators later said
Boyd alerted Hall to additional city financing available for the
purchase. Hall bought the park in December 1998 for $2.9 million and
sold it for $7.45 million two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd lost his bid for reelection in March after serving a
four-year term.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Drops Request for Fees</HD>
<DH>Tony Rackauckas had asked supervisors to pay $50,000 to law
firm that advised him in responding to critical grand jury report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta and Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas on Friday withdrew a
request asking the Board of Supervisors to pay $50,000 to a law firm
that helped him respond to a critical grand jury report after the
county CEO opposed the request.</LD>
<LD>   County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher was not available
Friday to elaborate on his reasons for red-flagging the item. But
Diane Thomas, a county spokeswoman, said the district attorney's
office did not follow county procedure when it retained the law firm
of Morrison and Foerster to help Rackauckas formulate a rebuttal to
the June report by the Orange County Grand Jury.</LD>
<LD>   That report faulted Rackauckas for allegedly intervening in cases
involving campaign supporters, misusing office resources and hiring
relatives of political allies instead of more qualified applicants.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly any time an outside law firm is hired, the requesting
agency must go through the county counsel's office, which presents
the proposal to supervisors, Thomas said. The board "has sole
authority to select outside legal counsel," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office declined to
comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas hired Morrison and Foerster to help him draft a
response to the 92 findings and 64 recommendations in the grand
jury's report.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said the report was inaccurate and one-sided and that
the panel was unduly influenced by his political enemies. His reply
ran more than 100 pages.</TE>
<TE>   The legal fees issue comes as the Orange County
auditor-controller's office is examining a special district
attorney's office fund that came under scrutiny in the grand jury
report.</TE>
<TE>   The panel accused the office of misusing the fund to entertain
politicians, lobbyists and others.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Spitzer, who stepped down last month from the Board of
Supervisors, had criticized the office for using the money to buy
alcohol, which he said was a violation of county policy.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas also came under fire from California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, whose office helped the grand jury with its probe.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said Friday that Schumacher's decision to oppose
Rackauckas' request to pay the attorney fees was a "procedural issue"
and "had nothing to do with the way the D.A.' s office runs its
shop."</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad on Friday would not say whether
she supported Rackauckas' request. But she noted that the board hired
its own outside lawyers to sort out the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   It is common for branches of county government to turn to outside
legal counsel when dealing with unusual cases. Rackauckas was
required by law to respond to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   But John Oetken, co-director of Common Cause Orange County, said
that because Rackauckas is an attorney, he should have been able to
write the response. "I don't think he should use taxpayer money," he
said.</TE>

<HD>New Council Members Revive Thousand Oaks Controversy</HD>
<DH>Wilson and Bill-de la Pena reopen debate over housing
construction that led to the censure of former Councilwoman Linda
Parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Thousand Oaks City Council's new slow-growth majority has come
out swinging by requesting a council apology to former Councilwoman
Linda Parks and by reviving a bitter debate over construction of
three luxury homes near the Dos Vientos community.</LD>
<LD>   New council members Bob Wilson Sr. and Claudia Bill-de la Pena
said they are also proposing several initiatives on Tuesday's agenda
to make good on campaign promises to keep residents better informed
and involved in city decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The new members have joined incumbent Ed Masry to form a council
majority elected on platforms calling for strict limits on city
growth.</LD>
<TE>   Masry proposes in a letter to be considered Tuesday that a written
apology be made to Parks and two former planning commissioners for
council actions against them before Parks was elected to the Board of
Supervisors earlier this year. The actions against them should also
be expunged from the council record, Masry said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks was censured by the council and the planning commissioners
were removed for allegedly conspiring to stall a land-swap deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very embarrassing and humiliating for the three of them,"
Masry said. "Let's face it, it was done for basically a political
motive. There was no due process involved and no factual basis for
the allegations made."</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena and Wilson, both endorsed by Parks in their
council campaigns, called the incident "a miscarriage of justice" and
said they strongly support Masry's request.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said the firing of the planning commissioners was one of
the reasons he decided to run.</TE>
<TE>   The apology request drew no response from the two current council
members who voted to censure Parks and remove the planning
commissioners: Councilman Dennis Gillette declined comment, and Mayor
Andy Fox did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping there's no debate. Let's just simply clean up the
record," Masry said. "I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I
just want the council to clear up this egregious error and move on."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Wilson has proposed altering council procedures by
having city staffers provide a description and status report of all
major capital projects before the city, with one project being
reviewed at each council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   He also asked that a community budget task force be revived. "I
had some real issues about $17 million being spent on the golf
course, or $1.3 million spent on a City Hall elevator," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette said timely updates on important building projects can
only improve the council's decision making. He agreed that a budget
task force could be useful as the city reacts to the state's budget
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we can get qualified residents to look at the budget"
the process improves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the former Planning Commission chairwoman, Bill-de la Pena is
pushing the city to complete an update of its General Plan map, part
of the master document that guides all city land-use decisions.</TE>
<TE>   She also wants to undo a city deal to allow development of three
estate homes on an 8.7-acre parcel in Newbury Park. Bill-de la Pena
and her slow-growth allies prefer to keep the land vacant and fear
that any construction south of Potrero Road would open the way for
future development.</TE>
<TE>   The former City Council, including Fox and Gillette, granted
permission to build on the land in exchange for the owner's promise
to give the city $2.5 million to help construct a public equestrian
center on the nearby public open space area Rancho Potrero.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, part of a larger land-swap arrangement known as the
Western Plateau Preservation Plan, led to the dismissal of planning
commissioners Michael Farris and Nora Aidukas and the censure of
Parks in February.</TE>
<TE>   Parks questioned whether construction was prohibited by a 1996
ordinance that protects land designated as parks and open space.</TE>
<TE>   After Farris and Aidukas sought to delay a decision on the Western
Plateau deal until the question about the 8.7 acres could be cleared
up, the council fired them, accusing Parks of trying to influence
their vote and of violating the state's open-meeting law.</TE>
<TE>   A district attorney's investigation concluded that there was no
evidence of any wrongdoing. But because no formal apology was ever
issued, Masry said the council needs to make one now.</TE>

<DH>Garden Grove apartment complex dubbed the 'Haster Disaster'
is reborn with a respectable look, and an attitude to match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no good reason Yolanda Reveles would have invited friends
to her home.</LD>
<LD>   Her two-bedroom Garden Grove apartment smelled from the bad
plumbing. She kept the walls bare because the roof leaked and the
paint peeled. The bathrooms were coated in mold. She was ashamed of
the potholes that pocked her driveway and the algae that clung to the
sides of the community's swimming pool.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so ugly," she said. "I was embarrassed."</LD>
<TE>   This week, city officials, management and residents celebrated the
rebirth of the complex, which has a new name, a new look and a new
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   On Haster Street, the former Haster Gardens, now named Arroyo
Vista Apartments, has a tropical feel with its neutral tones, deep
green lawns and arching palms, a far cry from the festering housing
project that earned the nickname "Haster Disaster" and was ultimately
condemned by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Renovation of the 148-unit complex was a painstaking job,
complicated by the fact that its former owners were convicted of
fraud and that many of the units -- which the owners had sold off one
by one -- ended up in foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The former owners -- Dale D. Marks, 48, and Neko K. Defterios, 62,
both of the Palos Verdes Peninsula -- were recently given jail terms
for engineering mortgage schemes that allegedly netted them millions
but left the complex essentially abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   After years of neglect, the city determined that the apartment
complex was putting a strain on city services -- code enforcement,
health department visits and increased police patrols -- and asked
the courts to consolidate the various foreclosure cases so that the
property could be purchased and renovated.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of the city, Irvine-based Vista Communities got a
$620,000 federal loan and bought the aging property in 1999. The
development firm also invested more than $2.5 million in new carpet,
fresh paint, refurbished baths, new kitchens and appliances, and
enclosed garages, among other improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The remodeled swimming pool was once little more than a landing
zone for dirt and leaves. The green grass, palm trees and brick-lined
landscape had been plots of unleveled, dry dirt. A playground with
blue swing sets, beige slides and a picnic area has been added, along
with a community room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy because I know how it used to look," said Denia
Huezo, 28, who now works as the assistant manager of the complex and
was a tenant in the complex during its lesser days. "I've seen it
grow and transform into a nice place to live."</TE>
<TE>   But not all have found it an easy adjustment. Some were upset that
rent, formerly $500 to $800 a month, was raised to $825 for a
one-bedroom to $1,395 for a three-bedroom. Some also were uneasy
about the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, there were no rules and everybody did what they wanted,"
Huezo said. "Now they know that in order to have something good, they
have to follow the rules."</TE>
<TE>   And so it is that residents now yell at children who play in the
flower beds and dutifully pick up trash and debris.</TE>
<TE>   Reveles said she is so proud of her remade residence that she
spent thousands of dollars making it feel a little more like home.
The apartment's blue carpet is protected with another layer of rugs
and she's hung leopard-print photos. Friends visit weekly, vying to
see who can make the hottest salsa or the best carne asada.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my home now," said Reveles. "There's a lot of pride in
where we live."</TE>

<HD>Luster Sex Videos Not Admissible</HD>
<DH>Judge rules against defense motion for man accused of
drugging and raping three women.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers will not be allowed to introduce homemade videos of
rape suspect Andrew Luster having consensual sex with a former
girlfriend when his trial begins next week, a judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, which comes just before opening statements Monday,
is a blow to Luster's case. His lawyers argued the tapes were crucial
evidence to rebut allegations that he drugged and raped the
ex-girlfriend at his Mussel Shoals beach house six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The defense argues that Luster, the 38-year-old great-grandson of
cosmetics magnate Max Factor, was an aspiring porn producer who
directed films in which women pretended to be asleep while he had sex
with them.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have charged the wealthy bachelor with raping three
women at his house after knocking them out with the date-rape drug
gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women called police after Luster allegedly drugged her
at a bar and allegedly raped her in his home. Charges were filed on
behalf of two other women after investigators seized tapes from
Luster's home that allegedly depict more sexual assaults. Luster
faces multiple counts of rape, sexual battery, sodomy and poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have portrayed the purported victims as vengeful
ex-lovers and party girls who drank too much and are now embarrassed
by their actions. They say the videotapes support that position. But
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley ruled that the tape
excerpts are not relevant.</TE>
<TE>   "The crime charged is not videotaping," Riley stated in a ruling.
"The issue is whether the defendant was engaging in sexual
intercourse with a woman he knows to be unconscious."</TE>
<TE>   Riley referred to a recent Northern California appellate court
decision, which Ventura County prosecutors have cited in their
efforts to narrow the field of evidence in Luster's trial.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the 6th District Court of Appeal, ruling in a Santa
Clara County case in which a man drugged and raped his estranged
girlfriend, found that a person who intentionally has sex with an
unconscious victim is committing rape.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected the concept of "advance" consent, finding that
a decision to engage in sex is made at the time of the act. Even if a
woman indicates she is willing to engage in unconscious sexual
intercourse, a man who then has sex with her while she is unconscious
deprives her of the opportunity to withdraw her consent, the court
ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, the California Supreme Court declined to consider
the case, which means Luster is stuck with the lower court's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate ruling, Riley rejected a defense motion to suppress
Luster's statements to detectives after his arrest two years ago.</TE>

<HD>5 Lawsuits Concerning Airport Plans at El Toro Are Settled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five lawsuits filed over Orange County's aborted plans to build an
airport at the closed El Toro Marine base have been settled, the
parties announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Two suits challenged the county's environmental reviews of the
airport plan; two others protested the spending of $8 million for a
public information campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The final lawsuit questioned El Toro's inclusion in regional
transportation plans.</LD>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments will drop the
airfield from its documents. SCAG's plans have long called for an
airport at El Toro to help fill the demand for air passenger service
in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes nine months after voters rejected plans to build an
airport at El Toro, deciding instead to build a park on the closed
Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors spent a decade trying to convert the base
into a commercial airport.</TE>
<TE>   Cities around the base fought against it, spending millions on
legal bills.</TE>

<HD>Alvarez Won't Run for Supervisor</HD>
<DH>Orange councilman says campaign pressures, doubt about
legal status of election were factors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange Councilman Michael Alvarez has decided not to run for a vacant
seat on the county Board of Supervisors, leaving four candidates in
the race.</LD>
<LD>   The pressures of mounting a campaign swiftly for the Jan. 28
ballot -- plus a lawsuit challenging the validity of the election in
the 3rd District -- created too many hurdles, Alvarez said.</LD>
<LD>   "With the lawsuit hanging overhead, I didn't want to continue
spending money not knowing if there would be an election," he said.</LD>
<TE>   An Orange County Superior Court judge will consider a request by a
group of citizens next week to halt the election. The lawsuit
challenges the constitutionality of voters' approval in March of a
county charter, which calls for elections to fill board vacancies
instead of appointments by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisorial seat was vacated last month by Todd Spitzer, who
was sworn in Dec. 2 to the state Assembly representing portions of
Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer on Friday endorsed former Assemblyman Bill Campbell to
replace him. Spitzer took Campbell's seat in the 71st District.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said Campbell would "continue to fight pro-airport forces,
will protect taxpayers and ensure that we maintain our quality of
life." He was referring to county plans, killed by voters in March,
to build an airport at the former El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez's departure leaves former Tustin Councilman Jim Potts,
Robert L. Douglas of Orange and Douglas Boeckler of Orange in the
race with Campbell. Candidates have until Monday at 5 p.m. to file
paperwork to run.</TE>

<HD>Museum Plan Not Viable, Study Argues</HD>
<DH>Military History displays in former blimp hanger in Tustin
wouldn't draw enough visitors to succeed, report says. Backers
dispute survey's cost figures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed Museum of American Military History, to be housed in a
blimp hangar on the former Tustin Marine base, would cost $262
million to create and more than $6 million a year to operate,
according to a feasibility study conducted for the Orange County
Planning Department.</LD>
<LD>   The study, which is to be presented to the Board of Supervisors
Tuesday, recommends narrowing the museum's focus from general U.S.
military history to exploring the U.S. role in the Pacific during
World War II, and expanding the center's appeal by including the role
of the military in establishing human rights.</LD>
<LD>   As proposed, the study said, the museum would appeal largely to
older white males and would not draw enough visitors to be
successful.</LD>
<TE>   If the focus is not changed, the study said, organizers should
consider a smaller facility that would be cheaper to build and
operate.</TE>
<TE>   The study also said the museum -- like most others -- would
require outside support, either from local governments, established
groups or the military itself.</TE>
<TE>   As the project is proposed, that would translate into an annual
subsidy of $2.6 million to $2.9 million, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Museum backers dismissed the study's financial estimates as too
high, and said the center could be launched with only "a couple of
million" dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to cost $2.5 million to $3.5 million to build it as we
operate it," said Jeff Sharp, an archivist for the Orange County
Veterans Service Office, which is coordinating the project.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, he said, the museum would be built in about 15
stages, each corresponding with a fiscal year. But the feasibility
study broke the project into three phases costing $138.3 million for
the first and $62 million for the second and third.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp also said the museum would cost about $2 million a year to
run, and would support itself in its third year.</TE>
<TE>   The idea arose four years ago as the federal government closed
operations at the one-time blimp base. Veterans groups have said they
want to convert the 18-story northern hangar -- one of two such
landmark structures at the base -- into a facility showcasing life in
wartime and recognizing the experiences of the county's 250,000
veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for displays developed from items donated by more than
40 private collectors, and would include planes, tanks, trucks,
Jeeps, uniforms and photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers have already received $2 million worth of vintage
tanks, landing craft, uniforms and other equipment restored for the
movie "Windtalkers," about Navajo "code-talkers" in the Pacific
during World War II.</TE>

<HD>State Budget Cuts Threaten Local Schools</HD>
<DH>Ventura County districts warn that Gov. Davis' proposals
may lead to reductions in teacher salaries and empty reserve
accounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County schools are bracing for sweeping state budget cuts
that could mean reduced pay for teachers, slashed programs and even
layoffs in districts from Ojai to Thousand Oaks, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis last week proposed midyear cuts of $10.2 billion
from the state budget to put a dent in the $21-billion deficit.
Education, which makes up about 40% of the budget, could be among the
hardest areas hit, with a proposal to immediately cut school funding
by nearly 4%.</LD>
<LD>   Most local districts would have to drain their healthy savings
accounts to cover the proposed cuts, officials said. In some smaller
districts, reserve funds won't cover the shortfall. That means
officials will have to consider pay cuts for teachers and classified
staff, slash programs or break contracts to lay off teachers.</LD>
<TE>   In tiny Ojai Unified, for example, the $25-million budget would
still be $100,000 short even after the school district uses its
$700,000 reserve fund.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Berube, assistant superintendent, said it would be difficult
to keep cuts out of the classroom unless the state allows districts
some flexibility in spending restricted funds, such as money
earmarked for textbooks or school improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all new to us. And it's going to be a real management
challenge," Berube said. "But we will try to keep it away from the
classroom in any way we can."</TE>
<TE>   In south Oxnard, the Hueneme Elementary School District has a
$1.9-million reserve fund, but could lose that amount under Davis'
proposal. Spending every cent of the district's savings account would
be irresponsible, Assistant Supt. Jeff Baarstad said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do that, you haven't begun to solve your problem," he
said. "You just delay it for six months, and you take away any
insurance you had for real emergencies."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has proposed waiving the state's requirement that districts
maintain a 3% reserve fund through 2004, in hopes that schools could
absorb the midyear cuts without disrupting instruction.</TE>
<TE>   But most Ventura County officials said they would not rely on that
strategy to solve budget problems. While cuts are permanent, reserve
spending is temporary, they said, leaving districts with a larger gap
to close in the next budget year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's scary," said Gary Mortimer, head of business services for
Conejo Valley Unified School District. "What if there was an
earthquake? Or a flu epidemic? There are a lot of what-ifs that can
come up if you spend down those reserve funds."</TE>
<TE>   If districts wipe out their savings, they could be left insolvent,
said Sandra Rosales, business director for Oxnard's elementary and
middle schools. In the district, where officials are compiling a list
of belt-tightening measures, cuts could be anywhere from $2 million
to $5 million, she said."It's not going to be pretty, whatever it
is," Rosales said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as lawmakers hash it all out in Sacramento, many
districts are attempting to slow spending.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oxnard Union High School District, teachers last week
agreed to make a proposed 2.5% annual salary raise effective for only
six months because of the budget uncertainties, Supt. Gary Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Districts are freezing hiring and cutting expenditures, such as
travel, conferences and nonessential purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already halfway through the school year, and every day that
goes by, people are spending money they may not have," said Stan
Mantooth, who oversees school budgets in the Ventura County
superintendent of schools office.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the midyear cuts come at a time when districts are
facing record increases in workers' compensation and health insurance
costs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is worse than it has ever been for public schools,
said district business officials -- even some who have weathered
other budget crises.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a debacle," Mortimer said. "We've had our share of
recessionary times, but never anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   Most school officials disagree with how Gov. Davis is handling the
crisis and have their own ideas about how to resolve it.</TE>
<TE>   Cut portions of the state's standardized testing program, said one
Ventura Unified school board member.</TE>
<TE>   Relax strict rules under class-size reduction that allow an
average of only 20 children per room, said another district official.</TE>
<TE>   Slash some of the programs that the state invented a few years ago
when economic times were good, said Baarstad, the Hueneme official.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to see them cut more of the icing and not the cake," he
said. "We know we have to be a part of the state solution, but we
want some leadership from them before they hand the problem over to
us. I think they need to work a little harder."</TE>

<HD>Dee Brown, 94; 'Wounded Knee' Author Altered Perceptions of
Frontier History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dee Brown, who raised awareness of the historical mistreatment of
Native Americans in his exhaustively researched 1970 book, "Bury My
Heart at Wounded Knee," died Thursday at his home in Little Rock,
Ark. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   The cause was congenital heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Brown was a librarian by training and a historian and novelist by
avocation who wrote or co-wrote more than 30 books about the American
West in a six-decade career.</LD>
<TE>   His best-selling "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" told the story of
how the West was won from the viewpoint of the 19th century Native
Americans who witnessed the last major battle between U.S. troops and
Indian nations at Wounded Knee, S.D.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which has sold more than 5 million copies and been
translated into 15 languages, altered popular perceptions of frontier
history.</TE>
<TE>   It also helped to revise scholarly views of the subject, paving
the way for so-called New Western historians who were more inclined
to see oppression than triumph in the way the West was settled.</TE>
<TE>   "All practicing historians who came of age from the mid-'70s on
were very conscious of 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,' " said
professor C. Fred Williams, an expert on the American West at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of 'Bury My Heart' was essentially to give voice to
the American Indians. They were always an important part of the
American West, usually as the indirect object. Dee Brown [made] them
the direct object."</TE>
<TE>   Brown wrote mostly nonfiction, covering such topics as the
building of the railroads and women settlers of the Old West. He also
wrote a dozen novels, among the most notable of which is "Creek
Mary's Blood" (1980), a generational tale of an Indian family's
westward journey.</TE>
<TE>   "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" was the culmination of a lifelong
fascination with Western history that began when Brown was a boy
growing up in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   He moved from his birthplace of Alberta, La., to Ouachita County,
Ark., after the death of his father when he was 5. His maternal
grandmother, who cared for him while his mother worked as a store
clerk, regaled him with tales of the Civil War and of her father's
friend, Davy Crockett, the legendary frontiersman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Aren't Real Indians'</TE>
<TE>   Many of Brown's childhood friends were Native Americans, whose
parents worked on oil rigs in the area. In a darkened theater, where
he would often join his friends to see western movies, he had what he
called his "first real revelation" about their history.</TE>
<TE>   "My buddy said to me, 'You know, those aren't real Indians,' "
referring to the characters on the screen. Brown started to read
anything he could find about Native American tribes and wondered why
they were so often portrayed as villains.</TE>
<TE>   After attending Little Rock High School, Brown worked as a printer
and reporter for the Harrison, Ark., Times. He later enrolled at
Arkansas State Teachers College as a history major. A job in the
college library helped offset his tuition costs.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression he worked, by his estimate, 50 different
jobs before he landed an entry-level position at the U.S. Department
of Agriculture library in Washington, D.C., in 1934. Within a few
years, he became head librarian at a government library in
Beltsville, Md. He was drafted into the Army in 1942 and spent most
of World War II assigned to library work at the Army's Aberdeen
Proving Ground in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Focus on the West</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Brown headed the agricultural library at the
University of Illinois, where he earned a master's degree in library
science and became a professor. He stayed for more than two decades,
moving back to Arkansas when he retired in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had been writing on the side since the 1930s, beginning with
magazine stories. His first book, published in 1942, was a novel
based on the life of Crockett, "Wave High the Banner." Over the next
several decades, he would alternate between fiction and nonfiction,
but never strayed from his abiding interest in the West.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote more than a dozen books, including several for children,
before tackling "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a cheerful book," Brown wrote in the introduction to
the 446-page tome, which took its name from the massacre at Wounded
Knee, S.D., in 1890. Four days after Christmas that year, troopers of
the 7th U.S. Cavalry encountered a band of 300 Sioux and confiscated
their weapons before slaughtering more than 150 of them, including
women and children.</TE>
<TE>   The book evolved from a notebook of speeches by American Indians
of the 19th century that Brown had been compiling for years. He was
so taken by the beauty of the Indian chiefs' words, which had been
translated into English, that he spent hours tracking down the
identities of the official interpreters.</TE>
<TE>   The trail of words, found in tribal histories, treaty meeting
records and other official proceedings, led him to the eloquent
eyewitness testimony scattered throughout the book. One of the great
chiefs he quoted was Black Elk, who tells of being haunted by the
memory of "the butchered women and children lying heaped and
scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them
with eyes still young.... A people's dream died there. "</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Brown's research led him to conclude that the West had
been won by genocide.</TE>
<TE>   "What surprised and hurt me most was how much the Indians believed
the white man over and over again," he said in the New York Post in
1971. "Their trust in authority was amazing. They just never seemed
to believe anyone could lie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Revisionist</TE>
<TE>   Brown took two years to write the book on a manual typewriter. He
persevered by telling himself every night, "I'm a very, very old
Indian, and I'm remembering the past."</TE>
<TE>   Some reviewers recoiled at what they called Brown's blatantly
revisionist motives. Others praised his painstaking research and
pronounced the book an important and compelling work.</TE>
<TE>   "Brown dispels any illusions that may still exist that the Indian
wars were civilizations' mission or manifest destiny," Peter Farb
wrote in the New York Review of Books. "[T]he Indian wars are shown
to be the dirty murders they were."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is survived by a daughter, Linda of Charlotte, N.C.; and a
son, James Mitchell of Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Brad Dexter, 85; Sinatra Pal Often Played Villains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Dexter, an actor whose first film credit, "The Asphalt Jungle"
in 1950, set the course of his career as a menacing villain on
screen, died Thursday in Rancho Mirage. He was 85 and had been
hospitalized with emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   Burly and handsome, he was often cast as a tough guy in supporting
roles beside the superstars of their day: Burt Lancaster and Clark
Gable in "Run Silent, Run Deep" in 1958, Frank Sinatra in "None but
the Brave" in 1964. He is probably best known as one of "The
Magnificent Seven," the 1960 movie that included a cast of
heartthrobs from Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson to Yul Brynner and
James Coburn.</LD>
<LD>   Dexter said he preferred supporting roles to any other kind. "I
love playing heavies," he told The Times in 1965. "It's the
best-written character. The hero is always bland."</LD>
<TE>   He was born Boris Milanovich in Goldfield, Nev. His parents were
natives of Yugoslavia and he spoke Serbo- Croatian. His friend and
fellow actor Karl Malden shared Serbian roots with Dexter.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to know each other in the Air Force," Malden told The
Times on Friday. During World War II, both performed in "Winged
Victory," a Broadway film touring unit. They remained friends and
worked together again after that.</TE>
<TE>   Dexter studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse and changed his
name to Barry Mitchell. After the war he worked on radio dramas and
appeared in plays, always as Barry Mitchell. But when director John
Huston cast him in his first movie, "The Asphalt Jungle," he changed
his name to Brad Dexter.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1950s, Dexter made guest appearances in some of the
most popular television series of the day, including "Zane Gray
Theater," "Death Valley Days" and "Wagon Train."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood gossip devotees found his personal life at least as
fascinating as his acting career. In January 1953, he married singer
Peggy Lee. Their garden wedding at her Los Angeles hilltop home was
fully reported by the press, along with details of her pink taffeta
wedding dress. Eight months later, Lee filed for divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt if I'll ever get married again," Dexter said in an
interview several years later. "I can't put up with 'What are you
doing?' and 'Where have you been?' " He did remarry, in 1992 to Mary
Bogdonovich, who died, and in 1994 to June Deyer-Dexter.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after his divorce from Lee, Dexter's name was linked to
Marilyn Monroe as a confidant. In 1954 when she planned to divorce
her husband, Joe DiMaggio, Dexter tried to persuade her to stay with
her husband. She didn't take his advice.</TE>
<TE>   Another close friendship, with Sinatra, took on legendary
proportions during the filming of "None but the Brave" in 1964. On
location in Hawaii, Sinatra nearly drowned and Dexter saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   Dexter described the incident to author Kitty Kelley for her book
on Sinatra, "His Way."</TE>
<TE>   Early news reports were that Sinatra had drowned. He did come
close, Dexter told Kelley, when a powerful undertow pulled him away
from shore while he was swimming. Ruth Koch, whose husband, Howard,
was producing the movie, was swimming with him.</TE>
<TE>   Dexter dove in and reached them when they were nearly unconscious.
He kept their heads above water until lifeguards arrived, he told
Kelley. Sinatra and Koch were brought to shore on surfboards. Dexter
was left to take care of himself.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the incident, he resisted talking about it to
reporters. "I don't like to discuss it," he told The Times. "I
consider Frank one of my closest friends." But when Kelley
interviewed him, he and Sinatra were no longer on speaking terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize now that my rescue efforts probably severed the
friendship then and there," he told Kelley. It seemed to him that
Sinatra did not like feeling indebted to anyone. "He never thanked
me, then or later," Dexter said. "I didn't see the love-hate
relationship all that clearly at the time, but it certainly became
obvious later on."</TE>
<TE>   Before their final break, they always seemed to be together,
Malden recalled. In 1965 Sinatra starred in "Von Ryan's Express" with
Dexter in a supporting role. He had named Dexter vice president of
Sinatra Enterprises, and in 1966 they made "The Naked Runner," a
Sinatra Enterprise movie with Dexter as producer and Sinatra as the
star.</TE>
<TE>   They were shooting in London when Sinatra announced his plans to
marry Mia Farrow. She was 20, he was 49. Dexter told him not to do
it. ("Brad was always outspoken," Malden said.)</TE>
<TE>   Their conversation led to the end of business dealings and
friendship. Sinatra never returned to the set. Dexter finished the
film without him and returned to Los Angeles to be told that he was
fired.</TE>
<TE>   About that time, Dexter told The Times, he was tired of acting and
wanted to do more producing.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest movie credit as a producer is "Lady Sings the Blues,"
the Billie Holiday story starring Diana Ross in 1972. He produced
"Skag" a television series with Malden as the star, in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Much as he disliked TV, he continued to make guest appearances on
popular shows, including "Mission Impossible" in 1966 and "Kojak" in
1973.</TE>
<TE>   He once said his personal life was a bit like his acting career.
He was happy playing the supporting role, even off-screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't involve myself in the world of competition they're
involved in," he said of his leading-man friends. "We have fun
together."</TE>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Dexter is survived by a stepson and three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. today at St. Margaret's
Episcopal Church, 47535 Highway 74, Palm Desert.</TE>

<HD>Anton Malloth, 90; Convicted SS Guard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Anton Malloth, a former Nazi SS guard who was sentenced last year to
life in prison for beating a Jewish concentration camp inmate to
death in 1944, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Malloth, who was a guard at the Theresienstadt camp in
Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, died of cancer at a nursing home in the
south German town of Straubing on Oct. 31 -- 10 days after being
moved from prison, Cord Lemke, a state justice ministry spokesman
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It was not immediately clear why the news of his death had been
delayed more than a month.</LD>
<TE>   Malloth was sentenced in May 2001 in Munich after one of Germany's
last trials for Nazi-era crimes. He also was convicted of attempted
murder in the shooting of another prisoner who hid a cauliflower
under his jacket during forced harvest work in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation against Malloth was closed twice for lack of
evidence but was reopened when a Czech witness came forward with new
information leading to Malloth's arrest at a Munich nursing home in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   His murder conviction was based on testimony that, in 1944, he hit
a Jewish prisoner over the head with a stick about 20 times, then
kicked him in the chest and head until he died.</TE>
<TE>   "He tortured, humiliated and killed people because he considered
them subhumans who had no right to live," Judge Juergen Hanreich said
in his verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's highest criminal court rejected Malloth's appeal in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Austria in 1912, Malloth took Italian citizenship after
World War I and became a German in 1939, the year World War II began,
so he could join the SS.</TE>
<TE>   Malloth was sentenced to death in absentia by a Czechoslovakian
court in 1948 for hundreds of killings at Theresienstadt.</TE>
<TE>   But Malloth had fled to Italy and reclaimed his Italian
citizenship. Rome revoked it after finding he had lied about his SS
past, and he was deported to Germany in 1988 because he had German
papers.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 Nazi war crimes investigations are pending in Germany,
where prosecutors in recent years reopened a number of cases against
former Nazi officers that had been dropped decades earlier.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic sexual abuse scandal has sent the public's view of
clergy spiraling to its lowest point ever -- 12 points lower than
last year's rating -- according to a new Gallup poll.</LD>
<LD>   Asked to rate the honesty and ethics of 21 professions, just 52%
of Americans gave high marks to clergy, down from 64% last year.
Ratings reached their peak, at 67%, in 1985. Overall, however, the
clergy still ranked fourth among professions, behind nurses, military
officers and high school teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Catholics gave lower honesty ratings to their clergy than did
Protestants, according to the poll. Just 50% of Catholics gave high
ratings, compared with 57% of Protestants. Both ratings are down from
five years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Gallup pollsters said clergy ratings also dropped between 1992 and
1994, the last time the Catholic Church wrestled with a sex abuse
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone poll of 1,017 adults has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II gave Israel and its president his blessing
Thursday, but he pressed the Israeli leader to allow Christians to
celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem and underlined the Vatican's
long-standing support for co-existing Palestinian and Israeli states.</LD>
<LD>   "God bless you. God bless Israel," John Paul said at the end of a
private audience with Moshe Katsav, the first Israeli president to be
received by a Roman Catholic pontiff at the Vatican. The Israeli
Embassy described the audience as "warm and cordial."</LD>
<LD>   A Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the issues
discussed at Katsav's meetings with the pope and Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, Vatican secretary of state, included the conflict in the Holy
Land, access to Bethlehem and bilateral relations.</LD>
<TE>   The wording of his statement indicated a difference of opinion on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but gave no details.</TE>
<TE>   "There was talk in depth on the dramatic situation existing in the
Holy Land in which each party expressed his point of view," the
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the pope had spelled out "the position of the Holy
See favorable to the existence of a collaboration between two states,
Israeli and Palestinian."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli Embassy said that Katsav "promised that if there are
no threats of terrorist operations, the army will withdraw from
Bethlehem and that, in any case, the army will do everything possible
to permit pilgrims to celebrate the festivities in an appropriate
manner."</TE>

<LD>In a state where everything seems bigger, a Baptist church is staging
a Christmas pageant that is pure Texas-sized.</LD>
<LD>   The cast and crew exceed 1,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes 500 people are on stage at once -- not to mention a
donkey, several sheep and three camels.</LD>
<TE>   Prestonwood Baptist Church can seat 7,000.</TE>
<TE>   The stage, which is triple the size of the one in New York's Radio
City Music Hall, measures 15,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   There's strong competition to play the five angels with
shimmering, translucent wings who "fly" along metal tracks in the
ceiling and hover above the manger.</TE>
<TE>   Winning performers are chosen on the basis of seniority and past
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 45,000 people bought tickets -- priced from $12 to $22
-- for the 150-minute spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials expect 65,000 this season.</TE>

<LD>An influential cardinal who until recently held a top Vatican post
has called the ordination of homosexuals "inadvisable," "imprudent"
and "very risky."</LD>
<LD>   The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline and the
Discipline of the Sacraments published Cardinal Jorge Medina
Estevez's viewpoint in its November-December bulletin Notitiae.</LD>
<LD>   "The ordination to the diaconate or the priesthood of men who are
homosexuals or have homosexual tendencies is absolutely inadvisable
and imprudent, and from the pastoral point of view, very risky,"
wrote the cardinal, who is from Chile.</LD>
<TE>   "A person who is a homosexual or has homosexual tendencies is not,
therefore, suitable to receive the sacrament of holy orders," Estevez
wrote.</TE>

<HD>Delores Mission Sees Homeless Men as Modern-Day Versions of
Juan Diego</HD>
<DH>They are likened to the humble peasant whom Our Lady of
Guadalupe is said to have chosen to relay her message in Mexico 471
years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Teresa Watanabe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a world that celebrates stock options, celebrities and A-list
power couples, they are nobodies. The men who huddle every night in
the sanctuary of Delores Mission Catholic Church in Boyle Heights
have no home. Few speak English. Most have no steady job, waking up
before dawn to scrounge for menial work as day laborers.</LD>
<LD>   But on a chilly night this week, in a street procession of devout
prayer and festive song, the community of about 50 homeless men was
affirmed and honored as a place where God resides.</LD>
<LD>   In the eyes of Delores Mission parishioners, the homeless men
represent modern-day versions of Juan Diego, the humble Indian
peasant whom Our Lady of Guadalupe chose -- above the powerful
conquistadors and lofty church clerics -- to carry forth her message
in the hills of Mexico 471 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   As Roman Catholics celebrated the feast days of the Virgin and the
newly canonized St. Juan Diego this week, Delores Mission
parishioners formally recommitted themselves to the cause of needy
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   They also publicly proclaimed, through one testimony after
another, a timeless biblical truth: Whether leading slaves out of
Egypt or embracing lepers and prostitutes, God smiles on the
castoffs, the poor and the weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Who we really think is important is not important in God's eyes,"
said Father Michael Kennedy, the parish's Jesuit pastor who has
devoted much of his life to aiding Latin American immigrants and
refugees. "God really does choose and make special [the] people who
are the most poor and vulnerable. It's a mystery."</TE>
<TE>   The parish's recommitment to sanctuary comes nearly 10 years after
the death of the legendary Father Luis Olivares. The fiery priest,
who died of AIDS contracted from a blood transfusion, caused an
uproar in 1985 when he and Kennedy chose to contradict U.S. foreign
policy and violate immigration laws by offering their parish at the
time -- Our Lady Queen of Angels -- as the first sanctuary church in
Los Angeles for undocumented refugees fleeing terror, torture and war
in El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   The parish's recommitment also comes at a time of rising calls for
a crackdown on the burgeoning homeless population in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, police have conducted sweeps of skid row and
downtown business owners have called for tougher laws against
sidewalk encampments and outdoor feeding.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions on the streets are even worse these days because
of the raids and crime," Kennedy said. "Now, more than ever, people
are in need."</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the dedication, the procession of about 100 men,
women and children wound through the streets of Boyle Heights as
neighbors cheered from their porches. Some strummed guitars or
carried lanterns.</TE>
<TE>   Others held homemade banners of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the
dark-skinned mother of God radiating glittering rays of light. Many
of the homeless men wore ponchos emblazoned with a handwritten plea:
"St. Juan Diego: Pray for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9 Nights of Preparation</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh of nine nights of preparation for the feast of
Our Lady of Guadalupe, whom Pope John Paul II has designated as the
patroness of the Americas. The group stopped at one house, lavishly
decorated with an outdoor shrine featuring a life-sized painting of
the Virgin surrounded with flowers, flickering candles and a backdrop
of the Mexican flag. A homeless man gave his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not only found shelter here, but also I have learned in
this community about love," the man proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   The procession ended at another home festooned with red and green
paper chains. Before another outdoor shrine, parishioners presented a
skit of the tale of Juan Diego, portraying the skepticism of the
local bishop over whether the mother of God would really appear to
such an insignificant peasant. The men were presented socks as a sign
of the church's continuing commitment to serve them, and the circle
of parishioners extended their hands to them in blessing and prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Aquino and Arturo Hernandez are two of the men who were
honored. Aquino is a 46-year-old retired police officer from
Argentina. Hernandez is a 29-year-old textile worker from Mexico.
Both say economic meltdowns in their hometowns after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks cut their incomes in half and compelled them, for
the sake of their hungry families, to make the perilous journey north
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "You see your family hungry and you say, 'I have to take a drastic
measure,' " Hernandez said. "There is great risk in leaving your own
country, but someone has to do it, so here I am."</TE>
<TE>   Both men wandered the streets for days, cold, hungry and
shell-shocked. Aquino came one month ago with $4 in his pocket, and
when that was gone he picked up odd jobs at the central produce
market and elsewhere to feed himself.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez arrived two weeks ago with the name of an acquaintance
who was supposed to help him. When the acquaintance failed to come
through, Hernandez spent cold and lonely nights at MacArthur Park.</TE>
<TE>   Through word of mouth, the two men heard about Delores Mission.
They were immediately welcomed, and given showers, hot meals and cots
in the church sanctuary. Every day, they rise at 5:30 a.m. with the
rest of the homeless men and set off to find work.</TE>
<TE>   Aquino has already landed a job as a carpenter and, he says with a
beaming smile, is able to send $140 of his $240 weekly pay back to
Argentina -- an infusion of cash just in time for his wife's
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez is still trying to find steady work, but he voices
confidence and a brimming desire for self-improvement. He has even
brought his textbooks from Mexico to study for his high school
diploma while here. He dreams of making enough money to return to his
hometown of Ensenada and start his own business.</TE>
<TE>   "I never dreamed I would ever be homeless," said Aquino, a man of
dignified mien and salt-and-pepper hair. "But from the moment I set
foot here, I have been treated with so much warmth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   14 Years as Sanctuary</TE>
<TE>   For 14 years, Delores Mission has served as a sanctuary community.
Parishioners have also operated the Guadalupe Homeless Project, which
offers temporary shelter, food, clothing, medical services, legal
assistance, spiritual guidance and classes for English and other job
skills. The program serves about 600 men a year, mostly from Latin
America, but also has begun drawing people from Canada, Germany,
Romania and India.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the program is facing an uncertain future. Cutbacks
in foundation grants and government funding have left the $240,000
program with a $100,000 budget shortfall, says program director
Arturo Lopez, prompting the community to appeal for help.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Delores Mission's parishioners say that serving the
homeless is a privilege that helps them feel the presence of God.
Their service, they say, is also part payback for what they received
during their own times of turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   The parish is filled with riveting tales of crisis, compassion and
faith. Esperanza Vasquez, 60, arrived here from Mexico 24 years ago
on her own with seven children because her husband had stopped
sending money; once here, she found that he had taken up with another
woman. She found solace and support at Delores Mission and never
left.</TE>
<TE>   Ana Zarzano's toughest times came when her husband's health
collapsed after working in a Los Angeles chemical factory with no
protective clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican native cares for her permanently disabled husband and
two children on a $7,000 annual income, mostly welfare, although this
week she was named manager of a new church-affiliated thrift shop.
Despite their tight budget, she and her family are trying to put
together food baskets for the homeless men.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is poor, but we have to help these men out because they
have no one but us," said Zarzano, who takes turns cooking for the
men while her children decorate the tables. "The more I give, the
more blessings I receive with my children and family."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Fuentes, the church's community organizer, fled his native
El Salvador in 1980 with nothing but the clothes on his back. An
active leader in the student movement at the time, Fuentes said he
vocally criticized government policies and began receiving numerous
death threats. He arrived in Los Angeles dazed, he said, and survived
only through the kindness of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "We give back because we really know what it is like to live under
tremendous pressure and limitations," Fuentes said. "Because we know
those who came after us come with the same needs."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important not to forget, not to forget," Fuentes says.
"There is joy in service. There is life."</TE>

<HD>Theodore Shackley, 75; CIA Leader Was Legendary Operative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Theodore G. Shackley, a retired associate deputy director for
clandestine operations of the CIA whose career took him from the
streets of Berlin to the jungles of Laos and Vietnam, died of cancer
Monday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   In the context of an agency and a profession whose watchwords are
secrecy and deception, Shackley was a legendary figure. He was known
as "the godfather of secret warriors." He was a three-time recipient
of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the agency's highest honor.</LD>
<LD>   Shackley spent his career on the front lines of the Cold War, and
he was involved in some of the agency's most important -- and
controversial -- operations. His rise in the shadowy world of
espionage was swift and sure. Colleagues described him as "coldly
efficient and dependable," "businesslike," and "cold, calm,
deliberate."</LD>
<TE>   In 1951, Shackley was recruited into the CIA from the Army. His
first foreign assignment was West Berlin, then the espionage capital
of the world.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, he was named CIA station chief in Miami, with
responsibility for assisting Cuban exiles bent on overthrowing Fidel
Castro. Shackley held that post during the Cuban missile crisis, when
President Kennedy's administration forced the Soviet Union to
withdraw missiles from the island nation.</TE>
<TE>   He also ran Operation Mongoose, an anti-Castro intelligence
campaign that had been ordered by Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy, the
president's brother.</TE>
<TE>   Shackley's next assignment was Vientiane, Laos. There he
supervised a "secret" CIA war in which 20,000 Hmong tribesmen were
pitted against the North Vietnamese-backed Pathet Lao. Among other
things, he ran agents into Communist China. In 1968, he moved to
Saigon as station chief.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Shackley was named associate deputy director for
clandestine operations at headquarters. The job involved worldwide
counterintelligence operations and covert action.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the CIA was no longer the freewheeling organization that
he had joined 25 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, a committee headed by Sen. Frank Church
(D-Idaho) published voluminous reports on some of the seamier aspects
of CIA operations, including plans to assassinate foreign leaders.
The agency came under close and unaccustomed scrutiny by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Adm. Stansfield Turner, a director of central intelligence
during the Carter administration, drastically reduced the clandestine
service. New technology, including spy satellites, came into use. The
role of agents on the ground was cut back.</TE>
<TE>   Shackley retired in 1979. His career appeared to have hit a dead
end, in part because of dealings he had with Edwin P. Wilson, a
former CIA agent who illegally sold explosives to Libya.</TE>
<TE>   In private life, he founded Research Associates International, a
consulting firm that specialized in risk analysis, threat assessment
and executive protection.</TE>
<TE>   Shackley also wrote three books on intelligence and security: "The
Third Option"; "You're the Target," with co-author Robert Oatland;
and "Still the Target: Coping with Terror and Crime."</TE>
<TE>   He was the subject of a fourth book, "Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley
and the CIA's Crusades," by David Corn.</TE>
<TE>   Shackley was born in Springfield, Mass., and grew up in West Palm
Beach, Fla. During World War II, he served in the Army and took part
in the occupation of Germany. After the war, he attended the
University of Maryland, graduating in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Called to active Army duty during the Korean War, Shackley was on
his way to Korea when he was ordered to Washington and assigned to
the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Hazel Tindol Shackley of Bethesda; a
daughter; and two grandsons.</TE>

<HD>Gilbert Wyland, 87; Engineered First Rose Parade, Winter
Olympics Telecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilbert P. Wyland, whose achievements during a five-decade career in
television included helping to put on the first telecasts of the Rose
Parade and the Winter Olympics, died Dec. 2 at his Valencia home. He
was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Wyland had a history of heart problems, but the cause of death was
not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime executive at CBS, he also oversaw the construction of
Television City in Los Angeles, and led innovations in electronic
news gathering and editing.</LD>
<TE>   Wyland grew up in Nebraska and studied engineering at Creighton
University in Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   He was working at the Don Lee Broadcasting System in Los Angeles
in 1939 when he helped put the Rose Parade on television for the
first time. The parade aired on W6XAO, an experimental station in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, CBS bought Don Lee Broadcasting, launching
Wyland's 46-year career at the network.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, after Television City was completed, Wyland moved in as
studio and field engineer in charge of technical operations. In 1959,
he became manager of studio and field operations. Among the shows he
worked on during this period were Edward R. Murrow's weekly program
"Person to Person" and "The Ed Sullivan Show."</TE>
<TE>   He also was the engineer on major sporting events, including the
first televised Pebble Beach Golf Tournament.</TE>
<TE>   When bidding opened for the right to broadcast the 1960 Winter
Olympic Games at Squaw Valley, Wyland spent days examining the site
and climbing the mountains to devise a plan for coverage.</TE>
<TE>   CBS was outbid by NBC and ABC, but that did not mean the rival
networks knew how to do the job. Telecasting from Squaw Valley meant
figuring out how to get the cameras and crew in place for challenging
events such as downhill skiing and how to keep the equipment from
freezing. ABC and NBC could not solve the technical problems and gave
up.</TE>
<TE>   "So we did it," Wyland said last year in an interview with the
Daily News of Los Angeles. "But the only reason we did it was because
we didn't know it couldn't be done."</TE>
<TE>   CBS won an Emmy for its coverage, which was anchored by Walter
Cronkite. Wyland, as director of operations for CBS' coverage of the
Squaw Valley Olympics, accepted the award on his network's behalf.
CBS also received a Peabody for the broadcasts, which aired over a
two-week period.</TE>
<TE>   Wyland's other major assignments over the years included directing
operations for CBS coverage of the 1960, 1964 and 1968 presidential
elections.</TE>
<TE>   From 1968 to 1977, Wyland held executive positions in CBS' general
engineering department in New York and directed the development of
electronic video-recording technology. In 1974, he became chief
engineer of all the CBS-owned and -operated stations and was involved
in the development of electronic news gathering.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to California in 1977 to oversee videotape operations
at CBS Studio Center in Studio City. He retired in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
recognized Wyland's accomplishments with an Emmy for outstanding
achievement for engineering development, also known as the Charles F.
Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Award.</TE>
<TE>   Wyland is survived by a daughter, Gail Laing of Lancaster; and a
grandson, Kenneth Laing.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Drops His Request to Have Legal Fees Paid</HD>
<DH>Orange County official had asked supervisors to pay $50,000
bill for advice in responding to a critical report by grand jury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta and Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas on Friday withdrew a
request asking the Board of Supervisors to pay $50,000 to a law firm
that helped him respond to a critical grand jury report after the
county CEO opposed the request.</LD>
<LD>   County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher was not available
Friday to elaborate on his reasons for red-flagging the item. But
Diane Thomas, a county spokeswoman, said the district attorney's
office did not follow county procedure when it retained the law firm
of Morrison and Foerster to help Rackauckas formulate a rebuttal to
the June report by the Orange County Grand Jury.</LD>
<LD>   That report faulted Rackauckas for allegedly intervening in cases
involving campaign supporters, misusing office resources and hiring
relatives of political allies instead of more qualified applicants.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly any time an outside law firm is hired, the requesting
agency must go through the county counsel's office, which presents
the proposal to the supervisors, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The board "has sole authority to select outside legal counsel,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office declined to
comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas hired Morrison and Foerster to help him draft a
response to the 92 findings and 64 recommendations in the grand
jury's report.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said the report was inaccurate and one-sided and that
the panel was unduly influenced by his political enemies. His reply,
which ran more than 100 pages, responded to the lengthy list of
accusations against him.</TE>
<TE>   The legal fees issue comes as the Orange County
auditor-controller's office is examining a special district
attorney's office fund that came under scrutiny in the grand jury
report.</TE>
<TE>   The panel accused the office of misusing the fund to entertain
politicians, lobbyists and others.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Spitzer, who stepped down last month from the Board of
Supervisors, had criticized the office for using the money to buy
alcohol, which he said was a violation of county policy.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas also came under fire from California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, whose office helped the grand jury with its probe.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said Friday that Schumacher's decision to oppose
Rackauckas' request to pay the attorney fees was a "procedural issue"
and "had nothing to do with the way the D.A.' s office runs its
shop."</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad on Friday would not say whether
she supported Rackauckas' request.</TE>
<TE>   But she noted that the board hired its own outside lawyers to sort
out the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   It is common for branches of county government to turn to outside
legal counsel when dealing with unusual cases. Rackauckas was
required by law to respond to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   But John Oetken, co-director of Common Cause Orange County, said
that because Rackauckas is an attorney, he should have been able to
write the response. "I don't think he should use taxpayer money," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Solis Seeks Better Monitoring of Pollution From Gravel Pits</HD>
<DH>Citing a new congressional report, legislator calls for
closer scrutiny of the mining operations' effects on air and water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal regulators have failed to adequately monitor the
environmental consequences of massive gravel mining that has carved
canyon-sized holes in the San Gabriel Valley, Rep. Hilda L. Solis
(D-El Monte) charged Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Gravel mining has taken place in the Irwindale area for more than
100 years, supplying the sand and rock for more than 70% of
California's roads and much of the building material for Los Angeles'
sprawling real estate development.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state air quality
officials appear to lack even the most basic information needed to
assess the mines' contributions to air and water pollution in the
surrounding area, now home to more than a quarter-million people,
Solis said.</LD>
<TE>   She based her statements on the findings of a congressional report
commissioned by her and another California Democrat, Rep. Henry
Waxman of Los Angeles, that found a lack of environmental oversight
of the gravel pits.</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel Valley residents suffer higher rates of asthma and
other respiratory ailments than others in the region, a situation
Solis and some local politicians suspect is linked to dust and
particle pollution from mining.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Irwindale, Baldwin Park, Azusa and El Monte "should
be able to get a better quality of life, and they should get better
information" on the health risks of the gravel pits, Solis said,
standing outside Geddes Elementary School in Baldwin Park.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to Solis' concerns, officials with the South Coast Air
Quality Management District announced Friday that they would begin to
monitor specific mining operations in the area.</TE>
<TE>   But they noted that they had regulated the operations for years
and have a general air monitoring station in Azusa within a mile of
most of the gravel pits. This year, that monitor found 22 violations
of the state's standard for particulate pollution, said Chung Liu,
the AQMD's deputy executive officer for science and technology
advancement.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Brink, a general manager with United Rock Products, which
runs one of Irwindale's 17 gravel pits, said the firm would cooperate
with regulators. But it is hardly lacking for oversight, he said,
noting that, he once counted 26 different governmental entities at
the local, state and federal level that were reviewing its mining
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly think we do a good job and are good stewards of the
environment," Brink said. "If you sat at my desk and saw things from
my perspective, I don't think you could say we are under-regulated."</TE>
<TE>   Solis and others at the news conference, including a woman whose
husband suffered from asthma and whose father had worked in a local
quarry, emphasized that they valued the economic benefits the mines
had brought. But they added that the health effects to which the
operations might be contributing needed a closer examination.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents in this area are absolutely right to be concerned,"
said Constantinos Sioutas, a professor and deputy director of the
Southern California Particle Center at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Particles in the lungs that are stirred up by gravel mining "stay
much longer than gases" and have been linked to higher mortality
rates, he said.</TE>

<HD>Defense Can't Use Sex Videos of Rape Suspect, Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Lawyers for the Ventura County man, accused of drugging and
assaulting three women, say tapes were evidence he was simply
producing porn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers will not be allowed to introduce homemade videos of
rape suspect Andrew Luster having consensual sex with a former
girlfriend when his trial begins next week, a judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, which comes just before opening statements Monday,
is a blow to Luster's case. His lawyers argued the tapes were crucial
evidence to rebut allegations that he drugged and raped the
ex-girlfriend at his Mussel Shoals beach house six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The defense argues that Luster, the 38-year-old great-grandson of
cosmetics magnate Max Factor, was an aspiring porn producer who
directed films in which women pretended to be asleep while he had sex
with them.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have charged the wealthy bachelor with raping three
women at his house after knocking them out with the date-rape drug
gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women called police after Luster allegedly drugged her
at a Santa Barbara bar and allegedly raped her in his home. Charges
were filed on behalf of two other women after investigators seized
tapes from Luster's home that allegedly depict more sexual assaults.
Luster faces multiple counts of rape, sexual battery, sodomy and
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have portrayed the purported victims as vengeful
ex-lovers and party girls who drank too much and are now embarrassed
by their actions. They say the videotapes support that position. But
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley ruled that the tape
excerpts are not relevant.</TE>
<TE>   "The crime charged is not videotaping," Riley stated in a ruling.
"The issue is whether the defendant was engaging in sexual
intercourse with a woman he knows to be unconscious."</TE>

<LD>Who says golfers don't get any exercise? Columnist Steve Propes of
Long Beach's Beachcomber reports that a call was made to animal
control authorities about a German shepherd "chasing golfers" on one
course.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Bottoms up! When I was a school kid -- a wiseacre school kid -- I
was swatted a few times by teachers. So I shivered involuntarily when
I received a clipping from Marian Shaw of Oxnard about what sounded
like a group disciplinary session at a local school (see
accompanying).</LD>

<TE>   No frequent-flier miles needed: David Greenstate spotted a free

<TE>   Him Tarzan: I read in the San Francisco Examiner that among those
who attended a book signing by Johnny Weissmuller Jr. was a man who
brought a loincloth signed by the entire cast of a "Tarzan" movie.</TE>
<TE>   The visitor told the author of "Tarzan, My Father" that he wanted
the loincloth appraised. Someone else offered to channel the late
actor's spirit for a million dollars. Would it have been less just to
channel Tarzan's yell?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lord of the Jungle (cont.): As it happens, I'm privileged to
say I actually heard Weissmuller's cry in person. A quarter of a
century ago, I covered a reunion of movie Tarzans on the 100th
anniversary of creator Edgar Rice Burroughs' birth.</TE>
<TE>   The good-natured Weissmuller, then about 70, was asked to render
the yell several times by TV and radio folks and me (I was trying to
figure out how to spell it). He was hoarse by the time he left.</TE>
<TE>   Three Janes also showed up, but there were no Cheetahs, which was
fine with another ex-Tarzan, Buster Crabbe.</TE>
<TE>   The one he used to work with "bit me all the time," said Crabbe.
"I'd whomp him back on the head, but it didn't bother him at all."</TE>
<TE>   Crabbe called the chimp a vulgar name. He obviously wasn't a true
ape man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Modern Crime reader, perhaps? The L.A. Independent's crime log
said that "a woman reported that a thief used her identity to obtain
a magazine subscription."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: There's one club in a golfer's arsenal that's called a
mashie. But I heard a KNX-AM (1070) radio advisory about some instant
mashies -- two sets of clubs dropped on the 133 freeway in Irvine.
Maybe the owners were still being chased by that German shepherd.</TE>

<HD>Speeding Wheelchair Users Are Put on Notice</HD>
<DH>Valley College wants them to slow down, or risk a ticket or
even expulsion. Educators say it's a safety issue; others call it
absurd.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned for the safety of pedestrians on campus, Valley College in
Los Angeles is cracking down on speeders by setting a new speed limit
of 4 mph.</LD>
<LD>   But the target isn't errant motorists. It's wheelchair users.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you speeding on campus?" asks a flier recently mailed to
disabled students. "If so, you could get more than a speeding
ticket."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, offenders face being cited or even expelled, according to
the campus office of disabled services, which imposed the new
regulations. The speed limit is 1 mph faster than the average walking
speed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a bad joke," said Lynn Eller, one of several dozen
students who navigate the Valley Glen campus by wheelchair or
electric cart. "I don't know which is more absurd -- the ticket or
the fact that this came from the office that's supposed to be helping
disabled people."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators said they issued the policy this fall because more
students are using motorized wheelchairs that can go faster but are
also heavier and can cause serious injury if they hit someone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a safety issue, pure and simple," said Tom Jacobsmeyer, vice
president of administration. "A speeding wheelchair can be just as
dangerous as a speeding car."</TE>
<TE>   Although no collisions have been reported and no citations have
been handed out on the 20,000-student campus, there have been some
close calls, Jacobsmeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   He asked the disabled services office to impose the policy after
seeing a "very petite female student" stepping out of a classroom
nearly get hit by another woman "going very fast" in a wheelchair.
"They both made pretty exaggerated moves to keep out of each other's
way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two advocates for the disabled in California say they know of no
reported injuries or problems caused by wheelchair users in crowded
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "This sounds like the bureaucratic impulse to regulate everything
in sight," said Deborah Kaplan, executive director of the World
Institute on Disability in Oakland, a public policy think tank. "Do
they also cite students who bump into each other in the hallways when
they're not looking?"</TE>
<TE>   "This seems like a solution looking for a problem," added Bay Area
disabled-rights attorney Larry Paradis, a wheelchair user. "I'm just
mystified as to why they picked this out among all the various
hazards out there. People should not be talking on cell phones and
reading while they're walking."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said anyone on campus can go to the administration
office and report someone barreling along too fast in a wheelchair.
If a warning doesn't work, alleged speeders will be cited under the
student conduct code. "We'll bring them in and say, 'Slow down,' "
Jacobsmeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Chronic offenders, however, can be reprimanded, suspended or
expelled, said Kathleen Sullivan, coordinator of the disabled
services office.</TE>
<TE>   Eller, a 56-year-old Pacoima resident enrolled in computer
courses, says campus officials have their priorities backward.
"People who aren't disabled should be warned to be considerate of
wheelchair users."</TE>
<TE>   She wants a retraction of the policy and an apology for the flier,
which states some wheelchair users are "putting other students at
risk."</TE>
<TE>   Eller said other disabled students share her opinion and many at
first thought the flier was a joke. "We figured they've got to be
kidding that we might be a danger to somebody. In fact, we have to
watch out for everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan defended the flier's message. "It had to be said because
some people in their wheelchairs go fast through crowds," she said.
"It's an awareness issue."</TE>
<TE>   She admitted, however, that some people are wondering what's next.</TE>
<TE>   A fellow administrator sent her a note that asked jokingly, "How
about cracking down on the blind? A guy could get a poke in the eye
with one of those white canes."</TE>

<HD>Soured Deal Will Be Talk of Water Meeting</HD>
<DH>A meeting of agencies that tap into the Colorado River
offers a chance to salvage a deal to reroute flows from Imperial
Valley to cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the middle of a desert, in the middle of a drought, officials from
four suspicious and sometimes feuding Southern California water
agencies are trying to revive a water deal that can satisfy farmers
and city dwellers and keep the federal government from cutting into
California's share of water from the Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are complex and divisive matters of money, hydrology and,
perhaps most important, psychology.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with a Dec. 31 deadline to make a deal, the Imperial
Irrigation District, the San Diego County Water Authority, the
Coachella Valley Water District and the Metropolitan Water District
of Southern California are pledged to meeting before, during and
after the annual convention in Las Vegas of the Colorado River Water
Users Assn., which begins Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   This year's convention was supposed to be a convivial gathering
where the California agencies could explain triumphantly how they
reached an agreement on the nation's largest transfer of water from
agricultural to municipal users.</TE>
<TE>   A panel discussion was scheduled for Tuesday in which
representatives of the four agencies could bask in the glow of
success and receive the thanks of water wonks from six other
drought-beset states that depend on the Colorado River and have been
eager for California to reduce its overuse of the river.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the convention will open amid controversy and rancor
among the California agencies and between California and other
Colorado River Basin states.</TE>
<TE>   What has the water world so riled is the Imperial board's defiant
decision last week to reject a proposed 75-year, $2-billion deal to
sell water to arid San Diego -- a deal that the Imperial board
negotiators had tentatively accepted two months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   As they arrive in Las Vegas, Imperial officials say they need
assurances that their district will not be soaked for hundreds of
millions of dollars to save the Salton Sea, the landlocked lake that
exists on agricultural runoff.</TE>
<TE>   They also want more assistance in offsetting economic damage to
farm workers and farm-dependent businesses caused by letting farmland
go fallow so that water can be sent to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   And possibly as important, they want a different tone.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in the seven-year negotiating process -- some say it was
last fall, when state Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks)
assumed the role of mediator -- the tone shifted from negotiation to
intimidation, Imperial officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be part of the solution but not at the expense of
devastating the Imperial Valley," said board President Stella
Mendoza. "If the other agencies are willing to treat us as equal
partners, with dignity and respect, we're willing to talk and try to
work out a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Grigg, engineering professor and water expert at Colorado
State University, said he is not surprised the deal fell apart when
the Imperial board members began to resent suggestions that without a
water deal the Legislature might move to disband their district or
take water without compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Farming communities take as a given that city people do not
understand the difficulties of farming, Grigg said. When that lack of
understanding lapses into disrespect, he said, the tendency of
farmers is to conclude: "Let's follow our built-in conservatism and
see if we can make this go away."</TE>
<TE>   "We see that repeatedly in agricultural communities in Colorado"
when dealing with water transfers, Grigg said.</TE>
<TE>   David Hayes, a Washington-based environmental lawyer who was
involved in the early years of negotiations as assistant Interior
secretary during the Clinton administration, agreed that the
tentative agreement of Oct. 15 may have failed to hold because
"somewhere the stick took over for the carrot."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg and other officials say they were not threatening
Imperial, just pointing out the real-life consequences of refusing to
sell a portion of their water. For historic reasons, Imperial is
entitled to 75% of California's share of the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, the Bush
administration's point man on Western water, made an unscheduled
visit to El Centro in the days before this week's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on his background as a lawyer representing an agricultural
water district outside Denver, he tried a more congenial,
I-feel-your-pain approach.</TE>
<TE>   As the West grows, transfers of water from farms to cities are
inevitable, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Best to cut a deal and make some money than wait for the cities to
use their considerable political clout, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what it's like to live under the threat of seeing water
that has been in a community for years being taken and used to
support growing needs in urban areas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a keynote speech to the convention Monday, Interior Secretary
Gale Norton is expected to deliver a tough ultimatum: Cut a deal now
or face swift and unpleasant consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Norton is expected to announce that unless a deal is reached,
surplus water allocations from the Colorado River to coastal Southern
California will be immediately suspended, and steps will be taken to
reduce the enormous allocation of water to Imperial Valley farmers.</TE>
<TE>   For the coastal region, it could mean an immediate loss of 600,000
acre-feet to 800,000 acre-feet of water a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Water District, wholesalers to six Southern
California counties, says that it has enough water in storage to
offset the loss for two years and long-term plans in the works for
conservation measures and other water purchases.</TE>
<TE>   For Imperial, Norton may threaten to rule that its enormous water
allocation is not a beneficial use, a legal finding that could lead
to reducing its share of the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   That water, in theory, could be transferred to other Colorado
River states, allowing coastal California to continue receiving the
surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "We hoped to get away from the war mode into a more collaborative
mode on the Colorado River," said Joseph Sax, professor at Boalt Hall
School of Law at UC Berkeley and former top water advisor to former
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, the river could well be reverting into a wartime
setting," Sax said.</TE>

<HD>22 Are Arrested in Drug Sweep</HD>
<DH>About $8 million in heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine
seized. Authorities say ring operated out of an Oxnard restaurant.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two brothers ran a large, illegal drug operation from their Mexican
restaurant in Oxnard, police said Friday, announcing the arrests of
the pair and 19 others throughout California.</LD>
<LD>   During a yearlong investigation involving phone tapping and
thousands of hours of surveillance, Ventura County and federal
officers statewide seized 55 pounds of tar heroin, 19 pounds of
cocaine and 6 pounds of methamphetamine, along with $120,000 cash.</LD>
<LD>   The drugs have a value of about $8 million, and there was enough
heroin and cocaine for 400,000 uncut doses, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   They described the seizure as one of the largest in Ventura County
history.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major organization; we're not talking about street
sales," Oxnard Police Cmdr. Steve Blanchard said.</TE>
<TE>   He identified Jesus Mendoza Naranjo, 39, of Santa Ana and Reynaldo
Manuel Naranjo, 36, of Canoga Park as ringleaders of the far-reaching
operation.</TE>
<TE>   They own Los Molcajetes restaurant in downtown Oxnard, where
investigators said much of the activity and money-laundering
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant has been shut down at least twice in recent years
for unsanitary conditions. Police said the brothers' primary supplier
was Saul Lopez Buenrostro, 23, of Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Also arrested in the sweep Thursday and Friday were Reynaldo
Naranjo's wife, Susana, and seven Oxnard residents.</TE>
<TE>   Suspects were also taken into custody in El Monte, Ontario, Madera
and Redwood City.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 21 California arrests, one man was arrested in
Oregon. Authorities said the investigation is continuing in Oregon,
Colorado, Texas and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The 17 arrested men and five women range in age from 23 to 61.
Oxnard police announced the arrests and displayed the drugs at their
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Also involved in the investigation were the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department, district attorney's office and police
departments in Ventura, Los Angeles and Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms and U.S. Customs Service also assisted.</TE>

<HD>Former Coach Gets Year in Jail for Having Sex With Student,
14</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say the relationship with the ex-Moorpark High
educator began a year ago. The teenager is now his wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rejecting pleas of mercy from the victim and her mother, a Ventura
County judge Friday sentenced a former wrestling coach at Moorpark
High School to a year in jail for having sex with a 14-year-old
student who is now his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Fonseca, 23, must also register as a sex offender, which
his attorney said will prevent him from ever teaching or coaching
again.</LD>
<LD>   Before sentencing, the girl's mother pleaded for leniency.</LD>
<TE>   "Andrew is living at our house, married to our daughter and he
works and supports her," the mother said. "It's been the best thing
that ever happened to her."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said later they may also file misdemeanor charges
against the girl's parents for allegedly knowing about the sexual
relationship and failing to contact authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The punishment meted out by Judge Kevin J. McGee brought tears to
the girl and visibly angered her parents, who support the marriage.
The girl's father softly uttered a stream of profanities from the
back of the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is one of the most unusual that one can imagine," McGee
said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple married in September, two months after the volunteer
coach pleaded guilty to three felonies involving the high school
student.</TE>
<TE>   McGee said Fonseca had committed a serious breach of trust and
that the case needed to be a deterrent to other teachers and coaches
in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "He violated that trust in perhaps the most egregious way possible
by initiating a sexual relationship," McGee said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, now 15, began having sex with Fonseca a year ago,
prosecutors said. The coach was the girl's mentor, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Fonseca will enter a work-furlough program Jan. 13 to serve the
remaining 100 days of his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, who sat next to Fonseca in court, told McGee she loves
her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel he needs to go back to prison or jail," she told the
judge.</TE>

<HD>Series of Fast-Moving Storms to Bring Rain, Possible
Flooding</HD>
<DH>High ocean swells and strong winds also are forecast. A
moderate El Nino condition could make winter wetter than normal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might be the weary remnants of Typhoon Pongsona, which hammered
Guam earlier this month. It could be a hint of El Nino, expected to
cause a water-logged winter for much of the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, the sunny December that has made Californians the envy
of the weather-challenged is coming to an end this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   A series of fast-moving storms will bring rain, high ocean swells
and possible flooding to the state for much of the next week.</LD>
<TE>   According to the National Weather Service, light rains are
expected in Southern California late tonight and will remain through
early Sunday. Snow is predicted for elevations above 7,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Seto, a weather specialist for the National Weather
Service, said a second storm should arrive Monday, with heavier rain
Tuesday, tapering off Wednesday. Rain is expected again next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   High surf at west-facing beaches could mean waves reaching 15 feet
by Tuesday, Seto said. Coupled with a high tide, that could bring
some flooding to Southern California coastal areas.</TE>
<TE>   Northern California, however, will bear the brunt of the storm,
forecasters said.</TE>
<TE>   The first inclement weather arrived in the San Francisco area late
Thursday, and by Friday some storm-related problems had been
reported.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco International Airport was reporting flight delays of
as much as an hour and a half because of heavy rain and winds. And
the California Highway Patrol reported that U.S. 101 was closed
temporarily Friday morning at Alemany Boulevard in San Francisco
after storm drainage systems became clogged and flooded portions of
the road.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect that conditions will worsen after the second
storm arrives Sunday evening. A high wind advisory has been issued
for the San Francisco Bay Area, where winds may gust to 50 mph to 60
mph, and waves could swell to 20 feet to 30 feet by Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Benjamin of the National Weather Service said that the initial
blast of moisture seems to be left over from the Pongsona typhoon,
whose winds gusted to 184 mph and which forced Guam's governor to ask
for federal disaster relief.</TE>
<TE>   But there's "probably some influence of El Nino," Benjamin said.</TE>
<TE>   El Nino occurs when the waters of the equatorial Pacific remain
warmer than usual for several months. Forecasters issued a report

<LD>Five lawsuits filed over the county's aborted plans to build an
airport at the closed El Toro Marine base have been settled, the
parties announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Two suits challenged the county's environmental reviews of the
airport plan; two others protested the spending of $8 million for a
public information campaign.</LD>
<LD>   A final suit questioned El Toro's inclusion in regional
transportation plans.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes nine months after voters rejected plans for an
airport at El Toro, deciding instead to build a park on the closed
Marine base.</TE>

<HD>Water Harvesting Plan Changes Course</HD>
<DH>A businessman drops his proposal to tap two North Coast
rivers for export. He vows to find other sources for his oceangoing
water bags.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A water entrepreneur announced Friday that he is dropping efforts to
tap two scenic North Coast rivers but will press ahead with plans to
harvest water from other sources in the region for export to Southern
California in gigantic oceangoing bags floated down the coast.</LD>
<LD>   Ric Davidge, president of Alaska Water Exports, said he would not
try to pump from the Albion and Gualala Rivers because of intense
local and state opposition as well as the huge costs of surmounting
California's environmental reviews.</LD>
<LD>   Davidge said it would cost as much as $1 million per river to
provide the environmental documentation required for the plan, which
involved planting a two-foot pipeline up the spine of each river. In
a letter to the state Water Resources Control Board, he said it is
clear that a big investment to overcome environmental concerns "makes
little sense in the face of no real assurance that there is any
return."</LD>
<TE>   Foes of the water export plan cheered Davidge's announcement,
which came after the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously
Friday to protest the plan, which has also drawn opposition from
several California lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Friday the 13th is our lucky day," said Ursula Jones of Friends
of the Gualala River.</TE>
<TE>   The two rivers, in Sonoma and Mendocino counties, drew support
over the last year from the region's collection of latter-day
hippies, environmentally minded urban refugees, nature-loving
merchants of tourism and bedrock farming community. Davidge vowed to
not give up. He said his company is in negotiations with several
municipal districts in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest
to purchase surplus water. The water would be loaded in poly-fiber
bags the length of a World War II battleship and towed down the coast
to communities such as San Diego and Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   He would not reveal what water districts he is talking to. But
several in the North Coast and in Oregon have surplus water for sale
because of the demise of paper pulp factories, lumber mills and fish
packing plants that used vast quantities of fresh water. In the
Eureka area, for instance, the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District
has advertised on its Web site the sale of up to 20 million gallons
of water per day for industries interested in locating in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Carole Rische, the district's general manager, said Davidge has
made contact but no negotiations are underway. She called any plan to
ship water "a political hot potato."</TE>
<TE>   Davidge said the recent decision by water officials in the
Imperial Valley to forgo the sale of water to San Diego adds momentum
to his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal regulators expressed concerns about the proposal Friday
before learning of Davidge's decision. Environmental issues range
from the effect of the bags on other boats navigating coastal waters
to impact on whale migration, scenic effects and the possibility that
a bag -- more than 850 feet long and 100 feet wide with a draft of 24
feet -- could run aground.</TE>
<TE>   Davidge has said most of those concerns are unjustified. Some
critics of Davidge say they suspect his real intent is to tap West
Coast water for international markets, or to fuel a lawsuit against
the state. Davidge called such theories "hogwash."</TE>

<HD>Rape Case Baffles Officials</HD>
<DH>The district attorney's office is asking that three Carson
students be tried as adults in alleged UCLA assault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox, Martha Groves and Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson High School officials were unable to explain Friday how three
popular students apparently eluded supervision during a
school-sponsored visit to UCLA last week and allegedly sexually
assaulted a UCLA student in her dorm room.</LD>
<LD>   Carson High Principal Douglas Waybright said school officials were
investigating the incident, which is alleged to have occurred Dec. 5
during a daytime tour of the Westwood campus. Only one teacher was
assigned to supervise 56 students during the excursion, according to
Los Angeles Unified School District officials.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA police arrested the three students the next day, using
descriptions provided by the victim and other witnesses. But details
of the alleged incident became public only this week.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Friday that
it had asked the Inglewood Juvenile Court to order that the suspects
be tried as adults.</TE>
<TE>   The two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old had not been identified,
pending their certification as adults. They were in juvenile custody,
charged with one count each of forcible rape in concert, forcible
rape and oral copulation, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "This crime was horrendous," Deputy Dist. Atty. Alex Karkanen, who
is handling the case, said Friday. "Our primary goal is to ensure a
successful prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA and Carson High on Friday, officials privately said that
planning for the visit might have been too hasty and that more Carson
High staff members should have accompanied the students.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Cox, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School
District, to which Carson belongs, said that, according to the
district's police report, the students arrived at the campus about
9:30 a.m. for a welcoming presentation. They were split into groups
and were told to meet at a certain spot on campus by 1:30 p.m. Cox
said she did not know whether any adult accompanied any group of
students.</TE>
<TE>   A Carson High teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
students had been allowed to explore the campus for several hours on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding is, they were given some free time," the teacher
said. "We've taken many trips to UCLA. Students are told not to go
certain places and if they're told they're representing Carson High
School, you expect them to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The teacher who led the field trip, Cox said, "had no indication
that anything was wrong." It was only the next day, when UCLA police
went to the Carson campus, that high school officials learned of the
alleged assault.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA policy requires that high school students on campus tours be
accompanied by one teacher or counselor for every 25 students,
officials said. But Carson High had informed the university too late
to arrange for a formal tour; the students were there on an informal
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Waybright, who has been principal of the 3,500-student high school
for four years, said he could not discuss most specifics of the UCLA
visit, but said the students had been supervised by the high school
staff. He would not say how many supervisors there were.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very unfortunate incident," he said. "We're all very
disappointed and hurt by just the notion of it, because we have a
great school here."</TE>
<TE>   Students interviewed at the campus Friday identified those
arrested as two seniors and a junior and said at least one was a
member of the football team. Cox, the district spokeswoman, said two
of the boys live together. The three are good friends, described as
popular and funny.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, police spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein said that the young
woman, accompanied by friends, went to the campus police station late
in the afternoon of Dec. 5 and reported that she had been raped. She
and others who had seen the young men on campus and near the Fir
residence hall provided detailed descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstein and other UCLA officials said that, while other sexual
attacks have occurred on the campus over the years, including an
assault in a restroom in January 2001, only one, in 1987, involved an
attack by a stranger in a residence hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very uncommon for us to have an assault like this on campus
... but the reality also is that we're in a large urban area and on
occasion bad things hap- pen."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA officials said the young men are believed to have entered the
residence hall, a four-story structure housing about 200 students, by
"tailgating" students who had opened the door to the building with
electronic key cards.</TE>
<TE>   "They apparently walked in behind the students," said Mark
Foraker, UCLA's housing director.</TE>
<TE>   "These three individuals would appear to be of a similar age, so
they would not have stood out necessarily from the students who live
here."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker said campus security and housing officials are reviewing
their security and campus visitation policies to make sure students
are protected.</TE>
<TE>   He said the review would be completed in several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, UCLA police have stepped up patrols around
the residence halls, most of which are in the northwest part of the
sprawling campus.</TE>
<TE>   And at the De Neve Plaza dormitory complex, which includes the Fir
residence hall, students heading home for holiday break Friday
expressed a range of emotions about the alleged assault, from
resignation to fear to anger.</TE>
<TE>   Several students said crime could happen anywhere. Others said the
alleged attack was a reminder that they should not walk alone from
the library to their dorms in the middle of the night or prop open
their room doors when they do laundry.</TE>
<TE>   And one second-year student voiced irritation that campus security
officers had not provided more details, letting rumors get out of
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not telling anyone what happened," said Monica Gray, a
second-year student, "But people have a right to know."</TE>

<HD>New INS Rules Put Cloud Over Parade</HD>
<DH>Without passports and visas, Mexican students drop out of
holiday event in U.S. Tougher policy also affecting surgeries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICALI, Mexico</DL>
<LD>The way band director Jorge Barrera sees it, the Grinch made an
unwelcome visit to his high school this holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   Every year for the past 16, Barrera has proudly led 150 Mexican
students over the border to march in the Christmas parade in
Calexico, Calif. Not this year.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. immigration officials have stopped approving non-emergency
waivers for Mexicans without visas. Barrera and his students are
staying home. In a push to tighten security at the border, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service is requiring all foreign
visitors to hold valid passports and visas. The change is forcing the
cancellation of planned surgeries and field trips and creating
frustration along the border.</LD>
<TE>   The impact lands particularly hard on poor families, who often
cannot afford or qualify for official documents. A Mexican passport
costs $91, and the U.S. fee for a visa, which gets a person the right
to an interview with a consulate official, runs $100 for adults and
$13 for children under the age of 15.</TE>
<TE>   Calexico's annual parade, scheduled for today, just won't be the
same without the thousands of Mexicali students and their proud
parents, said Hildy Carrillo-Rivera, executive director of the
Calexico Chamber of Commerce. Only three of the 25 Mexicali groups
that regularly participate are slated to attend, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's homeland security at work," Carrillo-Rivera said. "Unless
these little kids are going to have bombs stuffed in their backpacks,
I don't see what the threat is."</TE>
<TE>   Christmas parade day is typically one of the biggest shopping days
of the year in Calexico, where the economy has already taken a hit
since Sept. 11. Alex Stereo manager Herman Maciel said he depends on
the Mexicali shoppers and is worried that sales will be lower today
than they usually are on parade day.</TE>
<TE>   A few doors down, Calexico Beauty Supply manager Rosemary Wong
said the INS change will affect the merchants and the town as a
whole. "It's a longtime tradition and it's kind of hard to break
tradition," she said. "But after 9/11, nothing is going to be the
same."</TE>
<TE>   Barrera, whose classroom is filled with trophies and photos of his
award-winning drum-and-bugle corps, said he feels as though he was
invited, but his family wasn't. About 40% of his students at the
public school do not have visas, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Color guard member Lourdes Milagros said she cannot afford the
documents because her mother earns just $60 a week working at a
factory. Lourdes, 17, has marched in the Calexico parade seven years
in a row and can't believe she is missing this year. Her friend,
Victoria Alejandra, said she is disappointed too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair," she said. "We have gone for years and suddenly, we
can't go. It makes me sad."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials acknowledge that the children are not truly
a risk to national security, but say they have a duty to enforce
their rules.</TE>
<TE>   The policy, which permits waivers only in "unforeseen
emergencies," dates to the mid-1970s but was all but ignored in
recent years as agents routinely granted waivers for school trips to
Disneyland and Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials said they expect the change to help reduce
fraud. An estimated 3% of people who go to the U.S. on waivers do not
return, and others forge letters from funeral homes or hospitals to
get waivers, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The INS notified schools and charity organizations in November
about the change in policy. Officials began denying the waivers this
month.</TE>
<TE>   In Calexico, INS Port Director Michael Freeman said he used to
grant 99% of the waiver requests -- as many as 3,000 each month. That
number tripled each October when children were admitted into the San
Diego Zoo for free.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Freeman approved only 10% of the 735 requests. The
hardest cases are the children who want to have reconstructive
surgery in the U.S., he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a personal opinion and a professional obligation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Liza Davis, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, said
officials will consider requests for surgeries and field trips on a
case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be fairly liberal in our interpretation," she
said. "We're not saying it's going to be a rubber-stamp, but we want
to help as many kids travel as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Adolfo Beltran, whose family runs a tour bus company in Mexicali,
said he canceled 57 trips this month, a loss of roughly $100,000 in
business.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said his company in the past has carried about 30,000
Mexicali schoolchildren to theme parks throughout Southern California
every year.</TE>
<TE>   The field trips are the only opportunity many children ever have
to leave Mexico, Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this new law is to protect the U.S. border, but I think
the government is sending the wrong message to Mexican schools,"
Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   At Fresh Start Surgical Gifts, an organization that provides free
reconstructive surgery to children, spokeswoman Sabine Soddemann said
the change in INS policy will make it difficult to continue assisting
Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Fresh Start employees had to beg immigration
officials to allow 80 scheduled doctor's appointments in the U.S. to
go on as planned. The INS gave them a 30-day grace period, Soddemann
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soddemann said the nonprofit organization plans to work with
families to get the necessary documents and anticipates having to
raise additional funds to pay for passports and visas.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all patients who can't pay for medical treatment," she
said. "I'm concerned for future patients."</TE>
<TE>   At the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, Deputy Consul General
Javier Diaz said he doesn't believe the decision-makers in Washington
were taking into account the effects locally when they decided to
stop granting waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz said he hopes that INS and State Department officials will
continue to show some leniency. "Life must go on at the border," he
said. "We feel this is one region and this sort of thing only makes
it difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo-Rivera of the Chamber of Commerce said she unsuccessfully
tried to convince INS officials to change their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a wonderful relationship with our sister city and
this is not helping," she said. "What bothers me most is that the
government is raining on my parade."</TE>

<HD>Black Leaders Caution Chief</HD>
<DH>They back Bratton on the need to stem gangs, but fear a
poor choice of words will alienate South-Central.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster and Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prominent African American leaders are raising concerns over what
they view as overly harsh language used by Police Chief William J.
Bratton regarding gang violence in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Since taking the reins of the LAPD, Bratton, long known for being
outspoken, has called criminals "mental nitwits"; said of a suspect
who fled from police, "hang 'em high"; and termed the city's gang
members domestic terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Statements such as these have led several black leaders to express
criticism at a meeting with Mayor James K. Hahn, and in conversations
with Bratton. The admonishments, the first that Bratton has faced in
nearly two months on the job, serve as an indication of the fragile
sensitivities that underlie the LAPD's relations with minority
communities.</LD>
<TE>   What has most upset some in the African American community is the
perception that the department has declared a war on gangs, a
characterization Hahn and Bratton say they have sought to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Urban League President John Mack and Ken Lombard, the president of
Earvin "Magic" Johnson's development company, voiced their dismay in
their recent meeting with the mayor. They took issue with the
militaristic terms the chief has used to outline his department's
efforts to combat gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal leaders, including former state Sen. Tom Hayden and Father
Gregory J. Boyle, have also expressed concerns about the more fiery
aspects of Bratton's rhetoric, which they say is counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference early this month in South Los Angeles in
which Bratton and Hahn announced new anti-gang initiatives, Bratton
told reporters that the federal government should help stem gang
activity, which he termed "homeland terrorism." Asked if the war on
terrorism might make it difficult to get the attention of the federal
government, Bratton responded: "They need to get preoccupied with the
internal war on terrorism as well."</TE>
<TE>   Mack said that while he has no problem with the concept of waging
battle against gangs, he fears that excessively tough talk from the
chief may lead to overzealous officers on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "The admonishment I shared with [Bratton] and Mayor Hahn in my
meetings with them is that it is very important that in the process
of making the case against crime in South-Central the case is not
over-made," Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   Other leaders have expressed similar concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not against the police. We are with the police," said Tony
Muhammad, Western regional minister of the Nation of Islam. "But
watch your language."</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said he has yet to hear an adequate definition of a gang
member from top city officials, leading him to believe that they are
applying the tag only to "blacks and browns."</TE>
<TE>   "We are with the police chief when he says: 'Get angry.' We are
angry," Muhammad said. "But how do you differentiate between a
gang-banger and my brother?"</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who spent Friday morning at the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels being blessed by a cross-section of the city's religious
leaders, said after the service that he takes exception to anyone who
says that he has not taken care with his choice of words.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have been very careful with our language in terms of
reaching out to the community," said Bratton, who plans to meet with
Muhammad next week. "We are not going in as they did in the 1980s
with Operation Hammer.... The idea that we're going to go in and
fight to the death, we're not going to do that at all."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn, who got a bounce in his approval rating after he
selected Bratton, said Friday that he has intentionally not used
words such as "war" or "battle" to describe the city's efforts to
stem rising violence.</TE>
<TE>   At the appearance with Bratton in South Los Angeles earlier this
month, Hahn said, "We cannot and will not let gang members control
the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Friday that when he talks about the toll of gang crime,
he has repeatedly stressed the loss of those killed or hurt and those
imprisoned.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he and Bratton have talked about this issue.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn over the years -- and people let you know -- that
sometimes what you say is heard differently based on the context and
experience of the listener," the mayor said in an interview.
"Simplistic sound bite phrases like 'war on gangs' do not adequately
reflect the multi-pronged effort that we have to be very involved in
and can be counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Friday that he would not "raise gang members to the
level of going to war with them."</TE>
<TE>   In his address to religious and political leaders, Bratton noted
that "Gandhi, the great leader of the nonviolence movement, said that
to create change, you must become the change. We must all find a way
to become part of the change."</TE>
<TE>   Mack said that much of the message from the new chief has been
right on target.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us in the past have tiptoed around the problem of
violence in our community, worried that racists and white
supremacists would seize on it and use it against us," Mack said.
"But I think we have to face up to the fact that violence is a
serious problem in our community."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he cautioned the mayor and Bratton that anything said about
South-Central Los Angeles will be viewed by residents there through
the perspective of history, particularly the long-standing tensions
between the African American community and LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   And Mack said he has warned Bratton to be careful not to alienate
individuals in the community, such as Muhammad, who have
long-standing track records of working with gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Lombard, who was with Mack for the meeting with Hahn, said
"everybody still thinks [Bratton is] the right guy for the job."</TE>
<TE>   "We just need to recognize the differences in language that we're
using.... It's not what you say, it's how you say it," said Lombard,
who also serves as president of the Department of Water and Power
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said he and others who work to prevent gang involvement
are gearing up to do more. He plans to gather 100,000 African
American men in Los Angeles for a march for peace this spring, with
smaller marches scheduled in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said he also has asked for 30,000 men in South-Central
Los Angeles to step forward, get out on the streets and ask gang
members to "settle their differences and lay down their guns."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Friday that he welcomes such help from the community
and looks forward to sitting down with Muhammad next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he can be a very significant force for change," Bratton
said. "Perhaps we can agree to disagree on a term here and there."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he has been adamant that the department not repeat
mistakes that led to the LAPD's Rampart corruption scandal, which he
believes occurred in part when officers broke the law believing they
had a mandate to rid the area of crime and gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also said he believes Bratton understands that he cannot
alienate the people he is trying to protect and serve.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the mayor said, it's easy to get mad.</TE>
<TE>   "You're standing there looking at a photo of a 14-year-old who's
been killed and holding hands with a mother whose tears are still
fresh, you do get angry," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful about our choice of words here.... That is
the bottom line."</TE>

<HD>Nurses Vote for Union</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organized labor scored a major victory Friday as nurses at the West's
largest hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, voted to join the
California Nurses Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, according to the union, was 695 in favor and 627 against
in balloting that began Wednesday and concluded Friday night.The
effort to organize 1,511 nurses at Cedars-Sinai was rancorous, with
union supporters and opponents accusing one another of deceptions and
intimidation.</LD>
<LD>   It was a high-stakes fight: The union already represents 45,000 of
the more than 150,000 registered nurses in the state and a majority
of those in Northern California. It is now targeting Southern
California, where victories at large hospitals such as Cedars-Sinai
in West Los Angeles are of strategic importance.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's victory will help union organizers convince nurses at
other hospitals to support unionization, said Rose Ann DeMoro, the
union's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now going to see a wave of organizing through Southern
California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses at the West's second-largest hospital, Long Beach Memorial,
joined the union in November 2001. On Sunday, the union signed an
agreement raising pay for those nurses an average of 21% over three
years and improving retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   DeMoro said the win at Cedars-Sinai was especially significant
because the hospital's opposition campaign "was one of the most
vicious I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   The union has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations
Board alleging that the hospital interrogated nurses about the union
drive, conducted surveillance of nurses and threatened to fire
employees backing the union, all in violation of labor laws. The
hospital says the allegations are without merit. Nurses at
Cedars-Sinai who supported unionization said they sought better pay,
retirement benefits and working conditions. Cedars-Sinai had argued
that a union was not needed because management has been responsive to
nurses' needs. Hospital officials note than nurses' salaries
increased 5% this year, with an additional 5% increase for nurses
with at least 20 years' experience. The hospital says that it also
absorbed a 25% increase in health insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its campaign against the union, the hospital argued
that nurses should be represented by a professional organization
rather than a union. That argument was appealing to many. Betty
Nersesian, a nurse who has worked at the hospital for 25 years, said
a union would degrade nurses' professional standing.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't go to school to hold a stick and walk a picket
line," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Eva Buenconsejo, a Cedars-Sinai nurse for 20 years, said a
union is necessary to give nurses the power to negotiate with
management.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt our voices were not heard before. We need a unified voice
through collective bargaining," she said at nearby restaurant where
nurses gathered late Friday to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Drilon, another union supporter, said she understands the
union may not be able to win everything she and other nurses want
from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Our eyes our open," she said.</TE>

<HD>Mediator Steps In on Bus Impasse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal mediator in a long-standing dispute between a bus riders
advocacy group and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority issued
an 80-page ruling this week, providing a road map for the two sides
as they come up with a plan to ease bus overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by Washington lawyer Donald T. Bliss, came after the
MTA and the Bus Riders Union reached an impasse in discussions of a
1996 federal agreement.</LD>
<LD>   That agreement, called a consent decree, was issued after the Bus
Riders Union sued the MTA, contending that it violated civil rights
by providing poor bus service. The two sides, whose representatives
meet at least once a month to discuss solutions to overcrowding, rely
on Bliss if they reach an impasse.</LD>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Bliss intervened by ordering the MTA to add
buses. More recently, representatives have been unable to find common
ground since the MTA lost its bid to have the Supreme Court review
the consent decree in March.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss wants each side to consider factors outside the MTA's
control, such as car accidents, as they examine overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   But Bliss also notes that part of the problem is that the MTA does
not have enough buses and that some overcrowding comes from poor
management, exemplified by such things as buses that never make it
into service because of repair problems.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bliss' plan, much of the burden will probably fall on the
MTA to devise a plan within the next few months that is acceptable to
the union.</TE>
<TE>   Among the possibilities: The agency could add scores of additional
buses to its fleet of about 2,200, or could offer to add
higher-capacity buses.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides can't come to an agreement, the matter will be
kicked back to Bliss, who will then issue orders to the MTA.</TE>

<HD>Dump Truck Kills Girl, 13, on Her Way to School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 13-year-old girl, walking in a crosswalk to her El Monte school,
was struck by a dump truck carrying sand to a school construction
project and killed instantaneously 10 minutes before school began
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Anh Mong Tran was an eighth-grader who loved singing and was
looking forward to participating in the holiday program at Durfee
Middle School, her family said.</LD>
<LD>   The dump truck driver told police he looked both ways at Maxson
Road and Star Street, but did not see Tran stepping off the curb
before he attempted to make a left turn from Maxson onto Star, said
Sgt. Bob Roach of the El Monte police.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, who was not identified or charged, did not appear to
be driving drunk or under the influence of drugs, but he was given a
blood test, Roach said. The truck underwent mechanical tests to
determine if it was functioning properly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl lived two blocks from school. Her family expressed anger
that a crossing guard was not stationed at the intersection. Her
uncle, Ken Doan, said there was heavy truck traffic while children
walked to and from Durfee and a nearby elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   El Monte's school superintendent, Jeff Seymour, said the school
district employs a limited number of crossing guards and that the
Maxson-Star intersection was not considered dangerous. The district
has no control over when trucks deliver building materials for a gym
that is being constructed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten psychologists and counselors were on hand Friday to counsel
the more than 400 students.</TE>

<HD>City Council OKs Seizure of Johns' Cars</HD>
<DH>Bratton says a similar law worked in New York. The ACLU may
challenge the measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council gave initial approval Friday to a law
that would allow police to seize and sell vehicles used by motorists
while soliciting prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance, which was given unanimous council approval but
requires a second vote next Tuesday, was endorsed by Police Chief
William J. Bratton as a way to address a problem plaguing some Los
Angeles neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton said a similar law proved effective in New York City when
he headed the department there. "It's intended to be another tool to
discourage people from using their cars to solicit prostitution,"
Bratton said after the vote.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD officials said the department has primarily targeted
prostitutes and pimps for enforcement action in the past. Friday's
vote represents the city's most ambitious effort to go after their
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you dry up the market, hopefully [the prostitutes] will go
away," said Capt. Michael Downing, commanding officer of the
Hollywood Division, which accounted for 2,000 of the city's 3,100
prostitution arrests this year.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, drafted by Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents
Hollywood, is based on similar ordinances in Oakland and Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Once people realize they can lose their car, LaBonge said, it will
reduce the number of motorists driving into Los Angeles neighborhoods
looking for prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you come to Hollywood and disrespect the neighborhoods there,
the Police Department is going to take your wheels and put you on
your heels," LaBonge said.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance was opposed by Ramona Ripston, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, who said
it unfairly allows police to confiscate property even if the suspect
is never charged or convicted of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "On the face of it, it's clearly unconstitutional," Ripston said.
"There is a lack of due process."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU sued to challenge the Oakland ordinance three years ago,
but that measure was upheld in legal proceedings that went all the
way to the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Ripston said her office will review the Los Angeles law to see if
there are differences that might allow a new legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Police envision using the law as part of sting operations in which
female police officers pose as prostitutes and tape solicitations
before making arrests.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the police have probable cause to believe that a
vehicle was used in the commission of soliciting prostitution,
officers can immediately seize the vehicle as a nuisance, according
to the proposed measure.</TE>
<TE>   If the city attorney determines the facts warrant forfeiture of
the car, a notice is sent to the owner, who then has 10 days to file
a claim opposing forfeiture with the Superior Court. If no claim is
filed, or if a judge rules against the vehicle owner, the vehicle can
be sold with the proceeds divided between the Police Department and
the city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The forfeiture proceeding is a civil process separate from the
criminal process, and a car can be forfeited even if the motorist is
not convicted of a criminal act.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney has discretion to not pursue a vehicle in cases
of hardship and, in other cities, some motorists have been able to
buy back the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners and residents in areas of Los Angeles where
prostitution is rampant welcomed the plan, saying drastic action is
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you eliminate the customers, you eliminate the sales," said
Flip Smith, a tire store owner who has organized a business watch
program to fight prostitution and drug dealing along Sepulveda
Boulevard in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn said she is glad the city is finally
going after the men who solicit prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is an important way to curb prostitution," Hahn
said. "I like this because sometimes I think our prostitution laws
unfairly always target the women."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles measure is already garnering national attention.
"Tonight Show" host Jay Leno joked in his monologue Thursday that the
real punishment for the men who lose their cars will be having to ask
their wives for a ride to work the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced the forfeiture idea may have other applications, the
council also voted unanimously Friday to ask the city attorney to
draft a law allowing the seizure of cars used by gang members in
committing crimes.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Campaign Fines for Mattel, Others</HD>
<DH>Former officer and a consultant laundered money in
political races, including Davis'.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state commission on Friday approved $218,000 in fines against
Mattel Inc., a former executive for the El Segundo-based toy maker
and a political consultant, ending an investigation into political
money-laundering.</LD>
<LD>   The state Fair Political Practices Commission voted unanimously to
fine Mattel $72,000 for failing to properly disclose contributions.
The panel fined a former Mattel senior vice president, Fermin Cuza,
$88,000 for laundering Mattel funds in political contributions.
Political consultant Alan Schwartz was fined $58,000 for aiding and
abetting Cuza in the scheme.</LD>
<LD>   "Political money-laundering is among the most egregious violations
of campaign finance laws because you are deliberately flouting the
disclosure rules and intentionally not disclosing where contributions
come from," said the commission chairwoman, Karen Getman.</LD>
<TE>   When combined with fines levied by federal and Los Angeles ethics
officials, Mattel, Cuza and Schwartz will pay a total of $931,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cuza signed an agreement with the commission in which he admitted
using $52,000 in Mattel funds to reimburse himself and others after
they made 56 contributions to 25 state and local political campaigns
between 1996 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigns that received the funds included those for Gov. Gray
Davis; Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer; state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del
Rey); County Supervisor Don Knabe; Los Angeles City Councilman Nick
Pacheco; L.A. City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo; and former Los Angeles
mayoral candidates Xavier Becerra and Antonio Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation found no evidence that the candidates knew the
contributions were laundered or that Mattel officials other than Cuza
were aware of the scheme, according to Julie Bilaver, an attorney for
the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Bilaver told the panel that Mattel has changed some practices to
prevent future abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just astonishing to me that a company as large and
sophisticated as Mattel would have a scheme like this going on under
its nose," Getman said.</TE>
<TE>   "A scheme this big that went on for this length of time is not
something we see all the time," she added.</TE>

<HD>MTA to Introduce Additional Rapid Bus Routes</HD>
<DH>Transit agency builds on its popular, innovative system
with service on Vermont, S. Broadway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanding one of its most successful traffic-busting projects, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Sunday will unveil two new
Rapid Bus routes in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The red-and-white Rapid buses, praised by the Federal Transit
Administration for innovative design, will begin offering service on
Vermont Avenue and South Broadway. The new routes are part of the
MTA's planned 24-line expansion of the Rapid Bus system, meant to
create a network of the lines throughout dense parts of Los Angeles
County by 2008.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the true success stories in transit project
development anywhere in North America," said MTA spokesman Ed
Scannel, noting that transit agencies across the country are starting
Rapid Bus lines based on the MTA model, which first went into service
two years ago. "As a result, we want to expand the number of Rapid
Bus lines as quickly as possible. This is just the start."</LD>
<TE>   To increase speeds and mimic the effectiveness of light rail,
Rapid buses have special features, such as the technology to keep
traffic signals on green at intersections as they approach, shaving
trip times by about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The initial two Rapid Bus routes, on Ventura and Wilshire
boulevards, have proved remarkably successful since their inception
in 2000. The Rapid Bus on Wilshire, which runs from Santa Monica to
Montebello, is the MTA's busiest bus route. It has nearly 50,000
boardings each weekday, helping nearly double bus use on the Wilshire
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   The 11.9-mile Rapid Bus route on Vermont Avenue will run from the
Red Line station at Sunset Boulevard and Vermont to the Metro Green
Line. The new route on South Broadway will run from Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles to the Green Line.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is spending at least $110 million to create 24 new Rapid
Bus routes, to be competed by 2008. To handle the crush of patrons
expected on the routes, the agency plans to buy larger buses while
repaving some roads to help the buses run more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA will offer free service on the two new routes on Sunday
and Monday.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Christmas: Ahoy, Thar She Glows</HD>
<DH>Trees don't grow on water, do they? When the season comes
around, 71 plywood Christmas specimens are towed out and enjoyed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a moonless night over the Colorado Lagoon, perfect for the
occasion. Christmas carols filled the air. Chatting along the shore
of the inland waterway were about 300 festively dressed people. They
hushed as the countdown began.</LD>
<LD>   Then, the dark lagoon was alight, as 11 "trees" glowed with bright
Christmas bulbs. The residents of this Long Beach neighborhood burst
into applause.</LD>
<LD>   "Ta-da!" proclaimed a little girl in the crowd, clapping her
mittens.</LD>
<TE>   This is the 53rd year that holiday trees have floated on Long
Beach's waterways.</TE>
<TE>   A tradition begun in 1949 with one real Christmas tree on Alamitos
Bay has grown into 71 tree-shaped wooden pyramids on pontoons
anchored around the city. It is a holiday tradition kept afloat
financially by residents.</TE>
<TE>   Strung with multicolored lights, the trees grace several harbors,
bays, lagoons, city park lakes and the dockside of a private
condominium complex.</TE>
<TE>   From Thanksgiving through December, depending on neighborhood
preference, the lights are switched on nightly, the electricity costs
borne by residents' groups sponsoring the trees.</TE>
<TE>   The season began, as it does every year, on Alamitos Bay, where
the lights went on Thanksgiving night, much to the delight of several
families who chased their dogs or kids at low tide, admiring the
18-foot-tall trees from the Belmont Shore beach fronting the bay.</TE>
<TE>   A residents' group, Trees on the Bay, is responsible for many of
the floating trees, with 24 on both sides of the 2nd Street bridge
connecting Belmont Shore with Naples Island. Over the years, Trees on
the Bay has raised its funds in various ways. A local artist who
illustrates T-shirts with floating trees makes donations from his
sales to the group.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had garage sales, bake sales, you name it," said Marlene
Middough, head of the group. "Back in the earlier days, we did
everything. I used to have to replace light bulbs myself."</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, a restaurateur, Don May, unknowingly began a tradition
when he whimsically floated a real Christmas tree in Alamitos Bay,
which is on the east side of the city.</TE>
<TE>   May lived in Belmont Shore, where he owned a Hawaiian-themed
restaurant on 2nd Street, a place memorable for its Polynesian
cocktails and brothel decor. Longtime residents said it closed years
ago. Legends restaurant and sports bar occupies the spot now. But in
its heyday, May's restaurant was a popular hangout, and he was a
larger-than-life personality.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread about his tree, and the practice continued each year.
In 1953, living trees were replaced by the wooden triangles, although
no one involved today can remember why. May died a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For a number of years, the city picked up all the costs. But in
the early 1970s, the energy crisis threatened to kill the program,
said Chris Sanburg, the city's marine maintenance supervisor who
oversees the triangle trees.</TE>
<TE>   Residents came to the rescue. Homeowner groups paid the cost of
illuminating each of the wooden trees -- about $150 per tree. The
city pays for towing the trees out of storage and provides
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the number of residential groups sponsoring trees
has grown to five. The trees can now be found in Alamitos Bay,
fanning out from the 2nd Street bridge and along the channel between
Naples Island and the peninsula; in Rainbow Lagoon and Rainbow Harbor
near downtown; on Spinnaker Cove and in the lakes of El Dorado and
Heartwell parks.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, in the Colorado Lagoon, which meanders around the
Belmont Heights neighborhood inland from the shore.</TE>
<TE>   The night the trees were lighted in the lagoon this year,
residents of the Heights and other parts of the city met at a party
which itself has grown into a tradition over the last 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the lifeguard office draped with twinkling lights, a table
was decorated and covered with cookies and hot cider that never ran
out, despite the large crowd. Last year's turnout was slightly bigger
than this year, which was attributed to the rain forecast (it came
later) and Hanukkah falling on the same night.</TE>
<TE>   The lighted trees, mirrored in the water, helped illuminate the
beach in front of the lifeguard office, where people bundled in
sweaters and mufflers discussed holiday shopping, family visits and
the latest developments in the battle over the lagoon's water
quality, over which the residents have sued the county of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Two choirs from Woodrow Wilson High School sang holiday songs. A
fire engine with siren blaring arrived with Santa Claus aboard. While
the fire engine was a great attraction for little boys -- one
3-year-old threw his arms around the bumper -- Santa was the main
event.</TE>
<TE>   Within yards of the twinkling trees, a long line stretched across
the beach with children who sat with Santa and made their Christmas
delivery specifications. Each child got a candy-filled stocking and a
framed Polaroid memorializing the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Tom and Lou Gallagher have come to mark the tree lighting since it
started more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Heights residents for 30 years, they have brought various
grandchildren over the years. But this year, the couple -- she 81, he
83 -- made the party alone.</TE>
<TE>   "When you drive by it," he said of the lagoon, "it looks just
wonderful."</TE>

<HD>Get a Smallpox Shot? Even Doctors Divided</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Charles Goodman is a pediatrician, one of the front-line
health-care workers who will take care of children if they are
exposed to a bioterrorism attack using the deadly smallpox virus.</LD>
<LD>   But despite President Bush's decision to step up efforts to
vaccinate doctors and other health-care professionals against a
smallpox outbreak, Goodman, who practices in the San Fernando Valley
community of West Hills, says he will not take the vaccine -- nor
will he give it to his own two children. Other doctors say the same
thing. More than a third of 60 doctors surveyed at L.A. County's
Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, in Sylmar, said they either wouldn't
take it or were unsure.</LD>
<LD>   "I would be afraid to take it," said Goodman, who will counsel
parents in his practice to study the side effects of the vaccine
before requesting it for their children. "The side effects are
serious, including death."</LD>
<TE>   Bush, citing a risk to public health from wholesale vaccination of
Americans, stepped back Friday from earlier indications that he would
make the vaccine available to all.</TE>
<TE>   He said that medical professionals would be offered the vaccine on
a voluntary basis and that the administration was recommending they
take it. And Bush ordered that military personnel and government
employees in "high-risk parts of the world" be immunized. He said the
government had stockpiled enough of the vaccine to immunize all
Americans, should it become necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision to take the vaccine or provide it to one's
children is a difficult one. Most people know little about this
relatively primitive vaccine, which does not contain live smallpox
but does contain a live virus called vaccinia. It can have severe
side effects for children, people with depressed immune systems or
anyone who has ever had eczema or other skin conditions. It is not
recommended for anyone who is pregnant or nursing.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the nation, parents, doctors and others wrestle with a
decision that at best is based on a combination of fear and faith --
fear that a smallpox attack is imminent and faith that the vaccine
will be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm terrified," said Linda Sides, 29, who was shopping with her
husband and two children in the St. Louis suburb of Town and Country.
"I think about it every day. I have nightmares. I would do it to
protect my beloved children, and myself."</TE>
<TE>   Sides said she would give her children the vaccine if she knew
that it did not contain a mercury preservative, which some parents
fear causes neurological damage. But her husband, Tony, hesitated to
go even that far.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just talk," he said of the smallpox threat.</TE>
<TE>   Working the late-lunch crowd at a Miami cafe, Silvia Stanechuk
said she would feel more secure if her 10-month-old son were
vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it would be good or not for my baby, but it would
make me feel more at peace," the 23-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Data Wanted</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, elementary schoolteacher Elliott Cruzata said too
little is certain about the vaccinations to allow him to decide.</TE>
<TE>   "There's got to be more research," he said. "They've got to give
us more information before we can make our decision."</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Siman, 45, co-owner of a clothing boutique in downtown
Ventura, credited politics more than health concerns with her
decision not to vaccinate herself or her three children. "I don't
want to give [the Bush administration] the satisfaction of putting
everyone into this terrorist panic," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Carolyn Seiler, a mother of two from Huntington Beach, said
she is "petrified" of a smallpox attack and figures there must be
something to the threat if the administration is recommending
vaccinations for soldiers and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the president knows something about a smallpox threat to
be thinking about taking these steps," said Seiler, 44.</TE>
<TE>   It is the recommendation of the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention that persuades Dr. Pejman Salimpour, a
pediatrician practicing on L.A.'s Westside and Sherman Oaks, he will
take the vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we will be the first line of defense against [an outbreak],
we can't afford to be ill," Salimpour said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Larry Gardner, a Las Vegas surgeon, agreed and downplayed the
vaccine's side effects, saying they were more likely to affect people
already weak or sick.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're perfectly healthy, the risk is significantly less,"
Gardner said. "I absolutely would be vaccinated."</TE>
<TE>   Like large health-care agencies throughout the country, the Los
Angeles County health department has developed plans to vaccinate 100
volunteers at each of its 83 hospitals. Those emergency room doctors
and nurses, along with other medical specialists, laboratory workers
and support staff members, could then begin administering
vaccinations around the clock, should a case of smallpox be detected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Front-Line Uncertainty</TE>
<TE>   But even here, where doctors and nurses know they would be on the
front lines of an attack, health-care workers are torn about whether
to be vaccinated. The union that represents nurses and other hourly
workers opposes the plan, which union representatives say would not
protect health-care workers from potential side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Annelle Grajeda, executive director of Local 660 of the Service
Employees International Union, criticized the Bush administration
Friday, saying it had granted the company that makes the vaccine
immunity from lawsuits if people develop side effects, while
encouraging workers to take the vaccine. The legal immunity was part
of Homeland Security legislation passed by Congress and signed by the
president.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Lefkowitz, a nurse at the county Women's and Children's
Hospital, said the vaccine places people at "unnecessary risk."</TE>
<TE>   "Health-care workers do not want to lose income or their jobs if
they can't work as a result of the vaccine," Lefkowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Steven Murphy, a third-year family practice resident at
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said the county should provide screenings
to ensure that people receiving the vaccine aren't at greater risk
for complications.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and administrators were divided at private hospitals as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Rigg, medical director of West Oaks Urgent Care in
Canoga Park, said he would not require his staff to be vaccinated
because the risks are too great.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Brian Johnston, who runs the emergency room at White
Memorial Medical Center, said he would be vaccinated, despite the
risk of side effects.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather be a little sick than a little dead," he said.</TE>

<HD>MWD Taps Rice Farms for Water</HD>
<DH>Deals with Northern California districts could rescue
coastal cities forced to cut down on their use of the Colorado River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Facing a sharp reduction of water from the Colorado River, the Los
Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District has quietly negotiated
options with Sacramento Valley rice farmers on enough water to supply
1 million Southern California households for a year.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike California's Imperial Valley, the economically hard-pressed
rice growers here are open to the idea of selling water to coastal
cities, at least for the short term. Earlier this week, the Imperial
Irrigation District resisted state and federal pressure and rejected
a proposed water transfer to San Diego that would have helped meet
California's obligation to cut back on its use of Colorado River
water.</LD>
<LD>   "I think most of our landowners would be amenable to sharing some
water," said rice farmer Bruce Rolen, board member of the
Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District, Northern California's largest water
agency with 170,000 irrigated acres under its control.</LD>
<TE>   "It could not have been more different than the attitude we faced
in Imperial," said Timothy Quinn, Metropolitan Water District
president for state water project resources.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with the rice growers began in September when
Metropolitan Chief Executive Ron Gastelum instructed Quinn to
approach 14 regional water districts here about water-options
contracts "as a hedge strategy against the possibilities of
shortfalls from the Imperial Valley."</TE>
<TE>   To Quinn's surprise, almost all of the water districts quickly
embraced the idea, reaching tentative agreements within a month.
Since then, Quinn said, two other Northern California districts have
approached him offering to sell water.</TE>
<TE>   With the breakdown of the Imperial Valley deal, the Northern
California rice farm options now look particularly farsighted.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the complexity of California's ground-water supply system.
When sources dry up in the irrigated desert near the Mexican border,
the effects can be felt 600 miles north on snowy Mt. Shasta,
headwaters of the Sacramento River that supply the hardpan clay soils
in Colusa, Glenn and Butte counties.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of water involved, about 205,000 acre-feet, is more
than the amount at stake in the final version of the Imperial-San
Diego water transfer. The conclusion of the agreements with the rice
farmers is key to the Southern California water agency's contention
that it has a two-year supply of water available even if the federal
government makes good on its threat to cut Colorado River supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan officials agreed to pay more than $2 million for
options on the rice-land waters, amounting to about $10 per
acre-foot.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers will get that money even if the MWD never lays claim
to the water.</TE>
<TE>   In the event it does need the water, Metropolitan will pay the
Sacramento Valley districts an additional $90 an acre-foot, pumping
$20 million into the beleaguered local farm economy here.</TE>
<TE>   The price for the Northern California water is a lot less than the
$258 an acre-foot the Imperial Valley would have received in the deal
it rejected.</TE>
<TE>   But given the current low commodity prices for rice and heavy
competition from foreign growers, the option price was attractive to
Rolen and other local farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Many here had already stopped planting portions of their land
because of a 2001 deal to sell water to Westlands, a large Central
California water district that had run dry.</TE>
<TE>   In the Westlands deal, Rolen, 48, a third-generation California
farmer, let 174 of his 400 acres go fallow, for which he was paid
about $30,000 calculated on the basis of the water he would not use
to irrigate the land.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen said he put all of the extra money back into his property,
leveling his idle fields and investing in equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine that 98% of the farmers here would do the same thing,"
he said, surveying one of his rice field levees as a huge flock of
sandhill cranes strutted a few hundred feet away.</TE>
<TE>   However, some local businesses that depend on the farmers' trade
are not so sanguine about the effects of a water transfer.</TE>
<TE>   To reassure local communities about third-party impacts, Quinn
said MWD has offered to add a $5-per-acre-foot community service fee
to the price it pays for the water.</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough to console Jerry Davies, a Colusa diesel fuel
dealer.</TE>
<TE>   "If nobody moves a wheel on a tractor," Davies said, "We aren't
selling anything."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Bottini, owner of the John Deere farm equipment company
here, also is nervous. "I worry that once the water is transferred it
will set a dangerous precedent, especially after the Imperial Valley
thing."</TE>
<TE>   One major difference is that the idea of idling farmland in order
to slake the thirsts of coastal city dwellers does not offend rural
sensibilities here the way it does in the arid Imperial Valley.
There, farmers' families struggled to make the desert bloom a century
ago, and they have a hard time making sense of a deal that would
require them to allow any of that land to revert to desert.</TE>
<TE>   Colusa County farmers would have reacted the same way 20 years
ago, Rolen said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had even mentioned water transfers the answer would not
only have been 'no' but 'hell no!' But nowadays, we've been through a
couple of these things, and we've reached a kind of reasonable
comfort zone with the idea."</TE>
<TE>   But Donald Bransford, Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District chairman
and a major local rice grower, cautions against comparisons between
agreeable northerners and recalcitrant Imperial Valleyites.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial board, Bransford noted, balked at a deal lasting
decades into the future, whereas the Sacramento Valley proposal is
for only one year.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were facing a long-term arrangement," said Bransford, "I
think you might get the same reaction up here that you have in the
Imperial Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Bransford and others also think, however, that in a pitched
political battle for water between their sparsely populated northern
farm country and the urban coast, the farmers would end up losers.</TE>
<TE>   As such, they speak a language here that would be virtual
sacrilege in the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bransford: "I truly believe that you are not going to put a
wall up in the north state and prevent water from moving south. If
you are not willing to cooperate, then the state is going to come and
take your water anyway."</TE>

<HD>Tide Is Out</HD>
<DH>Tradition goes only so far at Alabama, with Franchione
jumping ship and Riley not jumping at the opportunity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They got a name for the winners in the world;</LD>
<LD>   I want a name when I lose.</LD>
<LD>   They call Alabama the Crimson Tide.</LD>
<TE>   Call me Deacon Blues.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steely Dan, 1977</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Classic rock, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   A generation later, the eighth day of a mighty rough patch in
Alabama's decorated football history passed Friday with another loss.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, those looks of pity and mocking laughter aren't reserved
exclusively for Southeastern Conference weakling Vanderbilt anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Tide has turned -- crimson, in anger and
embarrassment:</TE>
<TE>   * A steamroller has crushed the bobble-head dolls made to resemble
former coach Dennis Franchione, who shocked the school by resigning
Dec. 6 to move to Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   * The school chose Friday to tell alum Mike Riley to get lost
after he'd requested four more days before deciding if he should
accept a coaching contract worth $1.3 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   * And the "Bama Village" chat room topic with the most responses
is titled, "Arrogance is killing our football program."</TE>
<TE>   As the days dwindle to the 20th anniversary of famed Crimson Tide
coach Paul "Bear" Bryant's final game, the mood surrounding the
Tuscaloosa faithful has become as dreary and cold as on that 1982
night in Memphis when the frigid, aged Bryant paced away the final
seconds of his career in the Liberty Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a proud fan base," said Tommy Ford, director of the
university's donor club, Tide Pride. "What has happened this week is
a sensitive, emotional issue. Maintaining the tradition since Bryant
left ... things haven't gone our way. We have to get over that and
look to the future."</TE>
<TE>   Doing so hasn't been made easier with so many significant public
slaps in the face of one of the nation's most accomplished football
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Franchione was only days removed from his second season when he
announced last week he was leaving. Weeks earlier, Franchione, who
led the Crimson Tide to a 10-3 record, had turned down a 10-year
contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   That burned several 'Bama followers for several reasons, beyond
the betrayal many felt at his unexpected departure as the team
confronts four more years of NCAA probation, 21 lost scholarships and
bowl game bans this year and next.</TE>
<TE>   One Alabama fan said: "It's settled in my mind -- the dude knows
he's a fraud, he's a liar, and no one trusts him at all."</TE>
<TE>   When about 3,000 Franchione bobble-heads showed up in stores for
Christmas sales, customers bought them, then disfigured them,
swatting them at driving ranges and positioning them in the path of a
steamroller.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest insult to Tide fans is that Franchione
backtracked Bryant's steps from Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's time at Texas A&amp;M, to be reenacted tonight in an ESPN
movie, "The Junction Boys," ended in 1957, when he left the Aggies
for Alabama. When asked why he would depart A&amp;M for 'Bama, Bryant,
who'd played at Alabama, replied with a legendary answer: "Mama
called."</TE>
<TE>   He then took the Tide on a 232-46-9 run that featured 13 SEC
titles, 24 consecutive bowl game appearances and six national
championships.</TE>
<TE>   "An Aggie?" a Tide fan wrote of Franchione's move. "What is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Ken Gaddy, director of the Paul W. Bryant Museum in Tuscaloosa,
acknowledged the elitist edge to Alabama followers.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what the expectation and the standard is here," Gaddy
said. "What college team doesn't put a national championship on top
of their goal chart each year? That's reasonable here, and that's a
positive -- to know you're a little higher up on the hill than
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Tide Pride's Ford conceded there is a second school of
thought emerging: How the mighty have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   South Florida Coach Jim Leavitt, a potential replacement for
Franchione, declined to pursue Alabama's interest, accepting a
$2.8-million, five-year deal at his school that left university
President Judy Genshaft taunting, "Alabama, eat your heart out."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Kevin Scarbinsky of the Birmingham News: "Ouch. Dissed by a
school where the coaches work in a trailer park. Someone might want
to remind USF's madame president to look at next season's schedule.
The Aug. 30 opener: South Florida at Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   Scarbinsky lamented the Crimson Tide's dose of humility, adding,
"The [NCAA] death penalty might not be as cruel and unusual as what's
happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Riley episode was more salt in the wound.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, an assistant coach with the New Orleans Saints who was a
Crimson Tide defensive back under Bryant and is a nephew of former
Alabama basketball coach Hayden Riley, was the pick, despite his 1-15
record as the San Diego Chargers coach in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of accepting a contract offer from Alabama Athletic
Director Mal Moore, Riley asked for a delay -- to consider the offer
of a dollar-pinching West Coast school. With his family living in
Southern California, Riley is expected to meet with UCLA's Dan
Guerrero sometime after Sunday's Saints' game against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' offer is expected to reach a maximum of $1 million,
with incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Time was, coaches would leave their families for a chance to lead
'Bama.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a coach here is the top job in the state," Gaddy said.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining candidates for the position include Washington State's
Mike Price, Oklahoma State's Les Miles, Oklahoma assistant Mike
Stoops and West Virginia's Rich Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Riley's elimination from consideration, Moore said,
"There's been a lot of interest in this job -- I mean, a lot of
interest -- from all over the country. It just takes time.</TE>
<TE>   "It is imperative that we hire the best possible coach, someone
who is a good fit ... and often that does not follow a set routine."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Alabama is engaging in spin control.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Notre Dame took three weeks to find its coach last year, and
they ended up in a good situation," Larry White, Alabama's sports
information director, said.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to what might be perceived nationally, the sun has still
risen all eight days we've been without a coach."</TE>

<HD>Palmer Wants to Take the Fifth</HD>
<DH>His chances of adding to USC's Heisman total, so remote at
the start of the season, are down to one in five tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Light and sound technicians scurried about the Yale Club on Friday,
transforming the huge main lounge into the cozy setting for tonight's
Heisman Trophy announcement.</LD>
<LD>   Front-row seats were reserved for USC quarterback Carson Palmer
and four other finalists, who will be poised before one of sports'
most recognizable statuettes during the nationally televised one-hour
ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   When Palmer arrived at USC as a freshman in 1998, he dreamed of
hearing his name called and accepting the award as college football's
most outstanding player. But he never allowed himself to truly
believe it was possible.</LD>
<TE>   "It's such a farfetched goal," he said. "You can't really see
yourself up on the podium."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer might be holding the trophy and delivering an acceptance
speech if he wins what is expected to be one of the closest Heisman
votes in history. Iowa quarterback Brad Banks, Penn State running
back Larry Johnson, Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey and Hurricane
running back Willis McGahee are other finalists for an award
presented annually since 1935.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, a fifth-year senior, is trying to become the fifth USC
player, and first Trojan quarterback, to win the Heisman. History,
however, is not on Palmer's side.</TE>
<TE>   Only three of the 21 quarterbacks who won the Heisman were from
West Coast schools -- Terry Baker of Oregon State in 1962, Gary Beban
of UCLA in 1967 and Jim Plunkett of Stanford in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   No player from a West Coast school has won the Heisman since USC's
Marcus Allen in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmer's performance against the toughest schedule in the
nation and his showcase effort in the regular-season finale against
Notre Dame might have been enough to sway Heisman voters in six
regions across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about it," said Palmer, who passed for 3,639
yards and 32 touchdowns with 10 interceptions this season. "It's such
an honor just to be a part of the whole thing. I wasn't thinking
about any of this when the season started."</TE>
<TE>   Neither, apparently, was anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   After passing for 39 touchdowns with 39 interceptions in
three-plus seasons, Palmer's name did not appear on major Heisman
Trophy watch-lists. He was not even featured on the cover of USC's
media guide. All-American safety Troy Polamalu garnered that spot
while Palmer made a cameo on the back in a photograph with Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, however, seemed to display a new maturity in a prime-time
Labor Day opener against Auburn, driving the Trojans to a
game-winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   His Heisman campaign began in earnest after he passed for a
school-record 448 yards and five touchdowns in a 44-33 victory at
Oregon on Oct. 26. USC's sports information office sent a promotional
postcard to national media outlets. The "V.I.P. Pass" for the "The
Carson Show" featured a picture of Palmer on the front and detailed
his achievements on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer played well in the next two games against Stanford and
Arizona State, then finished in spectacular fashion. He passed for
254 yards and four touchdowns in a 52-21 rout of UCLA and made
national highlights when he somersaulted after being hit on a dive
near the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   The following week, he torched Notre Dame for 425 yards passing
and four touchdowns as the Trojans routed the Irish, 44-13, and
earned an eventual berth in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Palmer was named to the All-American team selected by
the Football Writers Assn. of America and also won the Johnny Unitas
Golden Arm award as the nation's top senior quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he lost out to Banks for the Davey O'Brien Award
given to the nation's top quarterback; Johnson won the Maxwell Award
as the nation's top player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really great to be player of the year, but somehow I feel
like I've been fattened up for New York," Johnson told the Associated
Press. "I think I've won all the awards I'm going to win. I think the
Heisman is going to go to somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey is the only Heisman finalist who began the season among the
favorites to win it. Last year, he finished third behind winner Eric
Crouch and Rex Grossman. Dorsey, a senior, is 38-1 as a starter and
has the Hurricanes on the verge of winning a second consecutive
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be nice to win it, but it won't ruin my season
or career if I don't," said Dorsey, who passed for 3,073 yards and 26
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, a backup as a junior in 2001, led the nation in passing
efficiency (60.1%) and threw for 2,369 yards and 25 touchdowns with
only four interceptions. Last week, he edged Palmer in voting for the
Associated Press player-of-the-year award.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, a senior, led the nation with 2,015 yards rushing and
averaged an NCAA-record 8.02 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee, a sophomore, rushed for more than 100 yards 10 times and
finished with 1,686 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns, both school
records. He completed the regular season with a flourish, gaining 205
yards and scoring six touchdowns in 39 carries last week in a 56-45
victory over Virginia Tech that sent the Hurricanes to the Fiesta
Bowl against Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was 8 years old in 1988 when Rodney Peete became the first
USC quarterback to be named a Heisman finalist. Peete finished second
to Barry Sanders, and USC's legacy of producing Heisman-winning
tailbacks such as Mike Garrett (1965), O.J. Simpson (1968), Charles
White (1979) and Allen (1981) was safe.</TE>
<TE>   If Palmer wins today, he does not expect that legacy to change.</TE>
<TE>   "It will still be Tailback U," he said. "It would still be four
Heismans to one, so they would definitely have the upper hand on me
there.</TE>
<TE>   "But it will be fun to see how it all turns out."</TE>

<HD>Birmingham Wins City Title</HD>
<DH>Patriots score early, often in upsetting Taft, 35-7, to
claim school's first football title since 1963.</DH>

<LD>Not many people gave Lake Balboa Birmingham a chance in its rematch
against Woodland Hills Taft in the City Section championship football
game Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Taft was rarely challenged in its 13 victories and came in looking
to erase the memory of last season's heartbreaking loss to Dorsey in
the title game.</LD>
<LD>   But a season's worth of single-minded focus became a night of
embarrassment for the Toreadors, who had beaten the Patriots in a
West Valley League game Nov. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Birmingham showed why it is tough to beat a team twice as it
dominated both sides of the ball in a shocking 35-7 victory before an
estimated 6,000 at the Coliseum. It was the school's first City
football title since 1963.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA-bound running back Dennis Keyes, who has tormented Taft in
the past, rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, the Patriots won the battle on defense, forcing three
turnovers while not committing any on offense. Birmingham's victory
continued a trend in which the loser of the regular-season meeting
has won the City title in four of the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   All week Birmingham (11-3) insisted it was a better team than it
showed in the first meeting. The Patriots showed it by opening the
game with a picture perfect 80-yard drive to take a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Ryan Lombardo completed a 32-yard pass to Brian Baylor
on the game's first play from scrimmage. Lombardo stayed hot on the
drive as he hit Kyle McCleary and Chad Green for consecutive 11-yard
gains.</TE>
<TE>   On second down at the Taft 28-yard line, Baylor got around
linebacker Wallace Bates along the right sideline and hauled in a
touchdown pass from the senior transfer from Newbury Park. Lombardo
completed all four passes for 82 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots continued to put the pressure on as they forced two
first-quarter turnovers. Green and Garrett Feig forced a fumble by
quarterback Cary Dove and Alex Martinez recovered at the Birmingham
25-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor capped a 13-play, 75-yard drive with a 14-yard scoring run
as he got a big block from offensive tackle Phillip Cerda.</TE>
<TE>   Another break came when Dove and tailback Ian Bell mishandled an
exchange in the backfield and Birmingham's Deshon Brookins recovered
at the Taft 37.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots then went to the ground with Keyes and the senior
tailback gained 25 yards on five carries. Keyes went over left tackle
for a one-yard touchdown run to give them a 21-0 lead early in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   With Taft reeling, Birmingham went back to ground as its offensive
line continued to dominate the battle up front. Using a two tight-end
set put in this week, Baylor and Keyes traded off for positive
yardage and picked up three of the Patriots' 16 first downs in the
half.</TE>
<TE>   The only mistake came with 27 seconds left in the half. Dove began
to get into a rhythm and he found Noah Smith on an out pattern. Keyes
went for the ball but lost Smith and the senior receiver weaved his
way into the end zone for a 28-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only sign of life for Taft, which hadn't trailed by
more than eight points this season. Late in the third quarter, the
Toreadors moved the ball down to the Patriot five-yard line but
couldn't score on four downs as Steve Smith dropped a second-down
pass and Keyes had two pass deflections.</TE>

<HD>How Low Will They Go?</HD>
<DH>Listless 98-82 home loss to New Orleans leaves them at
9-15, in virtual tie for last place, with no end to their struggles
in sight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal left Friday night's game with nearly three minutes
remaining, and a few people clapped, politely.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant sat to O'Neal's right half a minute later, and
together they stared glumly off at another pre-Christmas loss, at a
season they can't get their arms around.</LD>
<LD>   Another night gone. One more shrug. Last June's championship
growing ever smaller, this June's ever more unlikely.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of a week in which they didn't seem particularly fond
of each other or of themselves, the Lakers had another ounce of their
season, of their invulnerability, drift away.</TE>
<TE>   The New Orleans Hornets defeated them, 98-82, at Staples Center,
and then Phil Jackson, the losing coach, applauded the lesson he
hoped it brought. The Lakers are 9-15, in a virtual tie for last
place in the Pacific Division, now after O'Neal challenged the rest
of them to do something, and the rest of them said they're ready when
he is.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever goes on during the course of the week, obviously it had
to be good for a team to come out and have this kind of defeat, to
really level out the energy," Jackson said. "We need to open up the
pores and get a good sweat and what that will do, hopefully, is expel
the negative things that are going on.</TE>
<TE>   "This team really needed this type of loss. It's a matter of
folding in and fitting in together. It's not easier to do, nor is it
easy to reconcile. They are willful young men in the business and we
have to deal with those egos a lot. But, the coach has to sit on his
most of the time."</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers allowed 60 points in the first half and then
scored 34 in the second, Jackson considered how they had fallen.
O'Neal has played near his potential for at least the last two games,
and the Lakers have lost both. He had 28 points and 10 rebounds
against the Hornets, and the Lakers were never closer than 11 points
in the fourth quarter, never closer than nine in the second half,
after leading by eight in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After Jackson preached defense and ball responsibility for two
full practice days, the Lakers allowed 98 points and had 16
turnovers. Worse, after standing at a dismal 3-9 without O'Neal, they
are only 6-6 with him, with Jackson preaching patience with the
current roster configuration, and General Manager Mitch Kupchak
handcuffed by unmovable players.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he presumed his team had bottomed out, both in terms
of spirit and effort. Asked if he detected doubt among his players,
he looked surprised at the very question of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "they certainly must have doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Part of Jackson's touch is in his handling of the regular-season
grind. No matter the appearance, Laker teams have arrived into three
straight springs with lively legs and clear minds because Jackson did
not give in to the allure of 70 wins, or even 60.</TE>
<TE>   They played as hard as they had to, were blistered in the media
for playing without fire, were derided for their lapses against the
league's poorer teams, and then won championships, sometimes gliding
to them.</TE>
<TE>   It seems Jackson won't have that luxury this April, as he'll have
had to push the Lakers through defensive possessions, through long
trips and back-to-backs, and who knows what other trials.</TE>
<TE>   They've changed, there's little doubt of that now.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the bottom for us," forward Robert Horry said. "We
haven't been in a situation like this.... You look out there and you
try to figure out what you're doing wrong, whatever we're not doing
right, and what we need to do. We just need to figure it out. It's
like we're running in mud every time we go out there."</TE>
<TE>   After playing in Utah on Thursday night, the Hornets scored 29
points in the first quarter and 31 in the second. Jamal Mashburn
finished with 21 points. Baron Davis had 18 points and eight assists.
The Hornets had seven turnovers and 11 steals and reached most loose
balls half a step before the nearest Laker.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as close to the bottom as we can get," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left without speaking. Caught up to in the hallway, he
shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no remedy, just hard work and intensity," Jackson said.
"It starts with real intense play over a duration of time.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to figure out what's wrong and remedy what has to be done
to get back. Some habits will be broken. Things need to be fixed."</TE>

<HD>No Reason for Guerrero to Be All Riled Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And you thought Bob Toledo ran some crazy plays.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA's search to replace him has thus far resembled a first-down,
double-reverse pass from a freshman quarterback to a shaky receiver.</LD>
<LD>   The quarterback is Dan Guerrero.</LD>
<TE>   The receiver is Mike Riley.</TE>
<TE>   This thing has trouble written all over it.</TE>
<TE>   In hiring a new football coach, Guerrero has an opportunity that
occurs at UCLA only every six years.</TE>
<TE>   He's trying to do it in six seconds.</TE>
<TE>   By making one phone call.</TE>
<TE>   To a guy who, as a head coach, is on a nine-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Several qualified candidates have emerged for a job that became
vacant only this week, but Guerrero seemingly made up his mind last
month.</TE>
<TE>   An athletic director doesn't fly cross-country to meet somebody
hours after firing his old coach ...</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't set up that candidate with the chancellor before
interviewing anybody else ...</TE>
<TE>   That candidate doesn't then turn down a much more lucrative job at
his alma mater ...</TE>
<TE>   Unless the match has already been made.</TE>
<TE>   Forget this talk about an interview today with former Bruin
receiver and current Denver Bronco assistant Karl Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   If Dan Guerrero hasn't already chosen Mike Riley, then they've
wasted a lot of winking and nodding and nudging.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Guerrero has never been the boss of a football program
before, this is sort of like a first-time home buyer signing a
contract inside the first front door on the first day of his
house-hunting trip.</TE>
<TE>   C'mon, Dan. Not even an inspection contingency?</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Riley is a bad guy. He's a great guy.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, a secondary coach with the New Orleans Saints, looks and
talks like a football guy, yet acts like a regular guy.</TE>
<TE>   Recruits love him. Alumni want to hang out with him. The media
generally adore him.</TE>
<TE>   One of his ink-stained admirers was even pushing for him, in this
section, earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   But there's something those stories neglected to include.</TE>
<TE>   It's something that virtually every fawning story about Mike Riley
fails to include.</TE>
<TE>   His record.</TE>
<TE>   In five years as an NFL and college head coach, he is 22-48.</TE>
<TE>   Think about that.</TE>
<TE>   Would any coach in America still have a job if, after five years,
he had lost twice as many games as he'd won?</TE>
<TE>   The spin on Riley is that he coached in those awful,
impossible-to-win spots of Corvallis, Ore., and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, but after Riley left Oregon State, Dennis Erickson brought
an energy that turned the Beavers into winners.</TE>
<TE>   And after he left San Diego, Marty Schottenheimer brought a
discipline that turned the Chargers into winners.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that Riley, who earned his reputation largely
on the blessing of former NFL guru Bobby Beathard, wouldn't do well
with UCLA's great athletes.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not Jimmy Johnson or Bill Parcells.</TE>
<TE>   And wouldn't those have to be the only sorts of names that should
make the UCLA athletic director blow off everyone else?</TE>
<TE>   Such as, say, a Karl Dorrell?</TE>
<TE>   There are two raps on the Bronco assistant coach, the first being
that he has no college experience.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Riley has won eight more college games than Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   The second rap is that, because he is a former Bruin from a
beloved Rose Bowl era of the early 1980s, he brings too much alumni
baggage.</TE>
<TE>   The theory goes, if you let this guy in, all sorts of former
players come with him, hanging out at practice, walking the sidelines
at games, calling Guerrero at home, thinking they own the joint.</TE>
<TE>   To which every disillusioned former Bruin should say:</TE>
<TE>   What is wrong with that?</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely that sort of alumni involvement that helps USC
football maintain its edge over UCLA football, even during those
years when silly columnists claim otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The cliche is an absolute truth: In football, you are a Bruin for
four years, but a Trojan for life.</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of Trojan alumni involvement that, while driving
local media crazy with myopic correspondence, helps foster unity and
maintain tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Ask any former Bruin football player during the week of the
USC-UCLA game. He will be dismissive of USC's team, but jealous of
its alumni's pregame gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   The critics who think Dorrell would be a threat to Guerrero
certainly don't think much of Guerrero's toughness.</TE>
<TE>   And they certainly discount Dorrell's reported smarts, which
should have earned him more than what appears to be a courtesy
interview.</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of other folks Guerrero could also have considered.</TE>
<TE>   Why not give a serious interview to Washington State Coach Mike
Price, who was contacted by UCLA on Friday?</TE>
<TE>   Why not have a serious talk with former Bruin assistant Greg
Robinson?</TE>
<TE>   Why not ring up former Bruin assistant and Pac-10 vet Rich Brooks?</TE>
<TE>   Why not spend a few more minutes, with a few more candidates, just
to make sure that a guy with the .314 winning percentage and USC
pedigree is the right person to run UCLA football?</TE>

<HD>Riley Rejects Alabama for a Chance With Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Orleans Saint assistant Mike Riley turned down a lucrative
multiyear offer from Alabama on Friday but insists that UCLA has
given him no assurances he will become the next Bruin coach.</LD>
<LD>   "UCLA has not tipped its hand in any way on what it is going to
do," he said.</LD>
<LD>   However, the next several moves by the Bruins are clear --
including interviewing Washington State Coach Mike Price and,
perhaps, Kansas City Chief assistant Greg Robinson.</LD>
<TE>   First, however, Bruin Athletic Director Dan Guerrero will
interview Denver Bronco assistant Karl Dorrell today. Dorrell, 39, is
a former Bruin receiver who has the support of a large alumni
contingent, including Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel.</TE>
<TE>   And Sunday, Riley, 49, will fly to Los Angeles after the Saints
play a home game and meet with UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale.
Sources at UCLA said that an offer is not necessarily forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Former Oregon coach Rich Brooks, another potential candidate who
many Bruin supporters would like to see interviewed, said Friday he
has not been contacted by UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said no to a reported eight-year, $12-million offer from
Alabama after Crimson Tide Athletic Director Mal Moore pressed him
for an answer Friday. The job was offered to Riley on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Alabama for some time so I could visit UCLA, and Alabama
felt like it needed to get going," Riley said. "I understand that,
but it was also important for me to explore the UCLA situation, so we
went in different directions.</TE>
<TE>   "I want that opportunity to be a head coach again, but I'm taking
my time to make sure it's the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   Riley's wife and two high school-age children live in Solana
Beach, near San Diego, and want to remain in Southern California. If
UCLA affords him the opportunity, it will be for far less money than
he could have made at Alabama, his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is expected to offer a base salary of about $700,000 with
incentives that could raise the total close to close to $1 million a
year. Coach Bob Toledo, who was fired Monday, had a rollover contract
that allowed UCLA to buy him out for $1.3 million. There is no
indication that the new coach would get a contract structured any
differently.</TE>
<TE>   A hurdle could be the $750,000 guaranteed Riley next year by the
San Diego Chargers, whom he coached to a 14-34 record from 1999-2001.
He doesn't get the money if he takes another head coaching position
and UCLA is not expected to absorb the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell has no such concerns. He has never been a head coach, and
many UCLA boosters laud his work the last two years with the Broncos
and in the 1990s as the offensive coordinator at Colorado and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel, a former UCLA quarterback and assistant, has said he is
not a candidate and was not contacted by UCLA. However, he said on a
Seattle radio show Friday that he and former UCLA coach Terry Donahue
discussed their support for Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   "Donahue and I did talk, but not about the UCLA job," Neuheisel
said. "We were talking about Karl Dorrell and how best to get Karl an
opportunity. I was hopeful he would get an interview and get a start
as a head coach."</TE>
<TE>   While Guerrero is in Denver today to interview Dorrell, he could
interview Robinson as well because the Chiefs visit the Broncos on
Sunday. The Bruins, as of Thursday night, had not contacted Robinson,
a former UCLA assistant who has the support of Chief coach and former
UCLA coach Dick Vermeil. But with Guerrero apparently expanding the
search beyond Riley and Dorrell, Robinson could be in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson has been described as volatile, but other knowledgeable
football sources believe he would be a solid choice who would command
the respect of college players.</TE>
<TE>   Price, of course, is a proven college coach, and that UCLA
received permission to interview him will please many Bruin
supporters. Washington State will play in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1,
and Price, 56, has never been a hotter commodity in his 14 years at
the school.</TE>
<TE>   He fits UCLA's price range, making a base salary of $600,000,
although incentives will increase his compensation this year to about
$900,000. His record is 83-77 at Washington State and the Cougars
have lost to rival Washington five years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Price also is being mentioned as a candidate at Alabama. Should
UCLA go in a different direction, Riley said he would not regret
spurning the Crimson Tide.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried at all how this goes," he said. "I'm really
interested in UCLA, and I needed to give myself a chance to be a part
of that situation. This has nothing to do with negotiations of any
sort, UCLA has promised me nothing and, frankly, I'm very comfortable
with the way things have gone."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Poses Dilemma That Parallels Iraq</HD>
<DH>The communist regime, with a huge army and nuclear
potential, is more dangerous to U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>An impoverished totalitarian regime. A reclusive leader who wields
power through a cult of personality. Surreptitious plots to develop
weapons of mass destruction. A penchant for blustery rhetoric and a
distaste for international arms inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   While the world has been fixated on Iraq, a hemisphere away, North
Korea is presenting an uncannily parallel dilemma. North Korea's
declaration Thursday that it intends to resume its nuclear program,
along with a confession in October about a secret project to enrich
uranium for weapons, has inconveniently intruded on the Iraq crisis
at a sensitive time.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq and North Korea are worlds apart in culture and ideology, and
even North Korea's harshest detractors don't consider its leader, Kim
Jong Il, to be another Saddam Hussein. But the diplomatic
hand-wringing over two charter members of President Bush's famous
"axis of evil" is very similar.</LD>
<TE>   Like Iraq, North Korea is not terribly popular in the
neighborhood, but its neighbors are nevertheless fearful of the chaos
that might ensue if the regime collapsed. As with Iraq, the United
States is consistently moving several paces ahead of its allies in
pressing a hard line toward North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that no
military action is contemplated against North Korea, its position
that it will not negotiate until the regime shows signs of compliance
is at odds with the views of South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a vicious circle of negativity surrounding North Korea,
just like with Iraq. The approach of the Bush administration is
essentially the same even if they say it is not: no talking," said
Moon Chung In, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   From a policy standpoint, North Korea is arguably more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Although North Korea has a population of only 24 million, about
the same as Iraq's, it maintains a standing army three times the size
of Baghdad's. The Korean People's Army, as it is called, is
considered the fifth-largest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. congressional testimony earlier this year, the
North Koreans have 1.2 million soldiers under arms, more than 12,000
artillery systems, 1,700 aircraft and the world's largest submarine
fleet. Most of the force is deployed near the demilitarized zone that
divides the two Koreas, putting it within easy striking distance of
Seoul -- and of the 37,000 U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Korea remains a place where U.S. forces could almost
instantaneously become engaged in a high-intensity war involving
significant ground, air and naval forces. Such a war would cause loss
of life numbering in the hundreds of thousands and cause billions of
dollars in property destruction," Gen. Thomas Schwartz, the outgoing
commander of U.S. troops in South Korea, testified before the Senate
Armed Services Committee this year.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea is believed to have a program of chemical and
biological weapons, but unlike Iraq's, its stockpiles were not sought
and destroyed in the 1990s by weapons inspectors. Only its nuclear
program has been subject to inspection, and that is about to come to
an end if North Korea carries through with its threat. The North
Korean government Thursday asked the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna to remove its camera equipment and seals from
nuclear facilities .</TE>
<TE>   The United States' closest allies in Asia, Japan and South Korea,
have been loath to openly criticize the Bush administration, but
there is no doubt that they would prefer to open a dialogue with the
North sooner rather than later. South Korean President Kim Dae Jung,
who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts vis-a-vis North Korea,
has been very vocal in calling for a U.S.-North dialogue without
preconditions.</TE>
<TE>   And even as North Korea was declaring this week that it would
restart its nuclear program, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi and other officials were calling for negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, North Korea test-fired a long-range Taepodong rocket over
Japan. This week's threat to renew testing was seen as an explicit
warning to Tokyo, with which North Korea has begun to discuss
normalization, but that too was shrugged off by Japanese officials.</TE>
<TE>   "One can use both a carrot and a stick with North Korea, but if
you use a stick and it fails, the results will be devastating," said
Roh Moo Hyun, the ruling party candidate in South Korea's
presidential election next Thursday. In an interview Wednesday with
the Los Angeles Times, Roh said: "North Korea is different from
Iraq.... If it is attacked, it can strike back."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Bush administration's Iraq policy say that North
Korea is much more dangerous than Iraq and that a double standard is
being applied in which the North is being protected from U.S. attack
by its terrifying array of weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Koreans firmly believe that the difference between them
and Iraq is their nuclear program and [that] if they abandon that, it
would be easier for the United States to attack them," said Lee Jong
Seok, an academic with the Sejong Institute think tank here who has
made two trips recently to North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said there is also widespread disbelief in the North about the
Bush administration's disclaimers that it isn't planning preemptive
strikes against North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Korean people, including Kim Jong Il, have not a shred
of doubt that North Korea is the next target after Iraq," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some North Korea watchers believe that Kim Jong Il, a clever
strategist, is taunting the United States at this time because he
believes the distraction of the Iraq showdown has weakened U.S.
resolve with regard to North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the
main difference between North Korea and Iraq lies in their respective
track records.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea, while it harbors obvious nuclear ambitions, has
managed those ambitions differently.... It has not sought to invade
its neighbors in recent years," the official said. "The North
Koreans, for all of their other quirks, seem to be behaving more
rationally than the Iraqis."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bush's position regarding possible military action
against North Korea is confusing. Although members of the
administration ranging from the president to Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld have said repeatedly that no attack is contemplated, a
U.S. strategy announced this week calls for preemptive strikes
against countries engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the situation with Iraq, there has been no public
consideration of "regime change" in North Korea. Cynics say that is
because the United States has nothing to gain from a change in North
Korea, which does not have oil, as Iraq does, or other riches to
attract U.S. commercial interests.</TE>
<TE>   Asked last month to explain the different policies toward North
Korea and Iraq, Bush replied, "As I said from the beginning of this
new war in the 21st century ... each threat requires a different type
of response."</TE>

<LD>Iran's female legislators are demanding an end to death by stoning as
a punishment for adultery, saying it has harmed the country's image.</LD>
<LD>   The women do not disagree with adultery being considered a crime
but say the punishment should be milder. All 11 women in the
parliament are behind the push to get the law changed.</LD>

<HD>Accord Reached on 10-Nation Expansion of European Union</HD>
<DH>'This is a summit that redefines' the continent, says
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The new memberships are slated to
begin in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>European Union leaders and 10 candidate nations agreed Friday on an
enlargement aimed at sweeping away the lingering effects of World War
II and the Cold War while reinforcing democracy and economic growth
in nations behind what was once called the Iron Curtain.</LD>
<LD>   "In 1989, brave and visionary people tore down the Berlin Wall,"
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the summit host, said at
a final news conference. "Today we have delivered on their hopes....
We have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in European
history. Europe is spreading its wings in freedom, in prosperity and
in peace."</LD>
<LD>   Scheduled to join the bloc on May 1, 2004, are Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,
Cyprus and Malta. The expansion will boost the EU land area by 23%
and its population by 20%, to 450 million. New members' economic
output, however, equals just 5% of gross domestic product of the
current 15-member group.</LD>
<TE>   The two-day summit also endorsed a target date of 2007 for Romania
and Bulgaria to join the union and agreed that Turkey could begin
accession negotiations "without further delay" if it meets democratic
and human rights criteria in a December 2004 review. Turkey had hoped
for such talks to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a summit that redefines Europe," British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said as the meeting's success became clear. "This is an
extraordinary moment for Europe's history."</TE>
<TE>   Blair acknowledged that a toughly negotiated $41-billion package
of support aimed at helping new members catch up with the richer
countries of Western Europe will hit the EU budget hard. "People
worry, if you're bringing poorer countries into the European Union,
doesn't that impose a huge burden?" he noted.</TE>
<TE>   But previous expansions have shown that new members quickly bring
"prosperity not just to their own people but to every part of the
European Union," Blair said. "Yes, there is a short-term cost. But
the long-term benefits ... in terms of trade, prosperity and living
standards, as well as security, far outweigh any of the short-term
costs."</TE>
<TE>   Coordinated discussions were also held here and at North Atlantic
Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels on Friday on EU plans to
mount peacekeeping operations using NATO assets such as heavy
transport planes, command and control facilities and satellite
intelligence gathering. At the NATO meeting, in action seen as part
of a bid to cultivate favor with the European Union, Turkey lifted
its long-standing veto of those plans.</TE>
<TE>   That means the EU will now be "able to conduct operations where
NATO does not want to get engaged," Blair told reporters here. The
agreement sets the stage for EU forces to possibly take over
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   There was general satisfaction but no mood of great celebration in
the candidate countries, eight of which were formerly under communist
rule. Market-oriented reforms have imposed burdens such as
unemployment and inflation, and people know that more tough changes
lie ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the European Union "changes entirely our geopolitical
situation," but "unfortunately there is a deficit of joyfulness among
Poles," said Piotr Nowina Konopka, a prominent former dissident who
is now dean of the College of Europe's Natolin campus in Warsaw. "We
are unable to feel happy surrounded by everyday problems."</TE>
<TE>   Hopes that a United Nations-brokered deal between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots on reuniting the island could be reached during the
two-day summit were not realized, and EU leaders concluded
negotiations on entry terms with the island's internationally
recognized Greek Cypriot government. Turkish Cypriots can join if
they agree to a reunification plan.</TE>
<TE>   The island has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded in
response to a Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military junta then
ruling Greece. Turkish Cypriots make up about 18% of Cyprus' 750,000
population and control about one-third of the island.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, in comments to domestic
media, blamed "prejudice against us" for the failure to win an
earlier date for launching EU accession negotiations. But he took a
more upbeat line later Friday, declaring at a news conference that
"we will continue our reform process for our own people. We are not
doing this for others.... We continue to want to be members of the
EU."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey will "prove if it joins the EU that a Muslim country can be
democratic and comfortable with the modern world," Gul said.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey would have liked an earlier date, but for 40 years Turkey
has been wanting a firm date, and this is a firm date," Blair said.
Turkey has sought to join the European Union since the early 1960s,
but the bloc has cited concerns about the country's human rights
record and economy in refusing until now to give it serious
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Turkey's parliament approved constitutional amendments
to allow Recep Tayyip Erdogan, head of the ruling Justice and
Development Party, to run for parliament and become prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan was banned from running because of a conviction for
reading an Islamic poem that the courts said incited religious
hatred.</TE>
<TE>   Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller appeared exhausted but happy
and visibly moved when he appeared at a news conference to announce
Poland's acceptance of the EU deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our negotiating tactics paid off," Miller said. "Tough and
decisive talks until the very last minute bore fruit."</TE>
<TE>   One of the final points agreed on was an adjustment in Poland's
milk quota, and Rasmussen, who played a key role in negotiations,
joked at the closing news conference that he had learned a lot about
agricultural issues during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Poland also won greater flexibility in the use of EU regional aid
funds, which Miller said would give the Polish budget an extra $1.5
billion a year in 2004-06. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
endorsed that solution, saying it would ease Poland's cash flow
without boosting the total cost of expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "An enlargement without Poland is inconceivable to me," Schroeder
said while negotiations were still underway.</TE>
<TE>   The summit brinkmanship was partly a show for home audiences, as
Poland and other candidates must hold referendums on whether to
accept the deals.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for the Poles to be able to return home in such a
way that the campaign for their referendum on the Copenhagen summit
result gets off to a good start," Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig
Moeller said. "It would not be much of a success if the leaders of
the 10 countries agreed to the EU entry terms now, if their people
then voted against accession in the coming months. Everybody must
come out of this looking good."</TE>

<HD>Defector Urges U.S. to Court Iraqi Commanders</HD>
<DH>Hussein's troops could be swayed to help oust the
president, ex-general says. Others warn against underestimating the
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The former general has fought alongside Saddam Hussein and against
him. And Wafiq Sammarai, who was once Iraq's chief of military
intelligence, thinks that the most effective weapon against the
dictator could be his own armed forces.</LD>
<LD>   Sammarai urges U.S. strategists to reach out to Iraqi commanders
who could overthrow the Iraqi president without an all-out war.</LD>
<LD>   The commanders "are the important ones in the equation," Sammarai
said during a recent interview. "If some commanders rise against the
regime and they have something like 100,000 soldiers, that will be a
new force on the ground. This could resolve the whole conflict.</LD>
<TE>   "The most important thing," he added, "is how to make these
commanders feel safe, that they are not going to be destroyed ....
The Americans must distinguish between the military commanders and
the political elite."</TE>
<TE>   As a senior military defector, Sammarai is a force in the Iraqi
opposition and has been a valuable resource for the U.S. intelligence
and military communities. He defected eight years ago and dedicated
himself to leading U.S.-backed covert operations against the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sammarai is talking again with U.S. officials about their
plans for Iraq. But he said they have not discussed details about his
potential role. If asked, the retired major general said, he is ready
for action.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that will help the Iraqi people, I will not hesitate to
accept," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai and other Iraq-watchers in Britain, the key U.S. ally in
the campaign to disarm Hussein, are examining scenarios for a
confrontation in the widely anticipated event that U.N. arms
inspections break down.</TE>
<TE>   Although some analysts say U.S. and British planners think a
military revolt of the kind envisioned by Sammarai is likely on the
eve of war or in its early stages, an Iraq expert at Warwick
University calls that wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The main army will disappear, but it won't run toward the
Americans," said Toby Dodge, the expert. "Nearly everyone is
expecting a coup. But my distinct worry is that the strategic
policymakers in both Washington and London are significantly
underestimating Saddam Hussein's ability to control his core troops
and loyalists. And they are all that matters until the Marines get to
Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's inner circle doubts that it can avert an invasion,
according to Dodge, who travels frequently to Iraq and expects an
armed clash as soon as next month. He predicted that the regime will
make a show of cooperating with U.N. inspectors while girding for a
last stand.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leader has concentrated trusted commanders and crack
forces in Baghdad and major cities, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to extract as high a cost of life as possible and
flood the country with journalists," Dodge said. "The military
strategy is essentially political. He's hoping the Americans won't
have the stomach for it."</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis want to force U.S. troops into ugly urban combat "on
international TV screens," Dodge said. Hussein hopes that the
bloodshed will turn international opinion against the Bush
administration, causing it to stop short in a scenario resembling the
1991 Persian Gulf War, when U.S. forces halted the charge toward
Baghdad as Iraqi casualties mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about Hussein's ability to survive dominates
Iraq-related analysis in London these days. His apparatus of
repression appears to have weakened, according to British officials
and members of the Iraqi opposition.</TE>
<TE>   A British diplomatic source cited an apparent public spat between
the Iraqi leader and his eldest son, Uday, over the unusually
critical tone in an official newspaper run by the younger Hussein.
British officials also are getting reports about dissent from Iraqi
refugees, according to the source.</TE>
<TE>   "We have picked up from asylum-seekers that there are more slogans
appearing on walls, more anti-regime leaflets, clandestine activity,"
said the source, who requested anonymity. "The number of Iraqi
asylum-seekers here is at an all-time high."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by high-level Iraqi officials to defect or communicate
secretly with the outside opposition also have increased, according
to activists here.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems they are opening avenues of contact so they can say in
the post-Saddam era that they were in contact with the opposition,"
said Zaab Sethna of the Iraqi National Congress, or INC, a coalition
of opposition movements. "Hedging their bets. We have guys calling us
on open phone lines, which is a surprise. We see a slight unraveling
of his system of control."</TE>
<TE>   Although military officials are among the would-be defectors,
opposition leaders said they are for the most part urging the
disaffected soldiers to remain in Iraq because they could play vital
roles there during a U.S. military operation.</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai thinks that Iraq's military brass can be mobilized
against the regime with appeals to their sense of duty and
patriotism. That approach would balance recurring threats of
prosecution and annihilation that have convinced some officers that
their only choice is to stand by Hussein, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the majority of them will have, if conflict begins, an
impact on the situation. None will go and sleep at home," Sammarai
said. "If they are a target, they have no choice but to fight against
America. If they get good assurances, they will move with the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai recently founded an opposition group, the National
Salvation Movement. His outpost in exile is a spartan apartment in a
nondescript brick tower in a London suburb. He works at a desktop
computer surrounded by files and wall maps, writing commentaries for
Arabic newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sammarai used an interpreter during the interview, he
answered some questions in English.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he thinks that Hussein will surrender any weapons of
mass destruction, Sammarai said: "He will give very wide access to
the inspectors. But at the end of the day, there will be a conflict.
That will appear when the inspectors touch sensitive things relating
to the regime."</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai gave U.S. agents a treasure trove of sensitive
information after defecting in December 1994. He revealed Hussein's
secret hoard: VX nerve gas, 40 Scud missiles and aggressive programs
to develop biological and chemical weapons. His account helped U.N.
weapons inspectors conclude in 1995 that Iraq had failed to comply
with their mandates, according to the recent book "The Threatening
Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq," by Kenneth M. Pollack, formerly a
top Iraq analyst for the CIA and National Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai spent 20 years in army intelligence, whose focus on
strategic espionage makes its record less sadistic than that of other
Iraqi spy agencies, according to Mustafa Alani of the Royal United
Services Institute, a think tank affiliated with the British Defense
Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai served as intelligence chief during the Gulf War. He then
retired and eventually fell out of favor. He worked as an
administrator in Hussein's presidential office before fleeing Iraq,
an adventure requiring a cross-border trek on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty hours!" he said, a smile creasing his stern features.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after his escape, Sammarai went to work trying to win over
former comrades in arms. The CIA backed him in 1995 when, along with
Kurdish rebels and the INC, he assembled a guerrilla force in
northern Iraq and attacked government troops at Irbil. He planned to
use his clout with Iraqi officers to trigger a rebellion and push to
Baghdad. But the regime's spies got wind of the conspiracy and the
military crushed it.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Sammarai remains a player in the fractious
opposition, which in a rare show of unity this weekend is holding a
landmark conference in London.</TE>
<TE>   "He's ambitious, and he has a good analytical sense," Alani said.
"His assessment of the army officers' attitude is accurate. But
because of his involvement in the opposition, he is playing the
political game."</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai may retain connections with the armed forces that would
be useful in a future conflict, experts say. But they add that he
does not have the heroic aura of Nizar Khazraji, a former army chief
of staff in exile in Denmark. Many Iraqi officers still "worship"
Khazraji, a third-generation soldier, according to Dodge of Warwick
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Sammarai doesn't play as well," he said. "Khazraji has been
careful not to align himself with the opposition or Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Danish prosecutors filed war crimes charges last month against
Khazraji, however, scuttling his hopes of going to the Middle East to
rally opposition to Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Sammarai doubts that the U.S. will rely much on armed opposition
forces, whether guerrillas fielded by Kurds in the north, Shiites
Muslims in the south, or exile groups. The former general said his
impression of the developing U.S. military strategy results from his
conversations with U.S. officials and from media reports. Sammarai
expects the U.S. to attack Iraq with a force smaller than it used in
the Gulf War and bigger than the agile, commando-driven operation in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will start with an air offensive designed to paralyze
Iraqi communications and infrastructure, and deploy special forces in
the western deserts to prevent short-range missile attacks on Israel,
Sammarai predicted. U.S. forces will also use psychological tactics
to encourage a revolt that would isolate Hussein in Baghdad,
according to Sammarai.</TE>
<TE>   "I think America does not want to destroy the Iraqi army," he
said. "This American plan will put Saddam in a very difficult
situation." Aware of his weaknesses, Hussein is lavishing money and
attention on the Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard,
according to Sammarai and others.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to common wisdom, some experts here think that the
resolve of elite troops and security services may strengthen if they
find themselves surrounded in the capital, where the population tends
to despise them.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Sammarai has warned that Hussein has a medieval
mentality, a bizarre taste for the advice of soothsayers and a
willingness to lash out with biological and chemical weapons if
cornered.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sammarai is careful about discussing weapons of mass
destruction. Only the U.N. inspectors and Western intelligence
agencies can know for sure whether the Iraqi leader still has them,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he believes that Hussein will use whatever means to
counterattack, such as spreading biological agents on roads in front
of invaders.</TE>
<TE>   "If he has weapons of destruction, and if you attack him to remove
him," said the general, "I have no doubt he will retaliate by using
those weapons."</TE>

<HD>Tehran Brushes Off Nuclear Plant Concerns</HD>
<DH>Iran says two sites photographed by satellite are for
peaceful purposes. U.S. fears they could help make weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Iran on Friday dismissed U.S. accusations that two nuclear plants it
is building could be used to make nuclear weapons, but American
officials expressed "grave concerns" and suggested that the Iranians
were trying to conceal some of the facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's worries about Iran's nuclear activities came on the
heels of North Korea's announcement that it was restarting a
mothballed nuclear reactor and as United Nations arms experts combed
Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction. Iran, Iraq and North
Korea make up what President Bush called an "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials disputed assertions by Tehran that the two sites
near the west-central Iranian cities of Natanz and Arak, seen in
commercial satellite photographs, were for peaceful purposes.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have any hidden atomic activities. All our nuclear
activities are for nonmilitary fields," Iranian government spokesman
Abdollah Ramazanzadeh said in Tehran, adding that U.N. inspectors had
been invited to visit the sites.</TE>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said, "We do
continue to have grave concerns about it.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspect uranium-enrichment plant could be used to produce
highly enriched uranium for weapons. The heavy-water plant could
support a reactor for producing weapons-grade plutonium," Fleischer
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said Iran was trying to hide parts of the
nuclear facility near Natanz by burying some of the buildings
underground.</TE>
<TE>   The White House called on the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog,
the International Atomic Energy Agency, to assess both facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The IAEA said it planned to inspect them in February.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a surprise to us," IAEA chief Mohammed Baradei said
in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   The IAEA first raised the issue with Tehran in August, Baradei
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether the program is for peaceful purposes or not, this is
obviously for us to verify.... Iran affirmed that all their
activities are for a peaceful purpose," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran invited IAEA inspectors after informing the agency in
September of plans to build nuclear plants and related fuel
facilities over the next 20 years, IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky
said.</TE>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinian militants in the West
Bank on Friday, and 30,000 supporters of the militant Islamic group
Hamas rallied in the Gaza Strip, vowing to avenge the killings of
gunmen and civilians.</LD>
<LD>   One of the militants, Tarek Abed Rabbo, was a senior field
commander of Hamas' military wing. Palestinian security sources said
he was shot 13 times while hiding in a closet by soldiers who raided
a refugee camp near Tulkarm.</LD>
<LD>   "Abed Rabbo ... was killed as he resisted arrest," an Israeli army
statement said. "In addition, the forces arrested Mohammed Walir,
another senior Hamas terrorist."</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, soldiers killed an armed Palestinian in an exchange of
fire in the village of Thabra, south of Bethlehem, when he tried to
evade capture, Israeli military sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The violence, which has continued despite Washington's appeals for
calm while it seeks Arab support for a possible war on Iraq, followed
a day of bloodletting in which seven Palestinians and two Israeli
soldiers were killed.</TE>
<TE>   About 30,000 Hamas supporters packed a sports stadium in the
southern Gazan town of Khan Yunis, where they cheered a parade of
gunmen and 20 would-be suicide bombers wearing white shrouds that
read, "Martyrs-in-waiting."</TE>
<TE>   The rally, one of the biggest by Hamas since the start of the
conflict, marked the 15th anniversary of Hamas' founding.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and S. Korea Won't Placate Regime</HD>
<DH>Nations agree to keep up the diplomatic pressure. The
hard-line stance will mean a stalemate unless the North is given a
way out, some experts warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>South Korean President Kim Dae Jung told President Bush on Friday
that North Korea's decision to restart its nuclear power plants and
remove international monitoring equipment is "unacceptable," a White
House spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Bush agreed that the move is "very serious," but the leaders
offered no insight on how they would avert a looming crisis over the
North's nuclear programs. In a 10-minute phone conversation, Bush and
Kim "agreed to continue seeking a peaceful resolution, while not
allowing business as usual to continue with North Korea," White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</LD>
<LD>   He defined "business as usual" as "the expectation that the more
North Korea violates agreements, the more the world will double over
backward to placate North Korea, and the president will not do that."</LD>
<TE>   The White House reaction came a day after North Korea vowed to
reopen the facilities, which were shuttered as part of a 1994
agreement that required the communist regime in Pyongyang to abandon
its nuclear ambitions in exchange for energy assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The president, Fleischer said, "will not engage in allowing North
Korea to violate its agreements and then have the world come rushing
to North Korea to say, 'How can we help you?' "</TE>
<TE>   But at the moment, Washington is continuing its strategy of
diplomatic encirclement, urging North Korea's four key neighbors --
China, Japan, South Korea and Russia -- to join the U.S. in using a
cutoff of trade and aid to pressure the country to dismantle its
nuclear programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be patient," a senior administration official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned his Russian and
Chinese counterparts Friday, and Powell and Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld plan to meet with the Japanese defense and foreign
ministers Monday. Officials said North Korea strategy will be a top
item of discussion at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, even North Korea is going to have to face reality"
and acknowledge that none of its neighbors will accept its having
nuclear capability, a senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   "That may take a while to sink in, but it will," the official
said. "In the meantime, we've been pretty restrained."</TE>
<TE>   In Vienna, Mohammed Baradei, head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, said the North Koreans have not asked IAEA staff to
leave the country, but neither have they agreed to requests for talks
about how the country's nuclear facilities should be monitored if
they are restarted. On Thursday, Baradei requested a meeting with
technical experts in North Korea to discuss inspection protocols.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Washington's advice industry was abuzz with counsel for
the president.</TE>
<TE>   Some urged Bush to stand firm against what is seen as North Korean
brinkmanship, arguing that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is a
rational player who will continue to threaten and bluster as long as
he is rewarded for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Others argued that Pyongyang has staked its very identity on
standing up against all odds to what it sees as foreign bullies, and
they urged Bush to offer a face-saving exchange for North Korea:
respectful and serious negotiations about its integration into the
international community in exchange for forswearing its recently
disclosed uranium-enrichment program.</TE>
<TE>   Balbina Hwang, a Korea policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation,
a Washington think tank, said Pyongyang's threat Thursday to restart
its nuclear reactors and its demand that the IAEA remove its seals
and monitoring cameras from nuclear facilities show that the Bush
administration's no-nonsense line on North Korea is working.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans have "backed themselves into a corner, and I
think they know that now," she said. The last thing the U.S. should
do is to respond by turning it into a crisis, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The regime "has learned the lesson of throwing tantrums," she
said. "That's what the Bush administration has to stop.... North
Korea is the one that wants something from the international
community. So the rest of the world needs to stand firm, and as long
as they do, I think North Korea is going to be the one to blink."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a fierce foe of North Korea, said
the administration should go further and announce that it will not
help North Korea build two light-water nuclear power plants as
promised by the Clinton administration in the 1994 agreement. In a
statement, Markey derided the past administration's agreement for
"transferring two potential nuclear bomb factories to North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   But many veteran Korea watchers said the hard-line Bush strategy
will end in stalemate unless North Korea is offered a face-saving way
to back down.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who knows anything about North Korea who
doesn't advocate negotiation in some form. The trick is the timing,"
said L. Gordon Flake, executive director of the Mansfield Center for
Pacific Affairs in Washington. "Right now, the administration seems
to be intent on forcing a unilateral North Korean capitulation and
rubbing their nose in it" by forcing North Korea to submit to
intrusive inspections of the sort the IAEA is now conducting in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way out of this is forcing unilateral North Korean
capitulation but giving them a face-saving back door that says, 'If
you capitulate, we are prepared to reevaluate the [U.S.-North Korean]
relationship, treat you with respect and negotiate with you,' " Flake
said.</TE>

<HD>About as Corrupt as It Gets</HD>
<DH>Official dishonesty has become a grotesque art form in
Paraguay. Accountability is rare. So is outrage among ordinary
citizens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ASUNCION, Paraguay</DL>
<LD>The president found himself in the middle of a stolen-car caper,
which is an embarrassingly nickel-and-dime crime to have attached to
your name when you're a head of state.</LD>
<LD>   The vehicle in question was an armor-plated, silver BMW that had
disappeared from a parking space hundreds of miles away in Sao Paulo,
Brazil. Somehow, it ended up in this steamy South American capital --
with President Luis Gonzalez Macchi holding the keys. Then, a stolen
Mercedes-Benz was linked to the first lady.</LD>
<LD>   Few Paraguayans were surprised by the case of the first couple and
the hot cars. Like other top officials here, Gonzalez Macchi had been
accused of misdeeds more commensurate with his stature, including
allegedly aiding in the embezzlement of $16 million in public funds.
Now, he faces an impeachment trial in the Senate on charges related
to both the stolen car and embezzlement.</LD>
<TE>   Turn over the slimy rock of crime big and small in Paraguay and
you stand a good chance of finding a politician, military officer or
bureaucrat underneath. Now, the nation's leading thinkers are saying
the time has come to accept a label bestowed on this nation of nearly
6 million people by outsiders: the champion of Latin American
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true and it hurts us," said Martin Almada, one of the
nation's most respected human rights activists. "And it hurts more
because we feel impotent to fight against this mafia that's running
the country, a mafia that wears the cloak of democracy."</TE>
<TE>   In few places from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego are bribery
and official rule-breaking so blatant as they are in Paraguay. For
two years running, the country has finished dead last among Latin
American countries in a worldwide survey of corruption by
Transparency International, a Berlin-based watchdog group. Only
Nigeria and Bangladesh received more damning scores in this year's
report.</TE>
<TE>   Asuncion, a city of 1.2 million with an impoverished majority,
boasts a large fleet of stolen luxury vehicles. They are conspicuous
symbols of the kleptocracy that has continued to reign here since the
1989 overthrow of Alfredo Stroessner, a dictator who ruled Paraguay
for 35 years as a kleptocrat par excellence.</TE>
<TE>   In the local slang, the vehicles are called autos mau, a term
apparently derived from the stealthy Mau Mau rebels of 1950s Kenya.
No one has been prosecuted in the case of the most famous auto mau in
Paraguay, Gonzalez Macchi's BMW, including the person or persons who
stole the car, fabricated documents for it and then transported it
across the border and sold it.</TE>
<TE>   "The case of the president's auto mau shows that even when a crime
is discovered and thoroughly investigated, no one is punished," said
Maria del Pillar Callizo, president of Transparency Paraguay, a
branch of the international group.</TE>
<TE>   When even high-profile crimes go unpunished, people who are
otherwise law-abiding start to wonder if they're fools to play by the
rules, Callizo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of public goods as objects of plunder is becoming an ever
more rooted feature of Paraguayan culture," she said. "Honesty and
integrity are the exception rather than the rule."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at all levels have made a grotesque art form out of
stealing from the public till, extorting bribes and helping
"friendly" citizens who are willing to pay to circumvent
inconveniences such as business taxes and car registration.</TE>
<TE>   By official estimates, 70% of Paraguayans who owe taxes don't pay.
And even those who do, Callizo said, sometimes have to bribe an
official to get a receipt.</TE>
<TE>   Driving across the country can require both patience and a thick
wallet. Consider the case of a hard-luck Brazilian city councilman
who decided that he would save money by driving to a convention in
Paraguay. After crossing the border, he was soon stopped by police
and hit up for a bribe.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles down the highway, he was stopped again. And again. And
again. More than a dozen times in all. Apparently, the corrupt cops
were radioing down the highway: "There's a rich Brazilian headed your
way!" Finally, the councilman gave up and turned back for home.</TE>
<TE>   At the upper end of the government pyramid, the pilfering has
taken on similarly comic proportions. Inside the Palacio de Lopez,
Paraguay's White House, one high-ranking member of the information
office, Nemesio Acosta, was fired early this year after it was
discovered he was renting out the palace's sound system for private
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta's company was also billing the government for use of the
sound system at official functions, even though the equipment was
public property. He now faces criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   According to an estimate by the nation's comptroller general,
corruption has cost the treasury $5 billion since Paraguay returned
to democracy in 1989, or more than double the nation's $2.3-billion
foreign debt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, then-Comptroller General Daniel Fretes Ventre wrote a
withering denunciation of the corruption he'd seen during his years
in office. He said 90% of Paraguayans suffer because of a powerful,
amoral minority who run the country with "the most monstrous
violations of ethics."</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Fretes Ventre was himself charged with 15 crimes,
including soliciting bribes and extortion. He survived an impeachment
vote in Congress, then resigned. Later, he was found guilty of using
his post as director of a university to launder the money from his
"illicit enrichment" while in public office.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Fretes Ventre remains free, his appeal pending
before the Supreme Court. Many influential Paraguayans believe that
he will never see the inside of a jail cell, thanks to the legal
practice of oparei, a Guarani Indian word meaning "useless" or
"never-ending."</TE>
<TE>   Most judges will apply oparei to corruption cases that reach their
courts, according to Almada, the rights activist.</TE>
<TE>   "The cases die with oparei, with legal procedures that never end,
that have no time limit, no schedule," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most notorious crimes tied to politics since Paraguay's
return to democracy have been smothered in oparei.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Ramon Rosa Rodriguez, head of the nation's drug police, was
killed in 1994 as he was about to deliver a report linking top
political figures to the drug trade. Vice President Luis Maria Argana
was assassinated in 1999. Some top political leaders blamed his
rival, then-President Raul Cubas Grau.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these cases has been cleared up," Almada said. "Argana
was part of the circle [of corruption], and he was killed by that
circle. The people who are in power now are his friends, but none of
them is interested in pursuing the case."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by so much legal paralysis, a group of prominent
jurists has formed the private National Commission Against Oparei. In
September, they met with the Supreme Court to voice their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Any hopes that the high court would act against judicial
corruption were dashed the following month, when the justices
themselves were mired in scandal. Secretly recorded phone calls,
released to the media, revealed the inner workings of oparei, with
senators pressuring justices over court cases and judicial
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   For months, it seemed that Gonzalez Macchi was being protected by
a form of oparei enshrined in the constitution. No president can be
prosecuted for any crime until he or she is impeached by Congress --
which Gonzalez Macchi's Colorado Party controls, as it has for the
better part of a century. Several attempts to remove him from office
in the wake of the stolen-car incident and embezzlement charges
failed for lack of votes.</TE>
<TE>   Then, early this month, while the president was attending a summit
in Brazil, several lower house lawmakers from his party switched
allegiances, voting for impeachment. The president, appointed to his
post by Congress in the fallout after the Argana assassination, had
become a liability to his party. Gonzalez Macchi now faces a trial in
the Colorado-dominated Senate. Many government opponents fear that
the case will again fall victim to oparei.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay remains a virtual one-party state, just as when
Stroessner -- also a member of the Colorado Party -- was dictator.
Therein lies one important reason corruption continues to thrive
here, said Carlos Martini, a journalist and a sociologist at Catholic
University in Asuncion.</TE>
<TE>   "In Paraguay, we have no concept that there should be oversight of
things that are public," Martini said. Before Stroessner was chased
from office, Paraguay had known only six months of democracy in the
nearly 500 years since the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. Absolute
leaders always called the shots, and "absolute power never accepts
the idea of oversight," Martini said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years into democracy, elected and appointed officials
alike continue to see themselves as mini emperors, Martini said.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have power identify themselves with the state and the
law," he said. Like King Louis XIV of France, "they believe, 'I am
the state, I am the law.' In Guarani, we call this the law of
mbarete, the rule of the strongest."</TE>
<TE>   This sorry state of affairs doesn't provoke much outrage among
ordinary citizens. In response to a recent survey that asked what was
the most serious problem facing the country, 66% of respondents named
unemployment, poverty or the economy. Only 6% cited corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a country of shipwrecked people, so a lot of people
have the ethics of castaways," Martini said. "The castaway thinks
only of survival. He doesn't have a vision for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Given the almost complete lack of government regulation, it is
little surprise that business accounting practices are lax.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very common for companies to keep their books in
triplicate," said Sergio Britos, an economist with Price Waterhouse
in Asuncion. "They have one set of books to show the tax man, another
to show the banks and a third set of 'real' books."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's broken and bogus information systems only make it
easier to hide a stolen vehicle, like the president's BMW.</TE>
<TE>   When the hot-car scandal broke last year, Gonzalez Macchi said he
wouldn't give up the car, which he had bought "on good faith" from a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a trivial matter," he said. "We have more important
things to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   The president's office delivered a copy of the car's title to the
prosecutor pursuing the case, Alejandro Nissen. But that document
belonged to a Toyota 4Runner imported from the United States. The
only agency in the country authorized to import BMWs had no record of
the president's car.</TE>
<TE>   Having become the butt of jokes here and abroad, Gonzalez Macchi
relented. His office handed over the car to the Brazilian consul.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Nissen said he believed the president knew the
car was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the president is removed from office, Nissen might not
be able to charge him with anything.</TE>
<TE>   "The car entered the registration system with official documents,"
the prosecutor said. "The content of those documents is false, but
they are still official, so no law has been broken."</TE>
<TE>   Nissen has since turned his attention to a photograph showing a
black Mercedes-Benz parked at the president's residence. Nissen
checked the license plate number and found that it had been issued to
a trailer that once belonged to former President Juan Carlos Wasmosy
and was used to transport a Jet Ski.</TE>
<TE>   The trailer had been sold and was on an Asuncion lot -- without
plates. How and why those plates ended up on the Mercedes that
witnesses say belongs to first lady Susana Galli is a question no one
has been able to answer. The car has since disappeared, and Nissen is
still waiting to question the first lady about it.</TE>
<TE>   The embarrassing episodes of the autos mau helped prompt business
leaders here to organize an anti-corruption "National Day of Shame"
in September. Paraguayans were urged to wear black armbands and
ribbons. Many did so, though not the multitudes the organizers had
hoped for. In the nation's schools, teachers were asked to recite a
few words to students about the difference between right and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "You should always keep in mind and practice certain values that
your elders -- not all of them -- have started to forget," the
statement went. "Important values like honesty and patriotism that
were handed down to us by our forefathers.... You children are our
hope for a better Paraguay."</TE>

<HD>Terror Attack on Israelis Condemned</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Over Syrian objections, the U.N. Security Council on Friday condemned
last month's "acts of terror" against Israeli targets in Kenya and
deplored the claims of responsibility by the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</LD>
<LD>   By a vote of 14 to 1, the council urged all 191 U.N. members "to
cooperate in efforts to find and bring to justice the perpetrators,
organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks." It was a rare
show of support for Israel from the Security Council.</LD>
<LD>   Ten Kenyans, three Israelis and three bombers died Nov. 28 when a
vehicle packed with explosives plowed into the Paradise hotel, north
of Mombasa. Minutes before the blast, two missiles were fired at an
Arkia Airlines aircraft as it was taking off with Israeli tourists
returning to Tel Aviv. The missiles narrowly missed the jet.</LD>
<TE>   Syria's U.N. ambassador, Mikhail Wehbe, said his government
condemned the attacks but could not accept Israel's being linked to
efforts to combat terrorism while "ignoring the terrorism the
Israelis are committing daily, and particularly against the
Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's deputy U.N. ambassador, Aaron Jacob, expressed regret at
Syria's objection, saying that "the target of the attacks in Mombasa,
Kenya, were clearly Israelis." Wehbe said the council was exercising
a double standard. He stressed that the U.N. had named no countries
in resolutions condemning the October nightclub bombings on the
Indonesian island of Bali that killed 191 people or a hostage-taking
attack on a Moscow theater that claimed 129 lives.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte said Washington insisted on
including Israel because it was clearly the target of the Kenya
attacks.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Inspections Set to Enter New Phase</HD>
<DH>U.N. team has asked to interview scientists who may have
worked to develop weapons. CIA ready to reveal 'good stuff' to aid
search.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Weapons inspections in Iraq are about to move into a more intense
phase, a deliberate and targeted effort involving Iraqi scientists
and U.S. intelligence that could prove that Baghdad has not fully
disarmed, U.S. and U.N. officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix has formally asked Iraqi
authorities for the names of scientists involved in its weapons
programs, the first step in preparations for sensitive interviews, a
U.N. official said Friday. Further, a U.S. official said the CIA is
preparing to hand over "the good stuff," key information it says
could help the inspectors find hidden weapons, although officials say
there is no single smoking gun.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. and U.N.'s early impression of Iraq's 11,807-page weapons
declaration is that it is an empty shell full of recycled material
that leaves unanswered important questions about Baghdad's
capabilities.</LD>
<TE>   In Vienna, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Mohammed Baradei, said Friday that most of the 2,400-page
nuclear portion of the report "is material we already had before."</TE>
<TE>   The declaration includes 300 pages of new information in Arabic
covering activities from 1991 to 2002 that the agency is still
translating and analyzing, he said. Iraq says there have been no
prohibited activities in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot take that statement at face value," Baradei said,
adding that further inspections are necessary to assess whether Iraq
poses a nuclear threat.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Blix has also said that much of the document looks
familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there is duplication," he said this week. "You don't
put out a 12,000-page report in 30 days without something old."</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq on Friday, inspectors met with their first significant
delay during a visit to the Communicable Disease Control Center. The
inspection team was allowed into the building but was unable to enter
several locked rooms, prompting them to use their special hotline to
senior authorities in Baghdad. Iraq's liaison, Gen. Hussam Mohammed
Amin, arrived two hours later but couldn't open the doors. The
inspectors sealed the doors and will return later, perhaps today, to
try again.</TE>
<TE>   A team of inspectors also visited the Ibn al Haithem Co., an
industrial facility for the military north of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, Baradei and Blix will provide the full U.N. Security
Council with "sanitized" copies of Iraq's declaration, with
information about nuclear weapons, the formulas for chemical and
biological weapons and the names of suppliers of material that could
be used for weapons removed for "commercial secrecy and liability
reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The council's five permanent members -- the United States,
Britain, France, China and Russia -- have received uncensored
versions because they already possess nuclear know-how. On Thursday,
Blix and the 15-member Security Council will discuss the experts'
assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty crummy declaration. It's a pretty bold attempt to
mislead us on things we really have a lot of information about," said
a well-placed administration official who requested anonymity. "Iraq
should have been red-faced when it handed this over to the U.N. It
not only shows that Iraq is willing to lie and deceive, but also that
it has no shame."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are particularly concerned about the status of 550
shells containing mustard gas, weapons Iraq has used against Iran as
well as its own ethnic Kurdish population. An additional 150 bombs
that may have contained biological agents are also unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence is still combing through the massive
declaration, but the first round of analysis shows that Baghdad
hasn't explained what happened to 20 tons of so-called growth media
that can be used for biological weapons and 200 tons of chemicals
that can be used in the making of VX, a nerve agent.</TE>
<TE>   Those items are left over from the inspections by an earlier U.N.
team, which left Iraq in 1998 on the eve of U.S. airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   The deeper that U.S. intelligence analysts get into the document,
the more glaring the discrepancies they find, leading to a toughening
stand by U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent omissions, Washington is not ready to convene
a Security Council meeting to declare Iraq in material breach of a
U.N. resolution on Iraqi disarmament and set the stage for military
action.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not there yet," the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N.,
James Cunningham, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has already provided inspectors with suggestions of sites
to visit and people to talk to, said a U.S. official who asked not to
be named. But it has been withholding the "good stuff" until analysis
of the declaration is complete and intelligence services can
determine "what to give and when to give it," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the next phase's strategy will be to focus on Iraqi
scientists, who have proved to be the key in the past to finding
caches of secret materials and documents.</TE>
<TE>   Resolution 1441 provides inspectors with the right to interview
weapons experts and their family members, and to take them out of the
country to shield them from intimidation by Iraqi authorities.</TE>

<HD>White House Calls on Venezuela to Hold Early Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Abandoning its hands-off approach, the Bush administration said
Friday that it was "deeply concerned about the deteriorating
situation" in Venezuela and called for early elections.</LD>
<LD>   The White House said the 12-day-old strike organized by opponents
of President Hugo Chavez had disrupted the Venezuelan economy and led
to the shooting of peaceful demonstrators and to attacks on media
outlets.</LD>
<LD>   With negotiations between the two sides at an impasse, early
elections promise "the only peaceful and politically viable path to
move out of the crisis," according to a statement read by White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</LD>
<TE>   The administration's decision to suddenly exert pressure -- after
keeping a wary distance from Venezuela's strife for most of this year
-- reflected intensifying concern about violence and serious economic
damage in the country, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new approach also reflected American concern about the
disruption in supplies of Venezuelan oil, which represent more than
10% of U.S. oil imports. Venezuela's oil will be vital if the United
States launches a war against Iraq that begins choking off Mideast
oil and increasing prices, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The strike has nearly halted oil shipments from Petroleos de
Venezuela, the national oil company, which provides about 50% of the
government's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The strike has pitted populist strongman Chavez and his
supporters, made up largely of the poor, against a coalition of
unions, the Roman Catholic Church, business and professional classes,
and private groups such as women's organizations. Chavez, who has
strong support from much of the military, has steadfastly refused the
demands of the opposition that he allow a vote that could end his
tenure as president.</TE>
<TE>   The United States was accused in April of encouraging plotters of
a short-lived coup against Chavez, a charge it strongly denied. Since
then, U.S. officials have largely sought to work through the
Organization of American States, whose power is confined mostly to
persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   But this week in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, OAS and U.S.
officials acknowledged that Chavez and his opponents were entrenched
in their positions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no political will to arrive at an agreement," Charles
Shapiro, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, told a Venezuelan
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, have begun paying closer attention to developments there in
recent days, officials said. On Thursday, Powell dispatched Thomas
Shannon, a deputy assistant secretary of State, to Venezuela to meet
with the country's foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   A key question left unresolved by the U.S. statement Friday was
what kind of elections the U.S. favors. Chavez's supporters and
opponents have proposed various elections at different times.</TE>
<TE>   Some opponents have recently been pushing for a quick, nonbinding
referendum on the government's performance. Chavez has repeatedly
said the constitution would not permit a referendum until August,
midway through his term, though some outsiders are skeptical that he
would agree to one.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is simply not choosing among them," one State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Some private experts said the administration's failure to endorse
one of the alternatives showed that the United States has fallen
behind the curve in dealing with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a private
Washington policy group, said that a month ago, the call for
elections would have had some meaning.</TE>
<TE>   But now, he said, "the entire debate is about when to have the
election, and I don't know how much value this has. I'm afraid we
haven't quite caught up to the train."</TE>
<TE>   Others said it would be unwise for the U.S. to throw its weight
behind one of the alternatives when the situation remains so volatile
and murky.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Johnson, a Latin America specialist at the Heritage
Foundation, said there are no political figures who are obvious
alternatives to Chavez. Nor has the opposition put forth a
well-considered plan for returning the country to democracy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With such vagaries, "it would be very difficult for anyone in the
U.S. government to endorse a specific approach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Venezuelan sensitivities about U.S. meddling, many U.S.
government officials and outside experts have believed that U.S.
officials should keep a low profile and work only within the OAS.</TE>
<TE>   Julia E. Sweig, deputy director for Latin American studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said she believes that
earlier this year, U.S. involvement "may have made things worse." But
because of the deterioration of the situation, "now it can only make
things better."</TE>
<TE>   She said she would like to see senior State Department officials
and senior lawmakers, who have also been largely silent, speak up to
try to bring pressure on the two sides to reach a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they signaled increased U.S. interest, U.S. officials
asserted that the crisis must be solved in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "While the hemispheric community and other friends will do all
they can to help, only Venezuelans themselves can resolve their own
problems," the White House statement said.</TE>

<HD>Christmas Trees That Appeal to the High-Minded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising above the department stores and boutiques of Fashion Island in
Newport Beach is a Christmas tree so massive that shoppers must
squint to see its crown.</LD>
<LD>   But the message posted at the base of the 112-foot ornately
decorated white fir isn't your typical holiday greeting.</LD>
<LD>   "Please enjoy this spectacular tree with peace of mind, knowing
that tremendous care was taken to preserve the environment," the sign
tells shoppers.</LD>
<TE>   The upscale outdoor mall is this year's winner in the increasingly
intense competition to claim the nation's best and biggest Christmas
tree. And these days, size alone isn't enough to avoid a backlash --
the trees must be harvested in a way that persuades shoppers they
need not feel any environmental guilt.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grove shopping center in Los Angeles, for example, signs
around the 100-foot white fir tell shoppers that "not just any tree
would do for our first holiday season. It had to be special. It had
to be magic. And ... it had to be ecologically sound."</TE>
<TE>   The Grove's message also notes that if the 80-year-old tree stayed
in the forest much longer, it could become susceptible to disease and
fall over -- "an ignominious end for a noble tree."</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad Company Stores, an outlet center, offers concerned
shoppers a brochure describing the environmentally friendly process
that brought its 87-foot tree to San Diego County. "We have had
customers come in and sometimes be a little upset because they do
think we randomly go up to the forest and cut down a tree," said mall
spokeswoman Anita Boeker.</TE>
<TE>   Huge Christmas trees have been drawing visitors to the White House
grounds and landmarks such as New York's Rockefeller Center for
generations. In recent years, however, shopping centers and other
public places have competed with increasing ferocity to claim the
tallest tree.</TE>
<TE>   "The big Christmas tree is a celebration of the commercialization
... of Christmas," said David C. Sloane, an urban historian at the
University of Southern California. "It happened partially because the
shopping mall became a competitor to classic downtown civic spaces."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the bragging started in November, when the Missouri
Division of Tourism proclaimed its 100-foot tree at Kansas City's
Crown Center mall the nation's tallest.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of November, however, Miami officials announced they
had a 110-foot Norway spruce at a downtown park.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times, in a front-page story, proclaimed Miami's tree
the biggest, and city officials predicted it would draw long-sought
visitors to its downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Within a day, however, many in Orange County were challenging the
claim, saying Fashion Island's 112-foot tree was actually the
nation's tallest. So began a flurry of missives between California
and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Miami eventually admitted its tree wasn't the tallest, but with
ill-concealed reluctance. "Ours is far prettier," said Carlos
McDonald, a city spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Though Fashion Island downplays the importance of size, the mall
has a contract that guarantees it will receive the biggest tree
felled by Victor's Strictly Custom Christmas Trees, a Dana
Point-based firm that supplies mega-trees to Southern California
shopping centers and other institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The tree's journey from the timberlands near Mt. Shasta to Fashion
Island was long and expensive. Fashion Island officials flew there
this summer to survey prospective trees.</TE>
<TE>   They settled on a 65-year-old fir. But simply cutting the tree
down was out the question. Victor's specializes in what the company
describes as an environmentally conscious approach to Christmas tree
harvesting that appeals to mall officials who don't want to offend
ecologically minded shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   The company drove a 200-ton crane into the forest. The
20,000-pound tree was rigged to the crane so that it remained
suspended vertically after it was cut, preventing it from crashing
into nearby trees. It was then placed on a flatbed trailer for the
650-mile drive to Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree never hits the ground," said Vito Serrao, owner of
Victor's. "We don't disturb the forest, and we plant 14 for every one
we cut."</TE>
<TE>   Serrao maintains that removing the biggest trees from the forest
actually helps the environment by allowing more sunlight to hit
smaller trees. Environmentalists agree that the company's approach is
better than indiscriminate cutting. Still, they said, there are more
ecologically friendly ways to celebrate the season.</TE>
<TE>   "They could plant a permanent tree, which they could truly
celebrate and make into a real community festival," said Andy Lipkis,
president of Tree People, a Los Angeles-based group that encourages
the planting and care of trees in urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at Fashion Island secured the tree in a plaza outside
Bloomingdale's, and spent two weeks decking it out with 17,000
twinkling lights, shiny beach-ball-size ornaments and big glittery
bows. The whole operation costs $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   For all the expense and effort, shoppers expressed mixed feelings
about the grandiose display.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big. It's beautiful. It's a little outrageous -- the cost
and the age of the tree and cutting it down," said Susan Kosareff of
Huntington Beach, who brought her children to see it. "But it's still
very beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be bigger and better," scoffed Troy Gideon of
Huntington Beach. "The poor tree has been around forever and we had
to cut it down."</TE>
<TE>   The tree's journey won't end at Fashion Island. On Jan. 2, it will
be stripped of its decorations and ground up for mulch.</TE>

<LD>The state Supreme Court set rules for when judges can ban cameras in
courtrooms and rejected broad bans based on the expected effect of
publicity.</LD>
<LD>   Judges, the high court said in Concord, must allow the media to
cover all court proceedings open to the public and can limit
electronic coverage only if there is a "substantial likelihood" that
allowing cameras would cause more harm than banning them.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling resulted from intense coverage of hearings for two
teenagers charged with killing two Dartmouth College professors in
January 2001.</LD>

<HD>After Cardinal, Others in Focus</HD>
<DH>There immediately are calls in Boston for more dismissals
in church's sexual abuse scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of Cardinal Bernard Law's tenure as archbishop of Boston will
shift pressure to a second tier of bishops who until now have
received less attention because of the intense focus on Law's
failures, church observers said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, even as Boston parishioners absorbed the news of Law's
departure, leading reform figures were calling for additional
departures in the scandal over sexually abusive priests.</LD>
<LD>   "I think doubtless other resignations will be appropriate to get a
clean slate," Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told reporters. Keating
heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' review panel on sexual
abuse.</LD>
<TE>   And the leading group that advocates for sexual abuse victims
issued a list of likely targets.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinals Roger Mahony of Los Angeles and Edward Egan of New York
and five bishops who once served as auxiliary bishops in Boston made
up the list released by Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   The five former Boston bishops, all of whom now head their own
dioceses, are Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn, N.Y.; William F. Murphy of
Rockville Center, N.Y.; Robert J. Banks of Green Bay, Wis.; Alfred C.
Hughes of New Orleans; and John B. McCormack of Manchester, N.H. Each
has been linked to some of the Boston-area cases in which priests
accused of sexual abuse were shifted from parish to parish without
authorities or lay Catholics being told.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony and other California bishops may find themselves in the
cross hairs because of a new state law that takes effect Jan. 1. It
waives the statute of limitations for one year to allow victims of
older sexual abuse cases to sue the church or other institutions in
civil court during 2003.</TE>
<TE>   These court filings could reveal disturbing details of how
California bishops handled past cases of sexual abuse. Sordid
revelations contained in court filings released last week in Boston
helped to bring down Law after a year of controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "Through litigation comes documents and through documents comes
the real pressures," said David Clohessy, national director of SNAP,
the victims' advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has said he will challenge the new law in court.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Friday, Mahony sought to distance himself from
circumstances in Boston. "For more than 17 years it has been the
policy of this archdiocese to deal swiftly and effectively with every
allegation of sexual abuse," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have been effective. No priest or employee of the
archdiocese who was ever determined to have abused a minor is allowed
to serve in ministry in this archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   That is the case now. But, in fact, until earlier this year, some
priests who had sexually abused minors served in various ministries,
although not with children.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, Law appeared to be regaining his balance. During
the Washington meeting of the bishops panel, he spoke in favor of a
"zero tolerance" policy to remove priests and deacons who had ever
sexually abused a minor.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, some saw Law's emerging visibility as a sign of his
rehabilitation. It now appears it was part of an exit strategy to
allow him to resign gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   As debate about Law's future continued over the summer, Vatican
officials were worried that a resignation could set off a cascade of
others, according to church insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Vatican is terrified of a domino effect, and I also
think they are probably still so out of it that they think his
resignation will solve the problems, quiet down the survivors and
others and allow life to get back to normal, but it will never
happen," said Father Thomas P. Doyle, a chaplain in Germany who
co-wrote a report to U.S. bishops in 1985 warning of an impending
sexual abuse crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the circumstances leading to Law's resignation are unique
to Boston, particularly the unrelenting nature of the last year of
scrutiny by prosecutors, the media and abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   Father Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University
of Notre Dame, said a domino effect was not inevitable. "The basic
reason why Law resigned is that it was at the end of a lot of
developments." But still, "what's happening in Boston represents a
sea change."</TE>
<TE>   The church has been dominated by a "feudal understanding" of the
bishop's office, said Father Thomas Rausch, theology department
chairman at Loyola Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, "the idea of an absolute, monarchial bishop that's
accountable only to the pope I don't think makes a whole lot of
sense," Rausch said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the chief effects of the yearlong scandal has been to spur
lay Catholics to assert themselves, said Father Robert Silva,
president of the National Federation of Priest Councils.</TE>
<TE>   "The laity has to become adults in the church, and I think this
might have helped some to realize that," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   A lot depends on the staying power of the laity. Right now, they
are energized. But "once Law goes, how many people will come out for
meetings?" asked Father Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said the problem with democracy in the church is that
it takes up too many evenings," Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, advocacy groups for victims and lay organizations like
the Voice of the Faithful continue to give every indication they will
not cease their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexual abuse of children by clergy, and the seemingly
never-ending cover-ups of these horrific acts, is like an infection,"
said Barbara Blaine, a Chicago social worker and a founder of SNAP.
"It can't be partially cleaned out. It must be fully removed and
thoroughly cleaned before healing can begin."</TE>

<HD>Kissinger Quits as Head of 9/11 Panel</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Henry A. Kissinger told President Bush on Friday that he would not
serve as chairman of a new commission investigating last year's
terrorist attacks because he did not want to liquidate his lucrative
international consulting firm to take the position.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's appointment of the former secretary of state, announced 16
days ago, was controversial from the start. Kissinger had come under
increasing pressure to step aside -- even before all the members of
the commission had been named -- because critics questioned whether
his continued connections to his firm would pose a conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Kissinger Associates Inc., based in New York, represents some of
the world's leading multinational corporations, including many with
direct interests in U.S. foreign policy.</LD>
<TE>   Kissinger's abrupt decision followed by two days the departure of
the commission's vice chairman, former Sen. George J. Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   The Maine Democrat said he could not afford to sever his ties to
his law firm, as some had demanded, during what is likely to be a
yearlong investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the questions about his financial interests,
Kissinger, 79, encountered sharp criticism for the role he played as
national security advisor and secretary of state during the Richard
Nixon administration.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, the White House expanded the war in Southeast
Asia before pulling U.S. troops out, and the administration supported
the 1973 coup in Chile that overthrew the leftist government of
Salvador Allende. For his role in ending the Vietnam War, Kissinger
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, even as critics of the war's
conduct branded him a "war criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger's letter informing Bush of his resignation referred only
to the questions of conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Bush said he accepted the resignation with
regret.</TE>
<TE>   "His chairmanship would have provided the insights and analysis
the government needs to understand the methods of our enemies and the
nature of the threats we face," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had maintained that Kissinger was not obliged to
make public the extensive list of clients served by his company.
Democratic leaders and others disagreed. The issue had appeared to be
headed to court.</TE>
<TE>   As the controversy grew, Kissinger said he would sever ties with
any clients in the face of possible conflicts. But Kissinger said
that he could not "conceive that there will be any."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, however, he called White House Chief of Staff Andrew H.
Card Jr. to say he was stepping aside, and dispatched a letter to
Bush telling him he would not accept the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's choice of Kissinger was announced with fanfare at the White
House the day before Thanksgiving, with the former secretary of state
at the president's side.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter Friday, Kissinger said that to avoid any appearance
of conflict of interest, he had told White House lawyers that he
would present to the administration "all relevant financial
information," and would also make it available for independent review
"consistent with submissions of other members of the joint
commission."</TE>
<TE>   "However, it is clear that, although specific potential conflicts
can be resolved in this manner, the controversy would quickly move to
the consulting firm I have built and own," he said. He indicated that
while he was ready to make public his personal financial information,
he did not want to do so for his company, and dissolving it could not
be done quickly enough.</TE>
<TE>   "To liquidate Kissinger Associates cannot be accomplished without
significantly delaying the beginning of the joint commission's work.
I have, therefore, concluded that I cannot accept the responsibility
you proposed," he wrote to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "there can be no more important undertaking" than
investigating "the facts and circumstances surrounding the tragedy of
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the work of the panel was so important "that it must
begin without distraction and controversy so that it can be completed
swiftly, thoroughly and credibly."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic members of Congress had argued that Kissinger was
required to divulge his clients because Congress had created the
commission, and thus all panelists must comply with congressional
financial disclosure requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The White House sided with Kissinger, saying that as an
executive-branch appointee, he was exempt.</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded last week
that all panelists were required to divulge the identities of clients
who paid them more than $5,000 over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Kissinger would not budge from his position, even as
he sought to assure representatives of the Sept. 11 families that his
far-flung business interests would not interfere with his role as
head of the commission. He also has said that he has no Saudi clients
and does not represent any Middle Eastern governments.</TE>
<TE>   Former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), now director of the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, was named to
succeed Mitchell as commission vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   No replacement was immediately named for Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said the five Democrats appointed to the National
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States would each
comply with the Ethics in Government Act's requirements for financial
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The statement was distributed by the office of Sen. Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.), the outgoing Senate majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-member panel, created by Congress last month, is to follow
up on the work of the congressional inquiry that issued its final
report Wednesday on intelligence failures preceding the attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for commission appointments is Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kissinger, the only other Republican appointee named so
far is former Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.).</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic appointees are former Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.),
retiring Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.), Washington lawyer and longtime
Democratic investigator Richard Ben-Veniste, and Jamie Gorelick, vice
chairman of Fannie Mae who served as deputy attorney general in the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   A leader of a group of relatives of attack victims, Kristen
Breitweiser of September 11th Advocates, said the Kissinger and
Mitchell resignations "reaffirm my belief that the commission needs
to be pure, transparent and purely independent."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Push of Families of Sept. 11 said Kissinger's resignation
gives Bush "a second chance to appoint someone who will be a thorough
and competent investigator."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Law Steps Down, Apologizes for 'Mistakes'</HD>
<DH>Many hail the move as an important step toward recovery
from the sexual abuse scandal in Boston, but say the process has only
begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin and Geraldine Baum</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law, the nation's most senior Roman Catholic
prelate, resigned his post Friday as archbishop of the Boston
Archdiocese over the church's year-old sexual abuse scandal,
apologizing and begging forgiveness from "all those who have suffered
from my shortcomings and mistakes."</LD>
<LD>   Law's resignation was accepted personally in the Vatican by a
"saddened" Pope John Paul II, who appointed Bishop Richard G. Lennon,
a 55-year-old rector of a seminary, to temporarily take over the
troubled helm of the fourth-largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "It is my fervent prayer that this action may help the archdiocese
of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which
are so desperately needed," Law said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   While many hailed the cardinal's resignation as an important first
step, they suggested it was only the beginning of a long recovery
process for the archdiocese, where the nationwide priest scandal
erupted more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Law has been at the heart of the controversy, accused of covering
up the sexual abuse of children by priests and transferring them to
other parishes, where they continued to prey on youngsters. The
archdiocese has been hit with a wave of lawsuits in recent months,
demanding millions of dollars in compensation, and there has been
speculation that the venerable Boston institution might take the
unprecedented step of declaring bankruptcy to minimize such payments.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, as news of Law's resignation spread, attorneys
representing hundreds of alleged victims of sexual abuse vowed to
press on with lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because Cardinal Bernard Law resigned doesn't mean
everything's OK now. There's enormous rot, enormous decay within the
archdiocese of Boston," said attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who
represents more than 100 alleged victims of clergy abuse. "This will
turn out to be only a cosmetic change unless substantive changes are
made in church communities throughout the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Although the archdiocese had no comment beyond Law's prepared
statement, newly empowered church activists in the Boston area said
the church must become more accountable or face similar scandal in
the future. And academicians suggested that Law's resignation would
be meaningful only if it led to similar acts of contrition by bishops
in other troubled archdioceses.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be naive to presume that the problem is now solved and
the crisis is now over," said Thomas Groome, a professor of religious
education at Boston College and author of "What Makes Us Catholic."</TE>
<TE>   "This issue was far bigger than Cardinal Law and there are deep,
pervasive issues to be addressed now by the church nationwide, to
reach the root causes of this scandal. Our best hope is that today
will be a turning point."</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 of the 46,000 priests in the U.S. have been removed
from duty or resigned this year because of molestation claims; five
U.S. bishops have stepped down this year.</TE>
<TE>   Law's action left a host of questions unanswered. It was not
clear, for example, how his resignation would affect a state grand
jury probe into church sex abuse, which reportedly has subpoenaed him
and other prominent Catholic officials. "This is far beyond one
person," Atty. Gen. Thomas Reilly said on NBC's "Today" show. "There
are other people that knew, other bishops, perhaps even the Vatican,
that were aware of the scope of the scandal."</TE>
<TE>   There was also growing curiosity about the path the church would
take under Lennon, a respected but largely unknown prelate. A native
of Arlington, Mass., he was elevated last year to bishop. In a
statement Friday, he pledged to do all he could "to work toward
healing as a church." Under Vatican rules, Lennon will serve as an
apostolic administrator for a maximum of one year, until the pope
chooses a successor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't envy Lennon one bit," said Tom Blanchette, a victim of
priest sexual abuse. Blanchette, who has become an activist in
several church reform groups, stressed that he took no personal joy
in Law's fall from grace. His real concern, he said, is for Lennon,
because "in a way, the eyes of the whole nation are really upon him
now. He's got to find a way to clean this mess up."</TE>
<TE>   Law's future also remains unclear, though apparently he will
remain a cardinal, which means he could take another church post and
has the right to vote in a papal election until he turns 80.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Boston Archdiocese has been hit with scandals over
sex abuse in the past, the most damaging revelations began surfacing
this year. Plaintiffs in several lawsuits alleged that Law and other
church officials moved John Geoghan, a former Boston-area priest,
from one parish job to another, despite strong evidence that he had
sexually abused young males.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Geoghan was convicted in January and sentenced to up to
10 years in prison for indecent assault and battery against a
10-year-old boy, internal church documents from a civil lawsuit
suggested that archdiocesan officials had worked to protect the
priest and failed to alert authorities to his proclivity for sexual
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Law, 71, vowed in February to never step down from his post,
telling parishioners at a Sunday Mass that "when there are problems
in the family you don't walk away." Yet he was rocked by subsequent
allegations in April that Father Paul Shanley routinely had been
protected by church leaders and given one new parish job after
another, even though his personnel files indicated he had publicly
advocated sex between men and boys and was accused of raping young
males in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   As calls grew for Law to resign, he made a secret trip to the
Vatican in April and offered to step down. But the pope refused to
accept his resignation, and the prelate returned to Boston, saying he
was determined to reform the way the church handled abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   It all came unglued this week, however, when mainstream Catholic
groups and 58 local priests called for his removal, saying he had
become an embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   For some, Law's travails were a troubling interlude for a church
they still enthusiastically support. As she headed for a downtown
subway, Stephanie Graff, 20, a Boston University student, said her
parents, both devout churchgoers, "just pushed it all aside and stuck
to religion." She added, "I'm going to stick with my religion. It is
very conservative and in this liberal country we need that."</TE>
<TE>   But others said their faith in the church had been shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "I was behind Law all along and ready to stay there," said Marisa
Lee, who was shopping Friday with her daughter Angie, 13. "I send my
daughter to Catholic school and my husband and I tithe regularly."</TE>
<TE>   The last straw for Lee and many other parishioners came 10 days
ago, when attorneys representing alleged victims of sex abuse won a
court battle forcing the church to release thousands of documents
showing the personnel histories of eight priests accused of molesting
youngsters. They included revelations about drug use by priests, as
well as abuse of young girls and boys. The most damaging evidence,
however, suggested that Law had tried to cover up evidence, fended
off media inquiries and ran a church that was more concerned with
minimizing financial payouts to victims than helping them recover
from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say the words I sometimes think about when I'm at
church," Lee said angrily, after sending her daughter into a store.
"When the sex and drugs stuff came out, I thought to myself, 'How
could he [Law] protect those people?' "</TE>
<TE>   It would have seemed unthinkable in 1984 when Law, formerly the
bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo., assumed control of the
Boston Archdiocese. He was hailed as an able administrator and a
papal loyalist, but also as a man of the people who demonstrated
leadership during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard-educated Law, who worked on voter-registration efforts
in Mississippi, was viewed as a leader who could heal the Boston
Archdiocese after a series of race riots over school desegregation in
the 1970s. He became one of the nation's most powerful Catholic
officials, yet also reached out to poor and homeless people and
Boston's increasing number of immigrant parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   "People might wonder, 'Where did Cardinal Law go wrong?' " said
Eugene Kennedy, a former priest, theologian and psychologist at the
University of Chicago-Loyola who is also an expert on sexual abuse by
clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "And the answer is, he was part of an ongoing effort, sponsored by
Pope John Paul II, to restore a rigid hierarchy as the way to govern
the church.</TE>
<TE>   "We can see now that this didn't work, in the abuse scandal, with
his efforts to restrict information about abusive priests, the way he
tried to protect the church above all else, from the top down,"
Kennedy said. "And it was this idea that brought him down. Because
people began to stand up and say, 'No more!' "</TE>
<TE>   As the Boston church abuse scandal expanded, Catholics banded
together into a proliferation of grass-roots organizations demanding
a bigger say in church affairs. Voices of the Faithful, a group of
mainstream Catholics who until recently had not sought Law's
resignation, said the cardinal's departure could be a purifying act
if it leads to meaningful reform in Boston and other archdioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Law's resignation "is a sad but necessary step in the healing
process," said Jim Post, the organization's president. "This is not a
joyous time for us, and our hearts are heavy with sadness. The
archdiocese faces an enormous challenge now, because healing requires
listening to one another -- to survivors and their families, to
priests, the religious and the laity."</TE>
<TE>   Members of another group, the Boston Priest's Forum, voiced
similar hope Friday that Lennon would usher in a new period of
accountability. As they met in the basement of a Newton, Mass.,
church, several members tried to make sense of the day's dizzying
events and a tumultuous year in their parishes.</TE>
<TE>   "What was revealed 10 days ago just pushed people over the edge,"
said Father Walter J. Woods, the pastor in Acton, Mass. "My people
had filled me with their anger, their confusion, their frustration
and their heart-stopping anxiety for their kids. It was just gross."</TE>
<TE>   For Father Austin H. Flemming, pastor in Concord, Mass., the
lesson of Law's fall was that the cardinal had drifted too far from
his flock. He was preoccupied with scandal, and no longer heard what
was in people's hearts, Flemming said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead to the holidays, the priest said he hadn't yet
written his Christmas Day homily, and didn't really know what he was
going to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect there will be relief that day, and people are going to
want to know what is coming next," Flemming said. "But that I cannot
tell them."</TE>

<HD>Lott Decries Segregation, Struggles to Keep Post</HD>
<DH>Senator apologizes again for his remarks as GOP rumblings
about his leadership role grow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Scrambling to salvage his hold on power, besieged Sen. Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) on Friday offered his most extensive apology yet for
comments that seemed to endorse segregation and spurred criticism
from across the political spectrum, including from President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Despite Lott's latest bid to defuse the controversy, Republicans
say it remains uncertain that he will survive a growing clamor --
from conservative GOP activists as well as from Democrats -- for him
to resign his leadership post.</LD>
<LD>   "I apologize for opening old wounds," Lott said at a news
conference in his hometown of Pascagoula, Miss., the day after Bush
rebuked him. "I only hope that people will find it in their hearts to
forgive me for that grievous mistake."</LD>
<TE>   But Lott, who is in line to become Senate majority leader when
Congress convenes in January, adamantly refused to relinquish that
post. The job will be crucial to moving Bush's legislative agenda,
and the furor surrounding Lott has raised questions about how
effectively the senator can do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not about to resign for an accusation that I'm something I'm
not," Lott said.</TE>
<TE>   No Senate Republican has openly called on him to step down, but
Lott has been trying to shore up his position by calling GOP senators
across the country to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of no one in our party calling for him to step down," Sen.
Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) said in a terse statement after Lott's news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, Senate Republicans are sounding each other out
about Lott's future. And one Republican political consultant close to
the White House said Friday night, "It's not a matter of if [Lott
steps down as leader], it's a matter of when."</TE>
<TE>   The spiraling controversy has caused trouble for Republicans in
the aftermath of their triumph in the November elections, in which
they seized control of the Senate and expanded their House majority.
Instead of building on that momentum, the GOP finds attention focused
on a politically wounded Senate leader -- and faces the prospect of a
potentially divisive intraparty battle to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the controversy may undermine plans by the White House
and congressional GOP leaders to begin the new Congress with quick
action on an economic stimulus package and leftover budget issues.
The Republicans would like to spotlight for voters the difference a
GOP-controlled Congress can make.</TE>
<TE>   Many Bush allies also are worried that the Lott flap will hurt the
party's political prospects in 2004 by energizing support for
Democrats among African American supporters and setting back GOP
efforts to reach out to minority voters.</TE>
<TE>   Bush played a significant role Thursday in turning up the heat on
Lott when he publicly rebuked his fellow Republican. The president
termed "offensive" any suggestion "that a segregated past was
acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush did not call on Lott to relinquish his leadership job.
And White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said that remained Bush's
position after the Friday news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Buchan added that in Bush's view, Lott's comments on Friday were
"candid, forthright and apologetic, and rightly so."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's news conference was his fifth effort in as many days to
quell the controversy triggered last week at a celebration of the
100th birthday of retiring Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). At the
party, Lott said that the country would have been better off if it
had elected Thurmond president in 1948. Segregation was a central
plank of Thurmond's Dixiecrat platform.</TE>
<TE>   Through the week, Lott issued three short, written statements and
conducted two broadcast interviews by telephone to apologize. But
many fellow Republicans demanded that he go further, suggesting he
stand in front of television cameras and more explicitly repudiate
his comments.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement Friday, Lott said: "Let me be clear:
Segregation and racism are immoral.</TE>
<TE>   "Segregation is a stain on our nation's soul. There's no other way
to describe it. It represents one of the lowest moments in our
nation's history and we can never forget that."</TE>
<TE>   Lott said, as he had earlier, that he did not intend his comments
to be an endorsement of racism, but just a tribute to Thurmond. "I
was winging it," he said. "There were no venal thoughts in my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me make clear, though: In celebrating his life, I didn't mean
in any way to suggest that his views of over 50 years ago on
segregation were justified or right," Lott said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that his surprise at the negative reaction to his
words was evidence that he had a "blind spot."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the recent spate of reports about his record on race
issues -- such as his efforts to keep blacks out of his fraternity at
the University of Mississippi -- Lott deflected the question to talk
about how much racial attitudes have changed in Mississippi and the
country over the last 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, there'll be some disagreement on the best ways to ensure
that every American -- every American -- of every color and race and
ethnic background has a fair and equal chance in life," Lott said.
"But our goals are the same, even though we'll debate it on
philosophical or partisan lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a colorblind society [in which] every American has an
opportunity to succeed; an end to the entrenched poverty and
joblessness that has plagued minority communities and communities of
all kinds in this state and across this nation; a good education for
every child, that gives him a real chance for a good life and that
rejects the soft racism of low expectations."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to mend fences and communicate more directly with
African Americans, Lott announced he would appear early next week on
the Black Entertainment Television network to "talk about my hopes
and dreams for the people in this state and this country, regardless
of their race."</TE>
<TE>   But NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Lott's latest apology did
nothing to change the group's call for Lott to give up his leadership
post. He said Lott's remarks "come 22 years too late," noting that
Lott made similar remarks about Thurmond in 1980. "While we all
believe in forgiving other people, this represents more than anything
else a pattern of behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Nor was the Congressional Black Caucus mollified by Lott's latest
comments. The group, whose 38 members are all House Democrats,
renewed its call for Lott to be censured.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Lott
still has not clearly explained himself. "He indicated he did not
mean any endorsement of segregation, but his news conference today
did not provide an adequate explanation of what he meant," Daschle
said.</TE>
<TE>   The most important question for Lott is whether he is keeping his
fellow Senate Republicans on his side -- they are the ones who
elected him majority leader last month.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Lott's news conference, about 30 of his GOP
Senate colleagues participated in a conference call organized by Sen.
Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho) to discuss the situation.</TE>
<TE>   There was no push for his resignation, said a leadership aide who
listened to the conversations. "We believe it's time to move on and
do the work of the American people," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout the week, there have been signs of unease in the
usually clubby, insular Senate, where members are loath to criticize
each other publicly.</TE>
<TE>   GOP sources said that two senators who are considered possible
successors if Lott stepped down -- Sens. Don Nickles of Oklahoma and
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- have been calling colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   They are not openly campaigning for a leadership change, but "are
calling members just to take their [political] temperature," said one
Senate Republican aide.</TE>
<TE>   After Lott's news conference, McConnell issued a statement saying,
"I believe the American people will accept his apology and want us
now to move forward together."</TE>
<TE>   Another senator regarded as a potential Lott successor is a White
House favorite, Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, a Bush ally who just
finished a successful run as chairman of the GOP campaign committee
for the 2002 elections.</TE>
<TE>   The most ominous aspect of the controversy for Lott is that so
much of the criticism has come from the GOP's conservative wing.
Several conservative writers, activists and magazines have heaped
scorn on him. The latest to do so Friday was the National Review.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction has laid bare an undercurrent among Republicans that
rarely surfaces: Although Lott is conservative, he has never been a
favorite of many conservative activists outside the Senate. Some
believe he never pushed hard enough for their agenda; others blame
him for the GOP's loss of Senate control in mid-2001 when Sen. James
M. Jeffords of Vermont quit the party.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing is not going away," said one GOP operative. "It's not
the liberals who have kept this going. It's the conservatives, the
Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one senator who came to Lott's defense Friday was
Jeffords.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Trent Lott to be a man of honor and good conscience,"
Jeffords said.</TE>

<HD>White House Strategist Mary Matalin Plans to Step Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mary Matalin, a high-profile White House strategist, announced Friday
that she will return to the private sector by the first of the year.
But she intends to continue to informally advise both President Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney -- including in their anticipated
reelection campaign.</LD>
<LD>   An acerbic and fiercely partisan Republican, Matalin is part of
what many view as Washington's most unlikely couple: Her husband is
James Carville, the equally sharp-tongued Democratic consultant.
While they have attracted widespread attention as a seemingly odd
couple, Matalin long has been a top GOP operative.</LD>
<LD>   "Mary is just the best," Cheney said in a statement. "The entire
Cheney family is in awe of the superb job she has done."</LD>
<TE>   After serving as chief of staff to the Republican National
Committee, Matalin worked as a deputy campaign manager for
then-President George Bush's 1992 reelection campaign. She also was
already secretly dating Carville at that time, even though he was a
key manager of Bill Clinton's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton years, Matalin co-hosted "Crossfire" on CNN and
CNBC's "Equal Time," worked for Republican causes, delivered speeches
and wrote a book with Carville, "All's Fair: Love, War, and Running
for President."</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 election, President George W. Bush hired Matalin,
49, as counselor to Cheney and gave her the additional title of
assistant to the president.</TE>
<TE>   In a staid, button-down West Wing, Matalin brought not only star
power but also valuable Washington experience and contacts.</TE>
<TE>   She became influential in coordinating the administration's
response to criticism.</TE>
<TE>   It was Matalin, for instance, who aggressively defended Cheney and
the energy task force he headed, which was criticized for forming
policy behind closed doors while granting disproportionate access to
the industry.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2002 midterm elections, Matalin was among the many
administration officials who campaigned around the country for
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   After Matalin's resignation was announced, one West Wing official
likened her new role to that of Karen P. Hughes, Bush's longtime
confidant who returned to Texas in August but remains in close
contact with the president and his senior staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very Karen-esque," the staffer said. "Mary's
going to remain heavily involved."</TE>
<TE>   Matalin said Friday that she is seeking employment opportunities
that would afford her greater flexibility to spend time with her
family. She and Carville have two daughters, Emma and Matty, ages 4
and 7.</TE>
<TE>   Matalin is the daughter of Democrats. Her father was a steelworker
and her mother owned beauty salons in Chicago. Matalin got involved
in Republican politics as a student at Western Illinois University.</TE>
<TE>   Matalin is to be succeeded by Cathie Martin, 34, who has been her
deputy.</TE>

<HD>In the Town That Lott Built, Residents Are Forgiving</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart and Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>PASCAGOULA, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Gratitude can buy a lot of forgiveness, and if Sen. Trent Lott had
stopped by the shipyard that is the biggest employer in his hometown,
he would have encountered both in ample supply.</LD>
<LD>   It made sense that Lott would choose to return home Friday for his
high-stakes effort to undo the damage over comments last week that
appeared to endorse segregationist politics of the 1940s. Lott is
revered by many in Pascagoula, which has a middle school and airport
named after him and owes much of its stature as a center of
shipbuilding and military bases to the clout in Washington of its
favorite son.</LD>
<LD>   Like many people across Mississippi, residents here took offense
to the remarks Lott made at a birthday gathering for retiring Sen.
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who turned 100. But as the nationwide furor
persisted -- along with calls for Lott, a Republican, to step down as
the Senate's next majority leader -- many residents of this
blue-collar port town were inclined to give Lott the benefit of the
doubt, even before his nationally televised apology Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the hotel where Lott held a news conference, the marquee
read: "We Love You Trent."</TE>
<TE>   At Hulas, a diner down the street from the looming Northrop
Grumman shipbuilding complex, the lunchtime crowd of shipyard workers
seemed more worried about the harm to the area's economy if Lott were
to step down than about the remarks themselves. The area depends on
the largess of the federal government. Military contracts keep the
shipyard going, and the Navy and Coast Guard each have stations in
Pascagoula, about 100 miles east of New Orleans. As senator, Lott
helps assure that the spigots remain open -- even more so as majority
leader.</TE>
<TE>   "The man had a poor choice of words, but he shouldn't have to lose
his job over it," said Leroy Tillman, a 44-year-old shipbuilder who
is white. Tillman was finishing a crab sandwich and fries at a table
with seven other shipyard workers, white and black.</TE>
<TE>   "Around here, what he said doesn't amount to a hill of beans,"
Tillman said.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Wells, 30, a ship fitter who is black, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It embarrassed me for him to represent Mississippi and for him to
say that. People already have a bad impression of us," Wells said.
"People are not going to overlook it. He's done a lot for Pascagoula
so they will eventually move on. I personally don't think he meant
anything. I think he was caught up in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It would definitely hurt the shipyard if he was out of power. A
lot of people would have to move."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Eubanks, the white owner of Hulas, offered a grander analysis.
He swept his right arm in the direction of the shipyard. "All this
here," he said, "is because of Trent Lott."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his political importance to the region's economy, some in
this Gulf Coast city of 115,000 have stepped forward to criticize
Lott, who became senator in 1988. The city's daily newspaper, the
Mississippi Press, has called for him to step aside as Senate
Republican leader. In an editorial Thursday, the newspaper said that
Lott's remarks praising Mississippi's support of Thurmond's
segregationist campaign for president in 1948 -- and similar comments
in 1980 -- disqualified him for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper's editor, Dan Davis, said many residents reacted
angrily to the editorial, which he wrote. Some called or sent e-mails
decrying the stance. A few canceled their subscriptions.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were a popularity contest between me and a convicted
child molester," said Davis, who is white, "I'd be a distant second."</TE>
<TE>   But some black residents said Lott's comments showed that, despite
a series of apologies this week, he still harbored racial beliefs
that were discredited decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He said out loud what a lot of us felt was in his heart," said
Pam Wells, a black 30-year-old hairstylist, who is not related to
Gabriel Wells. "He should resign because he is supposed to represent
all of us, and now people don't believe he can represent our people
fairly."</TE>
<TE>   For many, the Lott controversy served to return the nation's gaze
unhappily to a racist legacy that Mississippi has labored hard to
extinguish. Many Gulf Coast residents in their 40s can remember the
days when blacks were barred from the beach not far from Pascagoula.
The periodic fights over displaying the Confederate battle flag in
public settings stir sentiments over race, as happened last year when
the state's voters agreed to keep the emblem as part of the state
flag.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in times when there was racism and you could see it
everywhere," said Marvin Pickett, 67, who retired from teaching
social studies at what is now Lott Middle School. Pickett, who is
black, spoke as he was getting his hair cut at a shop downtown called
Brothaz and Sistahz. "Now you don't see it as much, but you feel it
every day. You know it still exists."</TE>
<TE>   But the old caricature of the state as a racist backwater grows
less apt by the day as Mississippi lures state-of-the-art automobile
plants and its Gulf Coast twinkles with the lights of casinos. Many
Mississippians, black and white, have cringed as the storm over Lott
has played out, certain that it has damaged the state's efforts to
craft a new image, said Marty Wiseman, director of the John C.
Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University.</TE>
<TE>   In the senator's waterfront neighborhood in Pascagoula, where his
wood-framed house bears a sign that says "Lott's Landing," a neighbor
said he was upset because the affair might harm the prospects for
Lott's fellow Republicans. "What he said puts the Republicans in a
bad light," said Al Frank, a 77-year-old retired salesman.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what more he can do but apologize. Do they want him
to slash his wrist?" said Frank, who is white. "He shouldn't have
shot his mouth off. I thought he was smarter than that."</TE>

<HD>ExxonMobil to End PBS Sponsorship</HD>
<DH>Oil giant won't fund 'Masterpiece Theatre' after 2004,
citing new priorities. Picture isn't bright for public TV financing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Public television's "Masterpiece Theatre" was dealt a blow Friday as
ExxonMobil Corp. announced it would no longer fund the signature PBS
drama series after 2004, ending a relationship that has run more than
three decades.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest publicly traded oil company has been the sole
sponsor of the series since it first aired in 1971. Along the way,
ExxonMobil became the largest corporate sponsor in public
television's history, with contributions of more than $250 million to
PBS programs in the last 32 years. Its recent "Masterpiece Theatre"
contributions have run about $9 million annually, according to people
familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   An ExxonMobil spokeswoman said Friday's decision, which came after
weeks of negotiations with series producer WGBH-TV in Boston, was the
result of shifting company priorities. "We felt that the time had
come for us to consider some alternative sponsorship and outreach
activities," particularly in the areas of public health and the
environment, said spokeswoman Sandy Duhe.</LD>
<TE>   She said the decision "wasn't based on disappointment on our
part," and praised the program, which in recent years has added
American drama to its previously all-British lineup and weathered two
schedule changes as PBS tried to fend off competition. "There never
seems to be a good time to end a relationship that has spanned more
than a generation," she said, adding that the company was open to
future PBS sponsorship.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision nonetheless comes at a crucial time in PBS'
history, as the Public Broadcasting Service seeks to find its way in
an era of increasing options for viewers searching for cultural and
public affairs programs.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Masterpiece Theatre" programs are funded for another two
years, replacing such a large sum of money isn't likely to be easy in
the current difficult corporate climate. After a down year in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, PBS and "Masterpiece Theatre"
have had a strong season this fall, with the series' seven-part
"Forsyte Saga" remake drawing about 16 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   But underwriting money -- nonprofit PBS doesn't carry traditional
ads -- has been spotty, as the economy has faltered and companies
have backed away from broad-based corporate philanthropy, embracing
targeted contributions more closely tied to specific business
objectives. PBS' upscale and influential audience is appealing but
small.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some successes. Johnson &amp; Johnson earlier this
year underwrote the Latino drama "American Family," and after a long
search, "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" lined up SBC Communications
Inc. funding last year and recently renewed the relationship. But
many of PBS' well-received children's series lack funding and the
series "Mystery!" was unable to find a sponsor for last month's
production of a Tony Hillerman Native American detective story, which
was executive-produced by Robert Redford. PBS says underwriting
remains below a 1999 high but has come back from a falloff last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that it's a difficult time," said WGBH
spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins, but she added that the station expects to
announce a new corporate sponsor for another series soon, evidence
that money is out there.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins said WGBH is "very disappointed" in the ExxonMobil
decision but added, "certainly, we have to be grateful for the past
32 years, which is unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   A PBS spokesman said that with two years to find new funding, it
is too early to speculate about the program's future. Hopkins, too,
tried to put a good face on the news, noting that because ExxonMobil
was the sole sponsor, the program has "never been available for
sponsorship before. This is the first time we'll be taking it out, so
who knows? We're optimistic," she said.</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Vaccination to Be Available to All</HD>
<DH>Bush announces plan to inoculate front-line personnel. He
says he will take vaccine but his family and staff won't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush, citing "the current level of threat and the inherent
health risks" of the smallpox vaccine, said Friday that he will take
the vaccine but neither his family nor his staff would be inoculated
against the deadly disease, even as he made the vaccine available to
all Americans for the first time in 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   "At present, the responsible course is to make careful and
thorough preparations in case a broader vaccination program should
become necessary in the future," Bush said. "There may be some
citizens, however, who insist on being vaccinated now. Our public
health agencies will work to accommodate them.</LD>
<LD>   "But that is not our recommendation at this time."</LD>
<TE>   Bush ordered the vaccination of as many as 500,000 military
personnel and announced that he, as commander in chief, would also be
inoculated. And he rolled out a plan for the voluntary inoculation of
some 439,000 public health workers and emergency room doctors and
nurses who would be among the first to investigate and treat victims
of a smallpox outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   By making the vaccine available to all Americans without
encouraging them to get it, Bush placed his administration's
long-awaited smallpox vaccination policy squarely in the context of
other protective steps the country has taken since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. He did not present the policy as a response to
real or perceived threats.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the smallpox virus still exists in laboratories. And
we believe that regimes hostile to the United States may possess this
dangerous virus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our government has no information that a smallpox attack is
imminent," he added. "Yet it is prudent to prepare for the
possibility that terrorists who kill indiscriminately would use
diseases as a weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, nominee for secretary of the new Homeland Security
Department, said, "We inoculate in order to prevent" a possible
attack using the smallpox virus, which can kill as many as one third
of its victims.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his administration's top homeland security and public
health officials also took care to emphasize that the government has
enough doses of the vaccine, as well as a rough state-by-state plan,
to inoculate all Americans in the event of a bioterror attack using
the virus.</TE>
<TE>   "We know how to fight smallpox," said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding,
director of the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"We have wiped out this disease before."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's top priority, the officials said, is the
vaccination of front-line military troops and diplomatic personnel,
particularly those stationed in the Middle East, and the essential
medical personnel who would be called upon to treat smallpox victims
and to vaccinate other Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Implementation of the Pentagon's vaccination plan began Friday at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where a few dozen military "first
responders" were inoculated, said Dr. Bill Winkenwerder, assistant
secretary of Defense for health affairs.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear when the president would be vaccinated. Ridge said
Bush would make that decision with the help of the White House
physician.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccination of members of the emergency response teams is
unlikely to begin until late January, when states and cities have had
the time to set up vaccination clinics, and the liability provisions
in the law establishing the Homeland Security Department have taken
effect.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has encouraged states to complete their vaccination of
response team members within 30 days, but Gerberding acknowledged
Friday that some states will need longer.</TE>
<TE>   Once that round of vaccinations is complete, state and local
health agencies will begin vaccinating as many as 7 million other
health-care and hospital workers, along with police, fire and other
emergency personnel.</TE>
<TE>   People who have eczema, a history of atopic dermatitis or HIV, as
well as organ transplant patients, those being treated for cancer and
pregnant women, should not volunteer to receive the smallpox vaccine,
health officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson acknowledged
that many concerns health workers have about both getting and giving
the vaccine -- including paid time off to recover from any harmful
side-effects of the vaccine and protection from being sued by those
harmed by the vaccine -- remained unresolved Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing everything we can to make Section 304 protect as
many people as possible," he said, referring to the Homeland Security
provision that exempts manufacturers of the vaccine from lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and the officials also stressed possible health complications
that can be caused by the vaccine, which contains a live virus
closely related to the smallpox virus called vaccinia.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cited a 1968 study showing that from
14 to 52 of every million people vaccinated for smallpox could
experience life-threatening side effects. They include encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain, and progressive vaccinia, a condition
that destroys skin tissue. One or two of those people would probably
die.</TE>
<TE>   Another 49 to 935 of every million people vaccinated are likely to
experience less serious side effects, such as muscle aches, fever and
fatigue, Fauci said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime next spring or summer, unlicensed stocks of the vaccine
will be made available to the general public. Thompson said he was
not aware of a large demand for vaccinations, and all the officials
reiterated that they were not recommending mass vaccinations at this
time.</TE>
<TE>   "But we will ensure access," Gerberding said.</TE>
<TE>   She suggested that Americans most anxious to get the vaccine
enroll in a clinical trial. Others should wait for the creation of a
new, broader vaccine protocol or until additional doses of the
licensed vaccine become available in 2004, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccination plan represents 15 months of planning and
preparation by several federal agencies, all 50 states, four cities,
and some 3,300 hospitals and other health-care facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Protecting our citizens from this deadly disease is definitely
worth the effort we're asking from our cities and states," Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Thompson added, the planning will strengthen the same
public health system that must respond to far more common health
threats, including influenza, listeria and the West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson encouraged Americans with questions about the vaccination
to consult the government's new Web site, www.smallpox.gov.</TE>

<CX>   Smallpox -- An article in Section A on Saturday about President
Bush's smallpox vaccination policy misstated some of the risks. The
story said that between 49 and 935 of every million people vaccinated
could experience such nonserious reactions as muscle aches, fatigue
and fever. That risk is for serious, but not life-threatening
reactions. Up to half of those vaccinated could experience minor
side-effects.</CX>

<LD>Natives of India's Andaman Islands, once famed for their ferocity and
unique appearance, are genetically separate from their neighbors and
may be descendants of Stone Age settlers, researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   Analysis of DNA from samples taken in recent times and 100 years
ago show the Andaman Islanders, which include a group known as the
Jarawa, are genetically different from other South Asians. The
islanders, who are on the verge of extinction, have a distinct
language and culture. They resemble African Pygmies and were once
called "Negritos."</LD>

<HD>Satellite Will Measure Thickness of Icecaps</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A NASA satellite being launched Thursday to take precision laser
readings of the world's icecaps will yield the most accurate view yet
of melting at the North and South poles.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have noticed melting in Greenland, the Arctic Ocean and
parts of Antarctica. But some parts of Greenland and Antarctica are
accumulating ice, leaving scientists unsure of what is causing the
melting in different regions or how much that melting will raise sea
levels.</LD>
<LD>   "The time is really right to take a comprehensive look," said
Waleed Abdalati, a lead scientist of the new ICESat project. "Big
things are going on."</LD>
<TE>   The satellite will use a laser altimeter system pulsing 40 times a
second to measure the thickness of ice to an accuracy of about 5
inches, said scientist Jay Zwally, and it will focus on Greenland and
Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   It will also be the first satellite to take precise measurements
of clouds and atmospheric aerosols such as soot, sulfate and sea salt
-- particles that play a large but little-understood role in
governing climate.</TE>
<TE>   The $232-million mission is scheduled to be launched from
Vandenberg Air Force Base.</TE>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The budget-conscious Montreal Expos were in the spotlight Friday
during an otherwise uneventful opening of the baseball winter
meetings, keeping clubs on hold while considering blockbuster trade
proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Minaya was the most popular general manager at the start of
the gathering that ends Monday, meeting late into the evening with
teams about the Expos' top players, including 20-game winner Bartolo
Colon, starter Javier Vazquez and second baseman Jose Vidro.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioner's office, which operates the Expos, instructed
Minaya to cut payroll for 2003, so the shopping rush is on. Even
clubs that can't afford the Expos' prices are affected by the big
sale, causing a ripple effect on other proposed deals.</LD>
<TE>   "I've heard that I'm holding these meetings hostage," Min- aya
said. "That's not what I'm trying to do, but I'm not going to make a
[quick] trade just because we're at the winter meetings."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees, New
York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies have been the most aggressive
teams, baseball sources said, making strong proposals for Colon.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Colon, whom the Expos acquired from the Cleveland
Indians in June, Montreal also is expected to move middle infielder
Orlando Cabrera and catcher Michael Barrett for packages of
prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to listen to as many clubs as possible and have
as many options as possible," Minaya said. "I'm going to do what's
best for the Montreal Expos."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, trading talented young players seemingly isn't in the
Expos' best interests, but the commissioner's office sets their
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's payroll is expected to increase from about $38 million
in 2002 to $44 million next season, officials said, but more than $50
million would be required to keep the group intact. That's not going
to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think teams are trying to take advantage of our
situation," Minaya said. "I think teams are saying, 'You've got some
pretty good players available and we know you have to trim payroll.'
That's the objective."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans also carefully considered his
options, saying the club "won't be pressured into situations" just
because the meetings had begun. Focused on acquiring a first baseman,
Evans conducted "fact-finding" sessions with many clubs, gauging the
availability of players such as Robert Fick of the Detroit Tigers,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have discussed numerous free-agent options to fill the
spot opened when Eric Karros was traded to the Chicago Cubs, but
Evans and officials from other teams said the Dodgers were not close
to completing a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here with the understanding internally that our goal was
to just find out where clubs were," he said. "The important thing is
for us to make the right call."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers signed utilityman Jolbert Cabrera to a one-year,
$435,000 contract and now have five arbitration-eligible players.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia received plenty of congratulations
from officials from other teams when he arrived at the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Scioscia, the American League manager of the year,
deflected praise, crediting players for their dedication in a World
Series-championship season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels aren't expected to be active during the meetings, but
they might pursue a reserve outfielder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger owner Walter O'Malley is among 41 finalists on the
ballot of the Hall of Fame's veterans committee.</TE>
<TE>   Other finalists with ties to the Dodgers are former general
manager Buzzie Bavasi and former players Gil Hodges, Don Newcombe and
Maury Wills.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Miller, who as head of their union led the players to
important legal victories that opened the way to multimillion-dollar
contracts, is also on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   To be inducted into the Hall of Fame, nominees must receive at
least 75% of ballots cast. Voting is in January.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresno State put its basketball team and athletic department on
probation for two years Friday for numerous NCAA rules violations
that included payments from agents to players.</LD>
<LD>   The actions came after a two-year probe by the university and NCAA
that dogged the final years of basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian's
career and cast a shadow over the program he rebuilt.</LD>
<LD>   One of the violations included gifts that one of Tarkanian's
former players, Houston Rocket guard Tito Maddox, accepted from an
agent. He was dismissed from school after accepting airline tickets,
and he recently told the Fresno Bee that he received $30,000 from an
agent.</LD>
<TE>   But the actions Friday were in response to problems across other
fields of play that included major violations and judgment errors,
said university President John Welty. The NCAA said in a letter to
the school that it found a lack of control over the department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson Vroman's three-point play with 19.8 seconds remaining
broke the final tie and helped Iowa State defeat Iowa, 73-69, in a

points to help No. 12 Minnesota defeat Missouri Kansas City, 88-53,
in a women's game at Minneapolis.</TE>

<LD>Tex Cobb, the human punching bag who made a living by absorbing the
blows of more skilled heavyweights, was once asked how long he would
go on fighting.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as they've got the money," he said, "I've got the brain
cells."</LD>
<LD>   Funny line. Sad truth.</LD>
<TE>   Cobb ultimately hung up his gloves and used whatever brain cells
he had remaining to earn a more-than-decent living as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   But unfortunately in boxing, there is always another Cobb, always
more brain cells to be destroyed in the pursuit of fame and fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Evander Holyfield. He already has all the fame and
fortune a man could ask for. He has been world heavyweight champion a
record four times, has fought all the major figures of his time, was
a participant in the most memorable match of this era -- the
ear-biting fiasco by Mike Tyson -- and has made himself a millionaire
many times over.</TE>
<TE>   Thought to be a fighter whose size didn't match his heart, an
overblown cruiserweight who didn't belong in the ring with the bigger
guys, Holyfield won enough big matches to win over his critics.</TE>
<TE>   But what in the world is Holyfield (38-5-2, 25 knockouts) doing
stepping back into the ring tonight at the age of 40 to face
32-year-old Chris Byrd (35-2, 20) for the vacant International Boxing
Federation heavyweight championship in Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City,
N.J.?</TE>
<TE>   Holyfield's speech seems more slurred now, his reflexes noticeably
slowed. It was obvious his skill level had dropped in his two fights
against Lennox Lewis. It was even more obvious in his three agonizing
matches against John Ruiz, which were as much wrestling as boxing, a
has-been and a never-will-be locking arms and exchanging head butts
because they didn't have much else to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as sad as that was, here's something even sadder: Considering
the state of the heavyweight division, Holyfield, deserves to be
ranked among the top contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis remains the class of the division. He has continued to get
better even at 37, an advanced age for a fighter, his confidence,
combinations and ring generalship never better.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond that, good luck.</TE>
<TE>   There is Tyson, who had all the meanness beaten out of him in June
by Lewis. Tyson's boxing skills deserted him long ago, but he was
still able to get by on his reputation. His bullying tactics had been
intimidating to some. But no longer.</TE>
<TE>   The hope of the division is the Klitschko brothers, Vitali and
Wladimir. They offer a great story line, two brothers from Ukraine
who migrated to Germany to launch their professional careers and have
now moved to the United States. They both have doctorates in sports
science, they speak four languages and, in a division too often tied
to all sorts of aberrant behavior outside the ring, the Klitschkos
appear to be true role models, traveling the world in support of
needy children.</TE>
<TE>   But can they fight?</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center, in what
was billed as a landmark night for the new world order in the
heavyweight division, Wladimir beat Jameel McCline on a 10th-round
TKO. Before the match, this pair was described as two of the top four
active heavyweights.</TE>
<TE>   McCline looked scared from the moment he entered the ring and went
down without much fight. Klitschko looked awkward, uncertain and wide
open for any opponent who has the vaguest understanding of the word
counterpunch.</TE>
<TE>   As for Vitali, he will get his crucial test this spring when he
faces Lewis, but he has already lost to Byrd, on a TKO in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing the heavyweight division has going for it right now
is a light-heavyweight. Roy Jones' attempt on March 1 to beat Ruiz,
who will outweigh him by about 40 pounds, is the most interesting
bout on the heavyweight horizon.</TE>
<TE>   With this lineup of also-rans, Holyfield can probably fight until
he's 50.</TE>
<TE>   Or until he runs out of brain cells.</TE>
<TE>   Come Back, Shane</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are continuing for welterweight Shane Mosley to fight
Raul Marquez on Feb. 8 at Mandalay Bay. Also on the proposed card is
another welterweight match between Andrew "Six Heads" Lewis and
Antonio Margarito. Negotiations, however, have broken off for now
between Mosley and Oscar De La Hoya over a September rematch. Mosley,
who beat De La Hoya in 2000, has been offered $4 million for a second
fight but is asking between $7 million and $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jab</TE>
<TE>   World Boxing Council welterweight champion Vernon Forrest (35-0,
26), who took the title from Mosley and beat him in a rematch, will
face World Boxing Assn. welterweight titleholder Ricardo Mayorga
(23-3-1, 21) in a unification fight Jan. 25 at the Pechanga
Entertainment Center in Temecula. Also on the card, IBF cruiserweight
champion Vassily Jirov (31-0, 27) will defend against James Toney
(65-4-2, 42).</TE>

<LD>The Tournament of Roses has a new name for its New Year's Day
football game: The Rose Bowl presented by PlayStation 2.</LD>
<LD>   How long will it be before it is simply the PlayStation 2 Bowl?
Never, you say? Well, look what happened to the venerable Los Angeles
Open.</LD>
<LD>   For 60 years it was the Los Angeles Open. In 1987 it became the
Los Angeles Open presented by Nissan. After two years it became the
Nissan Los Angeles Open and in 1995 just the Nissan Open.</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last Iowa player to win the Heisman
Trophy?</TE>
<TE>   No connection: Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee of the Miami
Hurricanes are finalists for the Heisman Trophy and are playing on a
team that is hoping to win a national championship in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 3. But there isn't much of a link between the champion and
Heisman winner.</TE>
<TE>   Only four players have won the Heisman from a team that ended up
No. 1 since 1949, Charles Woodson of Michigan the most recent in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Growing boy: Garrett Webster, son of former Pittsburgh Steeler
Hall of Fame center Mike Webster, is a 6-foot-9, 340-pound high
school lineman.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to eat," he said, not surprisingly. "If I'm real hungry I
can eat 25 pieces of pizza. I hate salads. The only way I like them
is if they're covered with a big porterhouse steak."</TE>
<TE>   His dad never weighed more than 255.</TE>
<TE>   Cricket news: Blind men from six nations are competing in cricket
this weekend in Madras, India. They use a hard plastic ball that
rattles, which helps the basemen and fielders to follow the action.
Playing are teams from India, South Africa, Pakistan, England,
Australia and Sri Lanka.</TE>
<TE>   Travel talk: The New York Jets play the Chicago Bears in
Champaign, Ill., on Sunday and Coach Herman Edwards had words of
warning for his team.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no Trump Towers, no five-star meals waiting at the
Holiday Inn, only Twinkies in the vending machine, claustrophobic
meeting rooms, no soft pillows, no sympathy," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Being the Bear: Tom Berenger, who plays Paul "Bear" Bryant in
tonight's ESPN showing of "The Junction Boys," told David Martindale
of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram how it felt to portray the coaching
icon:</TE>
<TE>   "To a lot of people, he's a god. This is a guy who's revered by
college football fans. And there have been a lot of great coaches who
played for him or coached with him who adopted his style.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that a lot of people who knew him will be tough critics
when they're watching. That's sticking your head on the block a
little bit, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Nile Kinnick in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Elliott was selected NASCAR's most popular
driver, for the 11th time in 12 years and 16th overall. Tom Sorensen
of the Charlotte Observer said that when Elliott retires, the award
should be named the Bill Elliott Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   On second thought, Sorensen said, "Let's call it the Bill Elliott
Fan Club Stuffed the Ballot Box Yet Again Award."</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Is Back, but Miller Is Hurting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Michael Olowokandi was activated from the injured list Friday, as
expected. Cherokee Parks was put on the injured list because of back
spasms, which wasn't surprising since the Clippers had to make room
on the roster. Eric Piatkowski sat out the Clippers' 97-84 loss to
the Spurs because of a lower abdominal strain, as expected.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Andre Miller continues to be troubled by a sprained
left ankle. He scored seven points on three-for-13 shooting in 29
minutes and, later, had both ankles in a bucket of ice in the locker
room.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think he's healthy," Coach Alvin Gentry said of Miller,
injured after a collision Nov. 29 with Sacramento's Bobby Jackson.
"He won't say it. He's always played with injuries. But you see him
run and play and he doesn't have the same explosiveness. He's trying
to gut it out and hope it gets better."</LD>
<TE>   Of Olowokandi's play in his return, Gentry said, "I thought he did
a great job defensively in making plays. It's tough for any player
who has a long layoff to get back into the rhythm of playing the
game. Things will continue to improve for him."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski is not expected to play tonight against the Houston
Rockets but hopes to be sound when the Clippers and Spurs play Monday
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson had 19 points on six-for-14 shooting and took
seven rebounds in 35 minutes in a reserve role.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Houston, 5:30 PST, Channel 5</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Compaq Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Clippers 9-14, Rockets 12-9.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Rockets -- 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Clippers complete their four-game tour of Louisiana
and Texas tonight. They are one of only six teams this season to play
all three Texas teams in consecutive games. The Clippers lost Tuesday
to the Dallas Mavericks and Friday against San Antonio. The Rockets
lost Friday against the Grizzlies at Memphis. Some of the Rockets'
improvement this season can be tied to better defense. They are
giving up an average of 10 fewer points compared with last season,
moving from 20th overall in the league to second. Of course, a good
deal of that has to do with the addition of Yao Ming. Centers who
stand 7 feet 5 tend to solidify defenses.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Lose in Bat of an Eye</HD>
<DH>Spurs go on a 28-4 spree after flying intruders halt game
at their new arena, then cruise for a 97-84 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Not long after the bats began circling the court, but closer to the
time the Clippers took a modest second-quarter lead Friday, the San
Antonio Spurs surged swiftly and confidently.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers, like the bats, were soon driven from the scene.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Tony Parker ran the Clippers off the
court during a 97-84 victory that was stoked by a 28-4 run that
lasted from midway through the second quarter to midway through the
third.</LD>
<TE>   Arena workers and the Spurs' coyote mascot, armed with towels and
bits of carpet, managed to scare off four wayward bats, sending them
heaven knows where after they delayed the game for a few moments in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time either event has transpired at San
Antonio, where the Clippers' all-time record stands at 8-48. Even the
Spurs' move this season from the Alamodome, where bats had taken
roost in the roof, to the new SBC Center, a dark and unremarkable
barn on the outskirts of nowhere, couldn't change the Clippers'
fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Nor could the return of center Michael Olowokandi from a five-game
layoff designed to calm the tendinitis in his left knee, which flared
up this month. Olowokandi scored 20 points and had 11 rebounds in 43
minutes, but he and forward Elton Brand were powerless to halt
Duncan, who scored 25 points and took 18 rebounds in 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Parker added 22 points and nine assists, two days after torching
the Dallas Mavericks for a career-best 32 points in the Spurs'
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "My wind wasn't bad," Olowokandi said of playing for the first
time since going on the injured list Dec. 1. "I felt OK. Hopefully,
things get better for me from here."</TE>
<TE>   With Olowokandi leading them, the Clippers seemed to have found
their game in the second quarter. They took a 43-40 lead on his
nine-foot hook shot, which happened about four minutes after the bats
had entered the arena and began buzzing the court, bringing cheers
and laughter from the crowd of 16,696 and concerned looks from
players, coaches and referees.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely not a good sign," Brand said after scoring 16 points
and taking 14 rebounds for his 19th game with 10 or more points and
rebounds, though his streak of games of 20 or more points ended at
seven.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs went on their 28-4 run, turning a three-point deficit
into a 68-47 advantage after David Robinson's layup and free throw
with 7:57 left in the third quarter. The Clippers cut the Spurs' lead
to nine a couple of times. But the game had been decided by then.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a great job of keeping up with them in the beginning, but
once they started double-teaming us, we couldn't make passes out of
the post and we didn't have good spacing," Coach Alvin Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, when the Clippers double-teamed the big men, Duncan or
Robinson always seemed to find an open teammate on the perimeter.
Often, it was Parker, who stood without a Clipper in sight. Parker
made 10 of 19 shots, including two of four from behind the
three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi had a deft shooting touch in his return, sinking nine
of 18, but he also committed six of the team's 14 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we did a great job on the interior," Olowokandi said.
"But we have to get better at getting passes out to our perimeter
guys. I think once we get into a rhythm and guys get more
comfortable, we'll start making double-teaming less effective.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a great job of staying in the game in the first half, but
they hit some big shots in the third quarter and buried us."</TE>

<LD>USC coaches held their breath during an anxious moment at practice
Friday, when quarterback Brandon Hance absorbed an inadvertent hit
from defensive end Omar Nazel.</LD>
<LD>   That wasn't part of the plan for Hance, who is rehabilitating a
surgically repaired right (throwing) shoulder and was participating
in his first team drills in more than a year, since he played for
Purdue last season.</LD>
<LD>   But Hance wasn't fazed by the unexpected contact. He quickly
rejoined play while a shaken-up Nazel walked to the sideline.</LD>
<TE>   "I loved the fact we get in an accident and he bounced right back
up," Coach Pete Carroll said of Hance. "It's good for his
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Although he isn't 100%, Hance threw the ball surprisingly well and
showed he is ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation. He is among
several quarterbacks vying to replace senior Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Hance is sitting out the season after transferring.</TE>

<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said he has been contacted about
head coaching openings at Kentucky and East Carolina, but neither
inquiry has progressed past the initial stages. "Nothing is going
on," Chow said.... Fewer than 5,000 tickets remain from USC's
allotment of 15,000 for the Orange Bowl, said Steve Lopes, senior
associate athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   -- Rob Fernas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA offensive tackle Mike Saffer and four freshman teammates have
received recognition from the Sporting News. Saffer, who has started
41 games as a Bruin, was named a second-team All-American. Outside
linebacker Spencer Havner and strong safety Jarrad Page were chosen
freshman All-Americans. Tailback Tyler Ebell and center Mike
McCloskey were named to the second team. In addition, Havner was
selected the Pac-10 defensive freshman of the year.... In a change of
policy, UCLA practices leading to the Las Vegas Bowl will be open to
the public. Practices are today from 2 to 4 p.m. and Monday through
Friday from 9 to 10:45 a.m.</TE>

<LD>Adolfo Gregorio scored the winning goal on a penalty kick in the 81st
minute to lead UCLA into the NCAA men's soccer championship game with
a 2-1 victory over Maryland on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (17-3-3) will play Stanford in Sunday's title game.
Stanford defeated Creighton, 2-1, in a semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   Gregorio assisted on a goal by Matt Taylor, and Sumed Ibrahim
scored for Maryland (20-5). All the scoring occurred in a
seven-minute span late in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought we played well in the first half but didn't reward
ourselves," UCLA Coach Tom Fitzgerald said. "The whole game wasn't as
fluid as we'd like it to be. But that's the mark of a good team, to
win even when you don't play well."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was awarded a penalty kick after forward Cliff McKinley was
pulled down in the box by Maryland goalkeeper Noah Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley was on a straightaway run in the box and had Palmer
beaten when the goalkeeper grabbed McKinley's leg.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I got my hand on the ball before he went down, but
unfortunately the ref didn't, and he got the penalty kick," Palmer
said.</TE>

<HD>Runahalf Produces Happy Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The night more than two years ago, when Runahalf ran for a $10,000
claiming price, several trainers were seen tearing up their claim
slips after they had seen the horse close-up in the Los Alamitos
paddock.</LD>
<LD>   "They saw that this horse could hardly see in his left eye,"
trainer Juan G. Aleman said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Aleman thought Runahalf might be a good buy at the price,
and two other trainers did too. They shake numbered pills out of a
bottle when more than one trainer puts in a claim, and in an
improbable scenario, winning that roll was the first step along a
path that has taken Runahalf and Aleman into tonight's $500,000
Champion of Champions. Runahalf has gone from a cheap claimer to an
8-1 longshot in the quarter horse race that frequently determines the
sport's world champion.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be proud of this horse, no matter where he finishes," Aleman
said. "Just to be part of a race like this is exciting."</TE>
<TE>   He trains the 5-year-old gray gelding for his father, Juan R.
Aleman, a spacecraft systems engineer from La Puente who was pulled
into racing by his son five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A Ransom, winner of the Champion of Champions and world champion
in 2000, is the 6-5 favorite as he shoots for his fifth consecutive
victory in an undefeated year. Saturday's race is the centerpiece of
a rich stakes weekend at the Orange County track. Friday night's Los
Alamitos Million, at $1,313,700, is the richest race in the track's
52-year history and the biggest purse for any breed in California
this year. There are two six-figure stakes on Sunday's card, one the
$200,000 Marathon National.</TE>
<TE>   A Ransom drew the No. 7 hole in the Champion of Champions.
Chiarascuro drew the inside post, and outside him in the gate, in
order, will be Miami Cartel, A Secret Account, Whosleavingwho, Corona
Kool, Dinastia Toll, A Ransom, Streakin Sin Tacha, Runahalf and
Beccas Bunny.</TE>
<TE>   "To win, my horse will have to run better than he ever has," Juan
G. Aleman said. "But I think he's capable of that."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Aleman, who took out a trainer's license three
years ago, estimates that Runahalf has only 10-15% vision in his left
eye and doesn't know what caused the injury. Through the years, some
fairly accomplished thoroughbreds -- among them One-Eyed King,
Cassaleria and Real Connection -- have forged stakes-winning careers,
despite blindness in one eye. Real Connection, a California mare
trained by Mel Stute, was bought for $55,000 by Bill Thomas and had
earned $1.2 million by the time her career ended.</TE>
<TE>   Runahalf, who has 10 victories, five seconds and nine thirds in 38
starts and purses of $108,207, earned his way into the Champion of
Champions by winning a division of the Z. Wayne Griffin Director's
Trials on Nov. 22. After Aleman claimed him in 2000, the horse
continued to run in the claiming ranks, and could have been bought
out of a race, for $25,000, as recently as April.</TE>
<TE>   Runahalf won an allowance race at Los Alamitos in May and ran one
more time for a tag -- a pricey $100,000 in August -- before settling
into stakes company. He had his biggest effort, at 46-1, in October,
when he lost by a neck as A Ransom and Whosleavingwho ran one-two in
the Los Alamitos Championship, which at 440 yards is the same
distance as tonight's race.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I saw him, after he shipped in here from Texas, I
liked the way he ran," Aleman said. "He's gotten better with age.
I've put a lot of work into him, because he's not the easiest horse
to train. In fact, he can be a real pain to be around."</TE>
<TE>   Runahalf can see well enough to keep his handlers wide-eyed at the
barn.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no getting around it, he's a mean horse," Aleman said.
"He's gotten me a couple of times. One time, he smashed me up against
the wall in his stall."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First Place Queen, one of five 2-year-olds saddled by trainer John
Bassett, upset favored Meteoric to win the Los Alamitos Million.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Micah Leslie and the Newcomb Cattle Company, the daughter
of First Place Queen and 9-1 longshot broke quickly under jockey G.
R. Carter and won by about a half-length in 19.73 seconds for the 400
yards.</TE>

<HD>Division II Finale's a Struggle of Strong Suits</HD>
<DH>The Southern Section championship game will be a contest
between Newhall Hart's fast offense and Mission Viejo's tight
defense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-powered offenses, stingy defenses and teams that have
established traditions of excellence unmatched in Southern California
in the last few seasons -- the Southern Section Division II
championship football game has it all.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Mission Viejo (13-0), the defending champion, is riding
a 27-game winning streak heading into the 2 p.m. showdown today at
Edison Field. Second-seeded Newhall Hart (12-0-1) has a 35-game
unbeaten streak and has won four consecutive Division III titles.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of coaches who have had the misfortune of playing each
team weighed in on which might prevail today.</LD>
<TE>   Canyon Country Canyon suffered a 35-9 loss to Hart during Foothill
League play and fell to Mission Viejo, 48-14, in a quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I would certainly give Hart the advantage with its outstanding
offense," Coach Harry Welch said. "I don't know how Mission Viejo
prepares for that offense in one week. Mission Viejo may be in for
mission impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "The sophistication of Hart's passing attack is something they
haven't seen nor can they duplicate in practice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Hart's pass-first, pass-second, run-third offense has
generated 37.8 points per game behind quarterback Sean Norton. The
junior playmaker, generously listed at 6 feet on the roster, has
passed for 3,769 yards and 35 touchdowns and probably will extend the
Indians' string of all-section quarterbacks to 18 consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Norton doubly dangerous is his scrambling ability in
the spread offense. He has rushed for 576 yards and six touchdowns,
including 63 yards last week during Hart's 24-17 semifinal victory
over San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   But Eric Patton, the San Clemente coach, doesn't think Norton will
be able to roam freely against a Mission Viejo defense that limited
his Tritons to 14 points during a 35-point victory in South Coast
League play.</TE>
<TE>   "What you will see is a pass rush that just won't quit," Patton
said of Mission Viejo. "I don't think Hart has a way to block [nose
tackle] Chris Cole, and he could be devastating. That's going to
neutralize Hart quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo's defense is giving up only 8.7 points per game,
thanks in large part to its starting linemen, who average 6-1 and 240
pounds. Still, the Diablo linebackers will face a big challenge
against Hart: containing its third and fourth receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "Mission Viejo's corners should neutralize Hart's outside
receivers," Patton said, "but I don't think Mission has seen a team
that throws the ball so effectively to so many receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think the edge goes to Mission. Hart's a good football
team and they're very skilled, but Mission's skilled and physical."</TE>
<TE>   The coaches on the hot seat today know plenty about winning
championships. Hart's Mike Herrington has won five section titles,
one more than Mission Viejo's Bob Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Herrington is concerned about the Diablos' balanced offense, which
could match Hart yard for yard. Mission Viejo quarterbacks Josh
Rodarmel and Marty Tadman are both expected to play, and for good
reason.</TE>
<TE>   Rodarmel has completed 70% of his passes for 903 yards and 13
touchdowns with only three interceptions. Though not as prolific a
passer as his teammate, Tadman brings tremendous scrambling ability,
having rushed for 184 yards on the season.</TE>
<TE>   A mammoth offensive line led by USC-bound Drew Radovich has
provided ample protection for the quarterbacks and opened Texas-sized
holes for running back Ryan Holmes (1,131 yards, 16 touchdowns).</TE>
<TE>   "They have that big offensive line with the power running game and
the play-action pass," Herrington said. "We hope technique overcomes
[their size advantage], but it looks like it might be a big problem
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the onus would be on each team's defense, but added,
"There's tiebreakers, so somebody's going down."</TE>

<KH>DIVISION III FOOTBALL FINAL</KH>
<HD>Notre Dame Holds On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was more queasy than easy, and it reminded fans of Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame a little too much of a tough semifinal loss two years ago
against Manhattan Beach Mira Costa.</LD>
<LD>   But in the end, Notre Dame held on for a 20-17 victory over Mira
Costa to win the Southern Section Division III championship Friday
before 5,000 at El Camino College.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame quarterback Marcel Marquez ran for two touchdowns and
passed for another -- all in the first half -- and the Knights
withstood a furious comeback in the final three minutes to win their
first Division III title since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Mira Costa came screaming into the game averaging 40 points in
three playoff victories, but was shockingly quiet Friday until
scoring two touchdowns in the final 2:56.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after pulling to within 20-17, Mira Costa recovered an
onside kick with 1:07 left, but turned the ball over on downs.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, however, fumbled the snap from center and gave Mira Costa
another chance with 16 seconds left at the Notre Dame 25. The
Mustangs threw incomplete into the end zone and Tyler Pringle's
41-yard attempt went wide left with two seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez called the ending "the scariest thing ever."</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Kevin] Rooney said to hang on like a bulldog ... and we
did," Marquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez was sizzling in the first half, completing eight of nine
passes for 168 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown pass to Josh
Cordray that put Notre Dame ahead, 13-0, with 1:39 left in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez opened the scoring on a 41-yard option keeper down the
right side. He also scored on an 18-yard run with 51 seconds left in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, a senior, finished with 117 yards rushing and completed
10 of 12 passes for 205 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when the teams played in a Division III semifinal,
Mira Costa running back Michael Okwo had 253 yards in 46 carries as a

<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whitney Lewis ran wild in his final high school game Friday, scoring
five touchdowns and rolling up 359 yards of offense to lead Ventura
St. Bonaventure High to a 40-14 victory over Westlake Village
Westlake in the Southern Section Division IV championship before
8,000 at Moorpark High.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-2, 218-pound senior, an electrifying receiver and running
back headed for a high-profile Division I college, had touchdown runs
of 16, 80 and 38 yards, and scored on 52-yard pass play as the
Seraphs (13-1) ran up a 33-7 halftime lead.</LD>
<LD>   He added a 21-yard touchdown reception the first time he touched
the ball in the third quarter. Breaking tackles throughout the game,
Lewis rushed for 192 yards in nine carries and caught seven passes
for 167 yards.</LD>
<TE>   After the game, he signed autographs and posed for photos with
youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next few weeks, I'll be able to focus on next year and
college," Lewis said. "Tonight, I just wanted to focus on winning a
championship, and that's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure, three-time Division XI champion, has won 55 of
its last 56.</TE>
<TE>   "What this means is that the other three championships before were
all very special," St. Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack said. "But we would
have competed at any level the last four years."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' 16-yard run capped St. Bonaventure's opening drive and a
38-yard run by Matt Lee late in the first quarter put the Seraphs up
12-0.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake (11-3) cut the margin to 12-7 on the final play of the
first quarter with an eight-yard pass from Erik Vose to Michael
Stuart, but the Warriors' efforts to stop Lewis were futile.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis grabbed a slant pass and raced 52 yards to give St.
Bonaventure a 19-7 lead. Five minutes later, on the next play after
an end zone interception by David Brunner, Lewis swept left and ran
80 yards untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it every day in practice," Mack said of Lewis. "The only
guy who can cover him is David Brunner, and he plays for us."</TE>

<HD>Jackson's 8 Touchdowns Lead Centennial, 57-55</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrell Jackson finished the comeback he started Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson scored eight touchdowns to lead Corona Centennial to a
57-55 victory over Riverside North in the Division V Championship
game at Riverside Norte Vista High.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson scored on a 13-yard run, his third touchdown in overtime,
and DeAnthony Hicks followed with a two-point run to put Centennial
up, 57-49.</LD>
<TE>   Damon Morton made a 15-yard touchdown reception on North's final
possession, but Jody Johnson intercepted a pass on the conversion try
to seal Centennial's second section title in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial scored 21 points in the third quarter to take a 28-14
lead, but North countered with 21 consecutive points to move ahead,
35-28, with 7:42 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial got the ball back with just under three minutes left
and marched 74 yards in 13 plays, tying the score on a one-yard run
by Jackson on fourth down with nine seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   North's comeback began when it put together an 80-yard drive and
cut the lead to 28-21 on a 22-yard touchdown run by Josh Barnett.
Centennial running back Terrell Jackson fumbled on the next play, and
North's Damon Morton tied the score three plays later on a 28-yard
touchdown reception from his brother, Dion.</TE>
<TE>   North forced a punt and then drove 74 yards to take a 35-28 lead
on a 16-yard run by Adam Wright.</TE>

<LD>Southern Section</LD>
<LD>   Los Alamitos (12-0-1) vs. Mater Dei (10-3) at Edison Field, 7:30
p.m.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first championship-game meeting between Orange County
rivals who often served as stumbling blocks for one another in the
playoffs during the 1990s. Mater Dei won three of those four
meetings, including a 33-6 decision when the teams last met in 1998.
While the unseeded Monarchs are seeking their first title since 1999,
second-seeded Los Alamitos is seeking its first Division I title. The
Griffins won Division II titles in 1992 and '93 under John Barnes,
the winningest coach in Orange County history. Los Alamitos features
a dynamic offense in which quarterback Jeff Kline throws to a
multitude of speedy receivers or hands off to 1,000-yard rusher Ryan
Bagley. Kline, who has passed for 1,900 yards and 16 touchdowns, is
16-1-2 as a starter. Mater Dei's offense is more predictable --
1,000-yard rusher Rafael Rice gets the call nearly 50% of the time --
but the Monarchs can't be overlooked after upsetting top-seeded Long
Beach Poly, 21-20, in the semifinals. Defensive back Corey Boudreaux,
who had two interceptions and made the winning reception against the
Jackrabbits, will probably need another big game if Mater Dei is to
pull off a second consecutive upset.</LD>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   West Covina South Hills (10-3) vs. Walnut (12-1) at Cal State
Fullerton, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Walnut, seeded second in Division VII and in its first title game,
hadn't won a playoff game since reaching the semifinals in 1978;
fourth-seeded South Hills is trying to win its second title in three
years, its third overall. The teams finished first and second in the
San Antonio League, with Walnut taking advantage of five South Hills
turnovers, scoring twice in the first two minutes and winning, 30-9.
Ryan O'Shields rushed for 139 yards and three touchdowns in that game
and also caught a touchdown pass from Daniel Al-Gattas.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Phelan Serrano (13-0) vs. Fontana Kaiser (12-0-1) at Fontana High,
7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Serrano has been riding a roller coaster of emotions since last
week, when a popular student trainer, Sarah Rojas, was killed in a
car accident the day before the Diamondbacks defeated Cathedral City
in triple overtime to advance to their first championship game.
Top-seeded Kaiser is making its second consecutive appearance in the
Division VIII title game. The biggest challenge for the Cats will be
containing running back Chris Vega, who has rushed for 2,356 yards
and scored 37 touchdowns this season.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos Valley Christian (12-1) vs. Carpinteria (13-0) at Santa
Barbara City College, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Two contrasting styles clash in the Division XI title game, a
rematch of the 1986 Inland Conference championship. Valley Christian
is big and physical, Carpinteria small and fast. Valley Christian,
which has two section titles, including a 10-7 victory in that 1986
game, uses a balanced offense led by running back Chase Twedell
(2,272 yards in 263 carries). Quarterback Taylor Cameron has 1,903
yards and 25 touchdowns passing. His favorite target, Brad
Boekestein, has 49 catches for 1,140 yards and 16 touchdowns.
Carpinteria, winner of five section titles -- the last in 1991 --
relies on a veer-option running attack. Tailback Luis Soto (1,300
yards) and quarterback Aaron Gonzales (975 yards rushing, 1,400
passing) are the top threats. Valley Christian has averaged 46.4
points and allowed 14. Carpinteria averages 41.7 points and allows
11.7.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Edwards AFB Desert (13-0) at Ontario Christian (12-1), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario Christian, seeded fourth in Division XII, won section
titles in 1978 and '82. It has been dominant since an opening-week
loss to Division X finalist Cerritos Valley Christian. Ontario
Christian has outscored opponents by an average of 48-9 in its last
11 games, a span that includes five shutouts and two games in which
the Knights allowed only a safety. Running back Drew Robinson is the
leading rusher with 2,098 yards and leading receiver with 19 catches
for 580 yards. He has scored 39 touchdowns. Second-seeded Desert,
making its second section final appearance, won the 1981 title.
Quarterback Nick Gava, running back Jason Napolean and multitalented
Rudy Burgess lead an offense that has averaged 37.8 points a game
this season.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Poly vs. Simi Valley Grace Brethren at Moorpark High,
7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these teams was expected to reach the title game,
particularly Grace Brethren, which is playing its first season of
11-man football. But the Lancers opened the Division XIII playoffs by
beating third-seeded Arcadia Rio Hondo Prep, 20-7, and later hammered
second-seeded San Juan Capistrano Saddleback Valley Christian, 42-14,
in the semifinals. Grace Brethren is led by sophomore Chad Kackert,
who has rushed for 1,000 yards. Pasadena Poly ended top-seeded
Temecula Linfield Christian's 11-game winning streak last week,
35-20. The fourth-seeded Panthers won the Division XIII title in
1999.</TE>

<HD>Los Altos Topples Foothill, 27-10</HD>

<AU>Martin Henderson; Paul McLeod; Steven Herbert</AU>
<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may have been the quietest 209-yard rushing performance in
Southern Section championship history. So fierce was the defense of
Hacienda Heights Los Altos that Mike Liti's big night was nothing
more than a footnote.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Los Altos won its third championship in four years,
defeating Liti and Santa Ana Foothill, 27-10, for the Division VI
title before 8,020 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Led by linemen Brigham Harwell, Armando Soto and Andrew Rodriguez,
linebacker Oscar Ibanez and defensive backs Caleb Flores and Daniel
Drayton, Los Altos showed it was just as quick as Foothill's vaunted
offense, and certainly more physical.</LD>
<TE>   Liti came into the game with 2,136 yards and 28 touchdowns. He
finished with 209 yards in 21 carries, but he scored only once, on a
29-yarder with 9 minutes 14 seconds left, to cut Foothill's deficit
to 20-10.</TE>
<TE>   "Offense scores, but defense wins championships," said Harwell,
who had one of Los Altos' five sacks and also wrapped up punter Doug
McAuley while Tony Ortiz blocked the kick, setting up Carlos
Ordonez's five-yard scoring pass to Flores for a 20-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only shortcoming for Los Altos. The Conquerors
outrushed Foothill, 204-178, with Randall Brown carrying 26 times for
146 yards, including touchdowns of two and one yards.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill quarterback Don Poole had completed 63% of his passes for
2,756 yards and 20 touchdowns coming into the game, but he was five
for 14 for 36 yards. He took only four snaps in the second half --
two of them resulting in sacks -- after suffering a hip pointer.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   La Habra 27, Garden Grove Pacifica 21 -- The Highlanders did what
they had to do early in the game, then held off Pacifica to win the
Division IX championship at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first Southern Section title for La Habra (13-1), which
was playing in its second championship game in three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Highlanders took a 27-7 lead early in the second quarter, then
finished off the final 3 minutes 46 seconds of the game with a march
from their own 20-yard line to the Mariners' 27.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica (11-3) used a six-yard pass from quarterback Justin
Turner to Tim Brannen to pull within 27-14 at the half, then scored
on a 27-yard touchdown pass play from Turner to R.J. Koch late in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   That's when La Habra, which lived by the pass most of the season,
kept the ball on the ground. Running back Sean Findling banged up the
middle four times for 36 yards and quarterback Daniel Morales gained
30 yards on two bootlegs during the drive.</TE>
<TE>   Findling finished with 129 hard-earned yards and three touchdowns
on runs of one, 13 and four yards in the first 14 minutes. His
27-yard interception return also set up a score.</TE>
<TE>   Turner completed 23 of 34 passes for 257 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Lompoc 16, Gardena Serra 13 -- Andrew Jones scored on a one-yard
quarterback sneak with 2:17 left to play as the Braves, who had built
a 10-0 lead, rallied to beat previously undefeated Serra in the
Division X title game at Serra.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Cavaliers (13-1) took a 13-10 lead with 9:53 left
on Terry Wilson's 43-yard touchdown pass play to Devin Stearns.</TE>
<TE>   Lompoc (11-3) responded with its 14-play, 80-yard, game-winning
drive. Robert Adams ran for 37 yards in five carries, Jones completed
both of his passes for 29 yards and caught a nine-yard pass from Matt
Winn. Adams would finish with 108 yards in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Serra drove to Lompoc's 39 on its ensuing possession, but the
Cavaliers' comeback hopes ended when Winn intercepted a Wilson pass
at the Lompoc 15.</TE>
<TE>   Lompoc drove 78 yards in 16 plays on the game's opening series,
settling for Armondo Gutierrez's 21-yard field goal. Benny Ornelas
then returned a Robert Munoz punt 40 yards for a touchdown and a
10-lead.</TE>

<LD>If Composure doesn't win the $200,000 Hollywood Starlet today, it
would be one of the biggest surprises of the year.</LD>
<LD>   A game second to the unbeaten Storm Flag Flying in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile Fillies while beating the rest of the field by almost 10
lengths at Arlington Park on Oct. 26, the daughter of Touch Gold is
facing no such monsters in the 1 1/16-mile Starlet.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, Composure will be heavily favored
to give trainer Bob Baffert his third win in the Grade I in the last
five years. Baffert won with Excellent Meeting in 1998 and with
Habibti last year.</LD>
<TE>   Last in her sprint debut at Del Mar on July 28 when part of an
entry that was 3-5, Composure has not finished worse than second in
four subsequent races. One of her two victories came by three lengths
in the Oak Leaf, Oak Tree's biggest race for 2-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   In other graded stakes on today's card, Grey Memo will try for his
fifth lifetime win at Hollywood Park against seven other older horses
in the $100,000 Native Diver Handicap at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership and trained by Warren Stute, Grey Memo, a
5-year-old son of Memo, has won eight of 41 and earned nearly $1.36
million.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Xtra Heat will make her first start for new
owners David Plummer and Tony Ferguson and go after her 25th win in
33 races in the $75,000 Garland of Roses Handicap at Aqueduct.</TE>

<LD>Horace Grant is out there, somewhere between retirement parties and
birthday parties, maybe willing to be talked into one more stretch
run, maybe not.</LD>
<LD>   Though he suggested Thursday he would call Grant, waived Wednesday
by the Orlando Magic, Phil Jackson said Friday he hadn't yet, and
might not.</LD>
<LD>   In the hours after Grant's release, it became plain that his
surgically repaired knee was not the crux of his issues in Orlando,
and that Coach Doc Rivers was. So it's possible he has some
basketball left in him, at 37.</LD>
<TE>   In a nice bit of coincidence, the Magic is here Sunday, too soon,
probably, to get Grant his old gold uniform back.</TE>
<TE>   "In all fairness to the players that are on this team, the group
we picked out to be our chosen 13, we're not talking about change
until after the holidays," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   That might be fine with Grant, who joked with an Orlando Sentinel
writer Wednesday that he'd be happy to resume his career with the
Lakers ... in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to assess where we are as a basketball team," Jackson
said. "We haven't been able to do that yet. I think Shaquille is
getting into condition. I think the players are learning how to play
together again.... So, I think we're getting close. We've been
playing pretty good basketball. Although we can't sustain it for a
long period, that's part of conditioning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he found himself rooting for the Laker role players
to stand up to the Laker superstars in a clumsy week for Laker
camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not chopped liver, you know," he said. "They're players
of some renown and they've been on championship teams and they've
been able to perform under pressure. They have a role to play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Ostertag, in the wake of his ejection and fine for arguing
O'Neal had fouled him in the first quarter Sunday: "I have nothing
against Shaq; he's a good player [and] deserves the credit he gets
for being the guy he is. But at the same time, a lot of stars in this
league are very, very well protected [by referees]. Guys like me --
I'm not a star -- they're out here just trying to do their best
against guys like him, and they get ticky-ticky fouls. That's just
not right."</TE>

<HD>Level Best Not Good Enough at UCLA</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I enjoyed Bill Plaschke's article "As New Star Rises, Will Lavin
Fall?" and Chris Dufresne's article "Will Bruins Show Them the
Money?" on Dec. 10. Unlike their obtuse colleague T.J. Simers, I
think Dan Guerrero's decision was the right decision, and his
comments at the news conference were right on point.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA needs to move forward with its football and basketball
programs. UCLA should not be content with being a second-tier program
in both sports. Terry Donahue brought UCLA from the third tier to a
consistent second tier and occasional first-tier team. The hiring of
Bob Toledo seven years ago sent a signal to the program that UCLA is
content with being a strong second-tier school. As Guerrero said in
the news conference, UCLA should move to the next level.</LD>
<LD>   Dean Yanohira</LD>

<TE>   What do UCLA and UC Riverside have in common? Bob Toledo was their
last football coach and neither one of them has a football team.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Snyder</TE>
<TE>   Grand Terrace</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instead of crediting Bob Toledo because he tied for fourth place
in the tough Pacific 10 Conference, even though he was picked in the
preseason to come in sixth, you can also call it the way it is: He
tied for the fourth-worst record in the tough Pac-10. Sounds to me
that he did just as bad as his pitiful preseason pick.</TE>
<TE>   Don Geller</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA showed a complete lack of class in firing Coach Toledo. I
thought they were above such giving in to the ravings of a few
loud-mouthed alums. How would USC have done if Carson Palmer had gone
down with a broken leg in the middle of the season?</TE>
<TE>   Bob Cossarek</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I strongly agree with Chris Dufresne that UCLA should spend at
least one million dollars a year on salary for its new head football
coach. Heck, I think they should spend two million dollars!</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there's a huge state budget crisis. But a public,
tax-payer-funded college like UCLA should make winning football games
its highest priority because ... er ... well, because that's what the
public wants.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Srednicki</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been a supporter of UCLA athletics for quite some time now
and applaud Dan Guerrero's bold move in firing Bob Toledo. I don't
wish anyone to be out of work during the holidays, but I'm sure his
$1.3 million may soothe the sting of his dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Could the day be far off when there is another call on the UCLA
campus, followed by "Mr. Lavin? Mr. Guerrero is on line one. Do you
wish to take the call?"</TE>
<TE>   Bob Werner</TE>
<TE>   New Albany, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years I have read Steve Henson's articles about
UCLA football where I have often been misquoted or misrepresented.
Tuesday's article is one I cannot let go uncorrected. The firing of
Coach Bob Toledo is very unfortunate. Furthermore, the termination
and consequential uprooting of the coaches and their families do not
bring me "glee," which was stated in the article. I have had five
years of experience with these coaches and wish it could have ended
in a more positive manner for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Paus</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While many UCLA alumni hold J.D. Morgan in esteem, I always
believed that the school's best athletic director was Wilbur Johns.
In 1948, Johns, who was A.D. and basketball coach, fired himself from
the latter job and hired John Wooden. The next year he terminated
football Coach Bert LaBrucherie and replaced him with Red Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   These two moves, more than anything else, put UCLA on the national
stage in the major sports. Come next spring, Dan Guerrero will have
the opportunity to become the next Wilbur Johns. All Bruin fans
should hope he takes advantage of it.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps the best indication of how hard a big man (including
Shaquille O'Neal) is playing is in the rebounding totals. In 39
minutes Shaq got nine rebounds (four offensive). The two Golden State
centers, Erick Dampier and Adonal Foyle, got 10 rebounds (six
offensive) between them in a combined 37 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe we need to add another name to the list of Lakers who aren't
playing hard enough.</LD>

<TE>   What's wrong with the Lakers? It's not Shaq -- even though he
should have had his surgery sooner. It's not Kobe -- even though he
plays selfishly sometimes. It's not even Phil Jackson -- even though
he doesn't really coach.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that Jerry Buss is arrogant and cheap. After the
first championship, he decided that the Lakers could win with Shaq,
Kobe and any stiffs available. And over the past three years, he has
awarded contracts accordingly. While every other team has tried to
improve, Buss has been more interested in avoiding the luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth championship? Forget about it. They will be lucky to win
four games in a row.</TE>

play defense.</TE>

<LD>I am delighted to hear now the potential new rules the BCS will use
to determine bowl hopefuls and contenders:</LD>
<LD>   1. The standard flipping of coins and drawing of straws.</LD>
<LD>   2. Stabbing pins in a map while blindfolded.</LD>
<TE>   3. Picking papers out of a hat.</TE>
<TE>   4. Throw darts at a map over the shoulder while blindfolded.</TE>

states at random.</TE>

<TE>   Those USC fans should quit whining about how unfair the BCS is. If
it wasn't for the series, the Trojans would be strutting their
two-loss record in the lowly Holiday Bowl far from New Year's Day.
Instead, the BCS foisted the Trojans on a BCS bowl that didn't even
want them.</TE>
<TE>   And in the end, the BCS did exactly what it was designed to do: It
placed the only undefeated teams in the country in a title game when
they would not otherwise have been able to play each other.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne S. Kreger</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is embarrassing to read the tidal wave of whining that The
Times sportswriters have penned in relation to the "unjust" BCS.
Pulleeeassseee. This whole Pacific 10-Big Ten Rose Bowl matchup has
been overblown for years. In years past, it usually meant two
mediocre teams dressed up in pageantry, playing for civic pride.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, if the old Rose Bowl alliance was currently in
place, then Plaschke and Co. would be crying about the unfairness of
Ohio State's being left out of the national championship game. In the
past, the "ingenious" Rose Bowl game deprived us of heavyweight
national championship games between Nebraska and Penn State in 1994
and Michigan-Nebraska in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Craig P. Fagan</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The BCS was handed a no-brainer this year by having the only two
undefeated Division I college football teams face off in the Fiesta
Bowl. But even when the BCS gets it right, it still manages to get
something wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Espinoza</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It won't be long before some of the pro leagues emulate the
brilliant BCS system.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix Suns' final won-lost record will be padded a few games
due to their strength of schedule in the Pacific Division. The
popular Chicago Cubs will be given special at-large playoff
consideration because they travel well. A minimum 9-7 record will be
the ticket to earn the Pittsburgh Steelers a favorable playoff seed.
After all, they are the Pittsburgh Steelers!</TE>

<LD>I am not sure what mental state the Dodger front office was in when
they concluded to make the trade to bring catcher Todd Hundley to the
West Coast, but we Chicagoans are delighted.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger fans, you now have on your hands a self-absorbed, overpaid
catcher, who will likely strike out about 40% of the time. And I hope
your schedule does not include too many day games. If so, poor Todd
will likely complain, as he did in Chicago, that having to get to the
ballpark at 11 a.m. for a day game just does not suit his time clock.</LD>
<LD>   Again, many thanks to the Dodgers for this early Christmas present
to the city of Chicago.</LD>

<TE>   As the door hits Eric Karros on his way out to Chicago, I wanted
to relive some fond memories of his Dodger career.</TE>
<TE>   I will always remember his "it's early" speeches when his team was
floundering in June. I will fondly remember 11 years in Dodger
uniform with zero playoff victories. To his credit, he did work hard
to become an average first baseman, but he never could compete with
others in the NL at the position. He was never invited to an All-Star
game.</TE>
<TE>   He represents why the Dodgers have floundered for 14 years. He
represented the simply average level of Dodger play during his
tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute, we traded him to get Hundley back? I take it all
back, I miss him already.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Visconti</TE>
<TE>   Fontana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your choice to run an action shot of Eric Karros making an error
was more revealing of you than it was of Karros.</TE>
<TE>   I can understand the difficulty in trying to find a photograph
that depicted the heart and soul or the grittiness that Karros
embodied, yet somehow after 12 years and 270 home runs one might
assume there was an available shot of the L.A. Dodger home run king
actually doing just that. But you guys chose the funny shot. How very
"Simers" of you.</TE>
<TE>   No big deal, I guess. The local paper sends off one of the good
guys in sports with a raspberry. I would only suggest that, in the
future, you avoid that sticky double standard of your columnists
writing about the decline in ethics of the modern athletes. You have
proved it to be a meaningless bar to strive for.</TE>

restructure Todd Hundley's contract: a dollar a year for 12 1/2
million years.</TE>

<LD>Why am I a Kings' hockey fan? It's not only the game. It is the
people. Last week, my 16-year-old daughter contacted the Kings
through their Web site about a speech she was to give on fighting in
the National Hockey League for one of her classes. She was hoping to
get feedback from Jim Fox, the TV color commentator and 10-year NHL
veteran. Not only did they pass the request on, Mr. Fox personally
took the time for a 20-minute telephone interview.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Jim Fox and the entire King organization.</LD>

<LD>No. 5 Oregon (5-0) at Pepperdine (3-2), 7:30 p.m., Fox Sports West 2,
KPLS (830) -- Pepperdine has won three in a row despite missing
several key players. Oregon presents the Waves with their biggest
challenge yet. The Ducks are averaging 90 points and nearly 10
three-point field goals a game, led by point guard Luke Ridnour and
forward Luke Jackson. Ridnour is averaging 21.2 points and 7.8
assists, and Jackson averages 18.4 points, 7.4 rebounds and 3.2
steals. Oregon defeated Kansas, 84-78, Dec. 7 in Portland. Pepperdine
has been forced to juggle its lineup without center Will Kimble
(heart condition), forward Glen McGowan (knee injury) and point guard
Devin Montgomery (broken thumb). The short-handed Waves still managed
to defeat UC Santa Barbara, 72-68, Dec. 7. Forward Jimmy Miggins
averages 16.2 points and guard Terrance Johnson averages 15.8 points.
Pepperdine is playing a Pacific 10 Conference team at home for the
first time since 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach State (1-5) at Loyola Marymount (4-3), 7:30 p.m., KRLA
(870), KXLU-FM (88.9) -- Loyola plays the third of five consecutive
games against Big West Conference teams, after losing to UC Irvine
and defeating Cal State Fullerton. The balanced Lions are led by
sophomore point guard Charles Brown, who averages 10.4 points and
ranks first on the team in assists (4.4), rebounding (4.1) and steals
(2.1). Long Beach has lost four in a row since beating Cal State
Monterey Bay. Guard Tony Darden averages 18.5 points for the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   -- Rob Fernas</TE>
<TE>   Idaho State (2-4) at CS Fullerton (1-5), 7 p.m. -- This is a good
chance for Fullerton, which has played a tougher schedule than the
Bengals, to redirect itself after opening the season 1-5 for the
third straight season under third-year Coach Donny Daniels. Former
Compton Centennial guard Marquis Poole leads the Bengals, who have
been idle for 10 days since ending a three-game losing streak with a
72-56 home win over Menlo College. Poole had 10 assists in 20 minutes
against Menlo.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State (3-3) at CS Northridge (4-2), 7 p.m. -- A couple of
streaks are on the line. Northridge has won three in a row overall.
All of San Jose State's losses were on the road. Junior forward Oudie
Baker leads the Spartans in scoring (15.3 points) and is second in
rebounds (5.7). Swingmen Ian Boylan (17.2) and Curtis Slaughter
(11.3) lead Northridge in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Cruz (0-5) at UC Riverside (0-2), 7 p.m. -- The Division
III Fighting Banana Slugs may provide a slower tempo for UC
Riverside, which opened with losses to USC (81-68) and San Diego
(84-64). The Highlanders have been idle since Nov. 30. Riverside
guard Nate Carter has scored 40 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.</TE>

<HD>Marbury's Effort Lets Suns Shine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephon Marbury got it done on both ends of the court.</LD>
<LD>   Marbury had 28 points and 10 assists and guarded Philadelphia's
Allen Iverson for most of the game, holding him to seven-of-24
shooting as the Phoenix Suns handed the 76ers their fourth straight
loss, 99-91, Friday night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "[Iverson] is a great scorer and sometimes it's difficult to
concentrate on both ends of the court," Marbury said. "But I take the
defensive end just as seriously as the offensive end. I always play
defense."</LD>
<TE>   Said Sun Coach Frank Johnson: "That was a great individual effort.
He had to play Iverson and still got 28 points and 10 assists."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Marion had 25 points and 15 rebounds and made a three-point
basket to put the Suns ahead, 95-87, with 2:43 left. After Iverson
made two free throws, Amare Stoudemire's dunk made it 97-89 with 1:45
left. A layup by Penny Hardaway sealed the win.</TE>
<TE>   "I am 99% of the problem right now," Iverson said of the four-game
slump. "I'm the leader of this team and as I go, we go. And right
now, I am stinking up the place. I don't think I should even be
getting paid."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 115, Cleveland 100 -- Antoine Walker had the 13th
triple-double of his career with a season-high 33 points at Boston
and the Celtics overcame Ricky Davis' second 40-point game of the
week. The loss extended the Cavaliers' road losing streak to 12
games. They lost their seventh straight to the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 101, Portland 79 -- Tim Thomas scored a season-high 25
points before spraining his left ankle and Sam Cassell had 19 as the
Bucks had a strong second half to win at Milwaukee. Portland pulled
to 48-47 early in the second half, only to have the Bucks score the
next 11 points en route to an 80-60 lead.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 79, Washington 65 -- Jason Kidd had 11 points, 10
assists and 10 rebounds at East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nets held
Michael Jordan and the Wizards to a franchise low point total. The
total was one less than the Wizards had last year in a loss to the
Chicago Bulls. The point total was also a Net record for fewest given
up. The old record was 67 against Washington last season.</TE>
<TE>   New York 97, Miami 92 -- Latrell Sprewell scored a season-high 30
points and the Knicks shot an astounding 92% in the second quarter at
Miami. Brian Grant's dunk pulled the Heat within one point with 1:15
left, but Charlie Ward put the Knicks back up by four with a
three-pointer and the Knicks held on for their first win in seven
games this season against Atlantic Division opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 111, Golden State 85 -- Tracy McGrady had 36 points and
Grant Hill returned from a one-game absence to score 16 points at
Orlando, Fla., as the Magic avenged its most lopsided loss in
franchise history. On Nov. 16, Orlando lost to Golden State, 135-92.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 114, Houston 109 -- Wesley Person made a three-pointer
with 35 seconds left in overtime and followed with two free throws at
Memphis, Tenn., as the Grizzlies won their fourth in a row, one short
of the franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 94, Denver 72 -- Ron Mercer scored 19 points and helped
lead the Pacers to a 28-point halftime lead at Indianapolis as
Indiana avenged last week's 92-81 loss at Denver</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 91, Toronto 79 -- Gary Payton scored 21 points at Toronto
as the SuperSonics won consecutive games for the first time since
Nov. 17.</TE>

<LD>Conspiracy theorists will love this: A private jet belonging to
Indianapolis Colt owner Jim Irsay was parked last weekend at Van Nuys
Airport. The plane -- complete with horseshoe logo on the tail --
wasn't tucked away in a hangar, but sitting out in the open for
anyone to see.</LD>
<LD>   I called the Colts to ask about this and talked to the vice
president of media relations and Irsay's secretary. They couldn't --
or wouldn't -- tell me why the plane was there, if Irsay had been in
Los Angeles, or even if he'd attended last Sunday's game against
Tennessee at Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a year, rumors have swirled that the Colts could be
headed here if Indianapolis doesn't pony up roughly $10 million a
year to bolster franchise revenues. So Irsay's Gulfstream at Van Nuys
undoubtedly will set off some alarms. But I don't believe it has
anything to do with bringing pro football back to L.A.</LD>
<TE>   I would, however, say to Irsay the same thing I'd say to a
400-pounder in thong: Tarp that tail section.</TE>
<TE>   Five thoughts on the L.A. situation:</TE>
<TE>   * The Colts are fading as an option. Other NFL owners don't want
Irsay here, and neither does the league. Remember, those owners have
to approve any relocation. Irsay has too much baggage, including, as
he admitted after an Indianapolis TV station broke the story, an
addiction to prescription drugs. He has lost leverage in his own city
-- he and Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson haven't had any meaningful
talks since the drug revelations -- and more credibility with the
league. The way I hear it, if Irsay wants to sell all or part of his
team, there are people in Indianapolis ready to write a check.</TE>
<TE>   * The downtown stadium isn't dead. Sure, Philip Anschutz is out of
the football business and the South Park stadium coalition is kaput.
But the notion of a downtown stadium that is for the most part
privately financed is too enticing to lay to rest. I can see Casey
Wasserman bringing it back to life.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't count out the Coliseum. Love it or hate it, you just can't
kill it. City and county politicians wouldn't stand in the way of
renovation -- provided there were ways to pay for it without using
tax dollars -- and the league would eventually warm to the idea. No
place could pull off the project quicker. That said, the Coliseum has
to overcome more than its share of problems.</TE>
<TE>   * The Rose Bowl is the flavor of the month. John Moag, who helped
the Cleveland Browns move to Baltimore, is trying to bring a team to
the Rose Bowl. He's getting a good response around Pasadena too, when
he talks about a $400-million renovation that won't cost taxpayers a
dime, won't upset historical preservationists, environmentalists,
people who live in the Arroyo Seco, or the Tournament of Roses
committee, well, what's not to like? It all sounds good now, but this
is the easy part. Wait until an actual plan is on the table.</TE>
<TE>   * The Chargers soon will trigger the escape clause in their lease.
The way the Chargers see it, they've given San Diego every
opportunity to explore a stadium solution and city officials are
dragging their feet. Charger President Dean Spanos was in New York on
Friday, meeting with league officials, and my guess is, they were
discussing the next step. Why wait until the Super Bowl to trigger?
The Chargers won't.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Parity Way</TE>
<TE>   With the league as balanced as it has ever been, the playoff
picture has yet to come into focus -- especially in the AFC. The
Raiders on Sunday could become the first AFC team to clinch a
postseason berth, provided they beat Miami and Denver ties Kansas
City, or Denver loses and San Diego ties or loses at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   In the NFC, the 49ers and Packers have won in their respective
divisions, and the four other playoff spots could be filled Sunday.
Philadelphia can clinch its second consecutive division title by
beating or tying Washington, or if the Giants lose or tie Dallas.
Three teams from the NFC South could be headed for the playoffs.
Here's what those teams need:</TE>
<TE>   * The Buccaneers get in if they beat or tie Detroit, or the Giants
lose or tie.</TE>
<TE>   * The Saints get in if they beat Minnesota -- and the Giants lose
or tie, or the Eagles win or tie. If the Saints tie, they need a
Giant loss.</TE>
<TE>   * The Falcons get in if they beat Seattle, and the Giants lose or
tie. If the Falcons tie, they also need a loss by the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Sliding, Sliding</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Maddox, who came out of nowhere for the Pittsburgh Steelers,
is slowly slipping back to nowhere. He has not won since Nov. 3 and
is 0-2-1 in his last three starts. He has thrown one touchdown pass
and five interceptions in his last two starts, and he had low passer
ratings in both those games, 44.9 at Tennessee and 55.1 against
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox, a former UCLA standout, hasn't been the same since he was
knocked out Nov. 17 in a game against Tennessee and was sidelined for
two weeks. In a stunning loss to Houston last Sunday, Maddox
contributed to three Texan touchdowns. Two of his passes were
intercepted and returned for scores, and he fumbled -- without being
hit -- and that too was run back.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Maddox will look to get back on track against Carolina,
led by former USC quarterback Rodney Peete. The Steelers aren't going
to keep Kordell Stewart under the terms of his current contract, and
they want Maddox to be their answer. That prompts a question:</TE>
<TE>   Will Maddox be the toast of the town, or just toast?</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC East -- The Buffalo Bills are on the brink of playoff
elimination, and players will be groping for motivation, once that
flame goes out. "I can imagine what an attorney must feel like when
all the evidence is stacked against his client," fullback Larry
Centers said. "Or what a surgeon is feeling when everyone else is
saying his patient doesn't have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   History will be made Sunday in Miami when the Raiders play the
Dolphins. The game features the only three receivers with 1,000
catches -- Oakland's Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, and Miami's Cris
Carter. "It's going to be a unique time," Carter said. "Of course, it
has never happened before and probably will never happen again.... I
have a tremendous amount of respect for both of those guys as
receivers and people. What Jerry is doing at the end of his career is
truly phenomenal. Tim has had a great career. I came out of school
early and came in the league one year earlier than [Brown]. Our
careers have mirrored each other for a long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   AFC North -- Cincinnati Coach Dick LeBeau is a nice guy, a
stand-up guy, but he probably won't be around much longer. Since
starting last season 4-3, his team has lost 19 of 22. LeBeau's .262
winning percentage is worse than David Shula's .268. The bigger
problem is Bengal President Mike Brown, who steadfastly refuses to
hire a capable personnel director. Since Brown took over for his
father Paul Brown after the 1991 season, the Bengals are 54-135.</TE>
<TE>   Butch Davis has coached the Browns in 29 games, seven of which
have turned on the final play. Sixteen of those 29 games were decided
in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens, in their loss to New Orleans last Sunday, had seven
dropped passes, three lost fumbles, two intercepted passes, two punts
blocked ... and a partridge in a pear tree.</TE>
<TE>   AFC South -- Houston rookie David Carr is approaching an NFL
record. for most times sacked. Carr has been sacked 68 times, five
shy of the league record set by Randall Cunningham in 1986. With
three games to play -- against Baltimore, Jacksonville and Tennessee
-- Carr and the record are destined to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis receiver Marvin Harrison, the only NFL player to have
four consecutive seasons with 100 or more receptions, has 118 in
2002, six away from breaking Herman Moore's single-season NFL record.
That's what makes it so surprising that Harrison dropped a sure
touchdown pass in a loss to Tennessee. "A fourth-grader could have
made that play," he said. The Colts have forced 31 fumbles, yet
recovered only 13.</TE>
<TE>   AFC West -- San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson will play Sunday
against a Buffalo defense that has yielded running backs six 100-yard
games this season. The Bills have surrendered an average of 138.7
yards a game, second only to Seattle at 168.2. But the NFL's worst
run defense of all time belonged to the 1978 Bills, who gave up a
staggering average of 201.8 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer had some fun with Buffalo
writers on a conference call this week, playfully telling them he
might use backup quarterback Doug Flutie as a wideout for a few
plays. "It depends on the circumstances," Schottenheimer said. "We've
been going through the last couple of games with only three wide
receivers, so we had to look to somebody, and he knows all the
routes. We'll have to wait and see. He wants to run go routes. But I
don't know if we'll let him do that." Joked Buffalo Coach Gregg
Williams: "Maybe he thinks he has a height advantage over [5-9
cornerback] Antoine Winfield."</TE>
<TE>   Denver tight end Shannon</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe on the Broncos, who have lost their last three games by a
total of 12 points: "We're a good football team, but we're not good
when we have to be. On third down, we need to be good, we're not.
Fourth quarter to put a team away, we're not. Overtime, we're not.
We're a good football team, we're just not good when we need to be."</TE>
<TE>   NFC East -- All the evidence Jerry Jones needs to make a coaching
change in Dallas: In seven of their eight losses, the Cowboys have
led or been tied in the fourth quarter. Five of those losses were
decided by the opposing team's final drive. Dallas has not made the
playoffs since 1999 and has not won a postseason game since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins are relying less and less on running back Stephen
Davis, who had a team-record 356 carries last season but is well off
that pace this season with 205. "I get frustrated, but as far as
anger and blowing up at people, that's not me," said Davis, who had
12 carries in a loss to the Giants last Sunday, his fewest in more
than three years. "[But] it's hard. I've been here seven years. Just
to see something like this could happen hurts me to my heart." Then
again, Davis' $11.4-million salary-cap figure for 2003 hurts the
Redskins to their wallet. And, in this case, the wallet will win.</TE>
<TE>   NFC North -- By his comments on a radio show this week, you might
think Detroit's Joey Harrington had taken one too many shots to the
head. But the rookie quarterback said he wouldn't mind getting</TE>
<TE>   "ear-holed" by Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp on Sunday. "I said it to
get a rise," Harrington told reporters with a laugh. "I saw one of
his interviews. He said, 'Brett Favre earned my respect because I
kept hitting him and he kept getting up.' ... I'm going to get hit.
I'm going to get up too.</TE>
<TE>   That's what I was getting at. Not necessarily a jaw shot. Maybe a
thigh or square in the chest, where I can glance the blow a little."
As we now know, Sapp will take that shot -- cheaply or not.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's Marty Booker leads the league in receptions of 20 yards
or longer with 20 of them. That's really surprising, considering the
team's nickel-and-dime passing philosophy. New Orleans receiver Joe
Horn has 18 such receptions, and tied with 17 are Isaac Bruce of St.
Louis and Amani Toomer of the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   NFC South -- New Orleans running back Deuce McAllister is quiet
and easygoing. But he wasn't so relaxed after hearing former Saint
Ricky Williams say on "Monday Night Football" that one of his goals
with Miami this season was to out-rush McAllister. "That was a
personal jab," McAllister said. "I haven't taken any jabs or shots at
him in the media. It's a step back for me. It's a battle between me
and he now. He's taking a jab at me on a national stage, 'Monday
Night Football.' It wasn't like he just called me up on the phone and
was kidding. It was personal. It was like he called me out."</TE>
<TE>   NFC West -- San Francisco receiver Terrell Owens didn't dance on
the Texas Stadium star last Sunday, even though he caught two
touchdown passes, one the game-winner with 12 seconds to play.
"Coming into the stadium, I saw all the Sharpie signs, and in the
huddle I looked up at the Jumbotron and saw all the little skits," he
said. "I thought it was really cute. I was laughing at it. I was
like, 'We're going to get the last laugh some kind of way.' And we
did. We got the win." Well, he didn't get the very last laugh. He
left the locker room wearing a Cowboy-blue leather suit that had to
elicit some chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   I think Jim Mora, the 49er defensive coordinator and son of the
longtime NFL coach of the same name, would excel as a college head
coach. Why? Not only does he know Xs and O's, but he would be an
outstanding recruiter. He's 41, but looks closer to 25, and he's
better than most coaches at connecting with young players.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle linebacker Chad Brown leads the Seahawks with six sacks,
but he hasn't played since Nov. 3. Defensive tackle Rocky Bernard is
second on the team with four sacks, yet he hasn't gotten one since
September. Seahawk defensive ends have combined for four sacks in 13
games. The opposing quarterback this week is, let's see ... Michael
Vick.</TE>
<TE>   Uh-oh.</TE>

<HD>Viking, Packer Players Fined for Scuffle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six players were fined a total of $40,000 Friday for their roles in
the sideline scuffle that marred the end of the Minnesota
Viking-Green Bay Packer game Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Antuan Edwards, Mike McKenzie and Nate Wayne of the Packers and
Hunter Goodwin, Jim Kleinsasser and Chris Walsh of the Vikings were
fined. All said they would appeal, except for Walsh and Wayne, who
refused comment.</LD>
<LD>   Packer defensive tackle Cletidus Hunt was not fined, despite
running across the field to join the fray before the final play was
over in Green Bay's 26-22 victory.</LD>
<TE>   The Vikings were miffed that Hunt escaped punishment altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a guy who comes off the field in the middle of the
play, runs past the field at our bench, and he doesn't get a lick?"
Kleinsasser said.</TE>
<TE>   There had been some concern in Green Bay earlier in the week that
Hunt might even be suspended. He can be seen on film hitting Goodwin
in the face with an open hand as the fight was breaking up.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the right call," Hunt said with a laugh Friday. "Now, I
can tease some of the guys."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was fined $5,000 for hitting Walsh after the Viking
receiver had caught the ball and taken a knee, declaring himself down
with one second left in the game to give his team a chance for one
long last pass.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings were infuriated with Edwards' hit and said that's what
sparked the fight.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie was fined $5,000 for striking an opponent "who was
obviously out of the play," and Wayne was fined $5,000 for hitting
Viking receiver Randy Moss in the back on the final play of the game,
a 66-yard interception return by Darren Sharper that fueled the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin and Kleinsasser both were fined $10,000 for leaving the
sideline and striking an opponent, and Walsh was fined $5,000 for
hitting Marques Anderson in the back during Sharper's return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Eagle defensive end Brandon Whiting sprained his
ankle in practice and is questionable for Sunday's game against the
Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   "He rolled it a bit and we got him up there and got ice on it
right away," Coach Andy Reid said. "We'll just see how it is. It
doesn't seem real severe, but we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Whiting, a five-year veteran, has started every game at defensive
end this season. If he is unable to play, Reid said N.D. Kalu would
start in his place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Seahawk quarterback Matt Hasselbeck is expected to start
against Atlanta on Sunday after spraining his left foot during last
weekend's loss to Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck took almost all the snaps with the first team at
practice Friday. His foot was in a boot Monday through Wednesday and
he returned to practice Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll play," Coach Mike Holmgren said. "I think he's
going to start, but we'll see how he feels [today]. "He's throwing
the ball well. If he can play and run around, he'll start."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff George, who has not played this season, would start if
Hasselbeck cannot play.</TE>

<HD>Rowdy Fans Booted Off Jet in Wales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rowdy fans of Scottish champion Glasgow Celtic on Friday forced a
chartered passenger jet to make an unscheduled landing in Cardiff,
Wales, where six of the troublemakers were arrested by police.</LD>
<LD>   The aircraft was en route to Scotland from Spain, where Celtic
clinched a place in the final 16 of the UEFA Cup at the expense of
Celta Vigo on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot radioed that "unruly passengers" among the 148 on board
were causing a disturbance and allegedly had assaulted a flight
attendant trying to calm them down.</LD>
<TE>   The plane landed safely and resumed its journey after the
hooligans had been removed.</TE>
<TE>   USA-Japan</TE>
<TE>   Once again, and for the third time in recent weeks, word of an
upcoming international match involving the United States comes not
from U.S. Soccer but from its opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Japan announced Friday that it will play the U.S. "somewhere on
the west coast of America" on March 29, one week before the start of
the Major League Soccer's eighth season.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Argentina said it will play the U.S. in Miami on Feb. 8
and Jamaica said it would host the American team in Kingston on Feb.
12. Neither of those games has yet been mentioned by U.S. Soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Spurs to Move?</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of Tottenham Hotspur warned Friday that the English
Premier League team might abandon the White Hart Lane home that it
has occupied in north London since 1898 unless the government
improves the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "This area has gone downhill," Daniel Levy said. "There's been no
central government intervention to stop the decline.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't set a time limit, but if we find another suitable
site, somewhere financially viable that the fans would be comfortable
with, that would be a catalyst upon which we'd have to turn around
and say we've had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Either there's going to be significant [government] commitment or
we're off."</TE>
<TE>   More Drug Tests</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Aigner, the chief executive of UEFA, European soccer's
ruling body, said Friday that random drug testing in the competitions
it oversees will be increased by 30% next season and will be extended
to include youth and female players.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we have tended to test the same teams as they
progress through a competition and so the testing is concentrated on
the high-profile matches," Aigner said.</TE>
<TE>   "From next season, we intend to spread the testing across the
board and include players in the earlier rounds of the competitions."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, only one player out of 548 tested positive, and so
far only one has done so this season.</TE>
<TE>   UEFA Cup Draw</TE>
<TE>   The draw for the fourth round and the quarterfinals of the UEFA
Cup was held in Nyon, Switzerland, on Friday, with fourth-round
matches scheduled for Feb. 20 and 27 and the quarterfinals for March
13 and 20.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterfinal pairings will be as follows:</TE>
<TE>   * Glasgow Celtic-VfB Stuttgart winner vs. Auxerre-Liverpool
winner.</TE>
<TE>   * Malaga-AEK Athens winner vs. Hertha Berlin-Boavista winner.</TE>
<TE>   * FC Porto-Denizlispor winner vs. Anderlecht-Panathinaikos winner.</TE>
<TE>   * Slavia Prague-Besiktas winner vs. Lazio-Wisla Krakow winner.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Pass</TE>
<TE>   The Argentine club San Lorenzo won the inaugural Copa
Sudamericana, 4-0 on aggregate, after defeating Atletico Nacional of
Colombia by that margin in Colombia and then playing to a 0-0 tie in
front of 50,000 in Buenos Aires.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Holton Returns With Portland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Holland's return to Pauley Pavilion was made memorable when his
San Diego Toreros upset UCLA on Nov. 26. Tonight, Portland Coach
Michael Holton will try to become the next former Bruin to bring in
an underdog and tweak tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Holton was a freshman guard in 1980 when UCLA reached the NCAA
title game, then after completing his NBA career, returned to his
alma mater as an assistant coach under Jim Harrick.</LD>
<LD>   When Harrick was dismissed in 1996, Holton found himself working
under Steve Lavin, a relationship that lasted five years, despite the
growing pains of both coaches.</LD>
<TE>   Holton took over at Portland last season and went 6-24. The Pilots
are 3-2 and much improved this season. But are they ready for the
Bruins?</TE>
<TE>   "I know we are in for a steep challenge," Holton said. "For me,
personally, coming back is a proud moment. I expressed interest in
scheduling this game and am comforted that they accepted. It's a big
game for us."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin, who speaks with Holton frequently, is braced for a battle
because Holton knows the UCLA players so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of respect for him," Lavin said. "He thinks he knows
all of us and he'll have some tricks up his sleeve."</TE>
<TE>   Holton's knowledge of Bruins he coached, particularly Ray Young,
Jason Kapono and T.J. Cummings, might be only moderately helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "I know their strengths and weaknesses, but it might not matter,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming a head coach, Holton has a greater appreciation for
what Lavin went through after replacing Harrick.</TE>
<TE>   "My first year at Portland, I learned a lot about what I don't
know," Holton said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lavin: "We went through a difficult transition when Harrick
was dismissed.... I'm proud of the work Michael did and proud of the
fact he is a head coach and doing well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin sophomore Andre Patterson was ruled academically eligible
and readmitted to UCLA on Friday. The 6-foot-7 forward will suit up
today.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson spent the fall semester at Santa Monica College. He will
begin winter quarter classes at UCLA on Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 2.3 points and 2.1 rebounds in nine minutes a game as
a freshman. He is expected to become one of UCLA's top post players
once he gets into game condition.</TE>
<TE>   "His talents and work ethic will immediately help our team," Lavin
said.</TE>

<LD>No. 4 Tennessee (6-1) vs. USC (4-3), Forum, 1:30, Fox Sports Net,
KMPC (1540) -- The Trojans and Lady Vols have played 14 times, each
having won seven, but have not met since 1989. Tennessee has been off
since beating Louisiana Tech on Dec. 4. USC wants to get past last
week's 68-44 debacle against Connecticut, when the Trojans shot a
school-record low 18%. "We hope we're not the cure for them [today],"
Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt said. "When you go on the road, you
better bring your rebounding and defense. My concern is we've been
sporadic in those areas."</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (4-2) at Pepperdine (3-3), Firestone Fieldhouse, 5 p.m., KBET
(850) -- The Waves let a potential upset of USC slip away early this
month, but feel better about themselves after a 67-64 road victory
over Oklahoma State last weekend. The guard combo of Shandrika Lee
(16.5 points) and Damaris Hinojosa (11.0) is carrying the Pepperdine
offense. UCLA's four-game winning streak ended last weekend in
Georgia. The Bruins continue to get promising production out of the
freshman trio of Nikki Blue (14 points), Julia Pitts (11.8) and Lisa
Willis (9.3).</LD>

<LD>The Hail Mary pass is the most dramatic play in football.</LD>
<LD>   It fails most of the time but when it works, as it did Sunday when
Tim Couch completed a 50-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Morgan with no
time remaining in the Cleveland Browns' 21-20 victory over the
Jacksonville Jaguars, you can count on extreme reactions from both
teams.</LD>
<LD>   Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin: "The despair and the gloom that
set in when you have something in your hand and it's taken away from
you and you lose it, that's hard.... Never in my wildest dreams did I
expect that was ever going to happen. I thought we were in total
control of the game. There was no logical explanation for it. My
emotions ran the gamut from total despair to total frustration."</LD>
<TE>   Cleveland Coach Butch Davis: "Yeah, another day at the office. I
don't really know what to tell you, other than when you've coached 30
years, you think you've seen everything. Obviously, you haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville cornerback Fernando Bryant: "The call came in and it
came down to me making the play or not making the play, and I didn't
make it."</TE>
<TE>   Couch: "I was just giving everyone a 'jet' call. Everybody goes
deep and you see what happens. It just worked out for us. It's
unbelievable when you think about how something like this can
basically determine how your season will turn out."</TE>
<TE>   The "Hail Mary pass" became part of football's lexicon in 1975
when, after completing a desperation last-second touchdown pass to
Drew Pearson to give Dallas a 17-14 playoff victory over favored
Minnesota, Cowboy quarterback Roger Staubach, applying a Catholic
touch, described his throw that way, instead of saying, "I threw a
prayer."</TE>
<TE>   It has been part of football ever since. From Doug Flutie's
dramatic touchdown pass to Gerard Phelan in Boston College's victory
over Miami in 1984 to Marcus Randall's last-second 75-yard touchdown
pass to Devery Henderson in Louisiana State's wild win over Kentucky
this season, the Hail Mary pass has been responsible for scores of
victories over the years.</TE>
<TE>   When a Hail Mary pass works: It's usually because someone on
defense makes a mental mistake. That's what happened to the Jaguars
last week.</TE>
<TE>   With the ball at midfield and Cleveland down to its last play,
Jacksonville knew Couch had to throw into the end zone. Still, the
Jaguars did not go into a complete Hail Mary prevent defense.
Instead, Jacksonville used regular two-deep prevent coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The differences between the coverages vary from team to team but
the basics are the same. In a Hail Mary prevent, at least three
defenders are lined up across the field near the end zone. In a
regular prevent coverage, the defensive backs are staggered, with two
or three defenders playing zone at least 25 yards off the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Browns, Jacksonville free safety Marlon McCree was
responsible deep for the left side of the field and Bryant was
assigned to cover Morgan underneath. Bryant allowed Morgan to get
behind him running down the right sideline because he thought McCree
would be there to help.</TE>
<TE>   But McCree wasn't there because, looking at Couch, he'd been faked
into the middle of the field. By the time he recovered, it was too
late. That left Bryant to contest Morgan for a jump ball, and the
result was a touchdown for the Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a one-on-one matchup on a Hail Mary pass is a dream
opportunity for an offense. Any quarterback with a decent throwing
arm and a receiver with a sense of timing can almost always make the
play work with only one defender to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   When a Hail Mary play fails: It's because a defense doesn't panic
and is in the right coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns used a "bunch" formation, common on Hail Mary passes.
It features a group of receivers on one side of the ball, a lone
receiver on the other side. This formation confused the Jacksonville
secondary, which ended up with too many defenders concentrating on
the Browns' bunch receivers on one side of the field.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars would have done better to string their defenders in
the end zone, in position to knock the ball down. Too often,
defensive backs try to intercept Hail Mary passes when an
incompletion is all that's necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball is always kept in front of you and you knock the ball
down," Coughlin said. "That's what you do. That wasn't the case here.
Fernando actually had four or five yards on [Morgan] and as the ball
was thrown and they both began to look up for it, they got entangled
a little bit. That's where I think Marlon could have been over the
top and could have been involved in knocking the ball down. It didn't
happen."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Priest Blamed for Legacy of Pain</HD>
<DH>Ten, including relatives, say the Jesuit molested them. He
denies it and has not been charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenn F. Bunting</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During 16 years at Loyola High School, Father Jerold Lindner was
admired as an energetic teacher exceptionally devoted to his
students. Superiors lauded him as the model of "a Christian
educator." A colleague in the English department nominated him as
"chairman for life."</LD>
<LD>   Others outside the school say they knew a different Lindner. Ten
men and women portray the Jesuit as a molester who haunted their
childhoods, abusing them on Sundays after Mass, during holiday
gatherings and on Catholic family camping trips -- nearly always
while wearing his clerical collar.</LD>
<LD>   These encounters allegedly began in the 1950s, continued through
the 1970s, when Lindner was entering the priesthood, and persisted
into the 1980s, while he was teaching at Loyola High, a private,
all-boys prep school west of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Jesuit leaders say they first learned about Lindner's past a
decade ago, when his brother told them that the priest had sexually
abused three nieces, a nephew and a younger sibling. After sending
Lindner for a psychiatric evaluation, Jesuit superiors deemed the
allegations not credible and put him back in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh charges surfaced in 1997, when two brothers asserted in a
lawsuit that Lindner sodomized them years earlier during weekend
retreats in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Jesuits then removed the
priest from Loyola and negotiated a secret $625,000 settlement with
the brothers. As before, Lindner's superiors did not inform law
enforcement authorities, parents or teachers about the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn deposition, Lindner denied ever abusing anyone. In a
statement to The Times, he said: "I have devoted my life to helping
people, and I insist that the accusations against me are not true."
He said the Catholic sex-abuse crisis has "created an atmosphere
where people like me are presumed guilty until proven innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Lindner, 58, has never been criminally charged, and Loyola
officials say they know of no allegations that he molested students
or other members of the high school community. He is under
investigation by L.A. County sheriff's detectives and the district
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The priest's accusers depict a man who began molesting when he was
a child and continued to do so even as he soldiered through the
rigorous Jesuit rituals of indoctrination. Family members and victims
kept quiet and sometimes defended the priest, a Times investigation
found.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner's superiors, when confronted with explosive accusations,
tried to keep them "internal to the Society of Jesus," as one Loyola
administrator put it in a memo.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews and legal documents, the 10 men and women have said
they were molested while growing up in Los Angeles County, the San
Francisco Bay Area and suburban Phoenix. Eight agreed to be
identified by name in this article.</TE>
<TE>   Several said Lindner ordered them to lie still while he sexually
abused them. Afterward, they said, he called them "dirty" and
threatened to harm them if they told anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Four of Lindner's accusers said they were so traumatized that they
tried to commit suicide as teenagers. Others reported suffering
failed marriages, depression, flashbacks and a loss of faith.</TE>
<TE>   Many said they had remained silent until now because of a deep
sense of shame and because they feared retaliation by Lindner. The
alleged victims said they are angry -- at the priest and at the
Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want him behind bars, where he belongs," said Tamara
Roehm, 35, of Lancaster, one of Lindner's nieces.</TE>
<TE>   The priest's mother, 80, said recently that the accounts
of victims within her own family had persuaded her that Lindner preyed
on young people.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that Jerry needs help, and so do his victims," Isabelle
Lindner said in an interview at her Phoenix-area home. "If he wasn't
a priest and didn't have the Jesuits standing behind him, I think he
would be in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Lindner now lives in the Bay Area town of Los Gatos at the Sacred
Heart Jesuit Center, a picturesque retreat overlooking the Santa
Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits say they have barred him from teaching or ministering
to the public, but he is free to travel and tutor seminarians and has
collected a living allowance from the order.</TE>
<TE>   In preparing this report, The Times reviewed internal Jesuit
records, numerous letters Lindner wrote over two decades, and
documents related to the lawsuit by the two brothers, including a
sworn deposition of Lindner on June 10, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola High administrators last month informed parents and alumni
of the allegations against Lindner for the first time. They took the
step after learning The Times was preparing an article on the priest.</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 18 letter to parents and alumni, Father Robert T. Walsh,
Loyola's president, said administrators learned of sexual-abuse
accusations against Lindner in 1997 and "immediately relieved him of
his teaching and school duties." The letter made no mention of the
1992 allegations. Walsh and other Loyola officials declined to answer
questions about Lindner.</TE>
<TE>   A top-ranking Jesuit said no one at the high school noticed any
inappropriate behavior by the priest.</TE>
<TE>   "We never had complaints at Loyola High," said Father Thomas H.
Smolich, who as head of the California Province oversees Jesuits in
four Western states and Hawaii. "If you look at Jerry's professional
career there, it is very successful."</TE>
<TE>   Smolich, who began his six-year term as provincial in 1999,
acknowledged that the Jesuits did not notify authorities of the
accusations against Lindner in 1992 or in 1997. He said that he could
provide no explanation and that Jesuit records shed no light on the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things I wish we had done differently," Smolich said.
"If the allegations were reported today, we would contact appropriate
law enforcement authorities and respond pastorally to victims."</TE>
<TE>   Early Aspiration</TE>
<TE>   Jerold William Lindner was born Nov. 16, 1944, in Columbus, Ohio,
into a devout Catholic family. Priests and nuns were frequent
visitors to the home.</TE>
<TE>   Before entering elementary school, Jerold announced that he wanted
to be a priest, his mother recalled. She said his interest in the
clergy never waned.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Arizona when Jerold was 6. He served as an
altar boy, joined the Boy Scouts and became an avid chess player. A
gifted student, he ranked in the top four of his 115-student class
during several semesters at Brophy College Preparatory, the all-boys
Jesuit high school in Phoenix. Years later, he scored in the "very
superior" range on an IQ test.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Lindner's family said fellow students picked on him. As
a freshman, he was forced to kneel on the hot asphalt at school for
hours and suffered severe burns. He often came home with stains on
his white school shirts, the result of classmates pelting him with
oranges.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Brophy in June 1962, Lindner applied to
become a Jesuit. The Society of Jesus was founded in 1540 by St.
Ignatius Loyola and is the largest religious order in the Roman
Catholic Church, with about 21,000 members worldwide. Candidates
undergo years of rigorous training, and members of the society must
observe strict vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner's application was rejected by the order, according to
members of his family. They said the Jesuits told him he needed to
broaden his life. So he took a job as a courier for a title company,
became leader of a Boy Scout troop in Phoenix and dated for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   He reapplied to the Jesuits a year later and was turned down
again, this time with the suggestion that he move out of his parents'
home, family members said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner enrolled at Loyola University in Los Angeles, a Jesuit
institution, in the fall of 1963. He was accepted for Jesuit training
the following June and sent to the Sacred Heart Novitiate in Los
Gatos for two years to study the order's traditions, rules and
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Jesuit leaders detected psychological problems.</TE>
<TE>   After Lindner returned to Loyola University in 1968 to earn his
bachelor's degree in English, a routine evaluation found that he
"needs emotional and psychological maturing and stabilizing."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, he sought therapy for "depression and poor
self-image" on the advice of his Jesuit spiritual advisor and
suffered "bouts of panic attacks," say personnel records and
psychiatric reports.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner's aberrant behavior dated to childhood, his mother said.
She said she caught her son, at age 10, inappropriately touching his
5-year-old sister in bed. Over the years, she has defended her son
and rejected allegations from relatives that he abused them. She now
says she has come to believe the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   The sister, Kathy McEntire, also once defended her brother, but
now says he sexually abused her for years.</TE>
<TE>   "It started with me," said McEntire, 53, struggling to fight back
tears at her kitchen table in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   She alleged that Lindner knelt beside her bed at night and
molested her, a practice she said continued until she was about 9.
"He got bolder and bolder over time, as he figured out what he could
get away with," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Assigned to Teach</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, the Jesuits sent Lindner to earn a master's degree in
English at St. Louis University in Missouri, where he was active in
an urban Boy Scout troop. The next year, he was assigned to teach at
St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed in the Bay Area more than a decade, enrolling at the
Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley in 1973 and being ordained as a
priest in 1976. He returned to St. Ignatius and taught English there
from 1976 to 1982. He was also Scoutmaster for an Oakland troop and
accompanied boys on weekend camping and ski trips.</TE>
<TE>   During these years, Lindner allegedly molested six children,
according to sworn testimony and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was McEntire's son, Trevor. He said Lindner molested
him on about 20 occasions, beginning when he was 5, during family
visits to the Jesuit residence in Berkeley and when the priest made
holiday trips to Arizona. He said the abuse lasted until he was 9.</TE>
<TE>   "He touched me a lot," Trevor McEntire, now 32, said of his uncle.
"I tolerated it, because I didn't know any better. I kind of blame
myself for not telling anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy McEntire said her son told her only recently about the
abuse. She said it was devastating to learn that the same man she
accuses of molesting her more than 40 years ago had allegedly
violated her son. "I'm just coming to grips with this," she said. "I
am so sick and disgusted I can't stand it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner met other alleged victims while volunteering as a
spiritual advisor for the Christian Family Movement, a worldwide lay
organization of Catholic couples. Lindner said Mass in private homes,
heard confessions, attended monthly parent meetings and accompanied
families on weekend retreats.</TE>
<TE>   The two brothers who sued the Jesuits said Lindner sexually
assaulted them during Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend camp-outs in
the Santa Cruz Mountains in 1975, when they were 5 and 7.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged assaults are detailed in reports by Lynn E. Ponton, a
professor of psychiatry at UC San Francisco and expert in sexual
abuse who was retained by the brothers' lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Ponton said the brothers told her that Lindner sodomized them and
forced them to perform oral sex on four occasions in the woods. In
one incident, the priest allegedly abused the two boys in a tent.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Will Lynch of San Francisco, now 35, said in an
interview that Lindner coerced him to enter the tent by threatening
to harm his younger brother. "Even at age 7, I knew it was wrong. I
didn't want to be there," Lynch said. "When he grabbed me, I remember
thinking, 'I'm not getting out of this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's brother declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   In the deposition, Lindner confirmed attending weekend camp-outs
but said he had no recollection of meeting the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Will Lynch said the abuse had shattering effects. He had
nightmares for years, suffered from depression and alcohol abuse, and
twice attempted suicide, he said. "Many times I thought of driving
down to L.A. and confronting Father Jerry," he said. "I wanted to
exorcise all of the rage and anger and bitterness he put into me....
You can't put into words what this guy did to me. He stole my
innocence and destroyed my life."</TE>
<TE>   Sworn Depositions</TE>
<TE>   Two women who accuse Lindner of molesting them when they were
girls in the Bay Area also said they have had difficulty recovering.
Both described the alleged molestations in sworn depositions as part
of the Lynches' suit and in interviews with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Krista Nemechek, a 32-year-old special education teacher in the
Bay Area, said she was 7 when Lindner grabbed her in a bedroom of an
Oakland home during a 1977 social gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "I was wearing a dress," Nemechek said. "He put me in this almost
vise-grip of a hug. He pulled me so I was facing him, then he rubbed
his hands up and down me. I remember him kissing me really
passionately [and] moaning a little bit.... It just didn't feel right
in any way."</TE>
<TE>   In his deposition, Lindner said he had no recollection of Nemechek
or the alleged incident.</TE>
<TE>   Nemechek said the episode haunted her through adolescence. "I know
he hurt a lot of people," she said. "More than anything that happened
to me, the hardest part is realizing that I could have done
something."</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Lukas, 36, recalled meeting Lindner when he said Mass at
her parents' house in Oakland. Then 8, she "lit up" at the attention
the priest showered on her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 10, Lukas said, Lindner began making suggestive
remarks and forcing deep, full-mouth kisses on her. One evening after
dinner, she said, Lindner caught her alone in the basement of her
home. She recalled hearing her mother's footsteps on the kitchen
floor above while the priest sexually assaulted her.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushed me down on the bed. I was struggling to get away from
him.... He was a big guy," Lukas said. "I remember him covering my
mouth. I could hardly breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Lukas' allegation, Lindner said in his deposition: "I
don't remember doing this. I don't think I did it."</TE>
<TE>   Lukas said she was despondent for years and still feels
uncomfortable in her parents' house. "I've had this torture all my
life," said Lukas, who runs an herbal-products business in Oregon. "I
don't trust authority. I don't believe in God anymore.... It has
shaped the foundation of who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Another of Lindner's nephews says the priest molested him over
several nights at a family reunion in Arizona during the 1979
Christmas season. The boy was 11 years old at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was French-kissing me," said the nephew, who spoke on
condition that he not be named. "He was holding me tight, and he
fondled me. It happened every night."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, after eight years at St. Ignatius High, Lindner
transferred to Loyola High and was named chairman of the English
department.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1865, Loyola is L.A.'s oldest Catholic school,
occupying ivy-covered buildings on Venice Boulevard near Koreatown.
Among the most competitive prep schools in the area, it has 1,096
students and 84 faculty and staff members.</TE>
<TE>   At Loyola, Lindner expressed a preference for working with younger
students. An evaluation stated: "Fr. Lindner was quite honest about
his wish to teach frosh rather than seniors."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, he wrote an acquaintance: "I am tutoring frosh -- I don't
teach them, but I know about 110 of them now. I have a 'hit' list
with their names and photos (a way to get to know their names). They
are fun."</TE>
<TE>   Lindner organized numerous after-school activities that gradually
became known as "Lindner clubs." They included archery, backgammon,
chess, Knights of FRP (a fantasy role-playing group) and
remote-control car racing.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola administrators praised his devotion to students. "I want to
point out particularly that many of the students in your clubs would
have no other avenue into the mainstream of the Loyola community were
it not for your energy, ingenuity and organization," Father Gordon
Bennett, then the principal, wrote in October 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner served as an assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 1193 at St.
Thomas the Apostle Church, near the Loyola campus.</TE>
<TE>   And he reached out to a boy and girl he had met years earlier
through the Christian Family Movement.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Debbie Lukas. Lindner sent the teenager romantic
letters, calling her "my California beauty" and "the flame tree of my
life" and mentioning that the residence hall at Loyola had "a place
to put people up ... (even you)."</TE>
<TE>   Lindner also contacted Lukas' mother, Mary Louise Taylor, and
suggested that her 12-year-old son spend a weekend with him on the
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so shocked," said Taylor, adding that she declined.</TE>
<TE>   In his deposition, Lindner described the invitation as "a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting His Brother</TE>
<TE>   Lindner's move to Loyola made it easier to visit his
older brother, Larry, then an LAPD patrol officer who lived in Lancaster
with his family. During these visits, Father Lindner allegedly
molested three nieces.</TE>
<TE>   "He would hold your face, stare at you and then stick his tongue
in your mouth," said one niece, Susan Edens, now 32, who still lives
in Lancaster. "I used to hate him coming over to our house, because I
hated that kiss. It was horrid."</TE>
<TE>   Her sister, Tamara Roehm, said Jerold Lindner did the same thing
to her many times.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Lindner's youngest daughter, Tiffany Swindler, said the
priest sodomized her on three occasions when she was between 5 and 7.</TE>
<TE>   "He was meaner the second time," said Swindler, now 27. "He yelled
a lot. He grabbed my hair harder than normal." Afterward, she said,
Father Lindner called her "dirty" and told her: "Bad things happen to
little girls who open their mouths."</TE>
<TE>   Swindler and her father said that the priest molested the girl for
the final time around Easter 1984. In separate interviews, they said
Larry Lindner walked into the living room to find the priest playing
with Tiffany while sexually aroused.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw him out of my house," Larry Lindner said. He urged his
brother to seek treatment but did not report him to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I trusted him," Larry Lindner said. "I told him, 'I'm not going
to ruin your life or ruin your career. Just go get help.' ... I
should have had him arrested right there. But he's still my brother,
and I did what I thought a brother should do."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Lindner said that until recently he was not aware of
Swindler's allegations that the priest had sodomized her.</TE>
<TE>   Swindler said the abuse ceased when she was 8 but never stopped
haunting her. She said she became sexually active at 11 and endured
three broken marriages. Recently, she began undergoing therapy for
depression.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate him," Swindler said of her uncle. "I hate the way he
ruined my life."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Lindner retired from the LAPD in 1986, and the family
moved to Oregon. In January 1992, his wife found Tiffany crying on the
floor of their home after suffering flashbacks about the priest.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Lindner said his daughter's anguish made him so angry that
he called Jesuit superiors to report his brother's history of alleged
sexual misconduct. Loyola's then-principal, Father Eugene Growney,
posted a memo on Feb. 3, 1992, informing the high school faculty and
staff that Jerold Lindner had been placed on leave "for reasons
internal to the Society of Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatric Center</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits sent Lindner to St. Luke Institute in Maryland, a
psychiatric center where Catholic clergymen accused of sexual abuse
are evaluated and treated. Before going, Lindner solicited letters of
support from family members. His mother and two sisters submitted
five letters on his behalf to Jesuit superiors.</TE>
<TE>   Isabelle Linder wrote that Larry Lindner could not be believed.
"Father, they are all lies!" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy McEntire also supported Father Lindner. "I have
been informed that one of the lies being made against my brother is that
he also molested me when I was in fourth or fifth grade," she wrote.
"I can assure you that in no way is this true."</TE>
<TE>   Both women said in separate interviews that they knowingly
provided false information in the letters. The mother said she was
trying to help her son. McEntire said she wrote her letters under
duress. "Mom said if all of us did not come forward ... his career
would be destroyed and he would get kicked out of the church," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A confidential St. Luke report that cleared the way for Lindner to
return to teaching made several references to the family letters. The
report said an examination of Lindner, who told the St. Luke staff
that he had never abused anyone, found no sexual disorders or
"significant risk factors."</TE>
<TE>   "We see no reason why Father Lindner should not return to his
usual activities," the report said. The psychiatrists at St. Luke
closed with a recommendation that Lindner go on a low-fat diet.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sipe -- a former Benedictine monk and expert on sexuality
in the clergy who has served as a St. Luke board member -- reviewed
the eight-page report at The Times' request. He described it as
"deficient and biased," and said: "They did not provide any kind of
sexual history. They did not do any investigation. They simply took
his word."</TE>
<TE>   The president of St. Luke, Father Stephen J. Rossetti, said
he could not comment on Lindner's case but that in general it is
difficult to determine through psychological evaluation if someone is
a molester. "We are doing a clinical evaluation based on the
information we have, and it's not easy work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner returned to Loyola High in fall 1992. He said in his
deposition that Jesuit superiors and Loyola administrators never
discussed his brother's accusations with him. He resumed his teaching
duties and continued to receive plaudits.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot begin to thank you enough for your phenomenal generosity
and commitment," Father Walsh wrote on Nov. 8, 1992, weeks after
Lindner's return.</TE>
<TE>   Students dedicated the 1993 yearbook to Lindner, lauding him as
"one of the most active and popular teachers at Loyola."</TE>
<TE>   From 1992 through 1995, he escorted Loyola students on three
summer trips to Europe. In late 1996, he boasted in letters to
friends that 33 Loyola students had signed up for the 1997 European
tour, making it the largest ever.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner later wrote to say that "an unspecified illness" forced
him to miss the 1997 trip because foreign travel was "not medically
recommended." In fact, he was barred from the trip because new
allegations of sexual abuse had surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   The Lynch brothers, breaking their silence after two decades,
filed their suit against the Society of Jesus in April 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyer, Michael D. Meadows, said he had to pressure the
Jesuits to remove Lindner from the classroom. "There was still the
same reflexive response of circle the wagons, protect the priest and
the institution, and ignore the interests of the kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner was relieved of his teaching duties in late May 1997 and
sent back to St. Luke that September. He spent nearly nine months
there, receiving medical and psychological treatment for depression
and low self-esteem brought on by "the trauma of these allegations,"
a Jesuit superior said in a deposition.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1998, Lindner returned to the Jesuit residence at Loyola on
condition that he no longer teach.</TE>
<TE>   In the deposition, he said he agreed to the restriction to spare
the school a controversy. "It could possibly put the school in a bad
light with publicity if this went public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner continued to serve with the Boy Scouts at St. Thomas the
Apostle Church, near Loyola, records show. Father Dennis P. O'Neil,
then pastor of the church, said he was never told about Lindner's
past. "I never heard a thing," said O'Neil, now auxiliary bishop in
the Diocese of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1998, the Society of Jesus reached a confidential
settlement with the Lynch brothers. Documents show that the Jesuits
paid $625,000. Among the conditions was a prohibition against
publicizing the allegations. "There was no admission to anything, no
attempt to apologize," Will Lynch said. "The Jesuits' attitude was,
'Let's settle this out.' The only issue was how much."</TE>
<TE>   At Christmas 1999, Lindner visited his family in Arizona. His
younger sister, McEntire, said she confronted him about the pain he
had inflicted on his victims, herself included.</TE>
<TE>   According to McEntire, Lindner acknowledged that he "may have
crossed the line" in his conduct with one niece and with one nephew.
He expressed no regret and offered no apologies, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom to Travel</TE>
<TE>   Since he stopped teaching at Loyola, Lindner has enjoyed the
freedom to travel and work as a language tutor with few restrictions.
He earned a master's degree in linguistics at San Jose State and
spent several months in Paris immersing himself in French culture. He
moved to the Jesuit residence in Culver City last year, teaching
English to seminarians from developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2001, Lindner began teaching English as a second
language at Cal State Dominguez Hills. The director of the program,
Tony Costanzo, said the Jesuits never informed him of Lindner's
background. "Had I known that, I definitely would not have hired
him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner was transferred to Sacred Heart in Los Gatos this August.
At least five registered sex offenders have resided at the Jesuit
center in recent years, including a priest and brother who were
recently convicted of sexually abusing two mentally retarded men. In
September, the Jesuits agreed to a settlement that will pay the two
victims $7.5 million each.</TE>
<TE>   The center is within walking distance of downtown Los Gatos, an
upscale village in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Last
month, anonymously posted fliers bearing a photo of Lindner appeared
in the shopping district. "Warning," they said. "Pedophile in our
community.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner is living under a set of written restrictions laid down by
the order, said Smolich, the Jesuit provincial superior. He said
Lindner is barred from teaching or ministering to children and cannot
say Mass or hear confession in church.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has changed in the last nine months," Smolich said.
"For Jerry's sake and the public's sake, we can't be too careful."</TE>

<HD>FBI Continues Search in Anthrax Inquiry</HD>
<DH>About 100 agents are looking for evidence in Maryland woods
near the former home of ex-Army researcher Dr. Steven Hatfill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FREDERICK, Md.</DL>
<LD>Dozens of FBI agents and pond divers continued to comb a western
Maryland forest Friday for evidence related to last year's anthrax
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   About 100 federal agents searched woods and ponds here Friday for
what the FBI told local officials were "evidentiary items related to
the anthrax investigation."</LD>
<LD>   The search, which began Thursday, was to continue through next
week, according to Mayor Jennifer Dougherty. "They're going to do a
complete search of what is in the ponds," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI search area is in the Frederick Municipal Forest, a
7,000-acre tract wedged between Gambrill and Cunningham Falls state
parks about eight miles north of the city in the Catoctin Mountains.
The forest contains a reservoir that is one of several municipal
drinking water sources.</TE>
<TE>   The search site, a clearing called Sand Flats, includes at least
two of about a dozen spring-fed ponds, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   The Catoctins, part of the Blue Ridge chain, are about an hour's
drive from Washington. Popular with hikers and mountain bikers, the
public woodlands include two state parks and Catoctin Mountain Park,
the national preserve that surrounds the Camp David presidential
retreat.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI said they weren't looking for anthrax spores, according to
city spokeswoman Nancy Poss. She said scientists on the investigative
team were monitoring water in the area for possible contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The site is about eight miles from the former home of Dr. Steven
Hatfill, an ex-Army biological weapons researcher the government has
labeled a "person of interest" in the anthrax investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill has denied involvement in the October 2001 attacks, in
which five people died and 18 others were infected by letters
containing anthrax spores. His former apartment has been searched
three times.</TE>

<HD>A Steady Ascent, an Abrupt Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>He was friendly and approachable, looked like a Boston Irishman, and
had the local ties that come with a Harvard degree.</LD>
<LD>   When Bernard Law became archbishop of Boston in 1984, he was
immediately a favorite of local Roman Catholics. For his part, Law
proclaimed: "After Boston, there's only heaven."</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 19 years later, Law has stepped down in disgrace, abandoned
by priests under his charge and vilified by the public that once
hailed him.</LD>
<TE>   His resignation Friday completes the wrenching fall of a man who
ascended from small-town parishes to one of the most influential
posts in all of U.S. Catholicism. Instead of being known for his
extensive work with the poor or extensive influence with the church,
Law may be saddled with a different legacy: his apparent failure to
protect the archdiocese's children from rogue priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very saddening, not only for what he did to himself, but
what it did to the church in Boston," said Philip Lawler, former
editor of the Boston Archdiocese's official newspaper, the Pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Law was born in Torreon, Mexico, the only child of an Air Force
colonel. He was educated in North America, South America and the
Virgin Islands before graduating from Harvard in 1953 with a degree
in medieval history.</TE>
<TE>   He was ordained a priest in 1961, and became so involved in civil
rights work in Mississippi that his name appeared on a hit list
compiled by segregationists.</TE>
<TE>   His rise to national prominence began in 1968, when he took a job
at the ecumenical office of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
The position allowed him to establish numerous influential contacts
with bishops and diocesan leaders around the country.</TE>
<TE>   He became bishop in the Springfield-Cape Girardeau diocese in
Missouri in 1973, then became archbishop of Boston in 1984 and was
elevated to cardinal in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Law's concern for immigrants and minorities made him enormously
popular in those communities from the start, and he received support
from them even in the scandal's worst days.</TE>
<TE>   But Father Bernard McLaughlin, a frequent critic of Law, said the
cardinal never connected with the common person. McLaughlin blamed
Law's ambition for blinding him to the devastating problems in his
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "His gaze was on someplace else, the horizon," McLaughlin said.
"There was not that connection with the people, and in the end, that
hurt him."</TE>
<TE>   Law has been active in the pope's Congregation of Bishops, which
chooses bishops. He was the foreign policy architect at the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and made headlines with a 1998 trip
to Cuba to prop up the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Where Law will go now that his resignation has been accepted is
unclear. He remains a cardinal, which means he retains the right to
vote in a papal election and could move into another post.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Intensive, round-the-clock negotiations began Friday between the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and union negotiators in an
effort to avert a subway and bus strike that would leave millions of
riders scrambling to get to work.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, a state Supreme Court justice issued a preliminary
injunction Friday against a walkout under New York's Taylor Law,
which forbids strikes by public employees.</LD>
<LD>   In his decision, Justice Jules Spodek said a transit strike would
be "enormous, debilitating and destructive."</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, which clears the way for possible contempt citations
and jail time for union leaders, was designed to pressure the 34,000
members of the Transport Workers Union to agree to a new contract
before 12:01 a.m. Monday when the old pact expires.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg applauded the judge's decision. The
mayor, who pledged he would pedal from his Upper East Side Manhattan

<TE>   "Nobody's going to shut down New York," he vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said they were far apart on wages, payments to pension
funds and disciplinary policies.</TE>
<TE>   A central question is whether the MTA has sufficient funds to
grant raises. The transportation authority claims it faces a
$1-billion budget deficit, despite an increase in ridership.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, the authority reported a $300-million surplus.
Agency officials say the surplus was spent to dramatically improve
subway and bus service and to grant discounts to riders.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators view the explanation with skepticism and wonder
if the authority exaggerated its successes so that Gov. George E.
Pataki would not face financial problems before his reelection in
November or whether some money is being withheld for eleventh-hour
bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   During the last transit strike in 1980, which lasted 11 days, the
union was fined $1 million and workers gave up two days' pay for each
day of the walkout.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomberg administration is preparing to seek much stiffer
penalties.</TE>

<HD>Wisconsin Deer Disease Confined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>The latest test results of deer killed in Wisconsin's fall hunts
continue to show that a fatal brain disease in whitetail deer is
confined to an area west of this city, the state Department of
Natural Resources said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But the testing found four more deer killed in the Mount Horeb
area southwest of Madison were infected with chronic wasting disease,
bringing the total to 48 since the disease was discovered in
February.</LD>
<LD>   So far, the department said, 703 deer killed in areas beyond Mount
Horeb have been tested for the disease and all the tests were
negative.</LD>
<TE>   The newest report indicates 3,880 deer in Wisconsin have now been
tested for the disease, with about 30,000 samples still to be
analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Recent testing in Colorado detected the disease in elk for the
first time in areas near Kremmling, Meeker and Rangely. The disease
has been detected in 175 deer and elk around Colorado this season.</TE>
<TE>   In another Wisconsin development, the owner of a Portage County
deer farm where the first deer in a captive herd with chronic wasting
disease was discovered wants a judge to block the state from killing
his herd.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Hall, owner of Buckhorn Flats Game Farm near Almond, filed a
lawsuit in Portage County Circuit Court seeking an injunction to stop
the destruction of his herd. Hall alleges the state has stonewalled
his efforts to obtain documents that could show the buck shot Sept. 4
on his farm didn't have the disease. A hearing is scheduled for next
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, federal sharpshooters, hired by the state
Agriculture Department, killed 118 whitetail deer at a private deer
farm near Eagle where a captive deer also was diagnosed with chronic
wasting disease. It was the first private deer herd in Wisconsin to
be destroyed in the aftermath of the discovery of the disease, said
Donna Gilson, an Agriculture Department spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The disease was found for the first time in the state's wild herd
in February in three bucks shot last year near Mount Horeb. It marked
the first time the disease had been found east of the Mississippi
River.</TE>

<HD>Killer's Lawyers Say Evidence Was Withheld in 1982 Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for convicted killer Wayne Williams filed court papers Friday
alleging that police and prosecutors withheld key evidence from the
defense.</LD>
<LD>   Williams is serving a life sentence for killing two people and is
blamed for the deaths of 22 others, most of them children. He has
long claimed prosecutors were guilty of misconduct and that his
attorneys failed to effectively represent him during his 1982 trial.</LD>
<LD>   In the petition filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta,
Williams' lawyers allege that authorities withheld from the defense
evidence suggesting that the Ku Klux Klan was responsible for the
slayings.</LD>
<TE>   It also alleges the probe was abruptly derailed when a Georgia
Bureau of Investigation officer tipped off the Klan suspects as to
the identity of an informant, and that the officer later destroyed
much of the evidence of the Klan investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was convicted of killing Nathaniel Cater, 27, and Jimmy
Ray Payne, 21.</TE>
<TE>   They were among 29 young blacks, mostly children, slain between
1979 and 1981 in the Atlanta area.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court upheld his conviction in 1984 and rejected
an appeal for a new trial last year.</TE>

<LD>Don't be confused by Mike Leclerc's average offensive numbers because
the hard-working right wing is one of the most valuable players on
the Mighty Ducks' roster.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc, who has played in only 17 games, returned to the Ducks'
lineup this week against Washington and picked up two assists after
sitting out 10 games because of an injured left knee that required
arthroscopic surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "You just want to get back to playing hockey, especially when
you're seeing your friends out there having fun and winning games,"
said Leclerc, who has nine assists and 11 points. "It hasn't been
like that around here over the last couple of years."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock, who monitored Leclerc's ice time against the
Capitals, said the 6-foot-2, 215-pound winger provides an added
dimension for the Ducks' attack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good having Mike Leclerc back because he's a good physical
guy," Babcock said after the Ducks extended their winning streak to
three games with a 3-0 victory over Washington on Wednesday. *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' penalty kill is ranked ninth in the league with an
85.6% success rate, which includes an eye-opening 93.8% over their
last five games. This unit will face a major test on Sunday when the
Ducks host Mario Lemieux and the Pittsburgh Penguins, who have the
most dominating power play in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he is more than special," Babcock said about Lemieux.
"It's never an easy day when you are playing Lemieux."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei, who has been bothered by a strained right
side, skated Friday but did not take part in any contact drills and
is listed as day-to-day.... Less than 2,000 tickets remain for
Sunday's game against the Penguins.</TE>

<HD>Patriots Change Attack</HD>
<DH>Birmingham goes to two tight ends to bolster running game
en route to a 35-7 upset of Taft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called the power toss. It's an in-your-face, stop-me-if-you-can
offensive formation that uses two tight ends. Lake Balboa Birmingham
unveiled it in the City Championship football game Friday night and
pulled off the upset of the year.</LD>
<LD>   With running backs Dennis Keyes and Brian Baylor picking up
critical yards behind a dominating blocking scheme, the Patriots
defeated previously unbeaten Woodland Hills Taft, 35-7, at the
Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots didn't rely on the formation during a 30-6 West
Valley League loss to Taft. But in opening a 28-0 lead in the first
half, they dared the Toreadors to stop Keyes and Baylor. They
couldn't, not with linemen Robert Elisha, Eddie Arreola, Philip Cerda
and William Ramirez clearing the way.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen a line play this well in my life," said Keyes,
who rushed for 153 yards in 26 carries. The Patriots had an 11-minute
drive in the second half that symbolized their domination.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kissing the ground," a jubilant Arreola said. "We worked so
hard for this moment."</TE>
<TE>   Not many observers gave Birmingham (11-3) much of a chance against
Taft (13-1), which had one of the best collection of skill players in
City Section history and hadn't been held under 30 points all season.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots' emotion was fueled by a feeling of injustice that
receiver Bennie Ward had to miss the game because of a suspension for
a videotape that was turned in by Taft from last week's game against
Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it for Bennie," Arreola shouted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The defeat will be a bitter one for Steve Smith of Taft even
though he became the state career leader in receptions. He moved past
Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park with his fifth catch of the night in
the third quarter. Van Buren's record of 269 catches was set in 1993.
Smith caught 94 passes as a sophomore, 91 as a junior and finished
this season with 86 receptions and 271 in his career.</TE>

<LD>Senior Michael Poe of Etiwanda lacks the name recognition of a Chris
Solinsky of Stevens Pt., Wis., or a Bobby Curtis of St. Xavier in
Louisville, Ky., in national high school distance running circles,
but he said he won't be in awe of them today when he runs in the
national cross-country championships at Morley Field in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Solinsky placed third in last year's meet and Curtis was among the
pre-race contenders before finishing 21st, but Poe says he is looking
forward to facing them and the other 29 runners in the national title
meet, which was first run in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   "I know I can run with most of those guys, if not all of them,"
said Poe, who won the West region championships at Mt. San Antonio
College last Saturday. "[Solinsky and Curtis] are great runners, but
I'm not going to go in there all intimidated."</LD>
<TE>   Poe, the first Etiwanda runner to qualify for the national
championships, finished a disappointing 13th in the individual
sweepstakes race of the Mt. SAC Invitational on Oct. 26. But he has
won five consecutive races since, including the Southern Section
Division I championship on Nov. 23 and the state title the following
week.</TE>
<TE>   Nick LaCapria, the cross-country coach at Duarte, said Falcon
junior Mohamed Trafeh will run better in the national championships
than he has the previous month because he has been eating and
drinking fluids regularly since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
ended last week.</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh, who qualified for today's race with an eighth-place finish
in the West regional, did not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset
from Nov. 6-Dec. 5 while participating in Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   He won Division IV titles in the Southern Section and state
championships, but his times in those meets did not measure up to
some of his efforts earlier in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the fact that he's eating regularly] is going to help
him dramatically," LaCapria said. "It's hard to say how strong he'll
be, but he'll definitely be stronger than he's been in about six
weeks."</TE>

<TE>   The girls' basketball game scheduled for tonight between Lynwood

game fell through after Jacksonville was unable to secure corporate
sponsorship to cover airfare.</TE>
<TE>   After Ribault bowed out, the local Times-Union newspaper stepped
forward, allowing Ribault to make the trip at a later date. Ribault
has a 99-game winning streak.</TE>

<LD>On the eve of tonight's home game against NHL scoring leader Mario
Lemieux and the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Kings learned Friday that
they could be without one of their top defensemen for a month or
more.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Miller, who sat out the season's first 13 games after
abdominal surgery, is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks
after suffering a broken left foot in the third period of Wednesday
night's 3-0 victory over the Dallas Stars.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a huge blow," forward Bryan Smolinski said Friday after
practice. "He's a huge part of our team, but we're going to have to
try to fill his spot."</LD>
<TE>   Filling his spot on the roster will be rookie Joe Corvo, who was
the leading scorer among American Hockey League defensemen before his
recall Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Barring an improbable return by injured defenseman Lubomir
Visnovsky, Corvo, 25, is expected to make his NHL debut tonight. The
Manchester (N.H.) Monarchs' most valuable player last season, Corvo
was tied for the club lead with 26 points in 26 games this season and
had continued to play after his Nov. 13 arrest in Boston for
allegedly sexually assaulting and attacking a woman in a bar.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the allegations against Corvo, who is scheduled for a
pretrial hearing Jan. 10 in Boston Municipal Court, King Coach Andy
Murray said the club had "no reservations" in recalling the 6-foot-1
defenseman.</TE>
<TE>   Said General Manager Dave Taylor: "We're looking on this as a
hockey decision. What's gone on outside of the rink is a private
matter."</TE>
<TE>   X-rays taken Wednesday of Miller's injured foot were negative, but
he was unable to walk on it Thursday. X-rays taken Friday revealed a
broken foot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty tough to just start feeling like myself again and
then get hurt again," said Miller, in the last year of his contract.</TE>

<LD>Nothing's wrong with April Ross now.</LD>
<LD>   Ross, a junior outside hitter, had 10 kills, seven digs and a
career-high six blocks to lead the top-seeded USC women's volleyball
team to a 30-24, 30-20, 30-17 sweep of No. 9-seeded Pepperdine in the
NCAA West regional championship match at UC Santa Barbara on Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The victory comes a year after Ross was forced to sit out the 2001
regional final because of a severely sprained right ankle suffered
the previous night.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year definitely haunts me, and everyone else too," said
Ross, who was named the regional's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   In Ross' absence, the Trojans lost last year's regional final
match to Arizona in five games, but there wasn't much chance of that
this time as USC (29-1) advanced to the NCAA Final Four for the fifth
time.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore outside hitter Alicia Robinson had five kills and Ross
four in the first game, when USC hit at a .378 clip. Junior middle
blocker Katie Olsovsky accounted for six of the Trojans' first seven
points in the second game, when Ross also had three kills, four digs
and a block.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson came on again in the third game for six of her team-high
11 kills. USC took double-digit leads in each of the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Peppedine (26-7) saw its 17-match winning streak end. Its last
loss was to USC on Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Wilkins led Peppedine with 15 kills and five digs, and
Christina Hinds had 16 digs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Waves' best efforts, the Trojans won their 10th
consecutive match and will face the winner of tonight's East regional
final between Washington State and Florida in the national semifinals
Thursday in New Orleans. The championship match is Saturday.</TE>

the same time period, according to Nielsen Media Research Inc.</TE>

<HD>Vancouver Voters Have Say on 2010</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testing the desirability of organizing the Olympics in an era
dominated by security and budget concerns, the citizens of Vancouver,
Canada, will vote Feb. 22 in a referendum on whether the city should
stage the 2010 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   The Vancouver City Council authorized the nonbinding plebiscite
this week, and newly elected Mayor Larry Campbell -- who campaigned
on a pledge to hold such a referendum -- predicted it would win by a
significant margin.</LD>
<LD>   The referendum holds the potential to be a turning point in the
Olympic bid process -- a "watershed" event, Campbell called it, and
not just for Vancouver, but for the International Olympic Committee
and cities worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver's fate in the 2010 race, for instance, is likely to bear
significantly on New York's chances of playing host to the 2012
Summer Games. As one of many scenarios, if Vancouver wins for 2010,
that almost certainly knocks another Canadian city, Toronto, out of
the 2012 campaign -- which would work in New York's favor.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC is due to award the 2010 Games next July. Salzburg,
Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea, are also in the race. The IOC
will award the 2012 Games in 2005. New York will compete against a
number of cities from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC demands as part of the bid process that a candidate city
demonstrate public support for the Games. Typically, that comes via
public opinion polling.</TE>
<TE>   Full-fledged public votes over the years have been few -- and
decidedly unproductive.</TE>
<TE>   In September, for example, Swiss voters defeated a referendum that
asked whether they would help underwrite a Bern candidacy for 2010.
Bern then dropped out. In 1972, Denver voters rejected hosting the
1976 Winter Olympics even after the city had been awarded the Games.
The Games were staged in Innsbruck, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   But in Vancouver, polling now shows support for the Games at about
68%, Campbell said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Olympic champions Alexei Yagudin and Sarah Hughes didn't rekindle the
magic they produced 10 months ago in Salt Lake City, but each won an
important battle Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Not winning at the Crest Whitestrips International Figure Skating
Challenge mattered less than coming away with reason to believe
they've overcome injuries and are pointed toward success.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm extremely pleased with how I did, considering I missed the
whole season so far," said Hughes, who returned from a torn leg
muscle to finish second to a powerful and poised Sasha Cohen at the
Palace of Auburn Hills.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very nerve-racking to go out there for the first time,"
added Hughes, who is heavier than her Olympic weight but held onto
her landings in her "La Bayadere" routine. "You don't know what to
expect, where to breathe, which parts to sell more."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, hobbled by a hip problem, scaled down his program to
eliminate the quadruple jumps, which consigned him to fifth. Fellow
Russian Evgeny Plushenko won with a program that featured a quad and
seven triples and earned a perfect 6.0 for presentation from Russian
judge Igor Dolgushin. Michael Weiss was second, followed by Olympic
bronze medalist Tim Goebel -- also returning after a hip injury --
Takeshi Honda of Japan, Yagudin and Matt Savoie.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, encouraged by a new exercise regimen, will reconsider his
previous plan to skip the world championships in Washington in March.
"If I can do more, I will try to do worlds," he said. "I'm not going
to go to get 25th."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen didn't land a planned triple-triple combination but won the
hearts of the audience and the judges. Reigning world champion Irina
Slutskaya, lacking verve, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been able to find strength mentally, as a competitor," said
Cohen, who has followed coach Tatiana Tarasova to a new rink in
Simsbury, Conn.</TE>
