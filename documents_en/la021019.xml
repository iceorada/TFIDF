<HD>Supreme Beings have class, not spark</HD>

<LD>For Supreme Beings of Leisure, the studio is where music comes alive,
with a sophisticated sense of pop possibility and a classy mix of
styles and eras, global accents and a cool '60s mod flavor. The Los
Angeles act's newest album, "Divine Operating System," would make a
fine soundtrack for your next cocktail party.</LD>
<LD>   At the House of Blues on Wednesday, that sound remained
worthwhile, but the spark was missing. Singer Geri Soriano-Lightwood
was a game performer and a pleasant, energetic host, but her elegant
soprano had lost its personality. She had neither the high glamour of
Shirley Bassey nor the smoky trip-hop mood swings of Portishead's
Beth Gibbons.</LD>
<LD>   Too often Soriano-Lightwood seemed buried in the busy mix at the
very times she should have dominated. There were moments when she
approached a fitting sultriness, as during the dynamic soul-searching
of "Ghetto," wrapping her voice around the song's slick funk groove.
But as a whole, the Supreme Beings kept their emotional distance.</LD>
<TE>   "Does everyone have a martini?" the singer asked early in the
90-minute set. Her partner, Ramin Sakurai, stood behind his keyboards
and electronic gear, and, joined by live bass, drums, guitar and
occasional saxophone, all played with a loose, light touch.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano-Lightwood twisted behind the microphone, reaching for
romance and drama. And on "Calamity Jane," the singer actually
surpassed her performance on the new album.</TE>
<TE>   But the concert overall failed to create a lasting mood. A couple
of martinis might have helped.</TE>

<HD>A film festival where shorter is better</HD>
<DH>Now the biggest event for mini-movies, the series began as
an outlet for a filmmaker seeking to get his own work screened.
Entries have included Oscar winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles International Short Film Festival is a game of
numbers. As in five movies in 72 minutes. Or 400-plus movies in six
days. Or an overnight success story six years in the making.</LD>
<LD>   The festival, which runs through Sunday, includes more than 70
programs with idiosyncratic lineups like this one, from opening
night: the 18-minute plight of a lovesick man ("Sex and the City's"
David Eigenberg) who keeps injuring himself to visit a nurse; the
13-minute confrontation between an imprisoned Nazi war criminal
(James Cromwell) and a victim's granddaughter who comes to forgive
him; a surreal 15-minute merger between H.G. Wells' "War of the
Worlds" and a brief visit to Ireland by Che Guevara; a 14-minute
journey through the angst of teenage virginity; and a 12-minute
showdown between a small-time actress and the New York Times'
arrogant drama critic, in which the actress -- panned by the critic a
year earlier -- poisons his coffee and recites her favorite monologue
as he dies.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the LA Shorts Fest, as it calls itself for short, is
screening so many movies this week is a testament to the faith of its
founder, Robert Arentz.</LD>
<TE>   As a young man, Arentz was a minor league baseball player. That
didn't work out. Then he became an actor. That didn't work out
either. Then he began studying how to make short films, and figured
he'd set up a place where he and other like-minded people could get
their shorts screened.</TE>
<TE>   That -- it was finally clear this week -- definitely worked out.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the festival, which features films of 40 minutes or
less, boasts both a new status and a new home. Having surpassed the
240 films screened in 2001, Arentz can now claim the largest
short-film gathering in the world, overtaking the 8-year-old Palm
Springs festival, which showed 290 shorts last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The festival is screening about half of its films in stylish digs,
the new ArcLight cinema complex on Sunset Boulevard near Vine Street,
with the other half showing at the festival's home base in 2000 and
2001 -- the Los Angeles Film School opposite the ArcLight on Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   It's another world from Arentz's first stab at a festival in 1997,
when he screened 90 shorts at Barnsdall Art Park on Hollywood
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's opening-night program, by contrast, you could
walk through the ArcLight's second-floor bar and catch a struggling
Wisconsin-born actor, Brent Nowak, swapping experiences with Irish
writer-director Ciaran Foy, who had flown in from Dublin a few hours
earlier with his project's composer, Liam Bates.</TE>
<TE>   Nowak, 27, appears Sunday in an 18-minute short, "Union," about
tension between two Civil War Army brothers. It was written and
directed by San Diego State filmmakers Kevin Smets and Joey
Castanieto.</TE>
<TE>   Foy, 24, spent less than $3,000 in grant money from his Dublin
film school to make his eight-minute "The Puppet," which also screens
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's the synopsis," Foy said, smiling self-consciously at how
robotic a filmmaker becomes at repeating his one-sentence pitch:
"Five office workers are taken hostage by shy colleague Neil [played
by Irish actor Ned Dennehy] and his evil hand-puppet Morgan.... I'm
trying to turn it into a feature."</TE>
<TE>   So is almost everybody else who paid the $30 submission fee.
Filmmakers discuss their work after each program, providing technical
insights largely absent from Oscar after-parties, such as the fact
that Ikea does not charge a fee to shoot on location.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Stolaroff, an independent producer, went to opening night
seeking prospects somewhere in this swirl. "A 30-minute story or a
three-minute story, you're looking for some basic storytelling
elements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stolaroff has long since forgotten the name of a filmmaker who
charmed him at a student film exhibition, but he vividly remembers
his reaction to the movie and hopes someone else provokes it: "It was
scrappy, giddy, it had an energy to it, not everything worked but
most things did, and you just had a sense this guy was really going
for it. The humor had a real edge to it. You got the sense he didn't
have a lot of money but he made the most of what he had. He wasn't
trying to make the same old movie."</TE>
<TE>   Arentz, 40, once planned on being one of those people. Born in
Chicago, he went to high school in Anaheim and, he said, played
briefly on the lowest rung of the San Francisco Giants' farm system.
Then he stumbled across a friend who was studying acting and caught
the bug. When that didn't take, "I thought I would give filmmaking a
shot."</TE>
<TE>   He started taking classes at L.A. City College, shot a couple of
short films, and then, looking for exposure, coordinated a screening.
A year later, he held the first LA Shorts Fest. By the festival's
third year, Kodak became -- and remains -- a major sponsor. "This is
the first year, thank God, I'm able to pay myself a little bit of
money," Arentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven of the shorts shown at the festival have been nominated for
Oscars in the short-film documentary, action or animation categories,
and three have won Oscars, including last year's "The Accountant,"
the first directing effort of writer-actor Ray McKinnon. A native of
rural Georgia, McKinnon told the story of two farming brothers who,
on the brink of bankruptcy, consult an accountant with unconventional
moneymaking suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   The offerings for today and Sunday include more than 150 shorts
that cover a lot of ground. A sampling of subjects: filmmakers who
betray a Chicago mob boss, an elevator confrontation between rivals
at a murder trial, penmanship as an Olympic event, female rodeo
riders, teen prostitution, deadly hitchhikers and a racial drama that
takes place during three time periods. It ends with Sunday's awards
in eight categories and the annual character actor award, to be
presented this year to James Woods.</TE>
<TE>   And then Arentz can begin planning the 2003 festival. He's
convinced it beats acting. "I have more control than when you're just
waiting for the phone to ring."</TE>

<HD>A nation stuck on one station?</HD>
<DH>On his new release, Tom Petty laments the demise of the
autonomous DJ. But radio executives say they're actually more in sync
with listeners now.</DH>

<TE>   -- "The Last DJ," Tom Petty</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his darkened bedroom, the drowsy kid stared night after night
at the glowing amber radio dial and listened to deep-voiced DJs
transmitting vinyl truth across the humid north Florida night skies.
Money was tight in young Tom Petty's house, too tight to be buying
all the new records. "With radio," he says, "it was a romance."</TE>
<TE>   More than three decades later, Petty barely recognizes his old
flame.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happened with radio, it's an example of our loss of
collective soul as a culture, as a society," Petty says by phone.
"With radio, it is especially frustrating, it does discourage me.
Radio is such a part of my life. It was my best friend."</TE>
<TE>   The singer, a staple of classic radio who has a trunkful of hits,
spends a considerable amount of time on his new album, "The Last DJ,"
running down the lost dream of radio and the music industry. In the
title track, he blames conglomeration for making autonomous DJs an
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio was once regional, as different as every town," Petty says.
"More and more, the whole country is listening to one station ...
music is something that is magical, ultra-magical, and radio was an
art form. Now it's something cold and different."</TE>
<TE>   Petty says his new music is an alarm, not an attack, and uses the
music industry as a metaphor for larger issues. But it is also very
easy to hear a Clear Channel beneath the anger Petty is broadcasting.
"Yeah," he says with a chuckle. "that's not the first time I've heard
that."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Entertainment is the 800-pound gorilla in the music
industry these days, a corporate titan that controls more than 1,200
U.S. radio stations, including eight in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel, which is based in San Antonio, is the world's
largest radio broadcaster, as well as the dominant player in outdoor
advertising and concert promotion -- the latter a business that has
raised issues of conflicts of interest. As Clear Channel
empire-building kicked into high gear in recent years, the company
has been a target of music industry venom, government scrutiny and
its own dedicated gadfly Web site. In the 1960s, it was the DJ who
most often determined what was played. Now it is market research and
consultants. DJs often have their music programmed, making their
shifts the steady work of an autopilot. That's nothing new, says Fred
Jacobs, whose Detroit consulting firm is one of the most powerful in
rock radio. It was the advent of programming software in the 1980s
that marked the end of DJs picking the next song.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs says it's easy to romanticize the more ragged past, but he
says radio is now more in sync with listener taste. In the old days,
fickle DJs could pull a station's playlist toward the obscure
fringes. And, anyway those old days are long gone, a fact bemoaned in
song by Elvis Costello ("Radio, Radio" in 1978), Rush ("Spirit of the
Radio" in 1980), Queen ("Radio Ga-Ga" in 1984) and others. "Where has
Tom Petty been the last 22 years?" Jacobs asks. "Anybody who is
waking up now in 2002 and worrying about the last DJ picking their
own songs has been on the road too long or maybe he has been hanging
out with Jim Ladd or something."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out Tom Petty has been hanging out with Jim Ladd.</TE>
<TE>   Ladd is a night-shift host on classic rock station KLOS-FM (95.5),
and his main claim to fame is that he still picks his own songs. That
autonomy, by Petty's standards, may make him the last DJ in
commercial radio in a major market. Ladd and Petty have crossed paths
in recent years, and "The Last DJ" liner notes suggest Ladd may have
been a partial model for the song. Ladd says the DJs of the late
1960s saw themselves as part of a cultural revolution. Now he says
Clear Channel and other powers make radio "strictly a business."
(There are "real DJs" beyond commercial radio, of course, at some
college and public radio stations.)</TE>
<TE>   One voice within Clear Channel blames the advent of the "box
store" era for radio's consolidation blues. Spokeswoman Pam Taylor
points to the spread of Wal-Mart and mass retailers in the 1980s that
pushed out mom-and-pop businesses in small towns. Those businesses
were the bread-and-butter advertisers for independent radio stations
while Wal-Mart champions its stores through national advertising. The
small radio station became a less viable business prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "The box stores and the large retailers changed the landscape of
small towns and that changed, eventually, radio," Taylor says.
Federal deregulation of the industry in the 1980s was initiated to
buoy its fortunes, and that led to the consolidation era. "Many
people take a shot at radio today as if life began in the last 18 or
20 months."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the Clear Channel holdings include KIIS-FM
(102.7), KBIG-FM (104.3), KYSR-FM (98.7) and KOST-FM (103.5). Their
stations claim about 23% of the total audience. Roy Laughlin, Clear
Channel's regional vice president in Los Angeles, says the company's
size does not mean it is any less vulnerable to the power of consumer
choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you keep it a powerful and profitable venture is to
keep it close to the people," he said this week. "It's like being a
politician and not doing what the people want and thinking you're
going to get elected. It's insane. Every Arbitron rating, every
station starts with a zero. You have to earn those shares of
listeners every survey period, so you better be close to what
everybody wants."</TE>
<TE>   Laughlin says the Clear Channel reach also brings big-time talent
to a variety of markets -- even if listeners don't know that the
voice they hear giving them entertainment, local news and even local
traffic reports is imported from out-of-state. He cites Sean
Valentine, a highly rated afternoon DJ on KIIS-FM who, at the end of
his shift, pulls nuggets from his Los Angeles broadcast to sprinkle
into a morning show that he does for a Clear Channel station in
Cleveland. The casual Ohio listener would have no clue that Valentine
is in a different time zone.</TE>
<TE>   Ladd says he longs for the days when "beautiful mistakes" happened
and nontraditional artists such as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the
Grateful Dead were championed by DJs. Now the Internet, soundtracks
and video games are ways for artists to spread new music.</TE>
<TE>   Some do it the old-fashioned way, though. Petty's Web site lists
62 major radio stations, many of them Clear Channel-owned, which
previewed every track of "The Last DJ." Message song or not, Petty
has a radio hit.</TE>

<HD>Polo faces a different kind of suit as dress code is
challenged</HD>
<DH>Current and former Polo employees contend they are forced
to buy clothes to wear on the job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advertisements for Polo Ralph Lauren show a world populated by
beautiful trust-fund families on their leafy estates. But how far
should a company go to propel that image into the public
consciousness?</LD>
<LD>   A few current and former employees say Polo crossed the line. Two
onetime sales associates joined a class-action lawsuit this week
alleging that image was, in part, crafted illegally, by forcing
salespeople to spend thousands of dollars a year on the company's
latest outfits to project a "lifestyle image."</LD>
<LD>   The hired help, in other words, struggled to keep the shirt on
their backs, even with the in-house 65% discount.</LD>
<TE>   Accusations against the posh clothing company ring true for many
salespeople, but few have taken their case to court, said Dean Friar,
spokesman for California's Department of Industrial Relations,
Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. The law says employers who
require workers to wear uniforms must provide that wardrobe at no
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "But we see, instead, discounts given out," Friar said. "That's
very common."</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts, including representatives of the National Retail
Federation, the largest retail trade organization in the world, have
never heard of a lawsuit similar to the one filed against Polo. They
say salespeople are traditionally expected to look presentable and
sport some of the designer's product, but no one reached by The Times
had heard of an employer forcing its staff to invest heavily in
wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   "This strikes me as a unique lawsuit," said Peter Arnold,
executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint against Polo was initially filed in federal court
last month in San Francisco by Toni Young, a 31-year-old sales
associate. Attorneys for Polo have until Nov. 4 to respond to the
complaint. When contacted for this story, Polo spokeswoman Ellen
Maguire said that the company does not comment on pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff attorney Patrick R. Kitchin says Young, who earned
$22,000 last year, has receipts that show she was required to spend
more than $6,000 a year on Polo purchases since she began working at
the store in 1997. "It's a ton of money," he said by phone from his
office near the Polo store where Young still works.</TE>
<TE>   Young's lawsuit also alleges that Polo managers conducted "strip
searches to ensure that all of their clothing is from the defendants'
product lines."</TE>
<TE>   "They would ask Ms. Young to take off her sweaters -- she had a
shirt on underneath -- or take off her shoes, so they could check the
labels," Kitchin said. "In late August, all employees in the San
Francisco store were told they needed five new outfits from the fall
collection. They had to come in wearing the outfits so they could be
photographed and those photographs could be kept in a file sent on to
headquarters in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Kitchin has posted the Web page www.poloclassaction.com to attract
additional plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   One of the newest plaintiffs is 26-year-old Janika Goff, who
worked at the same store as Young, where both Ralph Lauren Footwear
and Polo clothes are sold. Over five years, she sold shoes and
clothes full time and made about $24,000 a year. Each season, she was
entitled to an 80% discount off two pairs of shoes and a 65% discount
off everything else, including the Polo clothes she was expected to
wear every day.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted you to be in current season and wanted the shoes to
look nice and not scuffed, but I was running up and down stairs,
doing stock work sometimes, so I would buy comfortable shoes," said
Goff, who now works at a bank in San Diego. Goff estimates that after
five years at Polo, she had accumulated 65 pairs of shoes, most of
which she considers in great condition but that were too scuffed for
store's management to consider acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   When Goff showed up in sandals one day, a manager made her choose
a pair of loafers to wear. "The price of $50 was deducted from my
paycheck," Goff said.</TE>
<TE>   For Young, the store's expectations were clearly out of line with
what she knew about retail. She had previously worked at the
mid-range clothing chain Bebe while she worked toward a court
stenographer's degree.</TE>
<TE>   "I did have to buy Bebe clothes, but they were a lot more lax
about how current you had to be," she said. "You could actually go to
a secondhand store and buy a Bebe outfit for work and not be
questioned."</TE>
<TE>   Another former employee who confirmed he has joined Young's
class-action lawsuit is Troy Greene, a former sales associate for
eight years at Polo on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was earning $87,000 by the time he resigned last month over
a dispute about new payment structures. He was immediately hired by
Prada, also on Rodeo Drive, which provides its employees with
uniforms -- at no charge -- that must be returned at the end of each
season.</TE>
<TE>   "We get two pairs of trousers, four dress shirts, four knit tops,
two pairs of shoes and a belt. All paid for," said Greene, 40. "Gucci
does the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   According to Young, Polo management received commissions on the
"sales" they made to their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   Young, who is black, also filed a racial discrimination suit
against Polo in San Francisco Superior Court last month. Kitchin says
that in addition to being subject to cruel racial remarks by
superiors, Young has not been promoted during her five-year career at
the store, despite glowing reviews from managers.</TE>
<TE>   "She was told her hair was too nappy, and she needed to straighten
her hair," Kitchin said. "Managers call out to her with an
exaggerated African American urban accent. They call her 'Ms. Thang.'
"</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first tussle Polo has had with its staff.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Polo
Ralph Lauren Corp. denied minorities the same pay and opportunities
as whites even as it promoted a "blond hair and blue eyes" image.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's conclusion was related to another lawsuit pending
in federal court by two former Polo employees.</TE>

<HD>It's like Cannes for critters</HD>
<DH>The Wildscreen film festival in Bristol, England,
celebrates natural history film, TV and new media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chapple</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol, England</LD>
<LD>   Breakfast on the first day at Wildscreen begins with the
creepie-crawlies, scorpions and centipedes, a discussion of the
mating habits of spiders, with a filmmaker from Spain, who was
pitching a project she called "Deadly Love."</LD>
<LD>   "The little male wolf spiders of Lapland drum their abdomens on
the newly fallen birch leaves so loudly they can be heard for 50
yards," she said, with excited Castillian precision.</LD>
<TE>   Next on the agenda was Alastair Fothergill, producer of "Blue
Planet," the wildly successful oceans series that has put nature back
on the map for us Americans, who know, if we know nothing else, that
if it's on DVD, it must be real.</TE>
<TE>   I politely pulled Fothergill out of a screening of "The Deep," as
lush and stunning images of rare sea creatures floated across the
screen, set against the Emmy Award-winning music of composer George
Fenton.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 11th biennial Wildscreen Festival, "the world's
largest and most prestigious" -- the publicists proclaim -- "festival
of natural history film, television and new media." Some 700
filmmakers from more than 30 countries have submitted 350 entries
vying for 17 Panda Awards, the Green Oscars of an earnest and
increasingly lucrative cable and digital world.</TE>
<TE>   The weeklong Wildscreen, which concludes today, is held in
Bristol, a tidal city two hours southwest of London, the place where
John Cabot set sail for the New World, once the center of mercantile
Britain's slave trade -- I write this from a hotel in sight of "Black
Boys Hill" and fronting "White Ladies Road" -- because Grenada Wild,
the BBC's Natural History Unit, the production house that helped to
create "Chicken Run" and other film-tech businesses, are all
headquartered here along with one of the great narrative voices, that
of Sir David Attenborough.</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting to paraphrase some lyrics from a favorite
alternative band -- "You and me, baby, are only just mammals/So come
on, let's do it, let's do it, like they do it/On the Discovery
Channel."</TE>
<TE>   But Wildscreen is not Sundance. And it's certainly not Cannes. No
drama queens, sullen hunks; only a handful of suits. These people are
like the smartest kids you went to high school with, now living what
the rest of us may only fantasize, filming "Secrets of a Tigress: Her
Sons and Her Lovers," while the shots from the poachers are caught on
the boom mike, and you run -- intelligently, with measured step,
probably with a clipped British accent -- to the camera boat.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans desire a quality experience in their living rooms,"
says Fothergill, who, at a trim 42, is director of development for
the BBC's Natural History Unit, "and most of the telly they're
getting is cheap. You're not going to buy a DVD of reality TV. I
mean, why bother?"</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Planet," which cost $12 million to make, is currently the
top-selling nature DVD in the world, and the series gave the
Discovery Channel, which has a strategic partnership with the BBC,
its highest ratings. Interestingly, at the 2000 Wildscreen, the
general consensus held that high-budget gorgeous "blue-chip"
documentaries were dead in the water, precipitously replaced by
"presenter-driven" shows such as Steve Irwin's "Crocodile Hunter."</TE>
<TE>   The patron saint of Wildscreen 2002 was E.O. Wilson, the
comparative zoologist from Harvard, who wrote "On Human Nature" and
"The Ants," both Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as "The Diversity of
Life" and the current "Future of Life." At Wildscreen the gently
erudite Southerner, more understated in his humor than even the
Bristolians, provided closure for the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   He asked the several thousand nature-film fans assembled in the
chapel of the University of Bristol if any had been raised, like him,
a Southern Baptist. There were no hands. "Let's just say," said
professor Wilson, "that for the writers -- the prophets -- of the
Abrahaimic religions, ecology was not even on their screens." He
spoke of the "Paleolithic obstinacy" of our species in rectifying the
damage it has done to the Earth, but said that he was optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Then he made a plea for the little creatures, and the 600 helpful
bacteria species in our human mouths, and the 10 billion useful
organisms living in a single handful of good soil. "Don't call them
bugs," he added, in reference to one Panda-winning children's entry.
"They are insects."</TE>

<HD>Roseanne to star in a new 'show within a show' on ABC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roseanne, the feisty middle-America mom who hit the comedy clubs and
landed an eponymous sitcom deal on ABC that rocketed her to fame, is
set to star in another series on the network, executives confirmed
Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   For 13 half-hour episodes tentatively scheduled to premiere next
summer, Roseanne will let audiences into a "real" workplace setting,
a concept one producer called a "show within in a show."</LD>
<LD>   Roseanne will executive-produce the show along with R.J. Cutler,
the documentarian who made "The War Room" (1993) and just completed
"The Residents," an unscripted drama for TNT.</LD>
<TE>   "If, for instance, this were the show of a cooking show, Roseanne
would exist as the host of that show," Cutler said. He said details
are still being worked out as to whether ABC would air the polished,
edited "cooking show" at a separate time.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Wong, ABC's senior vice president of alternative series and
specials, said the program would offer viewers an "evolution" of
Roseanne since her last stint in front of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old comedian rose to fame through the prime-time hit
sitcom "Roseanne," which ran on ABC from 1988 to 1997 and earned her
an Emmy for lead actress.</TE>
<TE>   The show also earned three Emmys for co-star Laurie Metcalf and a
Golden Globe for John Goodman, who played Roseanne's husband.</TE>
<TE>   The last time she headlined a television project was with "The
Roseanne Show," a syndicated talk show she hosted from 1998 to 2000.</TE>

<HD>Broadbent's piano is front and center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Broadbent may be one of the Southland's most versatile jazz
artists. The New Zealand-born pianist-composer-arranger has worked in
an extraordinarily wide range of musical settings, from playing piano
with Charlie Haden's Quartet West to conducting an orchestra for
Diana Krall.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, his busy schedule -- despite its numerous rewards
-- doesn't often allow him to appear as an instrumentalist in a
straight-ahead jazz setting. So it was a particular pleasure to hear
him with his trio Thursday night at Spazio, Sherman Oaks' relaxed and
intimate jazz restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the fact that his musical companions -- bassist Chris
Connor and drummer Mike Stephans -- were not his regular associates,
Broadbent played with musical mastery. Grant the fact that his
technique is a given, that he can play just about anything that pops
in his mind, and then add the perspective and overview of a
composer-arranger, and that still doesn't quite describe the appeal
of his music. Over and over, his solos offered instantly inventive
new melodies filled with attention-grabbing sequences and arching,
lyrical phrases -- the product of a sophisticated, intensely
communicative mind.</LD>
<TE>   "You've Changed," for example, began with a beautifully textured
solo opening, filled with inner movement and Chopinesque harmonic
alterations. Up-tempo renderings of "The Man I Love" and "I Remember
April" were stunning displays of technical virtuosity at the service
of musical invention rather than -- as is more commonly the case --
simply showing off fast fingers. An excursion through "All the Things
You Are" via a Lennie Tristano variation on the classic standard was
yet another example of Broadbent's ability to reconstruct familiar
material in a fashion that respects the original while uncovering
previously unrevealed musical facets.</TE>
<TE>   Although Connor and Stephans couldn't quite match the connectivity
Broadbent experiences with his frequent associates, bassist Putter
Smith and drummer Kendall Kay, they were warmly engaging, creative
partners. Connor's soloing flowed with an ease comparable to
Broadbent's piano lines, and Stephans' brush playing, in particular,
was the product of a sensitive drummer actively involved with the
other players.</TE>

<HD>Britten's studio to be preserved</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The tiny brick studio where composer Benjamin Britten wrote such
works as "Death in Venice," "Phaedra" and the Third String Quartet
has been declared a listed building, giving it protection from
alteration or demolition.</LD>
<LD>   Britten fled to Chapel House in Horham, eastern England, in 1971
when his previous home at nearby Aldeburgh attracted too many
visitors and interrupted his work. Soon after having the studio
built, he resumed composing.</LD>
<LD>   Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said Britten "is without a doubt
the greatest English classical composer of the last century."</LD>
<TE>   "Britten's music studio, with its view across his beloved Suffolk
countryside, is no architectural gem, but its importance as a piece
of our cultural heritage cannot be denied," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Britten moved to Chapel House five years before his death and had
the small studio built.</TE>

<HD>Trumpeter leads symbiotic quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trumpeter Ralph Alessi, a graduate of CalArts, has spent the past
decade establishing himself as a regular participant in New York
City's contemporary jazz scene. Working with such established artists
as pianist Uri Caine and saxophonists Steve Coleman, Sam Rivers and
Ravi Coltrane, he has developed a focused, carefully articulated
style based on elements that flow from Dave Douglas and Don Ellis.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday at Rocco's, Alessi led an extraordinarily talented
quartet in the opening performance of a four-night run at the
Hollywood club. Much of the material traced to his latest recording,
"This Against That," with a John Coltrane line, "Mr. Day," tossed in
for good measure.</LD>
<LD>   Alessi's original pieces tended to reflect the character of his
improvising -- lines filled with widely leaping intervals, sudden
bursts of notes and quick shifts of rhythm. In rare instances, he
offered too-brief samples of an ability to come up with an engagingly
lyrical, melodic phrase. More often, his music seemed intent on
communicating ideas rather than feelings.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the more absorbing passages in the set surfaced during the
improvised sections and especially during the spontaneous segments by
the rhythm section: pianist Andy Milne, bassist Ben Street and
drummer Gerald Cleaver. Working together with surprisingly powerful
cohesion, they displayed the sort of musical symbiosis that one
usually only hears in well-established, long-term ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   Milne, one of the important emerging new stars on his instrument,
moved easily from the harmonically and rhythmically disjunct
qualities of Alessi's pieces into passages filled with brisk,
straight-ahead swing. Street was a subtle but powerful presence in
the mix, and Cleaver offered a model example of musically sensitive
drumming.</TE>
<TE>   Alessi's choice of such gifted associates suggested a desire to
present his music in the best possible light. But he would more
effectively accomplish that task if he better balanced his technical
and intellectual goals with a larger portion of unfettered musical
expressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The Ralph Alessi Quartet at Rocco's, 6320 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood. Tonight, 10:30 p.m. $10. (323) 804-4146.</TE>

<HD>S.F. Festival revels in the offbeat</HD>

<LD>At one of the recent San Francisco Jazz Festivals, there was a
program that symbolized the impact of this long-running event. A
concert featuring pianist Cecil Taylor -- one of the most
determinedly individualistic artists in jazz history -- drew an
intent, receptive, capacity crowd of nearly 1,000. That's
considerably more than Taylor has attracted to local appearances at
the Jazz Bakery (although there was an understandably larger turnout
for his performance earlier this year as one of the participants in
UCLA's All Tomorrow's Parties).</LD>
<LD>   I don't in any way intend to demean Taylor's work, which I firmly
believe will at some point be more fully honored than it is today.
But the point is that the San Francisco Jazz Festival has established
the sort of solid, dependable connection with its audiences that they
will turn out in quantity for even the most offbeat acts. (And
perhaps even more so for precisely such acts, as they did for an
Ornette Coleman performance a few years ago that combined jazz
improvisation with poetry reading, multimedia collage and onstage
body piercings.)</LD>
<LD>   Given that sort of receptivity -- not surprising for the community
in which it takes place -- the festival has the opportunity to offer
extraordinarily diverse programming, broadly encompassing every sort
of music that might imaginably be found beneath the broad umbrella of
jazz.</LD>
<TE>   This year, as it celebrates its 20th anniversary with concerts
extending from Wednesday to Nov. 10, the festival has come up with
one of its most colorful and eclectic programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it comes together the way it does simply because of
happenstance," says Randall Kline, founder and director of the
festival. "But it's also because we're open to unusual ideas --
because our audience allows, even expects, us to try unusual
combinations. Someone compared what we do as being more curatorial --
in the best sense of the word -- to look at all the possibilities out
there and try to figure out how to put them together to make things
more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Although this year's festival has its share of major names --
Shirley Horn, Elvin Jones, Wayne Shorter, Branford Marsalis, Charles
Lloyd, Bobby McFerrin, to name only a few -- it is in the unusual
combinations and pairings, in the offbeat inclusions, that it reveals
its unique identity as one of the nation's preeminent jazz
productions.</TE>
<TE>   A concert on Oct. 28 featuring Brazilian composer-instrumentalist
Hermeto Pascoal and the big Brazilian jazz band Banda Mantiqueira
(internationally praised but virtually unknown in the U.S.) is an
intriguing example of the way some pairings take place in the
"happenstance" manner Kline describes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to get Hermeto many times," Kline says, "but he's not
an easy person to get to come to this country. Then his agent put
together a string of dates for him with a band. But Hermeto didn't
like the money, basically, and decided he was only going to our date
-- as a solo act -- because we offered him what he felt he deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I got a call from a big classical agency offering me a
Brazilian band called Banda Mantiqueira. They figured I'd be the only
person who'd know who they are, and in fact, Joshua Redman -- who is
the spring festival's artistic director -- had already brought them
to my attention and urged that we book them. So suddenly we had one
of the finest international big jazz bands, working on a bill with a
composer-musician who they feel has had a direct influence on their
music."</TE>
<TE>   Other unusual entries are the result of Kline's sheer persistence.
On successive nights, for example, the festival presents the Ornette
Coleman Trio (Nov. 7) and Merle Haggard's salute to western swing
king Bob Wills (Nov. 8). Each booking is the result of years of
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "In Merle's case," Kline says, "we just never could seem to fit
into his tour schedule. But I just kept calling, and this year they
called me back. Which is great because it gives us an opportunity to
present western swing music, performed by exactly the right guy.
Merle is so dedicated to Wills that he's given his dog the same name
as Wills' dog.</TE>
<TE>   "With Ornette, I kept feeling we needed to have something to sort
of bookend that controversial performance he gave here that upset so
many people. So when we got him to come out with just his trio --
something he only does a few times a year -- it seemed perfect, the
ideal way to experience pure Ornette."</TE>
<TE>   The list of similarly compelling events includes a "surprise
party" for Bobby McFerrin on Nov. 9, in which, according to Kline,
"Bobby won't know who's going to be there to play with him until they
walk out from behind the curtain, and hopefully what we'll get will
be an evening of really spontaneous invention."</TE>
<TE>   As in every festival, there will be a special event at Grace
Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a marvelous space," Kline says. "I mean, that's where Duke
Ellington consecrated the cathedral with his first concert of sacred
music. And this year we've got what seems to me to be this year's
grand slam, San Francisco Jazz Festival sort of show: James Carter
and the Huun- Huur-Tu singers [on Nov. 1]. Carter alone in that room,
with all his instruments and his unusual techniques, would be
marvelous. And I can only imagine what the Tuvan throat singers might
do with the cathedral's seven-echo delay and their eerie vocal sounds
and overtones."</TE>
<TE>   The 20th anniversary San Francisco Jazz Festival runs Wednesday
through Nov. 10 in various locations around the city. Tickets range
from free to $75. Festival information: (415) 788-7353 or
www.sfjazz.org.</TE>
<TE>   Woody Revisited: Woody Herman was one of a kind: a great
bandleader and a much-admired human being. He and his music will be
honored this weekend in a major event at what is surely one of the
oddest locations ever chosen for a jazz event: the Douglas Fairbanks
Gardens Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where Herman is buried. The
tribute program, with ancillary free events tonight and Sunday
afternoon at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex, features a stellar
aggregation of former Herman sidemen, including Terry Gibbs, Pete
Candoli, Bill Perkins, Jack Nimitz, Don Lamond, Billy Bauer and many
others. In addition, the current installment of the Herman Orchestra,
led by Frank Tiberi and featuring saxophonist Joe Lovano and singer
Shelby Lynne, will also perform. Information: (323) 769-1442 or
www.autumneve concerts.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jazz Calendars: Still can't get enough of Woody? Or Stan Kenton?
Dynaflow Publications has a way to sustain a daily connection: two
calendars -- the 2003 Kenton Kalendar and the 2003 Woody Herman
Calendar -- celebrating the memories of each of these bandleaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenton Kalendar contains more than 350 historical dates,
alumni background and 25 previously unpublished photos of the leader
and his ensemble. In addition, there is an alphabetical "Encyclopedia
of Kentonia" identifying the instruments, tenure and birth dates of
more than 275 alumni.</TE>
<TE>   The Herman calendar also includes previously unpublished photos,
as well as more than 150 trivia dates related to Herman and his
groups. An "Encyclopedia of the Herds" has 150 entries embracing his
numerous musicians and vocalists.</TE>
<TE>   The calendars are $20 each plus $2 postage, available by mail from
Dynaflow Publications, 148 N. Catalina Ave. No. 4, Pasadena, CA
91106.</TE>

<HD>Taking a sonic romp with Steroid Maximus</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lydia Lunch was in the audience at the Knitting Factory on Thursday
shouting, "Just the way the devil likes it!" Pouring an 18-piece
orchestra into a deep swing that eludes most rock outfits, J.G.
Thirlwell performed his new album, "Ectopia," recorded under his
cinematic-composition persona, Steroid Maximus, to shocking effect.</LD>
<LD>   Conducting an ensemble arranged by Lounge Lizards trumpeter Steve
Bernstein, Thirlwell, who over the decades has also worked under the
names Foetus, Clint Ruin and Wiseblood, set aside his industrial-rock
god pose. Instead, he pushed string and horn sections through complex
avant-compositions. Isaac Hayes-style Motown funk romps referencing
"Shaft" moved seamlessly into postmodern pastiche pieces like
snatches of sound heard through the windows of a moving bus.</LD>
<LD>   Proof that talent transcends hip, "Ectopia" makes spy/crime noir
and neo-blaxploitation quotations seem as if they were just invented,
and the ensemble, led by Charlie Hunter Trio drummer Scott Amendola
(miked big and booming), presented them as pure, lean, fast and fun.</LD>
<TE>   Though all manner of sonic frippery was added by two keyboardists
and guitarist Nels Cline, the vibe was more Cab Calloway than
Kraftwerk, and ending the set on a muscular tune from a previous
Steroid Maximus disc, "Quilombo!," made it clear that nothing is more
fun than a big orchestra out to rock.</TE>

<HD>Writers Guild policies ensure it's a union divided against
itself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.F. Lawton</AU>
<BD>J. F. Lawton wrote the films "Pretty Woman" and "Under
Siege" and created the syndicated television series "VIP." He lives
in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised to read Stephen Schiff accusing me of being divisive
and trying to "politicize" the Writers Guild of America just because
I believe the guild has an obligation to try to protect the first
writer on a screenplay ("Writing Credit Changes Proposed," by Lorenza
Munoz, Oct. 4). He said it was "dangerous" for me to try to divide
the union into first writers and rewriters.</LD>
<LD>   But the union already is divided, and Schiff, who is co-chairman
of the credits review committee, is well aware of it. Freelance
screenwriters are increasingly being paid less and less to do more
and more work setting up films for the major studios. It can take a
screenwriter dozens of pitches, treatments or specs and years of work
to finally get a movie started. Writers are often asked to do many
unpaid rewrites and can spend months waiting for notes between them.
I'm not talking about wannabe screenwriters; I'm talking about
working guild writers, who are truly suffering under this system,
having trouble paying their bills and feeding their families even as
they help get a big studio film off the ground. That is the reality
of our business.</LD>
<TE>   On the other end of the spectrum, a big-name rewriter can be paid
huge amounts of money for a few weeks of work once the film is
green-lighted by the studio. And the current guild rules encourage
the rewriter to throw out as much of the previous writer's work as
possible. A rewriter who throws out enough material, and makes enough
changes, can remove all the other writers' names from the film. And
if this was not enough incentive to destroy other writers' labor,
huge bonuses, up to $1 million or more, are tied to getting credit.
This is also the reality of our business.</TE>
<TE>   It is a reality that enormously favors the last rewriter,
especially powerful ones who also are directors or producers. And it
is, simply, morally wrong.</TE>
<TE>   From a business and creative standpoint, it is hurting our
industry. It is why big-budget films are more likely to be poorly
written and full of plot holes than low-budget ones. It is why
feature development drags on longer and longer, year after year. It
is why studios have to pay less to first writers, so they can have
the money to pay rewriters. It is why our most talented writers
quickly become directors, because the Directors Guild, unlike the
Writers Guild, protects its membership.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, in television, if David E. Kelley were brought in to
rewrite Aaron Sorkin's idea for a new show and then David Chase were
brought in to rewrite that. In television, powerful and talented
writers almost always refuse such work. They want to create their own
shows, not rewrite other powerful writers, or other weak writers. In
fact, powerful TV writers often mentor and assist up-and-coming
writing talent by co-creating or producing with them. And that's why
some of the best writing around is on shows like "The Sopranos" and
"The West Wing." Because writers help writers.</TE>
<TE>   In feature films, our system is completely upside-down. The
studios often hire the cheapest writer they can find, assuming
they'll bring on more expensive writers once they have made up their
minds to make a film. This is not the studio's fault. Hollywood is a
business of stars, and it's not unreasonable for studio executives to
be in awe of talented and successful writers and want to work with
them. The problem is that these writers have too much incentive to
take these jobs and cannibalize other writers' work.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful and talented writers should be writing their own scripts.
But the Writers Guild's credits system encourages them not to. The
moment any writer achieves any level of success, the temptation to be
last in the development food chain is usually too great to resist.
You can get all the credit, and a lot more money, for a lot less
work. That's simply the truth.</TE>
<TE>   I've spent more than 10 years -- two on the Writers Guild's board
of directors and five on the credits review committee -- trying to
bring writers together to confront the way our credit system affects
the industry. When I served on the committee, I begged Schiff and
anyone else who would listen not to push forward the proposals that
are now being put to the membership for a vote, precisely because
they are divisive. It was simply foolish to think the membership
would support proposals designed to give even more credit to our most
powerful members at the expense of our weakest. I resigned in hopes
they would reconsider, or that the board would act to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   What political gain does Schiff think I achieve by trying to fight
these changes? I hold no political office, nor do I seek one. And I
am a writer-director-producer and exactly the kind of writer these
proposals would help.</TE>
<TE>   But Schiff is right: I am seeking to politicize this union. Once
these changes are defeated, the Writers Guild needs to confront the
very real and growing problems we face with our credits system. It
needs the political will to do something that will change our system
for the better, not the worse. And it needs to start talking about
what that might be, right now.</TE>

<LD>I'M thrilled someone is filtering movies and can't wait for
CleanFlicks to open nearby ("Are these videos rated C for clean or
compromised?," by Bob Baker, Oct. 14).</LD>
<LD>   Why hasn't Hollywood discovered the money to be made with clean
versions? They routinely cut their movies for studio decisions and TV
ads and then offer director's cuts, commentary, wide or full screen
and deleted scenes on the DVDs. TV networks routinely omit
objectionable scenes and silence offensive words. Foreign versions
are not only dubbed but also modified to fit "cultural
sensitivities."</LD>
<LD>   Why shouldn't the average citizen have the same opportunity?</LD>
<TE>   Bill Spencer</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't find nudity, violence and the constant use of profanity or
the F-word entertaining, nor do most of the people I know. I think
CleanFlicks is a wonderful idea, and if there were a CleanFlicks
store in my neighborhood, I would be one of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   Since there seems to be a large number of people who feel the
same, maybe Hollywood filmmakers should -- dare I say that horrible
word? -- censor themselves and clean up their movies so the public
wouldn't have to do it for them.</TE>
<TE>   Mandy Baker</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OFFERING consumers alternatives neither diminishes the esteem of a
given work nor thwarts accessibility to that work for those who seek
an unedited, original version. Hollywood directors and studios -- the
latter as profit-motivated as they come -- would be wise to offer
differing cuts to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, such is already done to an extent if one considers the
special director's cuts and unrated versions of many hit films
available on video and DVD. No one seems to be protesting that. And
let's not forget that most films result from a Hollywood entity
buying, then altering, a script, an artwork in its own right. Those
directors protesting CleanFlicks are opposing an inherent principle
of their own craft.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Scoll</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN case they've missed them, here's a list of some recent popular
and classic films that CleanFlicks may want to consider for their
"family" versions: "Last Tango in Paris" without the sex; "The
Exorcist" without any of the disturbing, offensive scenes with the
little girl; "Raging Bull" without the ring violence; "Jaws" without
the scary shark; "The Godfather" without the mob violence; and
"Schindler's List" without the scenes of women and men being murdered
that might disturb some viewers.</TE>
<TE>   CleanFlicks, in "sanitizing" the films' methods of storytelling to
suit anyone's self-serving needs, not only infringes on copyrights,
it may do even more long-term damage to an arguably artistic medium,
that of homogenizing the vision so as to completely rob the authors
of their collective voice and the film of its very essence and
meaning. Depictions of sex and violence and the use of "off-color"
speech, as offending as they may be, are a means to tell stories
that, like "Saving Private Ryan," rely on these depictions to provoke
the emotions, the thoughts and the reactions that are so unique to
the story and to film as a medium.</TE>
<TE>   CleanFlicks establishes a precedent more disturbing than any
sexual or violent depiction captured on film. It opens the door for
other similar organizations devoted to shielding viewers from "filth"
while at the same time promoting censorship and, yes, fascism. One
can easily imagine CleanSculpture or CleanPaintings or even
CleanNews, where the world has been sanitized for easy consumption,
where nothing disturbing or thought-provoking is ever shown in the
living room.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fleischer</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE media furor over edited videos and the recent Directors Guild
of America lawsuit has unfairly lumped in DVD-filtering providers
such as ClearPlay with the video chain CleanFlicks, when in actuality
these companies are as different as night and day.</TE>
<TE>   The latter physically edits copies of Hollywood films and then
rents these "cleaned up" versions. On the other hand, ClearPlay
provides families with an enhanced parental control that acts like a
remote control to skip over or mute R-rated material, without
permanently altering the content of the DVD in any way. You return
the same DVD you rented -- or you can watch it later without
ClearPlay parental controls once the kids have gone to bed.</TE>
<TE>   The whole debate really boils down to parents' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Why does Hollywood think it has the power to control whether
parents may filter out graphic violence and nudity in the privacy of
their homes? If Hollywood directors wish to control how their movies
are viewed, then they should limit their distribution to the movie
theater, a place they can control. They clearly do not and should not
have such control in the family room.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York-based interdisciplinary artist-choreographer Charles Dennis
performs in the flesh and once-removed. In his case, a video image
created by a hand-held digital camera is his surrogate. Dennis,
co-founder of New York's long-running experimental space P.S. 122,
presented his splendid work, "Mr. Remote," Thursday at Highways
Performance Space. It brought new meaning to martinis, disco music
and spending the night solo in front of the tube.</LD>
<LD>   After a hard day, Dennis flicks through the evening's offerings
and, finding nothing, points the camera at himself. Gliding around
the floor with the ease of Astaire, Dennis shakes up a martini
grande, determinedly boogies with a sly, knowing grin and, with
camera strategically placed (a monitor and large screen also serve as
companions), the world is seen through a martini glass. When Dennis
gets to the olive -- it's satori.</LD>
<LD>   Cool multiple images, close-ups and other effects ultimately lead
to Dennis kissing his image on the rabbit-eared TV, before calling it
a night.</LD>
<TE>   His "The Gift -- Version 2.0," could be the next morning: Dennis
wakes up in bed, camera already cranking, before opening a bright red
box. Imagine his glee when he discovers a Dennis mini-me, wielding a
tiny video camera. Cereal-eating, shaving and more twirling to nifty
music ensue. Soon, a bigger box arrives, Dennis puts the doll into
his own bed and then he crawls into the box. Fade to black.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Dennis repeats this program tonight at 8:30 at Highways
Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. (310) 315-1459. $15.</TE>

<HD>ABC commits to full season for Lopez sitcom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Latino-flavored sitcom "The George Lopez Show," exhibiting
greater ratings promise since its wobbly start last spring, has
received a full-season commitment from the ABC network.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement affirmed the view of the struggling Walt Disney
Co.-owned network that the show named for its star, comedian George
Lopez, has demonstrated wide enough appeal to cut across ethnic lines
and draw a mass audience.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which airs Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m., features Lopez as
a middle-class man caught between the pressures of family and his job
at an airplane factory.</LD>
<TE>   The show drew lackluster ratings when launched in March and had
been seen as a longshot for renewal this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But "Lopez" has steadily built its audience since its Oct. 2
return and is running ahead of its own average in the same half-hour
last season, drawing 12.7 million viewers this week.</TE>
<TE>   In its first three telecasts this fall, "Lopez" has ranked first
in its time period in total viewers and among adults under 50, a key
demographic for most advertisers, according to Nielsen Media
Research.</TE>

<HD>The Pacific Symphony is led astray</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oceanic isn't the first word that comes to mind when thinking about
the rhythmically incisive music of Spain. But so wandering was the
beat of conductor Angel Gil-Ordonez when he guest conducted the
Pacific Symphony on Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center that the term was inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   A student of mystic-minded Romanian conductor Sergiu Celibidache,
Gil-Ordonez bobbed and bounced and used the same size and kind of
floating gestures for loud, soft, lyric and rhythmic passages. The
harsh, loud results in the Orgia, one of three movements from
Turnia's "Danzas Fantasticas," Gerhard's Alegrias and the Suite No. 2
from Falla's "The Three-Cornered Hat" were not surprising. The real
surprise was how the orchestra could follow him as well as it did.</LD>
<LD>   Things went better after intermission, with the appearance of San
Francisco Bay Area guitarist Jason McGuire ("El Rubio") and vocalist
Jose Manuel Blanco ("El Grillo"), offering flamenco pieces meant to
show Falla's traditional roots, but any direct quotations weren't
obvious. Still the artistry of the two men -- McGuire is a virtuoso
guitarist and Blanco an expressive singer -- proved completely
rewarding on its own.</LD>
<TE>   The two were substituting for Spanish flamenco singer Ginesa
Ortega and guitarist Chicuela, who could not get U.S. visas in time,
despite the orchestra paying an expediting fee, according to Pacific
Symphony President John Forsyte.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Oregon-based mezzo-soprano Milargo Vargas stepped in
for Ortega as the effective vocalist in Falla's "El Amor Brujo,"
which closed the concert. Except for Gil-Ordonez's penchant for
glacially slow tempos, the one-act ballet emerged with more
precision, subtlety and sense of dramatic atmosphere than anything
else on the program.</TE>

<HD>Allen takes his dual act to the theater</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 30 turns as a writer-director behind him in the
movies, Woody Allen is getting ready to wear both hats for the first
time in a theater production. "Writer's Block," a pair of one-acts he
has written, will be mounted in New York at the Atlantic Theater
Company, starting April 23.</LD>
<LD>   Beth Emelson, producing director of the off-Broadway, nonprofit
theater, said Friday that Allen volunteered the script out of the
blue less than two weeks ago. "We liked it and thought it would be
wonderful."</LD>
<LD>   Casting has not been announced for the companion pieces,
"Riverside Drive" and "New Milford." Emelson said she doubts Allen
will act in the show too. "</LD>
<TE>   "I've never directed anything in the theater before and have no
idea whether I'll have any flair for it," Allen said in a statement
reported in the New York Times. He said he offered the play to the
Atlantic Theater Company "because I really like their work over the
years."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, 66, has written nine previous plays, most recently "Central
Park West," which stood alongside short pieces by David Mamet and
Elaine May in a 1995 triptych called "Death Defying Acts." His other
stage works include "Don't Drink the Water" (1966), "Play It Again,
Sam" (1969) and "God" (1975).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ronettes can't collect movie and advertisement royalty rights to
music they recorded for Phil Spector in the 1960s, New York's highest
court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   A contract that members of the pop group signed with Spector and
his Philles record label in 1963 gives him the right to sell the
songs for use as background music, the Court of Appeals decided
unanimously.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling threw out a $3-million judgment lower courts had made
in favor of the Ronettes. The group has been in court seeking
royalties since 1988.</LD>
<TE>   The judges ordered the case back to a trial court to determine how
much the Ronettes are entitled to for use of their music in
compilations and reissues. The Ronettes have royalty rights to that
music, the court concluded.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Cruz-based Nuclear Whales Saxophone Orchestra is
spearheading an effort to assemble 1,000 sax players from around the
world to perform atop the Great Wall of China next summer.</LD>
<LD>   Orchestra founder Don Stevens conceived the event, part of
International Olympic Day activities in China on June 23, "to show
the Great Wall as a symbol of peace that can bring people of all
nations together through music."</LD>
<LD>   The concert will be conducted by historian and composer Gunther
Schuller, and the music director is Mark Watters, the four-time
Emmy-winner who was music director for the 1996 and 2002 Olympic
Games. The performance is slated to be broadcast live on Chinese
television and carried to the rest of the world over the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Stevens says half the musicians will be from China, the others
from the countries throughout the rest of the world, ranging from
professionals to high school players. Participants are signing up
through the orchestra's Web site, www.nuclearwhales.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra has lost nearly $1.1 million this
season, a deficit it blamed on the sour economy and last year's
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Orchestra officials said they were concerned about the loss but
noted that it was partly the result of problems beyond their control.
They said ticket sales did not return to normal levels until about
four months after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a fall subscriber drive,
which typically brings in $900,000, yielded no money in the 2001-02
season.</LD>

<LD>Fame, said Jack Kerouac, "is like an old newspaper blowing down
Bleeker Street."</LD>
<LD>   Winning a major literary prize, on the other hand, is something
you can cite on a book jacket. That's why the pulses of publishers,
editors, agents -- and authors less mordant than the bardic Beat --
quicken this time of year, as the award season slips into high gear.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Swedish Academy named Hungary's Imre Kertesz as the
2002 Nobel laureate in literature. On Thursday, the short lists of
nominees for this year's National Book Awards in fiction, nonfiction,
poetry and young people's literature were announced in New York. The
Mann Booker Prize winner will be named in London on Tuesday. The
National Book Critics Circle hands out its annual awards in March and
the Pulitzers follow a month later.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from their inherent drama and publicity value, do these
prizes really make a difference to the world of letters?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, say leading literary professionals, who believe such awards
not only carry commercial weight, but also play an increasingly
important role in connecting serious writers with readers eager for
qualitative road signs in a world awash in books.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely no question that the prizes make a huge
difference and that awards absolutely translate into sales," said
publisher Morgan Entrekin, whose Grove/Atlantic is one of the
country's major independent literary presses.</TE>
<TE>   "Just being nominated for one of these prizes affords a kind of
indelible seal of legitimacy, especially for a work of fiction,"
literary agent Sandra Dijkstra said. "Whether that seal is ersatz or
real in terms of quality is always debatable, of course. But it's
still indelible."</TE>
<TE>   Entrekin said that his eight years at Grove/Atlantic have provided
one example after another of the prize's particular value to serious,
literary authors. "When I had just taken over in 1994," he recalled,
"we were in the process of repackaging our backlist and the question
arose of what we should do with the Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe. I
said, 'Let's do 3,000 copies, which will give us about four or five
years of inventory the way he sells.'</TE>
<TE>   "Ten days after the books came off the press, he won the Nobel and
we were his only English-language publisher. He went from selling
about 700 books a year to 60,000. Now, for one of the big
conglomerates, that wouldn't be like getting a new John Grisham, but
for a literary publisher, like us, that's a big deal. I'd love to
have Kertesz right now."</TE>
<TE>   Both Dijkstra and Entrekin agree that, for the moment, the
National Book Awards, the Pulitzers and the National Book Critics
Circle exert the strongest pull on readers, and that England's Booker
is coming on strong among Americans, though the competition is open
only to British, Irish and Commonwealth writers.</TE>
<TE>   "We published Charles Frazier's 'Cold Mountain,' " Entrekin said,
"and it was No. 1 on the bestseller lists, when it won the National
Book Award. I'm sure we sold another 200,000 or 300,000 copies in
hardback because of the award."</TE>
<TE>   The Booker's nationally televised awards ceremony has helped give
it the special cachet of a literary Oscar, and England's legal
bookmakers do a substantial business in wagers on the prize.
Thursday, when the official Booker Web site mistakenly posted a draft
press release listing Canadian Yann Martel as this year's winner,
bookmaker William Hill was flooded with so many big bets that it had
to close the book until officials straightened out the mess. Wagering
has now resumed, and this year's odds-on favorite is 74-year-old
Irish author William Trevor.</TE>
<TE>   Dijkstra includes the National Book Critics Circle in what she
calls "the golden ring that creates an enthusiasm factor in a book's
life." Still, she said, "the Booker is having more and more of an
effect here. Many of my friends buy the whole Booker short list
because it's a wonderful way to tip one off to quality fiction. This
year's list is particularly interesting because of all the Canadian
writers [including Rohin Mistry and Carole Shields] and the lack of a
single English writer. It's another example of something you see
around the world -- the colonial tail wagging the cultural dog."</TE>
<TE>   As an example of the Booker's increasing American impact, Entrekin
recalled Grove/Atlantic's experience with Trezza Azzopardi, who was
short-listed for the prize two years ago. "Her novel, 'The Hiding
Place,' is about the Maltese immigrant community in Cardiff,
Wales--not exactly a quick easy U.S. sale," Entrekin said. "When it
made the short list, literary editors assigned reviews. They were
raves, and that made all the difference. We sold 40,000 copies in
hardback and 50,000 in paper. So, just being short-listed gave us a
way to find an audience for that worthy writer."</TE>
<TE>   According to Dijkstra, a place on the National Book Awards' short
list can have a similar impact. "When my client Amy Tan's 'The Joy
Luck Club' was nominated for a National Book Award, I was in New York
for the ceremony. That morning, Amy, her mother and I were having
breakfast at the Plaza Hotel, and I told her, 'You've already won.
The final vote doesn't even matter. Just being selected for the short
list is a victory.' She didn't win that year; there are now more than
4 million copies of 'The Joy Luck Club' in print in this country
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to quantify in advance what a reputation brings,"
Dijkstra said. "That's where these nominations and prizes come in."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, calculations about a prize's value elude even the most
astute literary publishers. One editor, who asked not to be named,
was working at Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux in 1988, when Egyptian novelist
Naguib Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize.</TE>
<TE>   His English-language publisher, the American University Press of
Cairo, knew it lacked the means to market the new laureate in the
United States, so it offered the right of first refusal to Farrar
Straus &amp; Giroux, which publishes more Nobel winners than any other
U.S. house. The list includes Isaac Bashevis Singer, Joseph Brodsky,
Czeslaw Milosz, Nadine Gordimer, Seamus Heaney and Derek Walcott.</TE>
<TE>   Founder and publisher Roger Straus Jr., asked the editor to take
Mahfouz's novels home over the weekend and return Monday with an
opinion on whether to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   "I did so," the editor recalled, "and concluded that, in my
opinion, Mahfouz was ill-served by his various translators. Second,
while his importance to Arab-language literature was inarguable, the
work was, formally speaking, not of the first rank.</TE>
<TE>   "When I told Roger that, he looked hugely relieved and exclaimed,
'Thank God! The last thing this house needs is another ill-selling
Nobel Prize winner. The only one for whom getting that thing ever
made a difference was Singer.'</TE>
<TE>   "So, we turned Mahfouz away," the editor said, "only to have him
scooped up by an editor at Doubleday named Jacqueline Kennedy. She
commissioned masterful new translations and compelling new cover
designs and published him brilliantly and successfully in both
hardcover and paper."</TE>

<HD>Dreams come alive on a bed of whimsy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exploring the fertile border between dream and nightmare, between
circus and multidisciplinary movement theater, the Junebug Symphony,
from France, is most of all a showcase for the unique DNA of
28-year-old James Thierree, its writer, director and star.</LD>
<LD>   Thierree's great-grandfather was Eugene O'Neill, a seminal theater
poet intent on revealing people's deepest natures. His grandfather
was Charlie Chaplin, a comic genius who specialized in showing how
people are undone by the obstacles of the material world. His parents
were pioneer new circus artists in Europe. Great genes, and Thierree
makes the most of them.</LD>
<LD>   At the Freud Playhouse on Thursday (opening night of a
five-performance UCLA run), he and his brilliant colleagues wedded a
hallucinatory theater style related to some of O'Neill's most
experimental plays to a sense of physical comedy akin to some of
Chaplin's most memorable routines. The subject: a sleepless night.
The treatment: deeply whimsical and poetic.</LD>
<TE>   From the moment Thierree gets undressed for bed, the Junebug
Symphony offers one startling display of quick-change stagecraft
after another. After the bed insists on turning into a precipice, and
his body literally falls apart, we find him reading a hot book (we
know it's hot because the pages keep bursting into flame), and
worrying over a portrait of soprano Uma Ysamat that refuses to stay
as painted.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does the portrait's actions confirm all the gossip that
circulates about artists' models, but a walk-in closet also keeps
issuing deafening invitations to dance. And before long, Thierree is
confronting a defiant doppelganger named Magnus Jakobsson with a
penchant for high diving into the wings and a boneless contortionist
named Raphaelle Boitel with a disquieting knack for climbing the
walls.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Thierree's head emits clouds of smoke. On this night, a
door, an armchair and a candelabra all become strange new
environments, and even the potted plants have a will of their own --
not to mention hands and feet.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute stream-of-unconsciousness ends, more or less, at a
beggars' banquet in which the place settings are neatly arranged (and
stuck) on Thierree's body, and the kitchen implements are enlisted as
armor in a battle between a giant rhino and griffin. But not before
we see Thierree roller-blading while playing the violin, cycling
backward at high speed, balancing on a giant sphere, sharing a
gymnast's mat with Jakobsson and a high trapeze with Boitel.</TE>
<TE>   The point: When we leave our bodies (or vice versa) in sleep, we
can do anything, and even if our imaginations run away with us, they
release a sense of untapped potential -- the realization of all those
illusions about ourselves that O'Neill called pipe dreams and that
Thierree physicalizes with Chaplinesque flair. His performance is
thus not merely funny and amazing, but also life-affirming because he
can do waking just about everything we can do only in fantasy. And
for that he deserves all the riches, renown and acclaim this grim
little world can bestow.</TE>
<TE>   At once the name of a performing company and its current vehicle,
the Junebug Symphony provides more evidence about the reinvention of
Western theater and concert dance by the same kinds of wandering
popular entertainers who started the whole thing to begin with. If
only our political leaders were as accomplished and inspired in their
way as Thierree is in his, the future would be secure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

4 p.m., Freud Playhouse at UCLA. $15 (students) to $40 (half-price

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Truman Capote once said that the world will never let a beautiful
woman starve, and in Sunday's 9 p.m. premiere of the made-for-CBS
movie "Dancing at the Harvest Moon," Jacqueline Bisset's character
proves that the planet's weakness for a pretty face apparently hasn't
changed a whit.</LD>
<LD>   Bisset, 58, hasn't changed much either. Although her poster-girl
days from movies such as "The Deep" are decades past, we don't blink
an eye when she's introduced as a 40ish professor named Maggie, whose
world is about to fall apart.</LD>
<LD>   A chance trip home in the middle of the day results in Maggie's
finding her husband of nearly 25 years nuzzling a co-worker on the
family's front walk. Although Maggie is stunned, a friend later
consoles her with the fact that the law-practicing Lothario has
"dipped into the paralegal pool" with regularity over the years.</LD>
<TE>   With her marriage finished, Maggie packs up and moves to the
idyllic lakefront community where she spent summers as a youth, where
she found first love while working at a charming dance hall called
the Harvest Moon.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, she learns that her old beau is dead, and the dance hall
isn't nearly as well preserved as Maggie. But she becomes determined
to restore the Harvest Moon, and a banker throws all business
practices out the window to help her fund the project. Soon the
townspeople, who have ignored the dilapidated hall for years, are
volunteering their time to the restoration. Valerie Harper, as
Maggie's long-ago best friend Claire, provides support in her best
"Rhoda" mode.</TE>
<TE>   But it's when Maggie meets her ex-boyfriend's son (Eric Mabius)
that things really get interesting and, in a weird way, almost
incestuous. Can a romance possibly work? Never underestimate the
power of the Harvest Moon.</TE>

<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eyebrows might rise at the prospect of traditional African music
adapted to a quintet of English classical, jazz and folk musicians
using mostly European instruments. Leave it to the great guitarist
John Williams to find the right cross-cultural balance. At the Irvine
Barclay Theatre on Thursday, as on the CD "Magic Box," Williams and
his group captured an African-rooted spirit in a prime example of
sensitive musical adaptation.</LD>
<LD>   Williams has obviously done his homework, bringing a smart and
affectionate approach to a vast subject. For this evening's program,
Williams focused on West African countries. At the group's center
were Williams, a model of clarity on classical guitar, and John
Etheridge on steel string, a looser player with jazz and folk
instincts. The textural blend of gut and steel string was
synergistic. A sure sign of success is that this listener basked in
the group's present pleasures and felt driven to re-explore the
musical sources.</LD>

<HD>J&amp;J Told to Pay Damages to Amgen</HD>
<DH>An arbitrator makes a $150-million ruling in a licensing
dispute over a bestselling anemia drug. The award is much less than
the amount sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending a long-running feud over the world's most successful
biotechnology drug, a federal arbitrator Friday ordered Johnson &amp;
Johnson to pay Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks $150 million in damages
for poaching its rival's dialysis business.</LD>
<LD>   The award by retired federal Judge Frank McGarr fell far short of
the $1.2 billion Amgen demanded from J&amp;J for violating a 1985
licensing contract that stands out as one of the most contentious in
the litigious biotechnology industry.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen also failed to persuade McGarr to terminate the licensing
pact, which splits the multibillion market for the anemia drug EPO.</LD>
<TE>   As a young company, Amgen retained the rights to sell EPO to
dialysis patients in the U.S., then considered the most lucrative
portion of the market for the drug. Amgen sold J&amp;J exclusive rights
to all other markets for the drug in the United States and Europe,
including chemotherapy patients. As it happened, the largest market
for EPO turned out to be for cancer patients, the business controlled
exclusively by J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after reaching the agreement, the firms began quarreling
and have ended up in arbitration four times. The bickering continued
after McGarr's binding decision was issued Friday, with both sides
claiming victory. J&amp;J and Amgen said they would try to force the
other to pay attorney's fees.</TE>
<TE>   At stake is the $7-billion market for EPO, a genetically
engineered copy of the human protein that spurs red blood cell
production. Friday's arbitration decision stems from a 1995 lawsuit
by Amgen claiming that J&amp;J intentionally sold EPO to dialysis
patients in the early 1990s. J&amp;J said such isolated sales did occur
but were stopped when discovered by J&amp;J in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Friday's arbitration was anticlimactic given that
Amgen last year introduced a second-generation form of EPO, called
Aranesp, to reclaim business it long ago ceded to J&amp;J. Amgen launched
Aranesp after arbitrators in 1998 denied J&amp;J's contention that
Aranesp, as a version of EPO, was covered by the 1985 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen in the third quarter is expected to report sales of about
$100 million for Aranesp and close to $590 million for EPO. J&amp;J
reported $1 billion in EPO sales in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the overall dispute, Amgen has been the most
successful," said Farbia Ghodsian, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ghodsian said the award would not have a significant monetary
effect on either firm.Friday's arbitration news was announced after
stock markets closed. Shares of Amgen rose to $50.80 in after-hours
trading after closing at $50.48, up 33 cents, in regular Nasdaq
trading. J&amp;J shares fell to $59 in after-hours trading after closing
at $59.35, down 85 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>She Holds the Cards in Copyright Fight</HD>
<DH>An official in an obscure agency will help define 'fair
use' in the digital age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Library of Congress, home to about 18 million books, many dating
back to the mid-19th century, might be the last place you'd expect to
find somebody at the center of one of the hottest debates of the
digital era.</LD>
<LD>   But Marybeth Peters, who for 38 years has labored away in the U.S.
Copyright Office, an obscure arm of the library, is serving as
referee in the battle between entertainment firms that are trying to
control the copying and piracy of their content, and technology
companies and consumers eager to explore new conveniences offered by
the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Internet radio stations were scheduled to start paying
music royalties to record labels, threatening an untold number of
small Webcasters that couldn't afford the controversial fee imposed
by the Library of Congress. Record companies Friday agreed to defer
most of the royalties they're owed, temporarily defusing that issue.</LD>
<TE>   But Internet radio is just one of many areas of debate in which
Copyright Register Peters and her office will play a big role. As the
federal government's top expert on copyright law, she will have a
significant influence on how people can download music, tape TV
programs and copy or sell e-books.</TE>
<TE>   Her agency recently declared that consumers -- who are free to
sell books and CDs that they have legally acquired -- should have no
such rights when it comes to e-books or digital music.</TE>
<TE>   And the Copyright Office has denied virtually every request by
librarians, educators and consumers seeking exceptions to the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. The law makes it a crime to bypass
copy-protection devices in CDs, DVDs and other digital products, even
to make a legally permissible copy.</TE>
<TE>   Peters believes that many "fair-use" practices consumers take for
granted, such as taping a TV program or copying a magazine article,
need to be reevaluated in the digital age because the economic harm
to copyright owners is far greater. For instance, she agrees with
court rulings that Napster-style song swapping over the Internet is
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the activities you tolerate in a non-digital world are
because of the inefficiency of making the copy, how the copy is
degraded, and the difficulty in sending copies to someone beyond
yourself," Peters said. "All of those things go away in a digital
environment."</TE>
<TE>   As Congress has deferred some of the stickiest questions to the
Copyright Office, Peters finds herself in the uncomfortable position
of having to set many of the ground rules for the digital age and, in
some ways, pick the winners.</TE>
<TE>   "They are more at the center of controversies over money than ever
before," said Ralph Oman, former head of the Copyright Office.</TE>
<TE>   Peters and her staff are housed in a dimly lighted building
originally designed to hold stacks of books. Old-fashioned shelves of
card catalog trays, holding the listings of millions of books in the
Library of Congress, fill the rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The Copyright Office was founded in 1870 to expedite the
restocking of the Library of Congress after most of its books were
burned in the War of 1812. Each year, the office registers about half
a million new books, plays, poems, motion pictures, photographs,
sculptures and software.</TE>
<TE>   Peters, 63, a former high school teacher who started as a music
examiner at the Copyright Office, worked her way up after attending
George Washington University Law School at night. She concedes that
the Copyright Office is struggling to keep pace with the new
rule-making duties.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress keeps giving us things to do, and some of them have
taken over our lives," Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s -- against the wishes of many in Peters' office,
she said -- Congress gave the agency responsibility for resolving
disputes over royalties and compulsory licenses, such as how much
satellite TV providers must pay broadcasters or how much Web radio
stations should pay music companies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, lawmakers surprised the Copyright Office by giving it
regulatory authority every three years to make exceptions to the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention law for those
who can show they are being unfairly harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Peters was amazed by the public reaction to her agency's new job.
In 2000, protesters picketed outside the Library of Congress to push
for broader exemptions to the DMCA.</TE>
<TE>   The Copyright Office is now dealing with the next
anti-circumvention proceeding, which is expected to be especially
contentious. The proceeding is likely be completed by next year.</TE>
<TE>   Some worry that the Copyright Office is too closely aligned with
the interests of copyright owners. "The Copyright Office has acted
like the tool of large business concerns for a couple of decades
now," said William Goldsmith, owner of a Web-based radio station in
Paradise, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The royalty fees, he says, would force him to pay $5,000 a month
in royalties, though he collects only $4,000 in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Many also point to a "revolving door" between the Copyright Office
and the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking with tradition, Peters hired several advisors from the
copyright industry. Two came from a New York law firm that
represented movie studios and publishers, including Steven Spielberg,
Doubleday and adult magazine publisher Larry Flynt.</TE>
<TE>   Peters denies any bias on her staff, noting the difficulties in
finding qualified experts on a government salary -- which tops out at
about $138,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that people worked here their whole life, people
like me," she said. "I don't think that's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   But Peters concedes that she tends to side most often with
creators and copyright owners.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is more with the individual author," she said. "If you
look away from the person who really is the genius, the spark, then I
think you lose sight about what copyright is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Such views have sparked criticism from librarians, digital rights
groups and academics who say the Copyright Office has lost sight of
the consumer and is too preoccupied with the commercial values of
corporate copyright owners.</TE>
<TE>   Though Peters' support for the rights of creators sometimes aligns
her with entertainment and media giants, she points to numerous
battles she waged against industry interests.</TE>
<TE>   She sided with freelance writers against the New York Times in a
Supreme Court battle over reproduction rights of articles loaded into
electronic databases.</TE>
<TE>   She opposed music companies that wanted to levy royalties twice on
streaming or downloading music, arguing that charging for the
temporary copies made during the process amounted to double-dipping.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say her recent decisions and recommendations on
digital issues threaten to restrict consumers and make it easier for
entertainment companies to charge for activities that are currently
free, such as taping a song or movie for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   Peters says she strives to be fair and consider all viewpoints but
is limited by statutes set by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Some would like to see Peters become more active in negotiating a
truce in the copyright battle. But she said that is not her role,
unless Congress asks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've offered on more than one occasion to take on an assignment
from Congress to try to get the parties together to see if they could
come up with some guidelines for uses under the fair-use doctrine,"
Peters said. "Nobody took us up on it."</TE>

<HD>Trade Deficit Hits Record $38.5 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. trade deficit soared nearly 10% in August as the value of
imports jumped on higher oil prices and as firms stockpiled foreign
goods amid a labor dispute at West Coast ports, government data
showed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The trade gap mushroomed to a record $38.5 billion in August from
$35.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said. Exports fell for
the first time in six months, and demand for foreign consumer goods
pushed imports to their highest level since March 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "We bought an awful lot more of everything in August, but
unfortunately the rest of the world didn't reciprocate," said Joel
Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the larger trade gap may exert a drag on gross
domestic product growth in the third quarter, but many other analysts
are still projecting a strong rate of GDP expansion, about 4%.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the Labor Department showed U.S. inflation
was tame in September, with consumer prices rising only 0.2% overall
and 0.1% in the closely watched core component that strips out food
and energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   The trade gap exceeded the average forecast of $35.6 billion that
analysts gave ahead of the Commerce Department report. Excluding the
U.S. surplus for services trade, the deficit for goods was $42.3
billion, also a record.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts worry that the growing deficit in the current account,
the broadest measure of trade because it also includes investment
flows, is at risk of a disorderly correction that could trigger a
slide in the dollar's value.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials repeatedly have dismissed this worry, calling the
gap a sign of the United States' economic strength and its appeal to
foreign investors.</TE>

<HD>Guilty Plea Fuels Power Crisis Probe</HD>
<DH>With former Enron exec's aid, prosecutors say they will
indict his co-conspirators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman and Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities issued a warning Friday that executives at Enron
Corp. and other companies that may have manipulated California's
power market are in serious peril now that a former top Enron
official has admitted conspiring to inflate prices.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. Kevin Ryan said the negotiated guilty plea of former
Enron Vice President Timothy N. Belden on Thursday was a major
breakthrough in a swift-moving, 4-month-old investigation to
determine whether crimes were committed during the state's 2000-2001
energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan said Belden's admissions and his cooperation with federal
investigators would offer an important "window into the upper
management of Enron," which was a leading player in the state's power
market until the Houston-based company declared bankruptcy late last
year.</LD>
<TE>   "He did not act without the help and approval of others," Ryan
said at a news conference. "To Mr. Belden's co-conspirators, and they
know who they are, they should be very concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials declined to say whether their investigation has
turned up evidence that other companies adopted the trading
strategies that Enron allegedly employed, or conspired with Enron to
drive up prices in the wholesale energy market. And they refused to
say whether Belden's former supervisors at Enron, including former
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K.
Skilling, are targets of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at the individuals who were part of the
decision-making process," said FBI spokesman Andrew P. Black. "And if
they are shown to be part of this [conspiracy], they will be
indicted."</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said only that the company is
cooperating with all investigations. Lawyers for Lay, Skilling and
former President Lawrence G. Whalley said their clients have nothing
to fear from the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The companies that sold power to California during its energy
crisis -- including AES Corp., Calpine Corp., Duke Energy Corp.,
Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp., Reliant Resources Inc. and Williams Cos.
-- have denied using manipulative trading ploys or withholding
electricity to drive up prices.</TE>
<TE>   "We conduct our business in California and elsewhere above board,
appropriately and with integrity," said Pat Mullen, a spokesman for
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, which owns several power plants in
California.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's news conference, federal prosecutors and the FBI
offered the most detailed description yet of their ongoing
investigation into Enron's role in California's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office and the FBI office in San Francisco
received a referral from the Justice Department's Enron task force in
May after federal energy regulators released memos and other
documents in which Enron attorneys described trading ploys to inflate
prices. The documents indicate that other companies were assisting
Enron or imitating its trading tactics.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in August opened
investigations into the trading behavior of Enron subsidiary Portland
General Electric Co. as well as Spokane, Wash.-based Avista Corp. and
El Paso Electric Co. after FERC staff found evidence that the
companies may have assisted Enron in its illicit trading practices.
The companies have denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said about 10 FBI agents and analysts were assigned to
the case, and they found that Enron's power-trading operation in the
West and headed by Belden generated $800 million last year, up from
about $50 million in revenue in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Although they did not specify how much of those revenues were
illegally generated, federal officials pointed to the jump in the
price of wholesale power -- from $24 to $40 a megawatt-hour in May
2000 to as high as $1,500 several months later.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the impact on the good people of the state of California,"

<HD>Another Winning Week on Wall St.</HD>
<DH>Despite some profit taking, October rally continues amid
positive shift in earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Momentum from Wall Street's continuing rally helped stocks preserve
their recent gains Friday and gave the major market indexes their
second straight winning week -- the first such streak in two months.</LD>
<LD>   The gain was surprising given stocks' recent big ride, which sent
the Dow Jones industrials soaring more than 1,000 points since
hitting a five-year low Oct. 9. Analysts expected the market to give
up more ground.</LD>
<LD>   "We have gone from being extremely oversold to very overbought. It
is due for a rest," said Brian Bush, director of equity research at
Stephens Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow closed up 47.36 points, or 0.6%, at 8,322.40 after having
fallen as much as 127 points early on. In the last seven sessions,
the Dow has climbed 1,036 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose
15.57 points, or 1.2%, to 1,287.86. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
advanced 5.19 points, or 0.6%, to 884.39.</TE>
<TE>   Winners and losers were about even on the New York Stock Exchange
and Nasdaq amid weak trading volume.</TE>
<TE>   All three indexes had their second consecutive winning week,
something they last accomplished in the two weeks that ended Aug. 24.
The Dow finished the week up 6%, while Nasdaq rose 6.4% and the S&amp;P
500 climbed 5.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Traders and investors said the stock market rally has been
underpinned by evidence that third-quarter corporate earnings were
better than expected. More than 60% of the S&amp;P 500 companies that
have reported quarterly results so far have beaten analysts'
estimates, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have finally begun to see is a strong, positive shift in
earnings," Diane Garnick, global investment strategist at State
Street Global Advisors, told Bloomberg News. "The change from an
earnings depression to a slight earnings recovery is making it much
more optimistic for equities."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Microsoft rose $2.38 to $53.15, having announced
earnings late Thursday that were 7 cents a share higher than
analysts' estimates. Avon jumped $3.60 to $49.79 on third-quarter
earnings that beat expectations by a penny a share. And Merck
advanced 28 cents to $51.03 after meeting expectations and
reaffirming its 2002 forecast calling for flat results.</TE>
<TE>   But the advance was curbed by profit taking. Shares of companies
that posted better-than-expected earnings results this week, such as
General Motors and Johnson &amp; Johnson, fell as investors cashed in
some gains. GM fell $1.09 to $34.31, while J&amp;J declined 85 cents to
$59.35.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields fell as investors took advantage of rates that had
risen to seven-week highs. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield
slid to 4.11% from Thursday's close of 4.20%. Still, the 10-year
T-note yield had its biggest weekly surge since March as the S&amp;P 500
climbed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had over a 100-point rally in the S&amp;P, and that's gotten
the bond market's attention," said Gary Pzegeo, a fixed-income
manager at Gannett Welsh &amp; Kotler. "What we've seen in the market is
an indication of change in sentiment" and a flight from bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar had its sixth weekly gain in seven against the yen on
signs the U.S. economic recovery is boosting corporate profits. The
greenback also had its third weekly advance in four against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. will show itself to be the best place to invest," said
Jeremy Fand, a strategist at Friedberg Mercantile Group. "The
dollar's going to get stronger."</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Dodges Defaulting on Loan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eleventh-hour reprieve kept San Francisco-based PG&amp;E Corp. from
defaulting on a $420-million loan, as the company announced late
Friday that it had renegotiated the terms and picked up $300 million
more in financing.</LD>
<LD>   Lenders had given the corporation until Friday to deal with a
requirement of the loan -- that the company's power generating and
trading subsidiary maintain an investment-grade credit rating.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than regaining investment status, the subsidiary's credit
rating was further downgraded Friday by Moody's Investors Service.
However, the requirement was removed as part of the renegotiation.
Absent a deal or another extension, the company would have been in
default.</LD>
<TE>   After the markets closed, the company announced that the loan
agreement would provide the corporation with "ample liquidity
resources to fund its operations through at least 2006, when the loan
matures."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of PG&amp;E rose 30 cents Friday to $9.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company's Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. utility is
operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. It serves about 14
million customers in Northern and Central California.</TE>
<TE>   The deal provided a bright spot for PG&amp;E, which on Friday saw the
credit rating for the National Energy Group cut from B1 to B3 -- six
levels below investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's cited NEG's low cash flow, the impending expiration of a
revolving credit facility and its plans to stop paying for a major
construction project.</TE>
<TE>   NEG's line of credit with 16 lenders, which are owed $431 million,
is set to expire Monday. The company is "continuing to negotiate with
lenders on that to reach some kind of long-term resolution," said
Brian Hertzog, a corporate spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Without a deal, he said, "the facility would mature and the money
would be due."</TE>

<HD>Ports Are Slow to Make Dent in Backlog of Cargo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a week after a federal injunction forced the reopening of
West Coast ports, the supply chain from Asia to the middle of America
is still snarled badly enough to close factories, cause retailers to
fret and drive truckers to despair.</LD>
<LD>   Honda announced Friday that it was halting production at four Ohio
plants for the weekend to allow parts to build up in the automaker's
supply line.</LD>
<LD>   About 9,000 containers filled with holiday toys, lights and other
goods are stuck on a dock in Ensenada, Mexico, where they were
diverted at the start of the 10-day lockout, said Armando Freire,
owner of San Diego-based Dimex Freight Systems.</LD>
<TE>   The prospects of all the goods reaching stores shelves by the
holidays are slim because only a few hundred containers are moving
north a day in caravans guarded by the Mexican army, Freire said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, more ships than ever are waiting to unload their
cargos. "We've got over 122 outside today," said Capt. Dick McKenna
of the Marine Exchange, which monitors ship movements in the Los
Angeles-Long Beach port complex. "Since the lockout ended, we've had
42 go out and 43 come in."</TE>
<TE>   Among the goods on those ships, according to truckers and
logistics planners, are 10 containers full of Halloween candles and a
load of disposable cameras meant to be handed out at the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect when this is all over you'll see a lot of these
products end up in the 99-cent stores," said Dan Sanker, chief
executive of CaseStack Logistics of Los Angeles, which handles
product movement for small and medium manufacturers and suppliers.
"That's going to hurt some manufacturers significantly."</TE>
<TE>   With terminal yards jammed at the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, truckers who are paid by the haul are waiting for up to five
hours to drop off or pick up containers, cutting their normal income
by a third or more.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's holding on for now, because at least they're
working," said Stephanie Williams, spokeswoman for the California
Trucking Assn. "But pretty soon I think we'll start seeing some
bankruptcies."</TE>
<TE>   Eager to get transpacific shipping back to normal, many shipping
lines have had vessels drop all U.S.-bound cargo at their first port
of call, such as Los Angeles, rather take the containers on to final
destinations in Oakland, Seattle or other ports that also are jammed.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to pick up those stranded containers on a later trip
and drop them off at the other U.S. ports when the logjam eased. To
accommodate the shipping lines, the U.S. Customs Service temporarily
waived the 1920s-era Jones Act that prohibits foreign-flagged ships
from picking up cargo at one U.S. port and delivering it to another
one, said Vera Adams, Customs Service port director for Los Angeles
and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The act was intended to protect the U.S. shipping industry from
foreign competition. In reality, however, nearly all container
vessels are now foreign flagged.</TE>
<TE>   A week after granting the waiver, the Customs Service reconsidered
and revoked it on Oct. 11, Adams said. By then, 19 vessels already
had taken advantage of the waiver, she said.</TE>
<TE>   International Longshore and Warehouse Union spokesman Steve
Stallone called the waiver "one more example of government-employer
collusion to solve the employers' problems."</TE>
<TE>   The union maintains that the Bush administration favored the
Pacific Maritime Assn. representing shipping lines and terminal
operators when it invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to
reopen following the association's lockout.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides blame each other for the slow pace of recovery since
the ports reopened Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping group said the union was staging work slowdowns to
gain leverage in contract talks, while the union said the slow pace
was due to logistics problems and employer mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   The longshore union itself suffered a strategic blow Friday when
the international presidents of four other unions announced to their
members they could not support the ILWU in its contract fight because
of territorial disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The letter from presidents of the Machinists, Iron Workers,
Operating Engineers and Seafarers unions, said the longshore union's
contract proposal "attempts to usurp and thwart the legitimate
jurisdiction" of the four unions and would lead to a loss of jobs and
membership. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka had attempted
to head off the rare public confrontation a month ago, but the unions
could not reach an agreement.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. settled a lawsuit filed by Walgreen Co.,
Safeway Inc. and other chain pharmacies over its efforts to block
generic competition to its anti-anxiety drug BuSpar.</LD>
<LD>   J.C. Penney Co.'s Eckerd drugstores, Kroger Co. and Albertson's
Inc. also were plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in New York in April.
Bristol-Myers is in talks to settle a similar group of lawsuits filed
by consumers. A company spokesman said details are confidential.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits accused the New York-based drug maker of improperly
using patents to block competition to buspirone, the active
ingredient in BuSpar. As a result, the pharmacies said, they were
forced to sell a higher-priced version of buspirone from 1995 to
2001. Bristol-Myers has said its actions were lawful.</LD>

<LD>The Boeing Co.-United Technologies Corp. Comanche helicopter program
has been cut almost in half by the Pentagon, according to documents.</LD>
<LD>   Under Secretary for Acquisition Edward "Pete" Aldridge signed the
paperwork that directs the Army to limit quantities to 650 from
1,207, according to a summary released by the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   The program was to cost $47 billion if 1,207 helicopters were
bought. The Army has spent $5.2 billion to date and estimates the
first Comanches will be ready for combat in September 2009, three
years behind the current schedule.</LD>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. must face a lawsuit by the University of California
accusing the software maker of using patented technology without
permission in its Web browser, a U.S. court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel rejected Microsoft's bid to
dismiss the suit, ruling that too many issues are in dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The university system and Eolas Technologies Inc. sued Microsoft
in 1999, claiming infringement of a patented method that allows a Web
browser to access an interactive application program. Microsoft
argued that its Internet Explorer didn't work the way the patent
described.</LD>

<HD>New Accountant for Winnie the Pooh Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled that a new
independent accountant must review Walt Disney Co. records before
proceedings continue in the 11-year dispute over Winnie the Pooh
merchandise royalties.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige threw out a previous
accountant's findings about how much Disney owed Shirley Slesinger
Lasswell and her daughter Patricia Slesinger because of bias
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The judge had devised his own formula but Disney lawyers alleged
that method would wrongly require Disney to pay about $200 million.
Hiroshige on Friday set aside his formula and said he would wait for
recommendations from a new accountant. The ruling probably will delay
the long-awaited trial, which was scheduled for March.</LD>

<HD>PS2 Net Adapter Sales Are Strong</HD>
<DH>Retailers say they're having a hard time keeping the device
for Sony consoles in stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing games online has become surprisingly popular among owners of
Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2, boding well for the industry's ambitions
to turn video game consoles into gateways for selling music, movies
and other digital wares.</LD>
<LD>   To connect PS2s to the Internet, gamers must buy $40 adapters,
which started selling in August and unexpectedly have become a scarce
commodity.</LD>
<LD>   A sampling of 25 Southern California stores earlier this week
found 24 were sold out of the device. Clerks, who said they've had to
turn customers away, report that the adapters sell out as quickly as
they arrive.</LD>
<TE>   Though people have been able to play online games on their
computers for years, they've only recently been able to take their
consoles online. Online games, including consoles, could be a
$2-billion-a-year industry by 2005, according to IDC. For players,
these connections could bring new games, new levels of play and even
new opponents. For media companies like Sony, consoles represent a
conduit for delivering entertainment directly to customers' living
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives thought only hard-core gamers would embrace
online console games at this early stage. Sony shipped just 100,000
adapters to U.S. stores this summer. For this holiday season, it's
only producing 400,000 for the U.S. market, a fraction of the 11
million PS2s in use nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Sony executives said they're surprised how quickly the adapter is
selling and plan to boost production. The device, the size of a large
deck of cards, screws onto the back of the PS2 and has a dial-up
modem and an Ethernet port for high-speed Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   "I must say we are a little bit overwhelmed by consumer interest,"
said Andrew House, executive vice president of Sony Computer
Entertainment of America, the U.S. arm of Sony's PlayStation
division. "We are doing everything possible to increase production
capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Game publishers also were taken by surprise. Electronic Arts Inc.
said 195,000 people have signed up to play its "Madden Football 2003"
online via their PS2s since the title launched in August. That
translates to more than one in 10 players who bought the game's PS2
version.</TE>
<TE>   "These are pretty active accounts," said Frank Gibeau, vice
president of marketing for Redwood City, Calif.-based EA. "We have a
guy who's played 500 games already, and it takes about half an hour
to play a single game."</TE>
<TE>   Players of Sega Corp.'s "NFL2K3" football and "NBA2K3" basketball
games for PS2 also have shown high interest in finding online
opponents. One in five purchasers of those titles currently play
online, said Tom Nichols, vice president of sports marketing for
Sega.</TE>
<TE>   The initial feedback augurs well for the launch next month of
Microsoft Corp.'s online game network, Xbox Live.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts caution against irrational exuberance. Early
buyers tend to be technophiles rather than mainstream consumers, and
once they have bought their fill of adapters, sales could drop off.</TE>
<TE>   "While there's some enthusiasm for playing online, it remains to
be seen when that will catch on as a mass market opportunity," said
P.J. McNealy, an analyst with research firm Gartner Inc.</TE>

<HD>UAL Records Massive Loss</HD>
<DH>The parent firm of United Airlines loses $889 million in
the third quarter but says it is near a pact on wage cuts and
concessions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines parent UAL Corp. posted a massive third-quarter loss
of $889 million on Friday but said it was nearing a pact with its
unions on employee concessions to help the carrier get a federally
backed loan and fly clear of Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   However, some analysts maintained that United's effort would fall
short and that the nation's second-largest airline, behind AMR
Corp.'s American, still is headed for Chapter 11 proceedings. Their
rationale: United will face a crippling cash crunch before it gets
the loan.</LD>
<LD>   United, the largest airline at Los Angeles International Airport
in passenger traffic, said it's working toward a "quick resolution"
with its five major unions on combined wage cuts and other
concessions totaling $5.8 billion over five years. With the plan
nearly in hand, United said it would file an amended application next
week for the loan guarantee with the Air Transportation Stabilization
Board, the federal panel overseeing the $15-billion bailout of the
airlines that followed the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The ATSB is demanding substantial concessions from airline
workers, creditors and vendors before granting loan guarantees that
might put U.S. taxpayers' money at risk if the airline defaults.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, nobody should consider a Chapter 11 filing
inevitable," UAL Chairman Glenn Tilton said. Under Chapter 11, a
company continues to operate but its debts are frozen while it works
out a restructuring plan. Tilton and other UAL executives declined to
elaborate; the airline postponed its quarterly conference calls with
analysts and the media until its recovery plan is in place.</TE>
<TE>   But UAL did warn that the deep travel slump would leave the
airline, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., with "a significant
fourth-quarter and full-year loss."</TE>
<TE>   The six largest U.S. airlines this week reported combined
quarterly losses of $2.2 billion, and the red ink is expected to
surpass $7 billion for all of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's third-quarter loss, equal to $15.57 a share, was narrower
than its loss of $1.16 billion, or $21.43 a share, a year earlier,
when the attacks occurred. UAL's revenue tumbled 9% to $3.7 billion,
from $4.1 billion in the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Like most other airlines, United is responding by slashing costs
and shrinking its size. The carrier said its system -- or capacity --
in the current quarter is 16% less than its level two years ago.
United said it's planning unspecified cuts in capacity next year
"until this mismatch of supply and demand is corrected."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Jim Higgins of Credit Suisse First Boston, who has a
"sell" rating on UAL's battered stock, again said in a report to
clients that UAL probably is headed for bankruptcy. Though United has
about $2 billion in cash, he said the airline faces nearly $1 billion
in debt payments in coming weeks and is burning through $7 million in
cash daily.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's shares fell 2 cents to $1.71 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wall Street now values the entire airline at $98 million, less than
the price of a new wide-body jetliner.</TE>

<HD>Webcasters Saved From High Royalties</HD>
<DH>Legislative relief stalls in the Senate, but record labels
give small Internet stations a break by deferring most of what is
owed them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Record companies agreed Friday to defer most of the royalties they're
owed by small Internet radio broadcasters after Congress failed to
pass a bill authorizing a discount for those stations.</LD>
<LD>   The move by the Recording Industry Assn. of America saves a number
of small Webcasting businesses from certain doom Sunday, when four
years' worth of back royalties would have been due. Although the
labels and artists are entitled to collect tens of thousands of
dollars from popular small Webcasters, the RIAA asked each station
simply to make a down payment of $2,500 or less.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, a wide array of Webcasters and over-the-air
broadcasters remained unhappy and continued to press for change. They
still want Congress to overhaul the way royalties are set.</LD>
<TE>   In last-minute maneuverings Thursday, former broadcaster Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) raised an objection that derailed a bill for
small Webcasters passed by the House this month, according to sources
who backed the bill. As a result, the Senate recessed without voting
on the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Helms spokesman Joe Lanier said the senator didn't want the Senate
"rubber-stamping a bill written by the recording industry in the dead
of night." Several religious broadcasters and other Webcasters from
North Carolina were "very unhappy they did not have a voice in the
process," Lanier said, adding that the bill's proposed royalties were
exorbitant.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute centers on the royalties that Internet broadcasters
must pay to labels and artists for the songs they transmit. The rates
were supposed to be based on the deals individual Internet stations
had struck privately with the record labels.</TE>
<TE>   But only one such royalty agreement qualified: a deal between the
RIAA and online powerhouse Yahoo Inc. It became the basis for the
rates set in July by the librarian of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Small Webcasters said the rates, which amounted to $100 per year
per listener, were ruinously high in light of the prolonged
advertising slump. They predicted that free Webcasts, once
commonplace on the Internet, would all but vanish as only media
conglomerates would be able to offer them.</TE>
<TE>   In response to pleas from small Webcasters, House Judiciary
Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) pushed a bill
through the House that called for royalties of 8% to 12% of a
Webcaster's revenue or 5% to 7% of its expenses, whichever is higher.
It also required annual minimum fees of $2,000 to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the librarian of Congress had set royalties for
commercial Webcasters at 0.07 cent per song per listener, regardless
of how little revenue they had raised.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would apply to Webcasters with less than $1 million in
revenue since November 1998 and whose revenue remains below $500,000
in 2003 and $1.25 million in 2004. Those eligibility limits would put
some mid-size companies in a bind: too large to qualify for the
discounted rates but not big enough to attract the advertising needed
to cover the per-song fees.</TE>
<TE>   Webcaster David Landis, founder of Los Angeles-based station
Ultimate-80s.com, said the rates for small Webcasters were "extremely
expensive, but the alternative is far more detrimental." Without the
discount provided in the legislation, he said, he'd owe $25,000 in
back royalties for two years of Webcasting. With the bill, he said,
he'd owe about $7,000.</TE>
<TE>   When the bill foundered, the RIAA decided Friday to ask for only a
portion of the royalties as "another example of our commitment to the
Webcasting industry," said John L. Simson, executive director of the
RIAA's royalties unit.</TE>
<TE>   Although the RIAA is still eager to see the bill pass, critics --
including college radio stations and Webcasting hobbyists -- want
more relief.</TE>
<TE>   Some large Webcasters, the National Assn. of Broadcasters and
religious broadcasters also are seeking changes to ensure that the
provisions for small Webcasters wouldn't affect their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the strongest proponents were artists' unions and trade
groups, who are slated to receive 50% of the royalties paid by
Webcasters. The bill would put that split, which was originally
mandated by federal regulations and contracts, into federal law.</TE>

<AU>James Scott Bell</AU>
<BD>James Scott Bell is a writer and novelist in Los
Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The country was rightly repulsed at the videotape of Madelyne Toogood
beating her 4-year-old child in an Indiana parking lot. We know such
mistreatment can have a terrible effect on a child's mental health.
But how many Americans indulge in a worse form of abuse without a
second thought? I'm talking about taking kids to the movies. The
wrong movies.</LD>
<LD>   The other night I saw "Red Dragon," the third installment in the
Hannibal Lecter series starring Anthony Hopkins. When the bad guy
(Ralph Fiennes) bites off the tongue of a screaming reporter, then
stands up, mouth bloody, and spits out the offending organ, I
squirmed in my seat. What I couldn't stop thinking about, however,
was the little girl in the seat in front of me.</LD>
<LD>   She looked about 6 years old. I'd seen her waltz into the theater
with her parents, tub of popcorn in hand, chirpy voice yakking it up
excitedly. Two hours of mayhem ensued. People stabbed, set on fire,
tortured. Your average day at the office for serial killers. Every
now and then I'd lean over and see the little girl with her eyes
fixed to the screen.</LD>
<TE>   How times have changed. I remember going to the drive-in with my
parents in the early 1960s. Then, about the worst thing you'd see
onscreen was Godzilla stomping through screaming crowds in Tokyo, or
Frankie Avalon pretending to surf. On occasion my mom put her hand
over my eyes to keep me from seeing something she deemed too scary.</TE>
<TE>   Now we have kids watching slashers, rapists and cannibals because
Mommy can't be bothered with finding a baby-sitter, or Daddy is so
clueless he doesn't see the difference between Disney and
disemboweling.</TE>
<TE>   After the movie, I waited outside the theater. I wanted to take a
look at the happy trio as they emerged from this uplifting bloodbath.
I wanted to glare at them, in fact. The little girl was being carried
by the father. She was frozen. Her face was pale, her eyes wide. She
looked like she was in shock.</TE>
<TE>   Children are not just bodies that hurt when they're hit by the
likes of Madelyne Toogood. They are souls, spirits in formation, for
whom exposure to vile images does enormous damage. We used to believe
in a long term of innocence for our kids, in protecting them from
input only adults are wired to handle.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year study by Joanne Cantor, a professor at the University of
Wisconsin, a recognized expert on children and the mass media and
author of the book "Mommy, I'm Scared," concluded that disturbing
images on television can lead to severe fright reactions that last
for years, or a "deadening of emotional responsiveness ... toward
violence." Movies are, of course, much more intense than TV.</TE>
<TE>   We think children should be protected from secondhand smoke but
don't give a rip (you'll pardon the expression) if they're exposed to
ritual murder and grotesque violence.</TE>
<TE>   I'll never forget going to see one of the teen slasher movies that
was all the rage a few years ago. There was a 5- or 6-year-old boy in
the theater with his parents. The movie had knives thrust into
skulls, screams of tormented murder victims, all manner of gruesome
death.</TE>
<TE>   We need to stigmatize this parental choice. If I could have
captured the little girl's face on video after "Red Dragon," we'd
have another national call for social services to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   The solution is not that difficult. Have a small child? Think
"G-rated." Or stay home. Rent "VeggieTales" or "Beauty and the
Beast." But leave Hannibal the Cannibal and his ilk to the adults who
can handle him.</TE>

<HD>Enact Law in California to Match Guns to Owners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Smith</AU>
<BD>Craig R. Smith is president of the Freedom of
Expression Foundation and a professor of communication studies at Cal
State Long Beach. He is active in state gun control efforts.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gun-control idea being talked about these days in
Washington--creating a national registry of the unique marks that
guns make on bullets when they are fired--was proposed in California
a few years ago and in a perfect political world would be law today.
It still could become law if enough people demanded it.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is simple. Every gun bears a serial number. And every
handgun sale is registered with law enforcement authorities. Since
every gun is test-fired by the manufacturer before it is put on the
market, there is a bullet available that holds the unique barrel
markings of that particular gun.</LD>
<LD>   If manufacturers were required to make one bullet from each gun
they produced available to law enforcement,  they could digitize the
unique barrel markings of each gun and keep them on file along with
the serial number of the gun and the name and address of the buyer
when the gun was purchased.</LD>
<TE>   To make the law truly effective, existing handguns should be
brought to a local facility, test-fired and registered. Then
officials would have a new and extremely efficient way of putting the
bullet from the crime scene together with the gun that was used for
the crime and the name and address of an owner.</TE>
<TE>   I proposed legislation to get this process started in California a
few years ago. A bill, AB 1717, sponsored by then-Assembly Speaker
Robert Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys), became law in 2000, calling for a
feasibility study that could lead to a "gun fingerprinting"
requirement. A similar proposal went nowhere in Congress, and the
California law, mild as it was, has been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Until a feasibility study is completed, no manufacturer could be
required to submit gun "fingerprints" to the state Department of
Justice. The study was due Jan. 1 but has yet to see the light of day
despite testimony from myself and others, including computer experts,
police chiefs and the FBI, all of whom endorsed the workability of
the proposal. Citizens ought to be asking Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
what happened to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper attacks in Maryland and Virginia aside, in California
alone in 1998 there were 1,315 handgun homicides, about four a day.
These handgun homicides constituted more than 60% of all homicides in
the state, up from 53% in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Most Californians want to extend federal background checks to gun
shows, would require trigger locks and would ban the sale of guns on
the Internet, according to polls.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic identification of handguns would significantly reduce
violence in our society. Even if it were law only in California,  a
properly worded provision could require out-of-state sales of guns to
California residents to be reported to the state. Buyers who
purchased guns outside the state would  provide barrel markings to
law enforcement agencies within five days of purchase.  A handgun
fingerprinting law also would  deter the use of "straw purchasers"
who buy guns for ineligible people, such as convicted felons.</TE>
<TE>   Each day of delay means innocent people killed by guns that could
be far more easily traced.</TE>

<LD>Yes, we're delighted the Angels are flying high right into the World
Series right here in Southern California today. Of course, we're
cheering. But before fans start yelling, before thunder sticks start
thundering, before beers and scoreboard animations start affecting
crowd behavior, let's appreciate what's really happening.</LD>
<LD>   We're a nation at war confronting trials, legal and otherwise.
Terrorists attack oil tankers, buses, nightclubs. Election-year
politics are over-combative and unproductive. Stocks tumble. One of
the losers running for governor will win. Corporate officers lie.
Even Martha Stewart may have cheated, though her kitchen looked great
all the while. Nobel Prizes for biology inspire, but only eight
people understand "suicide cells." Americans are lethally overweight,
gang murders mount and the Washington-area sniper and Osama bin Laden
elude captors.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes an amazing feel-good series. You needn't be a baseball
fan -- and most of us aren't -- to enjoy underdog, jinxed angels
facing earnest, overachieving giants, the first World Series of
wildcards. We've got teams named for socks, sailors, birds, evil fish
and poisonous snakes.</LD>
<TE>   Only Californians who prize rainy Sundays can cheer against
angels. Nothing against San Franciscans; they're like neighbors down
the street -- you wave and smile but don't really care.</TE>
<TE>   TV presents sports as winning and losing, plus gobs of fame and
money. Real fans, especially Angels fans, know that sports, like
life, are more about enduring, getting by, getting back up, trying
again, hanging in, hoping.</TE>
<TE>   None of us will be here when the Cubs reach the World Series. So
let's celebrate Angels who've endured bad luck, bad plays, bad
management, bad calls, bad trades and poor crowds. It may be just in
California, but this series seems more like an old-fashioned Sunday
dinner when familiar family faces gathered to share memories and mark
the start of yet another week together.</TE>
<TE>   Sports are supposed to be something to care about in passing, to
avoid thinking about other things or listening to a spouse who's no
fan. Sports are businesses for owners, lucrative games for players
and distractions for the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   The games are fun to watch. They happen right now before our eyes
-- no editing, no laugh or applause tracks, none of the careful,
calculated choreography that characterizes so much of our lives, in
watching sitcoms, attending meetings and observing politics.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we'll witness two come-from-behind teams battling for a
transient symbolic supremacy, two groups of disparate athletes, some
young, some old, who've endured losses and weak expectations but got
up again, now in the biggest games of their lives. These are games,
meant to be played and enjoyed. So let's do it.</TE>
<TE>   And may the most heavenly team win.</TE>

<HD>Overreaction to News Leak</HD>
<DH>Whistle-blower on LAPD domestic violence served the public
interest. He does not deserve jail time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time Los Angeles Police Officer Victor Felix Ramos pointed
his city-issued Beretta at his estranged wife, he fired so many shots
that he had to reload. The couple's three young sons cowered in
another bedroom as he killed their mother and her new boyfriend. He
saved a final bullet for himself.</LD>
<LD>   Now, five years later, a U.S. district judge wants to send to jail
the man who leaked documents about how the Los Angeles Police
Department routinely mishandled domestic violence complaints against
its officers -- including Ramos, who first pointed a gun at his wife
three months before he killed her. If a panel of judges from the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals upholds the 60-day sentence,
whistle-blower Robert Mullally would receive harsher punishment than
most of the 70-plus officers described in the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Mullally should not spend a minute in jail.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, he violated a court order that the files not be made public
without the judge's permission. But the information, obtained as part
of a lawsuit filed by the family of Melba Ramos, was pertinent to
public safety as well as LAPD policy. The suit was settled out of
court, but had it gone to trial the information would have been
publicly aired.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that the LAPD had engaged in a pattern and
practice of civil rights violations by ignoring complaints of
domestic violence against its officers. Mullally had been hired as an
expert witness by the family's attorney and had reviewed personnel
records that showed, among other slaps on the wrist, one officer
getting just a reprimand for raping his girlfriend, another a 10-day
suspension for breaking his wife's nose.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally gave the files to a television reporter. The resulting
story prompted the LAPD's inspector general to investigate and
recommend reforms.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge William D. Keller, in ordering the 60-day
sentence, seemed more concerned about defending the sanctity of a
court order than about stopping the next Victor Ramos. Even the U.S.
attorney prosecuting the case said a prison sentence would be
"extreme."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 9th Circuit judges who heard the appeal expressed
concern that probation alone would signal that anyone could violate a
court order and cite conscience. But that's what rendering judgment
is all about -- weighing the public's interest. Revealing the truth
about police getting away scot-free with domestic violence, or about
the lies of cigarette companies or about defective tires, saves
lives. What greater public interest is there?</TE>

<HD>Blackouts Leave Black Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Development Counsellors International recently asked executives
to identify the states with the worst business climate, 57% pointed
to California -- a higher percentage than the combined negative
rankings for New York (36%) and Massachusetts (18%). What's strange
is that when the research firm surveyed executives in 1999, only a
quarter put California at the bottom, and a near-equal percentage
described this as the nation's best business location.</LD>
<LD>   What's changed? The New York-based economic development marketing
firm suspects that business leaders have been blinded by the "dark
afterglow that remains from the energy crisis." Perceptions formed
during the blackouts have stayed frozen, with many executives
believing that Californians are still struggling to get by with
candles and portable generators.</LD>
<LD>   Californians have made it clear that they don't want to change
certain policies that give some businesses the willies: tough
environmental regulations that make running a company easier in other
states, living-wage laws that make doing so cheaper and the new
family leave policy that makes doing business elsewhere less
complicated. Demanding that firms treat workers fairly and the
environment responsibly undoubtedly can increase the costs of goods
and services.</LD>
<TE>   But Californians think the trade-offs -- a cleaner environment and
healthier, more-productive workers -- are worth the expense. The real
and perceived energy problems that seem to be fueling business
leaders' misgivings are another matter.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing California needs when it courts new business is
outsiders dulling the Golden State's image among those with the power
to build plants, warehouses and factories in job-hungry communities.
But that's what has happened since 2001 when energy companies played
games with the power supply. And business leaders are apparently left
with the false impression that electricity blackouts continue to roll
and power bills still soar.</TE>
<TE>   The state must refine its rocky attempt at deregulating energy
markets. When possible, it must renegotiate costly long-term electric
supply contracts signed at the height of the crisis. And it must
continue to go after companies that, as evidence uncovered by state
and federal investigations strongly suggests, improperly manipulated
the energy market to bolster profit.</TE>
<TE>   California shouldn't waste time wooing businesses that aren't
willing to do what's right by its residents, but it can't let
responsible companies be chased away because greedy energy companies
have created woes real and mythic.</TE>

<HD>Russian Governor Is Gunned Down in Bold Daylight Attack</HD>
<DH>Killer ambushes head of gold-rich region in Far East as he
is walking to his office in Moscow. Officials say mobsters may be
behind slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- In one of the most brazen assassinations in Russia in
recent years, a man armed with a silenced pistol killed the governor
of a gold-rich Far East region Friday on one of Moscow's busiest
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the attack was probably a contract killing and
suggested that the victim had run afoul of one of the country's
organized crime clans. They acknowledged that they had no immediate
suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Valentin Tsvetkov, the 54-year-old head of the regional government
of Magadan, was shot in the back of the head shortly after 9 a.m.
while on his way into his region's Moscow office on Novy Arbat, a
broad skyscraper-lined street constructed in the 1960s as a showpiece
of Soviet modernity.</LD>
<TE>   The killing was the latest in a long series of gangland-style
shootings of public servants and business leaders in the decade since
the end of the Soviet Union. Although the first of a governor, it
followed by less than two months the assassination of a Liberal
Russia party member of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
in a suburban Moscow park.</TE>
<TE>   "A governor, just like any ordinary Russian, has no protection
from arbitrary criminals," Eduard Rossel, the governor of Sverdlovsk,
told a Russian news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvetkov was gunned down  as he walked toward his office with his
wife at his side. The gunman, who witnesses said wore a stocking cap
and had been hiding behind a sidewalk billboard, fired several shots
and then fled in a waiting Zhiguli, a small Russian-made sedan. He
discarded his Makarov pistol at the scene. The Zhiguli was found on a
nearby side street, and police said the gunman probably fled in a
second car.</TE>
<TE>   There were crowds of people on the sidewalk when the shooting
occurred, and by late afternoon police were circulating a sketch of
the assailant based on witness descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin, whose motorcade to the Kremlin daily
passes by the site of the slaying, condemned it as a "crime against
the state" and ordered the country's top two law-enforcement
officials, Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov and Prosecutor General
Vladimir Ustinov, to take charge of the investigation. Putin also
called Tsvetkov's wife, Lyudmila, to offer his condolences.</TE>
<TE>   "This crime must be solved," Ustinov told reporters. Gryzlov said
a team of investigators would be sent to Magadan today. "We believe
the roots of the crime should be sought there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor had been in Moscow for two weeks and had been using
the office on Novy Arbat every day, said Vladimir Gordiyenko, chief
criminal investigator for Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "The crime is connected with the economic activities of the
region," said Gordiyenko, adding that the governor had been in
conflict with some local business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Magadan, a Pacific port about 3,700 miles east of Moscow, produces
roughly a quarter of Russia's annual gold output. As governor,
Tsvetkov personally oversaw the awarding of licenses and concessions
for companies in the gold, fishing and oil industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Magadan means fish and gold," Sergei Mironov, chairman of the
Federation Council, parliament's upper house, said on state
television. "Quite recently, the governor made a correct decision to
build a gold processing facility.</TE>
<TE>   "What is more, he did all he could to make sure that gold deposits
would be put to use for the benefit of Magadan residents. It looks as
though someone didn't like that at all."</TE>
<TE>   A former member of the Duma, Tsvetkov was elected governor in 1996
and reelected in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Criminals no longer are afraid of anything. They know they will
never be caught," said retired Police Maj. Gen. Vladimir Ovchinsky,
the former head of Interpol in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the Interior Ministry anti-organized-crime forces are
no longer a serious match for them," Ovchinsky said. He blamed what
he said were repeated "purges" of the country's anti-organized-crime
units that led to the departure of experienced investigators. He also
accused state television of glorifying organized-crime characters in
a recent series.</TE>
<TE>   At least seven lawmakers and a number of deputy governors have
died violently in post-Communist Russia. The most recent was Duma
member Vladimir Golovlyov, who was shot Aug. 21 while walking his dog
outside Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Golovlyov was a member of Liberal Russia, which is critical of
Putin. But the speculation after his unsolved death has been that it
had something to do with his business activities. Perhaps the
best-known unsolved killing of a politician was that of Galina V.
Starovoitova, a liberal lawmaker and presidential advisor from St.
Petersburg who was killed Nov. 20, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of arrests, authorities say they are making
progress fighting contract killings.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, each year we have been solving more and more of these
cases," said Natalia Vishnyakova, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor
general's office.</TE>

<HD>Militant Cleric Is Hospitalized in Indonesia</HD>
<DH>Suspected terrorist was to face questioning today. He had
earlier praised Bin Laden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JAKARTA, Indonesia -- A militant Islamic leader who was scheduled to
answer police questions today about a series of church bombings
delivered a sermon Friday, prayed for the good health of Osama bin
Laden and held a news conference. Then he checked into a hospital
complaining of exhaustion.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Bakar Bashir, 64, a Muslim cleric who advocates converting the
entire world to Islam, has become a symbol of Indonesia's inability
to combat terrorism, especially after a car bombing on the island of
Bali that killed more than 180 people last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear how police would deal with his failure to appear
for questioning today.</LD>
<TE>   Early today, meanwhile, President Megawati Sukarnoputri signed two
emergency decrees that will strengthen the country's anti-terrorism
laws and allow for the detention of suspected terrorists for up to
six months without trial. The measures also will allow convicted
terrorists to be sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists fear that the power to detain suspects will
be abused by security forces fighting separatist rebels in the
regions of Aceh and Papua. But advocates note that the decrees can be
overridden by parliament and are valid for only a year unless
lawmakers act to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   "As friends of Indonesia, we have a right to expect some decisive
action in the coming days based on the horrors that happened in Bali
last weekend," said U.S. Ambassador Ralph Boyce.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is accused of heading Jemaah Islamiah, a small and
disciplined organization blamed by authorities for dozens of bombings
in Indonesia and the Philippines that killed more than 40 people in
December 2000. Bashir denies that he is the leader of Jemaah Islamiah
and that it even exists. He also denies any role in terrorist
attacks, including the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir's attorney said Friday that the cleric had collapsed. But
before entering the hospital, the media-savvy Bashir was healthy
enough to give a sermon in which he prayed for the safety of Bin
Laden. The Al Qaeda leader, he said, "destroyed the interests of
America because America has destroyed the Muslims' interests."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir also predicted that he would be arrested, saying, "Even I
myself will be captured soon because I am allegedly a terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   He later told the news conference that "some Islamic clerics are
to be sacrificed for the sake of foreign countries' political needs."</TE>
<TE>   In the days since the Bali bombing, Indonesia has been under
intense pressure from the U.S. and other countries to crack down on
terrorism. In the past, the government has been reluctant to act
against extremist Muslims for fear of sparking violent protests in
the nation with the world's largest Muslim population.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about the safety of Americans in Indonesia, the U.S.
State Department ordered 300 nonemergency staff and family members to
leave the country. Only about 100 embassy personnel will remain.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian government warned today that there may be attacks
aimed at Westerners in the suburbs of Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital, and urged Australians to leave Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that it needs international assistance, Indonesia
signed an unusual agreement allowing police from seven other
countries to help investigate the Bali blast. So far, 95 foreign
investigators and police experts have been assigned to the case, most
of them from Australia, but also from the U.S., Britain, New Zealand,
Japan, Germany and Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Papua Police Chief Made M. Pastika, who has been assigned to head
the investigation, said there were no suspects so far. A total of 67
witnesses have been interviewed, police said.</TE>

<LD>Putting an end to a politically damaging paternity lawsuit, Peruvian
President Alejandro Toledo has acknowledged as his daughter a
14-year-old girl he had long denied was his, her mother said in Lima,
the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Lucrecia Orozco told a radio station that Toledo had agreed to pay
compensation for the 14 years he failed to recognize his daughter,
Zarai Toledo. A newspaper said the amount was about $100,000. Mother

<LD>   Riefenstahl, best known for Nazi-era propaganda films, was accused

<LD>Fifteen people, most of them Muslim rebels, have been killed in
separatist violence in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, police said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   They said security forces killed three suspected Islamic militants
as they tried to slip into the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir
from Pakistan early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The gun battle took place on the Line of Control, which separates
the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas of Kashmir, in Rajouri district
southwest of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   Later Friday, a policeman and a militant were killed in another
gun battle in Baramulla district north of Srinagar.</TE>

in separate shootouts across the region since Thursday evening,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Pakistan, meanwhile, said one man was killed and a
Pakistani soldier was wounded when Indian troops fired mortar shells
across the Line of Control.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan said this week they would withdraw troops from
their border. But both sides said there would be no withdrawal of
troops facing the 462-mile Line of Control.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Begins Diplomatic Offensive on North Korea</HD>
<DH>The White House asks nations in the region to help stop the
nuclear program. China is key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron, Henry Chu and Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is trying to enlist North
Korea's four key neighbors -- China, Russia, Japan and South Korea --
in a campaign to persuade Kim Jong Il to relinquish his nuclear
weapons programs, officials and analysts said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But while the administration is emphasizing its desire to solve
the crisis with diplomacy, its efforts could be complicated if South
Korean and Japanese leaders opt to continue their strategy of
engaging the isolated regime of Kim, North Korea's leader.</LD>
<LD>   China's cooperation is seen as key, since it is believed to have
more leverage over North Korea than any other nation, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   China is the leading supplier of cheap or free food and fuel for
its impoverished neighbor. It is also North Korea's main trading
partner, one of its only socialist allies and the unhappy host of a
growing stream of North Korean refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Two U.S. officials held talks with officials in Beijing on Friday,
but neither country disclosed the names of the officials involved or
the results.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the Chinese government shares our concern about the
possible introduction of nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "We hope to proceed
on the basis of the concerns, and we will continue our consultations
with China." He called the talks "useful and productive."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhang Qiyue, told
the official New China News Agency that the government believes that
"the nuclear issue in [North Korea] should be solved through peaceful
means, through dialogues and consultations."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny reports that
Pakistan -- now a key ally in the American war on terrorism --
probably provided uranium enrichment technology to North Korea
through the 1990s in exchange for missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. officials and defense analysts said that although
Pakistan was a leading suspect, rogue officials or black marketeers
in Russia or China also might have provided nuclear technology to the
North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   All countries emphatically denied the charge. There is some
evidence that China helped Pakistan obtain its nuclear technology,
making the complex nuclear-proliferation blame game murkier still.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials carefully avoided pointing the finger at
any of the three countries, mindful that the United States now needs
the cooperation of all of them in its efforts to disarm both North
Korea and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer dodged questions about
which countries might have helped North Korea's uranium enrichment
program, saying it was not in the interests of the North's major
trading partners to help the regime develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "These countries want good and improved relations with the United
States, and they have no interest in a 'nuclearized' North Korea,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has long said it opposes a nuclear-armed North Korea,
which could cause South Korea and Japan to rethink their nonnuclear
stances, trigger an arms race and upset the geopolitical stability of
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, analysts were relatively optimistic that Undersecretary of
State John Bolton and Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly,
who arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a previously scheduled visit,
would receive a sympathetic hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The visit by Bolton and Kelly was originally intended to finalize
preparations for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's three-day tour of
the U.S. next week.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton was to continue on to Moscow for talks with Russian
officials, while Kelly was heading for Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's surprise confession to the U.S. this month that it
has a uranium-based nuclear weapons program is now expected to be a
major topic of discussion during Jiang's one-day visit to President
Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, on Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   The question is how much leverage China has over North Korea --
and how much it will be willing to exert.</TE>
<TE>   The two Communist nations have enjoyed close ties for half a
century, a relationship they liken to that of "lips and teeth." But
differences have grown more stark over the last decade as China
continued to implement market-oriented reforms while North Korea
remained mired in its Marxist policies.</TE>
<TE>   As China's economy becomes more integrated with the rest of the
world, and as its leaders pursue a higher profile in international
diplomacy, Beijing has found itself putting greater emphasis on its
ties with countries such as the U.S., Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in recent years, Chinese officials have complained privately
to U.S. diplomats that Beijing has limited influence on the eccentric
North Korean leader.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception of most Chinese people [toward North Korea] has
really changed," said Zhu Feng, an international relations scholar at
Beijing University. "Our neighbor is frequently causing us
headaches."</TE>
<TE>   "China doesn't have absolute leverage, but China is part of a
coordinated front of the U.S., the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Russia, who all have an interest at least in bringing the North
Koreans to the negotiating table," said Stephen W. Bosworth, a former
U.S. ambassador to South Korea who is now at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth and other Korea experts argued that the North's bombshell
confession that it had a nuclear weapons program in violation of a
1994 agreement was a signal that it was ready to consider giving them
up in exchange for a better relationship with the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not so much an overt attempt to become a nuclear weapons
state as it is an effort to build up a better negotiating position,"
Bosworth said. "North Korea has now engaged enough with the outside
world so that if there is a crisis, they're going to have something
to lose. Let's take advantage of that. Let's be firm, but let's
signal that we're willing to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. all grappled Friday
with the implications of North Korea's confession.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) said in a statement
that "Pakistan's reported involvement ... is extraordinarily
worrying." But Akaka, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, also accused the Bush administration of manipulating the
timing of its disclosures and stinting on the content, and said he

<TE>   "Apparently, the administration came to the conclusion last summer
that North Korea had an active nuclear weapons program, briefed our
Japanese allies about it in September, raised it with the North
Koreans in early October, and then waited an additional 12 days to
raise it more widely with the Congress after the vote on war with
Iraq, and then only after reports had leaked in the press," Akaka's
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi faces growing domestic
criticism over his strategy to normalize relations with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have said that they shared evidence
with Japan in early September of North Korea's secret weapons
program. But Koizumi still paid a historic visit to North Korea on
Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't normalize diplomatic relations unless there is a

destruction," Taku Yamasaki, a top lawmaker of the ruling Liberal

<TE>   "Tokyo and Seoul share the opinion that, while the U.S. is our

<HD>Ex-Colleagues Ask Help Solving Mexican Attorney's Death</HD>
<DH>They fear that rights lawyer Digna Ochoa's fatal shooting a
year ago will remain unresolved without foreign assistance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MEXICO CITY -- Trying to breathe new life into an inquiry growing
colder by the day, former colleagues of human rights attorney Digna
Ochoa renewed an appeal Friday for international help in solving her
shooting death, which occurred one year ago today.</LD>
<LD>   Edgar Cortez, Ochoa's onetime colleague and now director at Miguel
Agustin Pro Human Rights Center here, said that without help from
outside forensic specialists and criminologists, the investigation
faces "the risk of becoming just one more unresolved case in this
country."</LD>
<LD>   Cortez announced that his organization had withdrawn from the
investigation, and complained that the case had dragged on without
resolution. He spoke at a news conference to mark the anniversary of
the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   The Mexico City attorney general's office, which in August
appointed its third special prosecutor to head the high-profile
investigation, has admitted that the case has been mishandled. But
the current prosecutor, Margarita Guerra y Tejada, said Thursday that
she is committed to bringing it to a transparent end.</TE>
<TE>   The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, a unit of the
Organization of American States, agreed in June to send a forensic
team to review evidence in the case, Cortez said. But the team has
yet to arrive because of a dispute over who should pay for the review
and because of questions over whether its findings would be valid in
a Mexican court, sources close to the case said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The commission met in Washington on Friday to review the Ochoa
case and others, but it was not immediately known whether it had
decided on any action. Guerra y Tejada spoke at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's body was found in her office, kneeling and slumped over a
sofa, with point-blank shots to her head and leg. Her pistol was on
the floor beneath her. A letter placed nearby threatened others in
her human rights office "if they continue."</TE>
<TE>   The death of the 37-year-old former Roman Catholic nun was
initially described by government officials as a political murder and
framed in the press as a test for President Vicente Fox's promise to
do away with gangsterism and impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa had made an ample number of enemies and drawn many death
threats because she had defended left-wing guerrillas and students,
as well as ecologists who had sought to block illegal deforestation
in Guerrero state. The year before her death, Ochoa had received the
American Bar Assn.'s Human Rights Award, honoring her for courageous
legal defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Her murder case took a twist last spring when Mexico City
officials told reporters that investigators were working on the
hypothesis that Ochoa was emotionally disturbed, had falsified death
threats and committed suicide. That theory enraged members of her
family.</TE>
<TE>   At the Friday news conference, Cortez said that his organization
did not have a position in the suicide-versus-murder debate, only
that it wanted the government to solve the case.</TE>
<TE>   In the text of her remarks at the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights hearing, Guerra y Tejada acknowledged that evidence in
the case had not been properly handled.</TE>
<TE>   "Some witnesses called to declare did not do so with clarity and
specificity," the prosecutor said, adding that a psychological
profile of Ochoa prepared by the prosecution team contained
"deficiencies."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Thursday, Guerra y Tejada said that no
line of inquiry would be discarded. She added that 20 witnesses had
been called since she took over the case and that 30 more were due to
testify.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to bring the case to a close in a matter of months.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had very little time on this case," she said. "I was named
in August, but have only been fully involved for a month. At this
point, this is not so much a case of analysis as it is of deciding
what evidence is useful and what isn't. I have no opinion whether it
was a homicide or suicide. We're still looking at the evidence ...
and calling witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   But Jesus Ochoa y Placido, a brother of the victim, said Thursday
night that he feared that Guerra y Tejada was following the same
"false line" of investigation as previous prosecutors because she had
asked him and his brother Ismael to supply saliva samples to her
office.</TE>
<TE>   If the samples match those on envelopes containing the
death-threat notes that his sister said she received, it would
bolster investigators' earlier claim that Ochoa had falsified the
threats.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "Clean Air Is the State's Right" (editorial, Oct. 14).
We have been fighting the big auto manufacturers on this very issue
for years. Our electric car has over 6,500 miles on it after about
nine months of use. Clean, reliable, zero-emissions, one-penny-each,
charge-at-home, no-visits-to-the-gas-station miles -- consuming no
oil, Iraqi or otherwise. People give us the thumbs-up on the road,
smile or wave. When was the last time that happened to an SUV driver?
I think they're more used to a different type of gesture.</LD>
<LD>   People often talk to us when we park, sometimes at stoplights,
sometimes just yelling across traffic, encouraging us and expressing
support. Soon we will have solar electric panels on our house and
then we will have zero emissions. There is an alternative to oil for
transportation.</LD>

<TE>   Re "2002 Spike in Air Pollution Reverses Downward Trend," Oct. 13:
Nowhere in the analysis offered to explain the possible reasons for
the purportedly unexpected spike in air pollution is there any
mention of the fact that half of all new-car sales last year were
sport utility vehicles. As an air-quality planner, I have raised the
probability that, this year or the next, we would see just such a
spike in air pollution measurements. It is inconceivable that we can
know the laws of physics and the principles of atmospheric chemistry
and not know the consequences of our collective actions.</TE>
<TE>   Each one of us who chose to drive an SUV chose to ignore the
consequences of that choice and chose also to externalize the
consequences of our choice-making onto others far distant from us. If
those who sow and those who reap are not one and the same, natural
law cannot prevail. An emissions tax is the only way to redress the
harm being done to us by those who care the least about us.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Calif. Overstepped Authority on 'Clean' Cars, U.S. Contends,"
Oct. 10: Once again President Bush has proven to be two-faced and a
hypocrite. In siding with DaimlerChrysler in its bid to trump the
revolutionary measure passed in our state to force auto makers to put
zero-emissions vehicles on the market, he has sided with those who
would, in the name of profit, risk the health of millions, as well as
the environment in which we live. While espousing his commitment to
states' rights throughout his campaign for the presidency, his
commitment to that philosophy stands only if his friends in big
business -- in this case, car makers and big oil -- are not
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   As a gigantic force in this nation's overall economy and
well-being, we as Californians should have the ability to govern our
own path in taking a great leap forward in developing a more
sustainable society.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his presidency, Bush sided with business interests when
he refused to endorse the Kyoto Protocol. Now he is castigating other
nations around the world for acting in their own self-interest in not
supporting his campaign for war against Iraq. Citing a perceived, yet
unproven, threat, Bush beats his chest for war with Iraq yet he
conveniently forgets the far graver threat of environmental
destruction and global warming that is slowly, but surely, creeping
over the horizon. Is it myopia that guides him, or pure greed?</TE>

<LD>So many families now face leaving their family physician (or
pediatrician) simply because their medical insurance necessitates a
preferred provider organization managed-care plan that either rejects
their doctor from participation or denies both services and payments.
They lament having to leave the care of doctors who have served them
well over many years ... but economically they have no other choice.
Is this right? Is this what America wants? Are doctors to be the
unofficial employees of the medical insurance companies? It is not
difficult to see how third parties destroy important relationships.
America, speak up; enough is enough.</LD>

<HD>Freebies for Police Officers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Paying a Price for Freebies," Oct. 12: "A band of reform-minded
chiefs is trying to banish these benefits." Surely they jest! Don't
these police chiefs have enough serious crime to worry about without
harassing their officers about free or discounted food offered by
grateful citizens? The men and women who put their lives on the line
for us every day deserve more than free cups of coffee, doughnuts or
discounted chicken dinners.</LD>
<LD>   Are these officers so highly paid that we should begrudge them
these freebies? I don't think so. Besides, they bring a sense of calm
and safety to the establishments they frequent. I enjoy seeing police
officers eating in a restaurant when I'm there. I feel safe.</LD>
<LD>   The police chiefs don't have to hire consultants, seek grants,
etc., to devise a plan to enhance goodwill in the community when this
so-called gratuity system already exists. Give the officers a break;
get off their backs about this nonissue. Go out and get the really
bad guys.</LD>

<TE>   In the mid-'60s I worked for a fairly large liquor store on
Ventura Boulevard. I was basically a delivery boy, but eventually I
started working behind the counter as a clerk. One Saturday night two
uniformed LAPD cops came in and each got a couple of packs of
cigarettes. Well, not knowing any better, I charged them the 35 cents
or so a pack. They looked at me kind of strangely but paid and then
left.</TE>
<TE>   When I came in for my delivery chores the next Wednesday, boy, did
I get it. I was asked what happened with the cops on Saturday and why
I charged them for the cigarettes. I told the boss that I did what I
was supposed to and charged "all" customers. Well, the cops weren't
"all" customers, and from now on when any uniformed cop came in for a
pack or two of cigarettes or a soft drink, it would be on the house.
Next Saturday, the same two cops came in and got their same packs of
cigarettes. This time I told them it was on the house.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later there started to be some robberies in the
Sherman Oaks-Studio City area, especially at nights along Ventura
Boulevard. When the cops came in one Saturday around 9 p.m., I
mentioned to them that I was kind of worried about all those
robberies, and they told me not to worry. Later that night, just
before closing at 2 a.m., I saw this cop car pull into the lot and
just sit there until I closed up and left for home. It was my new
friends. They waved to me when I left, and they did this same routine
for the next few weeks, until the robber was eventually caught
somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Would they have been sitting in the lot at closing had I not given
them the freebies? I don't think so. Was this cheap protection? You
bet. Was I happy about this? Sure was.</TE>

<TE>   The "gimme" attitude of our so-called protectors could easily be
compared with pot smokers or cocaine and heroin users. The continued
use of law enforcement officers' badges and uniforms to get discounts
easily turns to addiction. No business owner owes the police a penny
beyond their salaries. I was sickened one night when eight men from
the Sheriff's Department stood around in a local fast food
establishment until the owner told his waitress to "give them
anything on the menu for $2." I almost choked on my $4 sandwich.</TE>

<TE>   Seniors, students and teachers are examples of groups of people
with modest incomes who receive discounts on various things. Why
should peace officers not be included? They have a job that is highly
stressful and, depending on where they work, can be very dangerous.
Their salary is not reflective of the work that is expected from
them. Discounts are a built-in perk that comes with this type of job.</TE>
<TE>   Giving them a discount is a win-win for everyone. For many people
in the community it is a way of saying "thank you" for all you do for
us. It makes merchants feel good to give back, and gives peace
officers a feeling of being appreciated. Then there are the merchants
who do it because it is a way of generating business. Peace officers
are a vital part of our city. If individuals or companies want to
show their appreciation for all the hard work they do, they should be
able to do so. There may be some peace officers who take advantage of
this, but you will find those kinds of people in every profession.</TE>

<TE>   What happened to honoring our community servants in a post-9/11
world? Mooching is one thing, but the last I heard, accepting small
gifts is called being gracious. I am a former teacher who used to
receive discounts at book stores by showing my ID and receive gifts
from my students at the end of a semester. Did this influence my
grading practices or where I had students buy books? Not a bit! And I
trust that for the vast majority of officers the same is true. I had
a friend who was a small-town cop for a few years and finally quit
the job, partly because of the utter hostility he received from
strangers. I don't know many people who could tolerate the verbal
abuse an officer receives on a daily basis, let alone the physical
danger. So officers receive a free burrito or a cup of coffee? That's
the very least we can give them!</TE>

<LD>In "Locked in War's Embrace" (Opinion, Oct. 13), Amy Wilentz depicts
Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as a villain. No better than a
ruthless dictator. She even goes as far as to claim that Sharon and
Hamas share the common goal of "the destruction of peace." She states
that Sharon contemplates transferring all the Palestinians out of
Israel. I hardly think the elected leader of a democratic state
actually believes he can organize the expulsion of more than 2
million people.</LD>
<LD>   Wilentz asks why Sharon doesn't bulldoze the house of Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual founder of Hamas, as he does the compounds of
Yasser Arafat and other collaborators of terror. Yassin is a
quadriplegic and not part of the Hamas military wing. Sharon does not
endorse the destruction of innocent individuals even if they believe
in the annihilation of Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Wilentz wrote that Sharon sees himself as being at war with
Palestine. Why wouldn't he? Suicide bombers attack daily if he
doesn't take wartime precautions, such as locking down the West Bank
and Gaza Strip with strict curfews. Arafat either cannot or will not
stop attacks on innocent Israeli civilians. He is ineffective as a
leader at a time when leadership is the only solution to a crisis.
Sharon, like any other nation's leader, will not negotiate under
terror. Peace will happen only when the Palestinians put down their

safe until this happens, as any great leader would.</TE>

<TE>   "The Bulldozer" Sharon got his nickname for bulldozing hundreds of
Palestinian homes in a Gaza Strip refugee camp in the 1970s. He has a
philosophy that condones settlements, and his position is to grab as
many Palestinian hilltops as feasible. This creates "facts on the
ground." His tactic is to destroy the entire Palestinian
infrastructure to marginalize Arafat. In destroying police stations
and vehicles and preventing freedom of movement of Palestinians in
the occupied areas, how can law and order be maintained?</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians will never achieve statehood because three
powerful forces besides Israel are against them. These include the
U.S. Congress, the Christian right and the Israeli lobby in this
country. Only when you dismantle the objections of the three and get
rid of Sharon will you have peace in the Middle East. Fifty years
from now the issues will be the same unless, of course, the
Palestinians are expelled en mass to other Arab countries.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read Wilentz's article with some interest and even some
agreement. Wouldn't it be nice if she wrote a companion piece about
how Arafat has messed up every chance he has been given over the
years for peace, squandered international money donated to the
Palestinian cause and, through his old-soldier stubborn
thickheadedness, single-handedly brought his own people to the brink
of ruin?</TE>
<TE>   After all, even in the Middle East, it takes two to tango.</TE>
<TE>   Sara L. Cannon</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wilentz touches only lightly on the impact of Sharon's actions on
U.S. interests in the Middle East. In fact, Sharon's wanton
destruction of the homes, institutions, leadership and hopes of the
Palestinians has hurt not only U.S. standing in the Middle East but
our fight against international terrorism as well.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the world, the U.S. is seen as the shield behind which
Sharon has been allowed to try to bulldoze the Palestinians into
submission. The longer the U.S. appears to be giving unconditional
support to Sharon's brutal occupation of the Palestinians, the
greater the resentment and resistance we will meet among Arabs,
Muslims and the people of other lands.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hearing of the passing of Stephen E. Ambrose kind of took the wind
from my sails (obituary, Oct. 14).</LD>
<LD>   Growing up in a post-John Wayne America, many of us lost track of
who the real heroes of World War II were. Ambrose changed that. When
I saw "Band of Brothers" I was riveted in anticipation of each
episode. Seeing the stories of ordinary American men such as C.
Carwood Lipton -- a man then younger than myself who survived D-Day,
Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and right up through
the end of the war -- gave me a better understanding of human nature
and what real heroism is.</LD>
<LD>   Growing up with movies such as "Patton" that focused on a single
larger-than-life figure, I never thought about the average soldier. I
really had no idea of the individual acts of bravery and heroism in
just one company. Thinking that they might have "Hollywoodized" the
stories a little, I read Ambrose's book and found that was not true
at all. This led me to read "D-Day June 6, 1944" and "Citizen
Soldiers."</LD>
<TE>   Again and again, there were average men and women never thinking
of themselves, just working together selflessly for a common goal.
Ambrose's writing gave me an understanding and respect for those
people who, thanks to him, will never be forgotten. There were
unfortunate acts on both sides, and he wrote about both. In "Citizen
Soldiers" he never demonized the average German soldiers; he let them
tell their stories.</TE>
<TE>   I hope there are others out there who were as touched by Ambrose's
writing as I was.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bishops Dare to Dissent," Opinion, Oct. 13: Jack Miles suggests
that the Catholic bishops are rising to the occasion in taking a lead
role against an attack on Iraq. Bishop Wilton D. Gregory has
suggested that such a war would violate the standards of a "just
war." I suspect that most Catholics and Protestants alike have little
interest in the bishops' moral pronouncements. After all, most
Christian Americans probably think that Jesus' teaching that God
loves our enemies -- and asks that we do the same -- is some sort of
embarrassing silliness.</LD>

<TE>   The dogs of war are being unleashed upon the world. Shame on our
administration, which has chosen to follow the model of the Vietnam
War, whether from fear, vengeance, arrogance or a lust for control of
oil supplies. Shame on those members of Congress who voted from
political expediency rather than conscience. But most of all, shame
on the members of the public who have ignored the advice of major
religious councils that preventive war is immoral and supported
preemptive war on civilians of a country that has made no statements
of intent or moves to attack us.</TE>
<TE>   Woe to us when Muslim anti-American sentiments surge. Woe to us if
North Korea, Iran or Saudi Arabia is next on our enemies list. And
woe to us all if the Koreas, China, Pakistan, India or Israel should
follow our example.</TE>

<LD>Re "House Passes Bill to Improve Gun-Buyer Background Checks," Oct.
16: President Bush cautiously states that he is not in favor of
firearms "fingerprinting" because he is unsure of the technology's
accuracy. His spokesman suggests that if people are determined to
break laws, "how many laws can we really have to stop crime?" Yet
this same president has had no problem requiring far less evidence
for policies he finds politically expedient.</LD>
<LD>   On strategic policy, he's convinced of the accuracy of a
technologically dubious missile- defense system. On Iraq, he's
convinced of the accuracy of intelligence that he uses to justify our
preemptively attacking Saddam Hussein. And he despises pacifist
European nations that dare ask, in effect, "How many resolutions do
we really need to stop Iraq?"</LD>
<LD>   Why is Bush so gun-shy when it comes to a policy that might impact
domestic criminals like the Washington-area sniper? Hint: It isn't
technology. It's the National Rifle Assn.</LD>

<TE>   I understand when people feel the need to lash out when faced with
events that they cannot explain. I understand that this is the case
with the sniper. However, blaming the NRA for "making guns available"
is ridiculous. I am not a member of the NRA nor do I own a gun.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that the gun itself is not killing people. A rational
person with the same gun would not indiscriminately kill people.
Blaming the NRA for the sniper attacks is like blaming the DMV for a
drunk driving-related death.</TE>

<TE>   As we watch the difficulty of finding a sniper's truck in the
Washington area, we may want to consider a larger license plate with
bold numbers in an area on the vehicle where it is well lighted.
European license plates are much larger and easier to read. A simpler
numbering system would also be helpful. As it is now, the numbers
look jumbled and difficult to read when a vehicle is speeding by. The
way the world has become, every safety measure should be taken.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Times eagle may look fierce and alert; however, I think he
needs Lasik surgery on his left (or right?) eye ("Yes on Housing
Bonds," editorial, Oct. 13). If Proposition 46 is so good, yet fuzzy,
why am I supposed to vote to allow "special interest" groups access
to funds that purport to assist "those in need" to find housing and
apartments? Why can teachers and universities apply for these funds?
Let them propose legislation just for teachers and university
housing. No way am I voting for this measure when The Times doesn't
put figures in its editorial regarding what the salary of a beginning
teacher is (including perks) versus what the median income is for the
needy and down-and-out.</LD>
<LD>   Barb Waycott</LD>
<LD>   Canyon Country</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Voting yes on Proposition 46 is absolutely essential if anything
is to be done to meet the growing housing crisis. Not only are we not
building enough new affordable units to meet the needs of a growing
population, but the existing supply is steadily decreasing.
Insufficient construction leads to higher rents and to
"gentrification," a pretty description for poor-people removal. In
addition, 20,000 units of subsidized low-cost housing in California
have been "privatized" and rents raised. An additional 112,000 units
are at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial did not mention that the largest portion of the
$2.6-billion fund will build the low-cost rental housing desperately
needed by families and by the elderly, two groups in the population
where we are seeing a shocking increase in homelessness. Older women
with a Social Security income often as little as $600 or $700 a month
have become a heart-rending example of those threatened with the loss
of their homes as rents go up or as affordable housing disappears.</TE>
<TE>   If we are to do anything about housing, Proposition 46 is the only
game in town. Federal funds have practically disappeared. Counties
and cities have difficulty in maintaining essential services. Of
course more needs to be done. The Times is right in urging more
funding for the very poor, for the mentally ill and the addicted.
Proposition 46 will only make a dent in solving the housing crisis.
But it is a significant beginning.</TE>

<LD>Re "Audit Urges Major Reforms of Visitors Bureau Spending," Oct. 15:
With all the uproar over the performance of the L.A. Convention and
Visitors Bureau, nobody has bothered to do a competitive assessment
of the Los Angeles "product." There is no major hotel next to the
Convention Center, the area around the center is rather bleak, and
downtown L.A. on the weekend (when many visitors to business shows
arrive) is also grim. Street traffic patterns tend to confuse most
drivers, even L.A. residents. So besides "auditing" the bureau, we
also need to audit the product and come up with a plan to remedy its
shortcomings.</LD>

<HD>New Amgen Headquarters Dedicated</HD>

<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis visited the thriving Ventura Freeway technology
corridor Friday for the dedication of a new, multimillion-dollar
headquarters for Thousand Oaks-based biotech giant Amgen Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The 266,000-square-foot building -- designed by the same
architectural firm that made over the Louvre in Paris -- stands as
testimony to the high-tech industry's success along a 20-mile stretch
of the Ventura Freeway from Calabasas to Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the dot-com bust, biotechnology and health care are
among the few industries that have continued to expand and whose
long-term prospects appear relatively promising, economic analysts
say.</LD>
<TE>   "An extraordinary company deserves an extraordinary facility, and
Amgen has been an extraordinary company for 21 years," Davis said to
hundreds of employees gathered in a courtyard in front of the
metal-and-glass headquarters building.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said Amgen represents the entrepreneurial spirit of
California business.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to discover the cure for cancer or Alzheimer's
disease, but I want to create a hospitable environment for
world-class scientists and engineers that are going to find a cure,"
Davis said. "The future is unlimited. There's no telling how far this
industry will go."</TE>
<TE>   Although the governor's Thousand Oaks stop was not billed as an
official campaign appearance, Davis is traveling the state in the
final weeks before the Nov. 5 general election, in which he faces
Republican Bill Simon. Amgen contributed $65,000 to Davis' campaign,
according to the secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was flanked by venture capitalist William K. Bowes, who
founded Amgen 21 years ago in the Newbury Park section of Thousand
Oaks. The new headquarters bears his name, along with a life-size
bronze statue of the 6-foot-3 Bowes in front of the building.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't too long ago that this entire company consisted of a
small building," the bespectacled, white-haired Bowes said. Then,
referring to the headquarters site, he said, "This was a field, brown
in the winter and brown in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Bowes and two other Northern California investors started the
company with about $200,000 -- and a molecular biologist from UCLA.
They formed Applied Molecular Genetics -- almost immediately
shortened to Amgen -- and set about getting the business off the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they took the company public, hired 185 workers and
began marketing Amgen technology to major firms such as Texaco and
Upjohn. Now, Amgen is the largest private employer in the county with
7,650 employees working out of more than 40 structures on the
sprawling campus off Rancho Conejo Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   It serves as a centerpiece organization for the 101 technology
corridor that includes Baxter International of Thousand Oaks, which
produces blood therapy products; Rockwell Scientific Co. of Thousand
Oaks, a research and development firm; BioSource of Camarillo, which
conducts biomedical research; NetZero of Westlake Village, an
Internet service provider; and Xylan Corp. of Calabasas, which makes
switching systems for computer networks.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at Amgen have developed a number of products to treat
rheumatoid arthritis and to boost red blood cells. One of its leading
drugs, Neulasta, is used to prevent infection in chemotherapy
patients by boosting their white blood cell count.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 technology corridor is among several pockets of
high-technology clusters that have sprung up in the Southland,
including Multimedia Gulch in Glendale, Burbank, Universal City and
North Hollywood; Internet Valley in Pasadena, Altadena, Monrovia and
Alhambra; and Biotech Beach in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>County Needs to Prepare More for Bioterrorism, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Health officials cite many shortcomings in response plan to
an attack. 'We've got a long way to go,' says one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County is years away from being adequately prepared for a
bioterrorist attack, according to a new report by county health
officials.</LD>
<LD>   "If there were a bioterrorism attack today, the county would not
be caught totally unprepared," said Dr. Robert Levin, Ventura
County's public health officer and one of the plan's authors. "But
we've got much more to do in terms of specifics. We've got a long way
to go."</LD>
<LD>   Though county public health officials would be able to respond to
a bioterrorist attack, they would be hampered by poor communication
between health professionals and the public, the report states.</LD>
<TE>   They would also be overwhelmed by the need for mental health
services after an attack and slowed by the county laboratory's
limited ability to test for bioterrorist agents, it states.</TE>
<TE>   The county also lacks a plan for storing, managing and
distributing the antibiotics, vaccines and hospital equipment that
would be provided by the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile after an
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the county Board of Supervisors recently, Levin said
the need for a better response plan is obvious, given the Sept. 11
attacks and the recent nightclub bombing in Bali that killed at least
188 people.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors then voted to accept a plan to develop more effective
ways to track and contain bioterrorism in its early stages.</TE>
<TE>   "Bioterrorism is very frightening to all of us," Supervisor Kathy
Long said. "The more we can do to prepare ... is invaluable."</TE>
<TE>   A large-scale bioterrorist attack could involve the release of
anthrax, smallpox or botulism toxin. In a worst-case scenario, people
would be infected with a communicable disease or the county's food or
water supply could be contaminated, Levin said. The report notes that
Ventura County, as a major producer and consumer of agricultural
goods, could be vulnerable to such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Ventura County Public Health Department received
about one-quarter of a nearly $1-million federal grant to assess the
county's ability to handle a bioterrorist attack. The report is a
blueprint for a more detailed plan. If the California Department of
Health Services approves the initial report, the county will receive
the rest of the $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, county health officials say it will likely take several
years before they can afford to follow up on all of the report's
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "The things we think are the most important and the most likely
[to occur] are being dealt with earlier," Levin said. "If we had
double or triple the money, we could probably do this faster, but
we're just happy there's money available now."</TE>
<TE>   Top priorities include creating an Internet-based system to
streamline reporting of communicable diseases, coordinating efforts
with neighboring counties and improving communication among the
Public Health Department, doctors, hospitals and area residents,
Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Other recommendations include upgrading the county's medical
testing laboratory so it can conduct tests for biological agents;
establishing ties between county public health officials and
veterinarians to help track the spread of some diseases; and
sponsoring workshops for health workers so they can quickly respond
to outbreaks.</TE>

<HD>Bishops to Retain Policy on Abuse</HD>
<DH>'Zero tolerance' will be enforced in the U.S. pending talks
with the Vatican, clerical leaders say. But some opponents may ignore
the charter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer and David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in America said Friday they will
continue, at least for now, to enforce their controversial
"zero-tolerance" policy against sexually abusive priests despite
rejection of key provisions by the Vatican.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in Vatican City, Bishop Wilton T. Gregory of
Belleville, Ill., president of the U.S. bishops conference, said the
bishops would not back away from enforcement of their policy, known
as the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People.</LD>
<LD>   "Will they stop?" he asked rhetorically. "No." Vatican officials
have "not asked the bishops to stop pursuing the charter." The
Vatican's statement on the subject "simply says let us sit down and
talk together about issues that need to be clarified or modified."</LD>
<TE>   Others were more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what will happen is most bishops are going to hold up now
and not do very much other than what they've done," predicted Bishop
Thomas J. Gumbleton, the auxiliary bishop of Detroit and one of the
church's more liberal bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The minority of bishops who opposed the national policy in June
when it was adopted by the bishops at a meeting in Dallas will now
probably ignore it, he said. "Once again we'll have a situation
throughout the country of a great deal of diversity as to how bishops
respond."</TE>
<TE>   "We're now back to square one," said Barbara Blaine, founder and
president of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. "Each
bishop can decide for himself how to handle abusive priests."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the American bishops released on Friday, the
Vatican said provisions in the policy dealing with the rights of
accused priests and a definition of what constitutes sexual abuse
need to be rewritten to conform to the universal church's canon law.</TE>
<TE>   A joint Vatican-U.S. commission will be named with the intention
of working out changes in the U.S. policy in time for next month's
meeting in Washington of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican letter, sent by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, prefect
of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops, said that several
provisions in the policy are "a source of confusion and ambiguity"
and some of them "are difficult to reconcile with the universal law
of the church."</TE>
<TE>   But Re reaffirmed that the Vatican supports U.S. bishops in their
efforts to prevent the sexual abuse of minors, a crime that he called
"particularly abhorrent."</TE>
<TE>   Pending the review by the joint commission, which will be made up
of four U.S. bishops and four Vatican officials, the official
position of the U.S. church hierarchy is that bishops are free to
continue enforcing the charter.</TE>
<TE>   But that interpretation of the Vatican's position does not appear
to be universally shared. Some Vatican officials have privately
indicated that some of the American rules conflict with due-process
rights guaranteed to priests by universal church law and therefore
must be changed.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Father Jim Fredericks, a theologian at Loyola
Marymount University who has followed issues of canon law, agreed
that, at least in some dioceses, enforcement is unlikely to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "I know for a fact that some bishops since Dallas have complied
with the charter as cautiously as they can, knowing that there is a
problem with canon law," he said. "I suspect those bishops will take
this as a signal that the charter is on hold for the time being."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Vatican will have the final word. Without Vatican
approval, known as a recognitio, the policy cannot be made binding on
all U.S. bishops. Moreover, bishops cannot violate canon law to take
action against a priest.</TE>
<TE>   But there are constraints on the Vatican as well. Vatican
officials are painfully aware of the depth of the crisis in the U.S.,
and they made clear Friday that they do not wish to appear
obstructionist.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Re underscored what he called the Vatican's "full
solidarity" with U.S. bishops in their desire to rid the clergy of
sexual abusers.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony issued a statement
pledging continued enforcement of the zero-tolerance policy in the
archdiocese, which covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties. In Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose archdiocese has been
at the center of the scandal, issued a similar promise.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas J. Reese, a Vatican expert, agreed that U.S. bishops
may continue to carry out the policy until the joint commission says
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials have several specific concerns with the U.S.
charter, Gregory told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   One set of concerns goes to the heart of the U.S. charter's
zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Under that policy, a priest, deacon or other church employee must
be temporarily removed from any ministry or function when a "credible
allegation" of sexual abuse is lodged against him. The policy also
requires that any time sexual abuse is admitted or established after
an investigation, the offending priest or deacon will be permanently
removed from ministry. Offending priests are subject to being
dismissed from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said the Vatican wants more information on how that policy
will actually be carried out while still respecting an accused
priest's due-process rights under canon law.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican is also concerned about the "proper role" of local
diocesan sexual abuse review boards, Gregory said. The charter
declares that the boards must be made up of a majority of laypeople
who do not work for the diocese. It gives the boards the power to act
"both retrospectively and prospectively" on sexual abuse matters and
give advice to the local bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials did not specify what their objection to that
portion of the charter is.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Gregory said the U.S. charter's broad definition of
what constitutes sexual abuse is subject to revision. The definition
has been challenged by U.S. priests and canon lawyers as being so
sweeping that virtually anyone could be accused.</TE>
<TE>   The definition goes beyond what civil law considers to be sexual
abuse. The charter says that sexual abuse includes "contacts or
interactions between a child and an adult when the child is being
used as an object of sexual gratification for the adult. A child is
abused whether or not this activity involves explicit force, whether
or not it involves genital or physical contact, whether or not it is
initiated by the child, and whether or not there is discernible
harmful outcome."</TE>
<TE>   The language in the U.S. policy is "at times vague and imprecise
and therefore difficult to interpret," Gregory conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, Gregory sought Friday to cast the best light
on the developments that are proving embarrassing for U.S. bishops.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this is the moment when we have to re-create the
wheel," Gregory said. "We need to make whatever adjustments in the
documents approved in Dallas [that] will be necessary to get the
recognitio."</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials did not mention anything to him in the proposed
policy that is "absolutely unacceptable," Gregory added.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Vatican said the commission could finish its
work in the 3 1/2 weeks before next month's U.S. bishops meeting was
a sign of Rome's commitment to action. "For Vatican standards, that's
a miracle," Gregory said.</TE>

<HD>Yaacov 'Zeev' Farkas, 79; Israel's Most Influential
Political Cartoonist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yaacov "Zeev" Farkas, called the founder of the political
cartoonist's art in Israel, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Farkas died Tuesday at a hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel. The
cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Before television came to Israel, politicians and other public
figures competed with each other to appear in his full-page spread in
the weekly supplement of the newspaper Haaretz. "Anyone who appeared
in the middle of that page -- not on the margins -- knew that he had
arrived, that he was really somebody," his colleague Benny Zipper
wrote in Haaretz.</LD>
<TE>   The weekly cartoon, an intricate mixture of dozens of characters,
objects and symbols created around a central theme, appeared for
decades, always including an oval-faced, jug-eared self-portrait.
After the weekly page was discontinued in the 1980s, Farkas continued
drawing daily editorial cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   Many public figures, past and present, have caricatures of
themselves, drawn by Farkas, framed and hanging on their walls,
Zipper wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hungary in 1923, Farkas survived the Nazi death camp at
Dachau, where thousands of Jews were killed during World War II. In
1947, he came to what was then British Mandatory Palestine, and in
1952 he became the editorial cartoonist for the newspaper Omer. He
began drawing political cartoons for Haaretz in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   He always signed his cartoons "Zeev," with a tiny portrait of
himself holding a huge artist's brush dripping with black paint.</TE>
<TE>   His kindness was legendary. "He was never mean to anyone," Zipper
wrote. In 1972 President Richard Nixon wrote him a letter of thanks
for a cartoon in Haaretz showing the beleaguered U.S. leader carrying
a cross and surrounded by enemies.</TE>
<TE>   One of Farkas' most famous cartoons, published in 1979 at the time
of the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, showed the dove
of peace posing as a magician and producing three tiny figures out of
a hat: Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and President Jimmy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Farkas was awarded the Israel Prize for Journalism. In
explaining its decision to honor a cartoonist rather than a writer,
the Israel Prize jury wrote: "He established the daily political
cartoon as an essential and inseparable aspect of Israeli journalism
in its task of expressing matters of distinct public importance."</TE>
<TE>   Farkas is survived by a daughter.</TE>

<HD>Grace Hamblin, 94; Secretary to the Churchills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grace Hamblin, the trusted private secretary to Winston Churchill and
his wife, Clementine, has died. She was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Hamblin died Tuesday at her home in Westerham, in southern
England, said a spokeswoman for Chartwell House, the former Churchill
residence.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of the head gardener at an estate near Chartwell,
Hamblin began working part time for Churchill and his wife at
Chartwell Manor in 1932. She was nicknamed "Hambone" by the Churchill
children. She later became a full-time employee whose tasks included
typing manuscripts for Winston Churchill.</LD>
<TE>   When Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Hamblin moved to
London and took on the additional role of secretary to his wife,
accompanying her on several trips abroad.</TE>
<TE>   She accompanied Clementine Churchill to North Africa when the
prime minister became seriously ill at the villa of Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower outside Carthage. When the Germans surrendered in Europe,
the two women, who had just completed a journey across the Soviet
Union for the Red Cross, toasted the victory with champagne at
Britain's Embassy in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Hamblin returned to Chartwell, which she continued
to manage when Churchill regained power in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   When Church left office again in 1955, Hamblin was made an officer
of the Order of British Empire. When Chartwell passed to the National
Trust, a preservation group, she became its first curator and helped
re-create its atmosphere of the family home.</TE>

<HD>Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, 63; Led Foundation for
Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, the president of the William Randolph
Hearst Foundation and the granddaughter of publishing magnate William
Randolph Hearst, died Wednesday in Los Angeles of cancer. She was 63.</LD>
<LD>   She came from a long line of publishers and philanthropists and
followed the example of her great-grandmother, Phoebe Apperson
Hearst, who was committed to children's education and co-founded the
Parent Teachers Assn., or the PTA.</LD>
<LD>   As president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation since 2001,
Boudjakdji developed its two main programs, one supporting journalism
education for college students, the other fostering government
studies for high school students, including a week spent in
Washington, D.C., for a close look at Capitol Hill.</LD>
<TE>   She also turned more of the foundation's resources to after-school
programs. Separately, she founded the Boudjakdji Foundation for
education and the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Boudjakdji was born in Los Angeles in 1939, the only daughter of
David Whitmire Hearst and Hope Chandler Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1950s, her father was publisher of the family-owned
Los Angeles Evening Herald-Express, and she also pursued an interest
in journalism. After her graduation from UCLA, she covered the United
Nations for the Hearst Headline News, now known as the Hearst News
Service. In 1964, she married Raouf Boudjakdji, Algerian ambassador
to the U.N. The couple spent more than 10 years living abroad.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, after their four children were grown and the family had

Harper's Bazaar, the Hearst-owned fashion magazine. She also assisted
her father, who was vice president and later president of the William
Randolph Hearst Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Boudjakdji joined the board of the Hearst Corp., a
conglomerate of newspapers, magazines and cable networks. She also
joined the Hearst Foundation for charitable giving that year.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine listed Boudjakdji among the 400 richest people in
America in 2002, ranking her 256th, with a net worth of $900 million.</TE>

<HD>Proposed Sale of Water Creates Divisions in Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BRAWLEY, Calif. -- Long before the sun crests the Chocolate
Mountains, the Imperial Valley zanjeros are setting the water gates
on the 1,675 miles of canals that are the arteries of this desert
farming oasis at the southernmost fringe of California.</LD>
<LD>   Even today, a century after the original settlers subdued the land
and planted the first winter vegetables here, the valley's
diminishing clan of Anglo farmers still rises to meet the irrigation
district zanjeros, or ditch riders, on the canal banks.</LD>
<LD>   "Most farmers want to make sure they're getting the water they
ordered," said John Pierre Menvielle, a third-generation vegetable
and hay grower. But more than that, said the raspy-voiced Menvielle,
the dawn encounters on the canal banks are a link with the past and
an affirmation of a way of life in one of the country's most
productive agricultural areas, known as America's "Winter Salad
Bowl."</LD>
<TE>   Steeped in agrarian traditions, this desert valley is about to
give up a large share of its most precious commodity in a water deal
that will make some people rich, cost others jobs, and return some
fields to the dunes and dust from which they emerged. The prospect
has created sharp divisions in a society that was once proudly united
in a battle to make the desert bloom.</TE>
<TE>   There are ethnic overtones to the tensions. Many of the biggest
farmers hope to secure a windfall from the water transfer, while
Mexican American leaders worry about the displacement of farm
workers. They argue that the transfer should not be approved unless
profits from the water sale are invested in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as residents' leaders wrangle over the future, their beloved
image of a bucolic valley is belied by multiplying trade connections
with Mexico and the arrival of speculators whose interests lie more
with the market value of water than in maintaining a traditional way
of life.</TE>
<TE>   The number of farming families has declined from more than 2,000
in the 1970s to fewer than 400 today. More than half of the valley's
agricultural land is held by absentee owners.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement reached this week by key California water
agencies, billions of gallons of Colorado River water would be
shifted annually from Imperial Valley farms to urban San Diego
County. The agreement is the state's best hope of avoiding a federal
cutback of its ration of Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is no guarantee that the Imperial Irrigation District
will approve the transfer. Its members are split on the issue, which
will be discussed Tuesday at a board meeting in El Centro.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial County is feeling mounting pressure from Sacramento and
Washington to approve the transfer by the end of the year. Without
it, California could face an abrupt reduction in the surplus delivery
from the Colorado River it has been receiving for 29 years but to
which it is not legally entitled. Imperial Valley farms get most of
the water -- about one-fifth of the river's total flow -- that
California takes.</TE>
<TE>   If the transfer is approved, it will be the first time in history
that the proud farmers here agreed to idle land to make water
available for California coastal cities. "Fallowing" used to be the
"f" word here and is still an obscenity to many people.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Imperial Valley was settled in the early 1900s, its
farmers have staved off one threat after another to their way of
life: canals hopelessly clogged with silt, encroachment by
hyperactive hydrilla water plants and a U.S. Supreme Court battle
that threatened to break up their family lands.</TE>
<TE>   They retaliated with back-breaking work, savvy lawyers and sterile
carp to eat the hydrilla. To this day, a handful of prosperous Anglo
farmers and businessmen control the civic and political institutions
in an area with a majority Latino population and more people living
below the poverty line than any other county in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Now, for many here, the fallowing challenge is the greatest test
of all.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a recent town hall meeting to discuss the San Diego
water transfer, Brawley entomologist Clyde Shields fought back tears
as he expressed his fears for the valley where his family has lived
since his grandfather settled here in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   "If the IID [Imperial Irrigation District] allows fallowing," said
Shields, pausing to collect himself, "before long there will be more
fallowing and the Imperial Valley will be dried up."</TE>
<TE>   In the back of many minds is the specter of water transfers gone
bad, such as the one that turned the green Owens Valley into a
dustbowl so that Los Angeles could have water.</TE>
<TE>   But Shields' lament, received in gloomy silence in the Hidalgo
Society Hall here, was for an Imperial Valley that in many ways no
longer exists.</TE>
<TE>   For all its traditions -- morning encounters on the canals, family
gatherings at the Stockmen's Club, gripe sessions at Brunner's Coffee
Shop in El Centro, rodeos and high school sports rivalries -- the
Imperial Valley is in a state of transition.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the farmers are now college-educated agri-businessmen with
homes on the coast and land holdings in Mexico. Some are no longer
farmers at all but water speculators who have made a long "play" on
exactly what is happening: the lucrative conversion of irrigation
water.</TE>
<TE>   According to the terms of the pending agreement, they would be
paid up to $400 a cubic acre for water that cost them just $15.50.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the region has benefited from the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which has turned the sleepy border city of Calexico
into a dynamic goods distribution center, clearly the most
economically vital place in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   A broad new high-tech border crossing outside Calexico eases the
way for trucks carrying tomatoes, asparagus and other labor-intensive
crops from Mexico right through the Imperial Valley on their way
north to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 maquiladoras (border factories) in the booming
Mexican sister city produce goods for foreign managers, many of whom
live in the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The United Food and Commercial Workers and Teamsters unions have
successfully organized the Brawley Beef packing plant where 725
ex-farm workers toil for pay well above the minimum-wage field work
and receive full benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican American population now accounts for more than 75% of
the county's 140,000 residents. The children of people who aspired no
higher than zanjero now compete for a majority on the irrigation
district board.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal in life, and I will die happy when it happens," said
political activist Daniel Santillan of Calexico, "is to have three
Hispanics [out of five members] on the county Board of Supervisors
and the board of the Imperial Irrigation District."</TE>
<TE>   Anglo politicians complain that you can't get elected without a
Latino surname.</TE>
<TE>   Social tension was evident at the town hall meeting earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   As they portrayed a valley under siege by thirsty urbanites,
several speakers adopted a reverent tone, alternating righteous
indignation with David vs. Goliath imagery,</TE>
<TE>   A sign at Imperial Irrigation District headquarters says it all:
"Water is King, and Here Is Its Kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we celebrated 100 years of bringing water to this
valley," Andy Horne, a member of the irrigation district board, told
the crowd. "We were the pioneers. Hoover Dam was build at the
insistence of the Imperial Valley."</TE>
<TE>   "But times have changed under pressure from the 17 million people
on the coast," Horne said. "Now we are considered the deep pockets
when it comes to water."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting broke up inconclusively. No vote was taken on the San
Diego water transfer, but there was a palpable sense of resignation.
The general feeling seemed to be that no matter what was said, the
valley was destined to change in unpredictable, discomforting
directions.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has crossed the Coastal Range on Interstate 8 from San
Diego is struck by the emerald-green carpet of farm land spread
incongruously on the desert floor.</TE>
<TE>   There are thick groves of date palms that would seem at home in
southern Iraq or an oasis on the Arabian peninsula. The image of the
Imperial Valley as a hardscrabble land of rugged settlers who endured
ferocious heat and countless calamities to tame the desert was
already established by the early part of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   A 1911 novel by popular writer Harold Bell Wright, "The Winning of
Barbara Worth," was set here and described the hardships faced by the
pioneers. The moralistic book, subtitled "The Ministry of
Capitalism," sold nearly 2 million copies and was a schoolboy
favorite of Ronald Reagan during his Midwestern childhood.</TE>
<TE>   It was later produced as a popular play and a 1927 silent movie,
the first screen appearance for Gary Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   But farming in the valley, as well as the politics, has changed
radically.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch at the Stockmen's Club in Brawley, Earle Sperber, the
owner of Sperber Farms, described how some lettuce growers made $1
million last year for each 75 acres they planted in the crop.
Proposing an aerial tour of the valley to a pair of visitors, Sperber
offered the use of his own airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Although most farmers live modestly in the valley, a few also
maintain more ostentatious digs on the coast, including homes in
Newport Beach and La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, speculators hoping to cash in on the huge price
differential between the cost of valley water and its potential sale
price have laid claim several large farms.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest is US Filter, a subsidiary of French conglomerate
Vivendi Environment. US Filter owns 42,000 acres of valley farmland,
about 10% of the total under irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   US Filter bought the Western Farm holdings from the Fort
Worth-based Bass family for $200 million in 1997 after the Texas
family failed in its attempts to sell water directly to the San Diego
Water District.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Stanczak, US Filter vice president and general counsel, said
the company's moment may have arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Today there is so much pressure on the Imperial Valley from so
many different constituencies, including the Department of Interior
and neighboring water district, that they are between a rock and a
hard place."</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters are significant splits in the farming
community.</TE>
<TE>   "The farmers themselves are very divided," agreed labor union
consultant John Kennedy, who has spent much of the past five years in
the valley working with the United Food and Commercial Workers and
Teamsters unions to successfully organize the 725 employees at the
Brawley Beef plant.</TE>
<TE>   "There is one group that feels that water is a commodity that is
their right to sell," Kennedy said. "There is another group that
feels an almost spiritual bond with the land and that they are
engaged in the noble occupation of feeding the world."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the larger landowners who believe they should be able to
profit from selling water have grown impatient with the irrigation
district and formed the Imperial Valley Water Users Assn., which now
claims to represent about half the valley's farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Looming in the background is the increasing sentiment that any
money that comes into the valley for water should be shared by all
the residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," said Santillan, the Calexico community organizer whose
family came here from Mexico in 1918, "the big water reclamation
projects that created the valley were built with taxpayers' money. So
I figure any money made from the water belongs to everyone."</TE>

<CX>   Water transfer -- A story in Section A on Saturday about a pending
water transfer between the Imperial Irrigation District and San Diego
incorrectly stated that the water cost up to $400 a cubic acre. The
correct figure is $400 an acre-foot, the approximate amount of water
consumed by two average families in a year.</CX>

<HD>House Arrest Conditions Eased for Alleged Rapist</HD>
<DH>Judge modifies terms, but refuses to lower $1-million bail
for Andrew Luster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this week, accused rapist Andrew Luster urged a court to
release him from house arrest at his oceanfront home in Mussel
Shoals.</LD>
<LD>   For two years, his lawyers argued, an electronic monitoring device
has confined Luster to the modest beach house. He can't surf. He
can't visit his two children in Los Angeles. And he can't meet with
his attorneys at a law office in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   "He is stuck in his house 24 hours a day," attorney Roger Jon
Diamond argued. "It's a nightmare."</LD>
<TE>   One Luster should awaken from soon.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley agreed to
modify the terms of Luster's house arrest to allow him to roam freely
between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old defendant, whose trial begins next month, must
remained confined to his home the rest of the time. Court appearances
are an exception.</TE>
<TE>   The great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, Luster was
arrested two years ago on suspicion of using a date rape drug, gamma
hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, to sedate women and sexually assault them at
his beach house.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of the home, detectives found videotapes that
allegedly depict Luster engaging in sex acts with unconscious women.
He is charged with rape, sodomy, oral copulation, drug possession and
poisoning. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 150 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Bail has been a frequent dispute in the case. After his arrest in
July 2000, Luster was jailed in lieu of an unprecedented $10-million
bond after prosecutors portrayed him as a flight risk with deep
assets and foreign contacts.</TE>
<TE>   An appellate court later lowered bail to $1 million and ordered
house arrest with specified conditions. Presiding Superior Court
Judge Bruce Clark was appointed as the appellate court referee to
resolve any disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Luster asked Clark to eliminate the house arrest
and reduce bail -- a request opposed by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Clark deferred the matter to the appellate court, which in turn
ordered it resolved by the trial court.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the bail request landed before Riley, who will preside
over Luster's trial.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold urged the judge to keep Luster's
bail and house arrest in place, arguing the defendant remains a
flight risk and a danger to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "The man is a serial rapist," Wold argued.</TE>
<TE>   Riley took the matter under consideration and issued a written
ruling Friday. While modifying the terms of the house arrest, the
judge refused to lower Luster's bail. Other terms remain in effect.
Luster must continue to submit to random drug tests and searches of
his property. He is forbidden from contacting the alleged rape
victims.</TE>
<TE>   And his passport remains in the custody of the county sheriff.</TE>

<HD>Abe Most, 82; Played With Brown, Dorsey</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Abe Most, a swing clarinetist known for his work with the Les Brown
and Tommy Dorsey bands in the 1940s and '50s, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Most, who later fashioned a career as a studio musician, died Oct.
10 of heart failure at Kaiser Hospital in Panorama City, according to
his wife, Gussie.</LD>
<LD>   Born in New York City, Most began playing the clarinet at the age
of 9. He began playing professionally at 16 and later led his own
groups at Kelly's Stable and the Hickory House, two New York City
jazz spots.</LD>
<TE>   In 1939, Most joined the Les Brown orchestra for a two-year stint
playing alto saxophone and singing.</TE>
<TE>   Most served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and was
stationed in Southern California. After the war, he settled in the
Los Angeles area. He worked with his own group and briefly with the
Tommy Dorsey orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   From the 1950s through the '70s, he made a steady living in the
studio orchestra at 20th Century Fox. He worked in studio bands led
by Nelson Riddle, Billy May and Henry Mancini.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, he played the clarinet on "The Swing Era," a
15-volume set of recordings from Time-Life that recreated swing-era
numbers of the great bands of the '30s, '40s and '50s. Most played
all the clarinet solos, emulating the work of Benny Goodman, Artie
Shaw, Woody Herman and Matty Matlock.</TE>
<TE>   Through much of the last 30 years, Most played in tribute bands to
Shaw and Goodman. He was a popular figure in traditional jazz
festivals up and down the coast.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Most is survived by his three children,
Cameo, Mark and Debbie; three grandchildren; and three
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   He is also survived by his younger brother, saxophonist Sam Most.</TE>

<HD>San Diego State Asked to Stop Using Padres Owner's Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson and Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego Padres owner John Moores, stung by a student newspaper
column on his financial and legal troubles, has asked San Diego State
University to stop using his name as a prominent benefactor of the
school, a Padres official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But Moores, who has donated more than $30 million to San Diego
State since 1994, has not broken ties to the university or withdrawn
his financial support, according to Bob Vizas, vice chairman of the
baseball team.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'Look, take my name off stuff. I don't want my name used
in affiliation with the university if it's going to be a lightning
rod for controversy,' " Vizas said Moores told university President
Stephen Weber and other officials.</LD>
<TE>   Moores, who also heads the UC Board of Regents, is the chairman of
Peregrine Systems, a San Diego software company that is under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Justice Department for questionable accounting practices. The company
has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Moores did not return calls for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   His office referred calls to Vizas.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres official said Moores was upset by an Oct. 10 column in
the student-run Daily Aztec, which detailed his recent difficulties
and argued that the university should reconsider its affiliation with
Moores. The headline on the column by senior Lenn Bell said the
school's athletics should not "be the beneficiary of corporate
greed."</TE>
<TE>   But Vizas denied a San Diego Union-Tribune report Friday that
Moores had broken ties to the university. "It's one thing to use
someone's name, and another to support it financially and
philosophically, and that he still does," Vizas said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Friday, Weber did not comment directly on the
controversy but praised Moores and his wife, Becky, as "among the
most generous friends San Diego State University has ever known."</TE>
<TE>   A university spokesman noted that a plaque honoring the Mooreses
on the school's baseball stadium, along with several plaques naming
other benefactors, had recently been removed for cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Jack Beresford said he did not know when or whether they
would be replaced.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Zara Nelsova, 84, a prominent cellist perhaps best known for her work
with the composer Ernest Bloch, died Oct. 10 at her home in New York
City. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Winnipeg, Canada, to Russian parents, Nelsova began
lessons at the age of 5. She made her solo debut at the age of 12
with the London Symphony Orchestra. She later returned to Canada,
where she became the principal cellist of the Toronto Symphony
Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   She studied with Gregor Piatigorsky and Pablo Casals and made her
U.S. debut in 1942.</LD>
<TE>   Nelsova began studying Bloch's cello works with him in the late
1940s. He dedicated two of his three suites for unaccompanied cello
to her. Nelsova toured for several years with American concert
pianist Grant Johannesen, who was her husband for several years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wu-chi Liu, 95, a leading scholar of Chinese literature whose work
helped American readers understand the writings of his homeland, died
of causes associated with old age Oct. 3 at his home in Menlo Park.</LD>
<LD>   Liu published more than 25 books, including the anthology
"Sunflower Splendor: Three Thousand Years of Chinese Poetry." On its
release in 1975, a New York Times reviewer termed it the "largest
and, on the whole, best anthology of translated Chinese poems to have
appeared in a Western language." The anthology is often used as a
text in schools.</LD>
<LD>   Liu was born in Shanghai. He took university classes in Beijing
before coming to the United States in 1927. He earned his bachelor's
degree in literature at Lawrence University and his doctorate in
English literature at Yale.</LD>
<TE>   He returned to China to teach shortly before World War II. After
the war he returned to the United States and taught literature,
philosophy and drama at several institutions, including Yale, the
University of Pittsburgh and Indiana University, where he helped
establish the East Asia Language and Literature Department.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring in 1976, he moved to Menlo Park and for several
years edited the journal of the International Southern Society.</TE>

<HD>Aileen Soule, 96; Won Gold Medal in 1920 Olympics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Swimmer and diver Aileen Riggin Soule, the oldest female U.S. Olympic
gold medalist, has died at 96.</LD>
<LD>   Soule, who won her gold medal at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp,
Belgium, at the age of 14, died Thursday night at a Honolulu nursing
home.</LD>
<LD>   In 1924, Soule competed in the Paris Olympics and won the silver
in the springboard, as well as a bronze in the 100-meter backstroke.</LD>
<TE>   "Swimming was her life and joy," stepdaughter Patti Anderson said.
"It kept her young."</TE>
<TE>   Soule was born May 2, 1906, in Newport, R.I., and spent her
childhood in New York. She moved to Hawaii in 1957 and swam daily at
a pool or at Waikiki Beach well into her 90s.</TE>
<TE>   She and her 17 female teammates almost didn't get a chance to
compete in the 1920 Olympics because officials were concerned about
them traveling with the team's 331 men. Chaperones softened those
fears, and the women took care of any concerns that they weren't
athletically prepared.</TE>
<TE>   In war-impoverished Belgium, the aquatic events were held in a
muddy canal. After earning 539.9 points in the springboard
competition, she received a victory trophy from King Albert.</TE>
<TE>   Soule traveled the world on her own in the 1930s, putting on
diving exhibitions and teaching clinics.</TE>

<HD>Daniel Kelliher, 104; WWI Veteran Was Retired Firefighter</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Kelliher, 104, a veteran of World War I and also one of the
country's oldest retired firefighters, died Sunday at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Malden, Mass., Kelliher was a member of the 101st
Infantry during World War I and fought in several major battles in
Europe. In 1998, he was one of several servicemen awarded the Legion
of Honor by the French government.</LD>
<LD>   After World War I, Kelliher ran a repair shop in Boston before
joining the Medford, Mass., Fire Department in 1929. Years later, he
recalled that there had been no training period required. "They put
you on a truck and you picked it up as you went along," he told the
Medford Transcript.</LD>
<TE>   Kelliher retired as a lieutenant in 1963 after 34 years with the
department.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked 84 hours a week, day in, day out, all year long.... I
thought it was a wonderful job."</TE>
<TE>   Kelliher moved to Florida after his retirement.</TE>

<HD>Pinning Hopes on Measure F</HD>
<DH>Many in Santa Paula say city's future hinges on outcome of
initiative, which would allow development of Adams Canyon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Santa Paula, people on both sides of the Measure F battle agree on
one thing: This town needs help.</LD>
<LD>   Its downtown shopping district is struggling. It doesn't have
enough housing to accommodate natural growth. It grapples to pay its
police officers competitive salaries and to provide recreational
activities for its children.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to how the community may solve these problems,
citizens are sharply divided.</LD>
<TE>   Many say the answers hinge on the outcome of Measure F, an
initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot that would open the door for the
development of up to 2,250 homes and condominiums in Adams Canyon
northwest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the so-called Santa Paula Revitalization Measure,
proposed by Arizona-based Pinnacle Development Corp., say such
suburban development is the only way to jolt Santa Paula out of
economic stagnation.</TE>
<TE>   A large housing project would bring jobs, they say, as well as
residents with more disposable income.</TE>
<TE>   "When more people come here, there will be a trickle-down effect,"
said Greg Boyd, general manager for the Ranch at Santa Paula, the
name of the development that would be built if Measure F passes. "The
whole economy expands."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, including a growing number of citizen activists,
want the community to grow by investing in its existing city core.</TE>
<TE>   They champion a "new urbanist" design philosophy that pushes for
converting dilapidated buildings and vacant lots downtown into new
housing. That would bring pedestrians to suffering retail shops and
attract new employers by providing a vibrant, traditional-town
environment, said Mike Miller, a leading activist against Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to manifest Santa Paula's potential," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adams Canyon, with its citrus groves, herds of grazing cattle and
oaks scattered between rugged hillsides, provides a serene backdrop
to the increasingly heated debate over its future.</TE>
<TE>   The 5,413-acre canyon is designated for residential use in the
city's General Plan, but a growth boundary approved by voters in 2000
requires a citizens' vote before any development can occur there.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Measure F is asking voters to amend the growth
boundary to include Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   While the initiative itself doesn't approve any housing -- that
job remains with the City Council -- its passage would essentially
endorse the kind of residential development described in the General
Plan.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for 1,980 single-family homes, 180 condominiums, 90
apartments, two schools, hotels and a 150,000-square-foot strip mall.
If that development was approved and the land annexed by Santa Paula,
it would double the geographic size of the city.</TE>
<TE>   According to an economic study completed by Pinnacle in May, such
a project would result in $44 million spent annually in Santa Paula
and $2.5 million in net revenue to the city from development fees and
property and sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle executives are working with Arnold R. Dahlberg of San
Diego, who owns the Adams Canyon land. Although they make no secret
of their intent to pursue development in the canyon, they have not
yet proposed a specific project.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said that's because the developer wants to work with the
community in crafting the right plan. And it doesn't make sense, he
said, to spend time and money on planning and engineering studies if
voters decide they do not want to expand into Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the lack of a real plan has become a chief rallying point
for opponents, who argue that Pinnacle should have brought a
development proposal--complete with environmental studies--to the
City Council before taking it to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Our challenge to them is to be upfront about what they're doing,"
said attorney Jim Procter, another organizer in the campaign against
Measure F. "They need to tell people what they have in mind before
[the people] cast their ballots."</TE>
<TE>   Also, opponents say, it's unfair to sell Measure F using economic
benefit figures based on a plan that does not officially exist.</TE>
<TE>   If studies end up showing that only 1,000 homes are feasible in
the canyon, for example, the economic projections that were the basis
for the campaign also would change.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, opponents believe a large bedroom community in the canyon
could end up being a drain on city coffers, taking money away from
efforts to revitalize the town center and driving people to do their
shopping elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another contentious issue in the debate is the idea of "local
control."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd and other Pinnacle officials contend that Santa Paula will
lose control over what happens in Adams Canyon if voters reject
Measure F because, they say, the company would attempt to develop the
land through the county.</TE>
<TE>   County regulations allow for a maximum of one single-family home
per 10 acres in areas zoned as open space. Pinnacle officials said
that means they could build up to 500 luxury homes.</TE>
<TE>   City residents wouldn't get to vote on the project, and they would
lose the opportunity to force Pinnacle to include affordable housing
and new parks, Boyd said. The city would also lose the financial
benefit of development.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, however, dispute that local control is an issue at all.
Under SOAR open-space protection laws, they say, voters have control
now, which is why Measure F is on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long also said the developers'
argument is misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that 500 homes could be built in Adams Canyon is "not
plausible -- period," she said. In fact, Long said, the most that
could be built there is 100 homes, and even that would be difficult
because of the water and sewer lines that would be required.</TE>
<TE>   Driving his SUV on a small dirt road that winds through the Adams
Canyon property, Boyd said any decision to develop the land would
involve a trade-off -- the creation of more housing versus the
impacts on traffic and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said he believes the state will soon begin imposing penalties
on cities that are not meeting their fair share of California's
housing demand. Santa Paula has added 10 to 15 new houses a year in
the last decade, while its population has grown by more than 3,500.</TE>
<TE>   "What's more important?" Boyd asked. "Saving a tree or providing
someone with a place to live?"</TE>
<TE>   To Miller and Procter, both are equally important. And both can be
achieved, they said, if city leaders and citizens decide that's what
they want and work together.</TE>
<TE>   Their group, Imagine Santa Paula, has a vision for the city that
would include aggressive "infill" development to bring more people
closer to downtown, where they could walk to shops, civic buildings
and public spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Changing zoning laws so that they are more conducive to
higher-density residential development is one way of increasing the
value of underused land downtown and attracting developers, Miller
said. Once the housing is there, the people will follow, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of Measure F, including city Planning Commissioner
Gary Nasalroad, are skeptical of such an approach.</TE>
<TE>   He is not opposed to the kind of new urbanism that Measure F
opponents are pitching, he said, but he isn't confident that it could
actually work.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had someone with millions of dollars to come in and buy up
much of downtown to revitalize it, that would be great," Nasalroad
said. "I think it's going to be difficult to attract that kind of
investment in our community."</TE>
<TE>   He also said money generated by a large development such as the
one that could occur in Adams Canyon may be the only way for the city
to meet its needs, including more parks and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Procter said they are not willing to give up on Santa
Paula just yet.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most Ventura County cities, Santa Paula is not overrun with
suburban development, so it still has a chance to implement the
principles of smart growth, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not bleary-eyed utopianism. It's happening all over the
country," he said. "At stake is an opportunity to move forward in
Santa Paula and do something different."</TE>

<HD>What's Red and 6 Blocks Long? Angels-Loving Mob</HD>
<DH>The faithful flood the streets of Downtown Disney for a pep
rally on the eve of the opening World Series game. 'The curse is
gone,' declares a player.</DH>

<LD>In what the master of ceremonies described as "a red sea of lava"
nearly six blocks long, several thousand Angels fans took to the
streets of Downtown Disney on Friday for a pep rally to usher in
their team's first-ever World Series appearance today against the San
Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   "The curse is gone," former Angels second baseman Bobby Grich told
the cheering fans gathered for what was billed as "The Official
Anaheim Angels World Series Pep Rally."</LD>
<LD>   Grich continued: "The thunder sticks beat the curse right out of
here."</LD>
<TE>   The rally was conducted in true Disney style, with fireworks,
confetti, live music, cheerleaders, a battery of huge video monitors
and red Angels T-shirts almost to the person. There were paper hats
with halos attached, a smattering of stuffed Rally Monkeys and 10,000
pairs of thunder sticks, the plastic, tube-shaped noisemakers that
have become familiar symbols of the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We started planning last Sunday night," said Tom Brocato, a
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co., which owns the Angels. "This is a
great celebration of America, which is what baseball is all about and
what Disney is all about."</TE>
<TE>   He stopped short of estimating how many fans were in attendance,
saying it was "hard to gauge." But the company had brought 10,000
halo hats and 10,000 pairs of thunder sticks to give away, he said,
and by 6:30 p.m. every last one was gone. "We wanted to create a lot
of energy to rally behind our team," Brocato said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Grich, the event was attended by former Angels
players Kirk McCaskill and Mark Langston, as well as Jackie Autry,
the widow of founding team owner and legendary cowboy singer Gene
Autry. "You're the 10th man on the field," she told the fans. "So
when we go out there to play the Giants, I want you to scream and
bang those sticks till they can't stand it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the crowd seemed to be getting a head start.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually a Dodgers fan," said Richard Valera, 35, of
Westminster, "but I wanted to be a part of this. I think the group of
guys they have here in the Angels is great. They've brought
excitement back to the game."</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Rosas of Ontario said she felt inspired by the team's
first ascension to World Series play.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," she said. "It's been a long time coming."</TE>
<TE>   And Crystal Stevens, 19, of Orange, a psychic reader who with her
husband had just spent $1,000 for a pair of tickets to tonight's
opening game, couldn't gush enough about the team. "They deserve it,"
she said. "It's nice to see so many fans."</TE>
<TE>   Did her psychic abilities give her any special insight into what
lies ahead?</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely going to win," she predicted. "I feel good for
the Angels. I think changing their color to red brought them to the
next level."</TE>

<LD>The head of Cleveland's Roman Catholic schools, who was a leading
proponent of the city's landmark school voucher program, has
announced she will step down in June.</LD>
<LD>   Sister Carol Anne Smith, 54, played a key role in the fight for
vouchers that culminated in June with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that state money can go to Cleveland children who want to use
vouchers to attend religious schools.</LD>
<LD>   "Her leadership was absolutely essential to the Catholic
educational story in Cleveland," said Michael Guerra, president of
the National Catholic Education Assn. in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   The majority of the 51 schools participating in the city's voucher
program are Catholic schools.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who belongs to the Sisters of Humility of Mary, said she is
leaving to seek new challenges. A search committee has been formed to
find a new superintendent.</TE>

<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Rabbi David Ellenson, a prominent scholar in the Los Angeles Jewish
community for many years, has been inaugurated as the eighth
president of the school that trains clergy, educators and others for
service in Judaism's Reform movement.</LD>
<LD>   A ceremony for Ellenson was held Sunday at a synagogue in
Cincinnati, where the headquarters of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion is located. The 127-year-old school has three
other campuses, in Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York.</LD>
<LD>   Ellenson was a professor at the Los Angeles campus before taking
the presidency of the school. He has written and lectured extensively
on modern Jewish history, ethics and thinking, covering such subjects
as medical ethics and conversion to Judaism.</LD>
<TE>   "Our students internalize the history and memory of the Jewish
past into their very being," Ellenson said. "This knowledge inspires
them to feel a responsibility to the past and gives them the courage
to respond creatively in their own voices to the demands of the
present."</TE>
<TE>   A survey completed last year found that 26% of the 3,727 Jewish
congregations in the United States are Reform.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 10-month investigation by the Connecticut attorney general said
sloppy accounting practices at an Episcopal divinity school allowed
money to be misspent on personal expenses when it should have gone
toward scholarships.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal said reforms and reparations are
needed to ensure that Berkeley Divinity School does not "continue to
engage in practices that place its charitable assets at risk."</LD>
<LD>   The school, closely affiliated with Yale University, came under
fire last year after an internal Yale audit found "a complete lack of
internal controls" on spending. Former Dean William Franklin received
personal loans, which apparently were not paid back, and money for
his daughter's tuition, dry cleaning and a trip to Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Franklin resigned on Jan. 1, but school officials insisted he was
not fired. Bishop Frederick Borsch, the acting dean, told Episcopal
News Service that "nothing illegal or seriously unethical was done,
but poor judgment was used, and poor standards were in place."</TE>

<HD>No Basis for Women as Deacons, Panel Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>An authoritative panel of advisors to the Vatican Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith has found no historical or theological
basis for the ordination of women as deacons.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Georges Cottier, secretary of the International
Theological Commission, said in a statement that the panel determined
that there is no exact precedent for female deacons, and the office
of deacon is closely linked to the priesthood, from which women are
excluded.</LD>
<LD>   Cottier made clear, however, that the commission's conclusions are
only advisory.</LD>
<TE>   "It is now within the competence of the Magisterium [the Roman
Catholic Church's teaching authority] to pronounce authoritatively on
the issue in the light of the elements that the
historical-theological research of the International Theological
Commission has been permitted to put in evidence," Cottier's
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Cottier, a Dominican who is theologian to the papal household,
said the panel undertook more than five years of research into the
question of female deacons at the request of the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 members of the commission, presided over by Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, prefect of the congregation, approved the findings at a
meeting in late September.</TE>
<TE>   Cottier said the most important conclusion to emerge from the
study was that the deaconesses of the early church could not be
compared to deacons. "Both the rite of institution and the explicit
function of the deaconesses distinguished them from ordained
deacons," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to church history, the deaconesses of the early church,
who often were widows, helped converts, assisted in baptisms, read
the Scriptures to the community and distributed Communion to other
deaconesses when a priest was not available. They were instituted
with a liturgical rite, but the Council of Nicaea stated in 325 that
they were laity and not ordained.</TE>
<TE>   The Second Vatican Council, in the early 1960s, encouraged the
church to reestablish the status of deacons as part of the
hierarchical structure of the Roman Catholic Church after centuries
of considering the position only a stage leading to priesthood.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a heated dispute over ordination of gays and lesbians, the
Presbyterian Church (USA) is not in a "full-blown constitutional
crisis" and needs no special assembly to settle internal conflicts,
church leaders said.</LD>
<LD>   Church officials hope to quell a petition drive for an
unprecedented special assembly to deal with pastors and churches who
have openly defied a church law that bans the ordination of
non-celibate gays and lesbians.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Metherell, a church elder from Laguna Beach, said the
assembly is needed because denominational leaders have turned a blind
eye to open defiance of the church constitution. Such defiance
represents "a clear and present danger to our constitution. A
constitution that is not enforced is no constitution at all,"
Metherell wrote in his petition.</LD>
<TE>   A special assembly can be called by 25 ministers and 25 elders
from at least 15 regional presbyteries.</TE>

<HD>Zoning Can Bar Houses of Worship, Judges Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Towns can prevent houses of worship from opening in residential areas
in an attempt to control traffic and noise, a federal appeals court
has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The case is one of a series of lawsuits in which religious
organizations have sought to overturn zoning rules in cities and
towns nationwide -- including several in California -- using a
federal law passed in 2000. The law is designed to prevent towns and
cities from using zoning laws to block the building of houses of
worship.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling this week by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia overturned a lower court ruling that had sided with a
Jewish congregation seeking to open a synagogue in a Philadelphia
suburb. The town's zoning law permitted kennels, riding clubs and
golf courses -- but excluded churches -- in residential areas.
Congregation Kol Ami sought to buy an 11-acre former monastery that
now houses a small order of Catholic nuns.</LD>
<TE>   The three-judge panel said in its opinion that large churches or
temples can cause parking and traffic problems. Although churches
once were seen as an integral aspect of most neighborhoods, "we do
not believe land use planners can assume anymore that religious uses
are inherently compatible with family and residential uses," the
judges said.</TE>
<TE>   "The facts of this case illustrate why religious uses may be, in
some cases, incompatible with a place of 'quiet seclusion.' "</TE>
<TE>   The decision does not end the litigation, however. The court sent
the case back to the trial judge for further action.</TE>
<TE>   "We still feel good about our chances," said Anthony R. Picarello
Jr., an attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which
represented the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Marci A. Hamilton, the lawyer for the township in question,
Abington, said she was confident it would prevail in protecting the
zoning regulations that she says control suburban growth.</TE>
<TE>   "This case takes place at a time when religious [buildings] are
turning into '24-seven' operations," she said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate is prepared to consider a scaled-down version of President
Bush's "faith-based initiative," and a key House leader has said he
will go along, meaning a bill could reach the president's desk this
year.</LD>
<LD>   But Senate supporters said they won't go forward unless they know
they can defeat a series of amendments that sponsors say are aimed at
strengthening the separation between church and state.</LD>
<LD>   As conceived, the Bush initiative would have opened a dozen new
social programs to religious groups, which supporters say are often
best suited to offer help. But after a bitterly partisan debate in
the House, Senate leaders scaled back the legislation.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate bill now offers tax breaks to encourage charitable
giving and makes it clear that religious groups cannot be excluded
from government contracts for superficial reasons, such as a
religious name or religious symbols on display.</TE>
<TE>   The chief House sponsor, Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), said last week
he would accept the scaled-back version and support taking it to the
House floor for a vote if it passed the Senate first.</TE>
<TE>   "Half a loaf is better than going hungry," Watts said.
"Underserved communities shouldn't have to wait any longer."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said he wouldn't allow the bill to
advance without a debate over the religious nature of social services
that are paid for with tax dollars. One of his amendments would bar
proselytization with government money; another would prohibit groups
that get tax dollars from discriminating against beneficiaries or
employees of other religions.</TE>
<TE>   "There are fundamental constitutional values, and they have to be
considered," Reed said in an interview.</TE>

<HD>Campus a Microcosm of Changes in Greek Orthodoxy</HD>
<DH>Conference explores the phenomenon of recent converts
flocking to the Massachusetts theology school that trains priests in
the ancient faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>BROOKLINE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Twenty-five years ago, just about every seminarian on this campus was
a young man who spoke such fluent Greek that he could pass for native
in the cafes of Athens.</LD>
<LD>   Today, more than 20% of students at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox
School of Theology have no Greek roots. Graduates include the
spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America: a
34-year-old, blond former Southern Baptist preacher from Dallas who
changed his name from Eric to Nektarios Morrow when baptized into
Orthodoxy seven years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Seen in such light, this sacred training ground for priests who
would preserve Greek heritage through local churches has become
instead a microcosm of the changing face of Orthodoxy. A wave of
fresh interest in the ancient faith has begun to transform these
church institutions from protective ethnic enclaves into relatively
diverse centers to probe the essence of Christianity's
longest-preserved tradition.</LD>
<TE>   As congregations teem with converts in America and brace for the
spread of MTV in the Old World, Holy Cross recently hosted a
pioneering conference: "The Orthodox Churches in a Pluralistic World:
An Ecumenical Conversation." Top scholars from various denominational
backgrounds delved deeply into history, philosophy and theology with
a common goal: to help Orthodoxy thrive as one of many voices in a
changing world.</TE>
<TE>   "In a period of rapid globalization, in a world community that is
increasingly conscious of its pluralistic character, the Orthodox
Churches meet a great challenge," Archbishop Demetrios, head of the
Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, said in his keynote address.
"The word 'challenge,' however, is not to be understood with negative
connotations, but rather in the most positive and optimistic sense.
The pluralistic world is not an obstacle to Orthodoxy. It is rather
an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Parishes nationwide have already tasted some benefits of embracing
those who don't speak Greek -- or any of Orthodoxy's historic
languages. Since the early 1990s, "Introduction to Orthodoxy" courses
increasingly have filled parish halls with everyone from spiritual
seekers to newly married, interfaith couples to recent converts from
evangelical Protestantism.</TE>
<TE>   At Church of the Holy Resurrection in Allston, Mass., a flock of
the Bulgarian Orthodox Church hears an English-language liturgy from
the Rev. James Robinson, their Scotch Irish priest who converted from
the Episcopal Church 18 years ago. Hardly anyone in the pews, he
said, claims Bulgarian ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   "They're mostly American kiddos like me," Robinson said. "In the
past, it was almost impossible to separate what was Greek and what
was Orthodox because the church promoted a connection between
ethnicity and religion. But for us, we didn't grow up with the
Orthodox Church, so we can ask what it really means to be Orthodox."</TE>
<TE>   Successes with ethnic pluralism, however, have had a flip side in
the annals of modern Orthodoxy. When Serbian dictator Slobodan
Milosevic was purging Kosovo of ethnic Albanians in the 1990s, the
Serbian Orthodox Church seldom protested or provided a safe haven for
refugees. Archbishop Demetrios says the international press battered
the Serbian church with "anti-Orthodox bias."</TE>
<TE>   But World Council of Churches General Secretary Konrad Raiser said
last week that the church fell silent because as the "guardian of
national heritage and ethnic identity ....Orthodox churches have had,
and still do have, great difficulty adjusting to a pluralistic
context."</TE>
<TE>   Without a lofty theological vision, many Orthodox communities have
tried to avoid the modern world with a "retreat to the glorious
past," said Petros Vassiliadis of the University of Thessalonike in
Greece. When confronting the outside world that came to its doorstep
on Sept. 11, 2001, or in 1989 when the Iron Curtain came down, for
instance, many have revived ethnic nationalism beneath a garment of
Orthodoxy.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatives to ethnic backlash seem to be working in some pockets
of Orthodoxy, at least in the American experience.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Rev. James Katinas, co-director of admissions for
Holy Cross and Hellenic College, Orthodox Christian Fellowship groups
have become important sources of support across ethnic lines at Holy
Cross and other seminaries.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he said, Orthodoxy is being prepared to shine for a world
in need of inspiration, but it first needs to shed a few layers of
national and ethnic pride that got stuck to it over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Orthodoxy is "the saber-toothed tiger that's been deep-freezed and
preserved nicely over the centuries," Katinas said. "In speaking to
the modern world, it has a lot to say. But it's also like a beautiful
icon that's had soot all over it for years. To preserve that beauty,
you have to carefully take that tarnish off. Very carefully, you have
to take it off."</TE>

<HD>Teens' Rite of Passage Can Include Their Faith</HD>
<DH>Promise Keepers is starting a program to help what it fears
is a lost generation of evangelicals. Test run is set in Anaheim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Promise Keepers, the Christian men's movement that has drawn 5
million often-tearful males to outdoor stadiums and sports arenas
over the last 12 years, is launching a rite-of-passage offshoot for
teenage boys.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to capture what organizers fear could be a lost generation
of evangelical Christians, "Passage" uses Christian rock bands,
hip-hop artists, extreme sports exhibitions, testimonials and scores
of fast-paced videos in an attempt to reconnect teenagers with their
faith and families.</LD>
<LD>   Bill McCartney, the founder of Promise Keepers, cites survey data
to back up the claim that the percentage of Americans who say they
have accepted Christ as their savior--the hallmark of evangelical
Protestantism--has dropped sharply.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Accept Christ</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic drop was found in a poll conducted by the Billy
Graham School of Missions, which found the percentage dropping from
65% of Americans in the World War II generation to 35% in the
baby-boom generation, to 15% in Generation X and even smaller numbers
in the most recent generation of teenagers. Other surveys have found
declines, although less steep.</TE>
<TE>   "If the current trend continues, we're going to be a heathen
nation," said McCartney, who was head football coach at the
University of Colorado before retiring after the 1994 season to
devote himself full time to Promise Keepers.</TE>
<TE>   But Randy Phillips, who heads the Passage event, says a youth
revival is possible if the Christian message is repackaged in a more
relevant form.</TE>
<TE>   "The emerging generation has far more spiritual hunger than the
previous four generations," Phillips said. "But they are rejecting
the current expression of the church that's been model for them."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips has spent the last three years meeting with consultants,
youth pastors and teenagers to develop a program that would click
with a more cynical generation of boys that puts more value in
tangible relationships and actions inspired sermons from the pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was just words, why did Jesus come?" Phillips asks. "We
need an intimate connection at a heart level."</TE>
<TE>   The language of the Passage program is meant to appeal to
hormone-raging boys who are challenged to "step up to the plate" and
"become warriors for Christ."</TE>
<TE>   "In ancient times as well as today, warriors have always fought
together," the teenagers are told at the outset of their training.
"Every fighting force is organized into platoons, squadrons, or units
of some kind. By putting together this Passage group, we are forming
a kind of fighting unit--a band of brothers. This unit has a single
purpose of helping you learn to become a warrior for Christ and
successfully navigate the passage into manhood."</TE>
<TE>   Down-to-earth relationships between the boys and spiritual
mentors--fathers, uncles, big brothers or church members--are at the
core of the program, with the teenagers' spiritual advisors revealing
painful mistakes in their past in order to develop intimacy and warn
against the dangers of drugs, alcohol, premarital sex, crime and
violence.</TE>
<TE>   The second of two test runs for Passage will be held Nov. 1 to 2
at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim. The expected crowd of 14,000 will
leave the event with six weeks worth of curriculum designed to give
teenagers concrete steps to increase their commitment to their
family, church and community and also hook them up with a spiritual
mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Using informal feedback as well as surveys conducted by university
researchers, a tuned-up Passage curriculum will be given away at a
Promise Keepers conference in February that's expected to draw more
than 40,000 pastors from around the world to Bank One Ballpark in
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "What should happen after February is all over America, churches
will be implementing Passage," said McCartney. The program has the
potential to be "the most important project Promise Keepers has ever
launched," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of using the spiritual mentors is that "the men have gone
through certain life experiences that have changed them for the
better," said Joe Hernandez, the youth pastor at Mission Ebenezer
Family Church in Torrance. "Hearing about them motivates the young
guys who think, 'Maybe I don't need to go through all that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez plans to bring more than 30 teenagers to the Anaheim
event. The two-day program costs $59 for boys 18 and under, and $65
for those 18 and older. Scholarships are available.</TE>
<TE>   An academic study on the first Passage event last year in
Columbus, Ohio--and its 12-week follow-up program (since shortened to
six weeks)--shows it had deepened the teenagers' faith and other
commitments, according to the Applied Research Center of Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Rising</TE>
<TE>   Three months after the Passage event, a follow-up survey of 31
small groups in eight states showed those who strongly agreed that
Jesus is the ultimate role model for a man grew from 63% to 94%.
Those who strongly agreed that there should be no sex until marriage
rose from 63% to 75%. Similar jumps were seen in prayer time, quality
of relationships, devotion to Bible study and commitment "to make a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The results were absolutely invigorating to me," Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   More Passage events are being planned for next year, but the
organizers say the program will fail if it's not embraced and
implemented by local churches.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said one of the program's most powerful messages is
delivered when the teenagers are recognized during a church service
for graduating from Passage, a technique that has worked well for
Jewish boys honored during their bar mitzvah ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   We need to celebrate their decision to live a Christ-centered
life," Phillips said. "We need to say three things: We honor you.
We're here for you. And we're counting on you. That's what a young
man wants to hear."</TE>

<HD>Ed Rossbach, 88; Broadened Art Boundaries With Textiles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Rossbach, a pioneer of the contemporary fiber-arts movement who
pushed the boundaries of traditional textile techniques and
influenced a generation of young fiber artists, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Rossbach, a professor emeritus of design at UC Berkeley, where he
taught for 29 years, died Oct. 7 in a Berkeley hospital after a long
illness.</LD>
<LD>   The essence of Rossbach's art, as one writer put it, was in
"transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary."</LD>
<TE>   Although he used a variety of centuries-old basketry techniques,
he was a pioneer in using nontraditional, often whimsical materials,
including metal foil, plastic bread bags, Mylar, rice paper, twigs,
spray lacquer, ash splints, heat transfers, natural wood fibers,
ribbon, tape, staples, twine -- and newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Like the ancients who used readily available river reeds to make
their baskets, Rossbach found that the availability of newspaper in
contemporary society made it a particularly appealing material to
work with.</TE>
<TE>   He just happened "to like it, the texture, the sense of
ordinariness of it," he said in an interview for the 1990 book "Ed
Rossbach, 40 Years of Exploration and Innovation in Fiber Art," which
was produced for a retrospective of his work at the Textile Museum in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Of one of his baskets made of coiled newspaper, he said, "I was
not remotely interested in seeming clever or in making a statement
about newspapers in our society; yet when the baskets were finished,
the letters and words and fragments of illustrations added a peculiar
force. They seem to speak out with an undeniable message."</TE>
<TE>   "His baskets were incredible," said Inez Brooks-Myers, curator of
costume and textiles at the Oakland Museum of California and a former
student of Rossbach's.</TE>
<TE>   "He was innovative, using throwaway materials for his baskets,"
she said, "but he also was innovative in his other weaving, where he
would apply really old textile techniques in a very modern
pop-culture, provocative way.</TE>
<TE>   "The pieces he did with images of John Travolta and Mickey Mouse
were marvelous. He was a scholar and yet he enjoyed popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   Early Mickey Mouse drawings appeared periodically in Rossbach's
work; he reportedly co-opted the world's famous rodent in response to
snide remarks about his classes and occupation being "Mickey Mouse."</TE>
<TE>   Added Brooks-Myers, who studied under Rossbach in the 1970s: "He
was really a wonderful man and a marvelous teacher who listened to
his students and challenged them in the most positive way."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Edison Park, Ill., Rossbach grew up in the Chicago suburb
of LaGrange, where he displayed an early artistic bent.</TE>
<TE>   He never forgot the praise he received from his mother as a boy
when he made a card-table cloth with three designed block prints in
each corner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terribly important at a very early age, the appreciation
that someone expresses toward your work," he told a former student
who interviewed him in 1996 for her doctorate thesis.</TE>
<TE>   Rossbach earned a bachelor's degree in painting and design from
the University of Washington in Seattle in 1940 and a master's degree
in art education from Columbia University's Teacher's College in
1941.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army Signal Corps in Alaska's Aleutian Islands
during World War II and, after earning a master's of fine arts degree
in weaving and ceramics at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., in 1947, he began teaching painting and design at the
University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to earn a living," he said in the 1996 interview. "I
contemplated doing just art, but I was a shy person, and I could not
imagine myself going with a portfolio of my art."</TE>
<TE>   Rossbach, who joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1950 and retired
in 1979, received a gold medal for highest achievement in
craftsmanship from the American Craft Council.</TE>
<TE>   His fiber-artist wife, Katherine Westphal, a UC Davis emeritus
professor of design, is also considered a seminal figure in
contemporary fiber arts.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Davis Design Museum recently concluded a "retro" exhibit of
hand-painted textiles by Rossbach and Westphal from the 1950s to the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Ties That Bind," an exhibit of work by Rossbach and Westphal that
ran at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1997-98, continues to
tour the country.</TE>
<TE>   Rossbach's textiles are part of collections in numerous museums,
including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Museum of
Modern Art in New York, Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian
American Art Museum's Renwick Gallery and the Stedelijik Museum in
Amsterdam, as well as in many private collections.</TE>
<TE>   Among the books he wrote are "The Nature of Basketry," "The Art of
Paisley," "The New Basketry" and "Baskets as Textile Art."</TE>
<TE>   Rossbach is survived by his wife.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Denies Plea Bid</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley man sought to admit to woman's murder without
specifying a degree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California appellate court has denied a request by serial rapist
and accused killer Vincent Sanchez to plead guilty to murder without
specifying the degree of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled that because Sanchez is charged with first-degree
murder and special circumstance allegations that allow prosecutors to
seek the death penalty, he cannot "recast" the charge as murder
without a degree.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, released Friday by the 2nd District Court of Appeal,
upholds a ruling by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley,
who refused to let Sanchez enter the plea.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously we are very pleased with the decision," said Chief
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth, who argued the matter before
the appeals court a week ago. "We are hopeful we can move ahead to
the trial date and get this case completed."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, may try to challenge the decision,
which could delay a Jan. 13 trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we will be reviewing in the next day or two whether we
will be filing a petition to the California Supreme Court," Deputy
Public Defender Jan Helfrich said. "I think there is a good
possibility that we will."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 32, of Simi Valley is accused of gunning down Megan
Barroso, 20, of Moorpark during a rape and kidnapping attempt last
year. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers admit Sanchez killed Barroso but insist there was
no rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they contend that Sanchez, overcome with road rage, shot

on July 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   For months they have argued that state law allows their client to
plead guilty to murder without specifying a degree.</TE>
<TE>   In California, murder is divided into two categories. First-degree
involves a killing that is either planned or committed in conjunction
with another crime, such as robbery or rape. All other murders are
second-degree.</TE>
<TE>   During arguments before the appellate court, Chief Deputy Public
Defender Neil Quinn cited a statute that he said permits suspects to
plead guilty to crimes and compels judges to determine the degree.</TE>
<TE>   But three appellate justices rejected Quinn's argument. They ruled
that "murder with special circumstances is first-degree murder as a
matter of law and, therefore, is not a crime 'distinguished into
degrees.' "</TE>
<TE>   The ruling does not preclude Sanchez from pleading guilty to
first-degree murder. But Helfrich said that will not occur.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez already is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to
sex-assault charges last year.</TE>

<LD>The embattled police chief in this town has three more weeks to build
a case for why he shouldn't be fired. The City Council was poised to
send Chief Martin Monica packing on Friday, but decided after a
closed hearing to give him until Nov. 8 to present more evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Monica says he is being unfairly targeted because of a child
molestation investigation involving Sgt. Henry Pruneda, who is
married to a city councilwoman.</LD>

<LD>The California Supreme Court has decided not to hear the appeal of a
Ventura man charged with capital murder in the slaying of a woman
nine years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Schultz, 42, had challenged an appellate court ruling that
a judge erred when he dismissed the case at trial because of a filing
mishap. Prosecutors successfully argued that the judge abused his
discretion and that the error did not violate the defendant's rights.</LD>
<LD>   The case will proceed to a preliminary hearing next month.</LD>
<TE>   Schultz is accused of raping and strangling Cynthia Burger, 44,
then burglarizing her Port Hueneme townhouse and setting it on fire
in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying went unsolved for six years before a tip led
investigators to Schultz. He is charged with one count of murder
committed during a rape and burglary.</TE>

<DH>Junipero Serra High will build on a likely Indian burial
ground. City gets money in lieu of taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave Mckibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Juan Capistrano city officials have cleared the way for a planned
parochial high school to build an athletic complex on a 29-acre
parcel believed to contain an American Indian burial ground.</LD>
<LD>   Junipero Serra High School boosters had forced a special January
election, seeking voter permission to rezone the property on the
north end of town. City leaders, concerned that they might lose room
to negotiate with school officials should the initiative pass, struck
a deal this week in which the school will pay the city up to $200,000
a year in a student "head tax" and cap enrollment at 2,000.</LD>
<LD>   School officials had hoped to attract as many as 3,000 students.
The high school is scheduled to open in the fall of 2003 with about
300 to 400 ninth- and 10th-graders.</LD>
<TE>   The compromise was endorsed by David Belardes, the
state-recognized representative of the Juaneno tribe, but was
rejected by other factions of the local tribe, many who spoke at a
packed City Council meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After about three hours of debate, the council voted 3-2 to rezone
the property for an athletic complex and an adjacent parcel -- the
Sycamore Commons office complex -- for school office and class space.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the agreement, the school will include California
Native American history as part of its curriculum, permit Juaneno and
cultural activities around the school's athletic complex and dedicate
monuments on campus commemorating the tribe's religious and political
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The designated grave sites -- there are believed to be seven --
will not be disturbed by the athletic grounds, according to the
negotiated deal.</TE>
<TE>   Belardes could not be reached for comment, but tribal manager
Joyce Stanfield Perry said the school's plan "is sensitive and meets
our goals of preservation and education."</TE>
<TE>   The $200-per-student "head tax" will help make up for the tax
revenue the city would have earned had the land been developed with a
450,000-square-foot hotel and office complex most recently planned
for the site.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the original deal would have generated about $1
million a year in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was a real tough call," said Councilman David
Swerdlin, who voted for the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have that tax base, but we'll now have a site more
fitting to San Juan's ambience, with athletic fields and open space.
I'd much rather have this than 450,000-square-feet of cement."</TE>
<TE>   Since the council approved the plans, the initiative won't appear
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Serra backers had struggled to find a home for three years.</TE>

<HD>The Accidental Candidate, Dogged Simon Soldiers On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in a series profiling Bill Simon Jr.</SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The accidental candidacy of Bill Simon Jr. began in the fall of 2000,
when Simon -- staring down his 50th birthday, recovering from his
father's death, feeling a void in his life -- was hit up for a
political donation by a state Republican official who offered up the
requisite praise that fund-raisers use to lather up donors: Why don't
you run?</LD>
<LD>   Three months later, a team of Sacramento consultants was cranking
out glossy booklets featuring Simon's beaming visage and mapping out
a dark-horse strategy for him to win the Republican nomination for
governor.</LD>
<LD>   The neophyte candidate had moved to California 10 years earlier,
voted sporadically and had never been involved in state politics.</LD>
<TE>   His most prominent backer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was the lame-duck
mayor of a city 3,000 miles away who was going through a messy
divorce. And to win the GOP nomination, Simon had to get past former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   While Simon's top strategists were confident, other campaign
staffers assumed they were laboring on a lost cause.</TE>
<TE>   Implausibly, lightning struck three times. Giuliani went from
late-night TV punch line to national hero for his leadership during
the Sept. 11 attacks on New York City. Riordan ran an erratic,
unfocused campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And Gov. Gray Davis, whose top political advisor used to telephone
the Simon campaign to urge attacks on Riordan, decided to go after
the former Los Angeles mayor himself, pumping $10 million into a
barrage of negative primary ads.</TE>
<TE>   An odd mix of tentativeness and confidence, caution and
impetuousness has defined the Simon campaign, an effort that will go
down in the annals of California politics as either one of the most
ill-conceived or brilliantly daring runs for higher office the state
has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Simon could not answer some basic questions about
state policy, deferring instead to his aides. He looked so stiff and
formal in primary debates that the campaign called in a speech coach.</TE>
<TE>   But he doggedly stuck to his message and his sunny smile, trudging
up and down California while his aides mounted a stealth campaign to
nail down the conservative right wing.</TE>
<TE>   In the final two months before the March primary, as Riordan
flopped, Simon surged from 4% in the polls to an overwhelming
victory.</TE>
<TE>   It has not been easy since.</TE>
<TE>   The rookie candidate's campaign, riven by infighting, has
struggled to adjust to the demands of a general election against
Davis, a notoriously tough campaigner and champion fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign reeled as the family business was hit with a
$78-million verdict in a fraud lawsuit, since overturned, and tax
controversies. Simon laid off half his staff and went through four
campaign managers before Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   "This campaign," said one rueful insider, "turned Cinderella into
a Greek tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Simon has been written off before. Times when all seems
gloomy, says Simon, can conceal opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   He quotes his late father, conservative icon and former Nixon
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon: "You may not be able to decide
whether the time is right for you ....[But] you'd better grab it,
because the opportunity may not be around again."</TE>
<TE>   GOP Was Hungry</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity that Bill Simon grabbed was presented,
unknowingly, by John McGraw, a software executive who, in the fall of
2000, was winding down his term as chairman of the California
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   It was a dismal time for the state GOP. George W. Bush was about
to lose big in California. Democrats controlled both houses of the
Legislature. Democrat Davis had trounced his last Republican opponent
in 1998 and, in those pre-energy crisis days, was considered safe in
the 2002 election. His only challenger was Secretary of State Bill
Jones, the last remaining Republican in statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP was hungry for new faces.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was also hungering. He spoke to one of his siblings of
feeling a "void" in his life. His father, a brilliant, domineering
man who towered over much of his eldest son's life, had died in June.
Simon had already scaled back his role at the family investment firm
to spend more time on charity, but he felt that he should do even
more. He traveled the country, speaking on the importance of religion
in American political life.</TE>
<TE>   Then McGraw, the state party leader whose job consisted partly of
hitting up wealthy Republicans for money, met Bill Simon for the
first time in late October.</TE>
<TE>   Simon wrote a check for $2,000, then mentioned the poor shape of
the party, McGraw recalled. McGraw gave his standard response: It's
easy for people to gripe and write a check, but we need candidates.
"Someone like you," he told Simon, "should consider running for
statewide office."</TE>
<TE>   Simon peppered McGraw with questions. He had lived in California
for only 10 years. Would that be a problem? This is a state full of
newcomers, McGraw replied. How can a novice run? How much would it
cost? Their meeting ran for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   For years, people had wondered when Bill Simon Jr. would make a
run for office.</TE>
<TE>   In his native New Jersey, Simon recalled, friends would make vague
suggestions about running. His father was a Cabinet member and
Republican power broker. Billy, as he was known to friends and
family, was a former federal prosecutor with an outgoing, choirboy
persona.</TE>
<TE>   The low-key talk persisted after Simon moved to California.
Stephen Kaplan, a Los Angeles businessman and friend of Simon,
remembers a charity banquet in 1999 where, after Simon gave a
passionate speech on public service, Kaplan and others urged him to
run.</TE>
<TE>   "The response was always, 'Politics can be a very nasty game,' "
Kaplan recalls.</TE>
<TE>   But after McGraw's visit, the idea stuck.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, at a think-tank gathering in Washington, Simon ran
into Ed Meese, who had served as Ronald Reagan's chief of staff in
Sacramento and later as U.S. attorney general. People were talking to
him about running for governor of California, Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't dismiss it out of hand," Meese counseled.</TE>
<TE>   "That conversation with Ed made me think this was not a pipe
dream," said Simon, a longtime Reagan admirer.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also recalls an encouraging call from Riordan, then mayor of
Los Angeles. The two attended the same Santa Monica church, where
they had worked together raising money for the parish.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, says Simon, suggested that he run. Although the former
mayor does not remember that conversation, he does recall urging
Simon to run weeks later, when his family and Simon's were skiing in
Sun Valley, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "I did recognize a bit of myself in him," Riordan said. After a
career in business, he said, politics is "kind of another mountain to
climb."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's encouragement helped push Simon closer. After his talk
with the mayor, Simon took his wife, Cindy, aside at their Sun Valley
condominium and told her that he was thinking of running for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was uncharted territory," Cindy Simon recalled in an
interview. "Bill's the type of guy, he would never do anything I was
opposed to .... He wanted to be sure I was comfortable with it. We
really talked about it, back and forth and back and forth, and the
more we talked about it, the more I saw why he was doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Fateful Encounter</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Simon met Sal Russo.</TE>
<TE>   Russo is a veteran Sacramento consultant and former Reagan staffer
known for his fondness for running the campaigns of sunny, optimistic
conservatives. Simon flew to Sacramento Feb. 1 to question him about
a possible political race.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting with Russo, his partner Ron Rogers and consultant Jeff
Flint, as well as John Herrington, a former Reagan Cabinet member who
would become Simon's campaign chairman, began at 3 p.m., eventually
shifting from Russo's high-rise offices to dinner conversation at the
consultant's nearby home.</TE>
<TE>   They discussed Simon's public service. They discussed his concern
with education -- his frustrations in trying to start charitable
programs in Los Angeles schools, the difficulty he and his wife were
having finding an appropriate public school for their oldest son.
They talked about whether Simon should run for governor or, as some
were counseling him, shoot for a lower office like state treasurer or
attorney general. Russo told Simon that the top of the ticket was
what mattered.</TE>
<TE>   The things that would come back to haunt Simon -- his tax returns
and allegations of fraud against his family business -- would not
come up until later. That first evening, the only warning Simon got
from the assembled consultants was that his opponents would throw
everything possible at him.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the evening," Russo recalls, "I was a little
surprised. He said 'OK, I'd like to go forward.' I said, 'Don't you
want to think about it?' And he said 'No, I've made up my mind.' "</TE>
<TE>   While he had decided to run, Simon was content to let his
consultants do the talking. He did not even attend the first
Republican convention of 2001, just weeks after his decision. He
opted instead to take a long-scheduled family skiing trip while his
consultants passed out glossy fliers to the GOP elite. Some confused
Simon with his more famous father, Herrington recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Testing the Waters</TE>
<TE>   The consultants designed a series of "benchmarks" that would allow
them to test the waters before declaring a Simon candidacy. Could
they raise enough money? Could they get enough volunteers? Could they
get the right staff?</TE>
<TE>   "Bill very much wanted to leave an escape, where he could give the
money back and decide not to run," said Kaplan, Simon's friend and
now a campaign fund-raiser. "I think he wanted to convince himself
that it wasn't folly, that he could run and win .... At the time, it
wasn't like a lot of people outside of Pacific Palisades knew who he
was."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, everyone knew who Richard Riordan was. And everyone
wanted to know whether the mayor would run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Russo and Simon went to Riordan's home in August to sound him out.
Riordan was accompanied by political consultant Arnold Steinberg, who
recalled that Simon kept asking Riordan whether he was going to run.
Steinberg, who had advised the mayor in prior races, was convinced
that Riordan could have talked Simon out of the race. But the mayor
made no effort to do so, though he would later decide to jump in
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Simon campaign was hitting its benchmarks and
mapping out what one insider called an "under the radar" strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Simon would concentrate on three issues. Two were ones the
candidate himself had raised: the faltering California economy --
victim of what Simon argued was over-regulation and poor fiscal
stewardship -- and education.</TE>
<TE>   Another Simon concern was that the promised land of California he
had heard so much about back East seemed to be falling apart at the
seams. That became the third issue, a focus on the state's
infrastructure. They'd be able to sell the novice Simon as a serious,
issues-based candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign would tout Simon's record not only as a businessman,
but as a former prosecutor and charity leader. This would counter the
contention that business was no training ground for government.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the campaign would nail down conservatives who would feel
abandoned by the more moderate Riordan. But they would do so quietly,
so as not to paint themselves into a corner in the general election.
Simon hit the right-wing talk radio circuit. He recruited the Rev.
Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition, a strongly anti-gay
religious leader, and hired Sheldon's son to help get social
conservatives to the polls, but did not mention him in speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign kept in touch via e-mail with leaders of
various anti-gun groups, antiabortion activists and libertarians.
When Simon said something of interest to those groups, the statement
would be forwarded via e-mail with a request that it be spread around
to like-minded people, rather than putting out a news release for
general consumption, insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   Work Ethic</TE>
<TE>   During the primary, Simon vowed to be "the hardest-working
candidate" in the race. Certainly, he was the most disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever he was, whomever he talked to, whatever questions were
asked, he would smile and repeat, over and over again, two things,
without getting into details: He was going to cut taxes and fix the
budget, education and infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't think he's the king of Siam, but his life experience
has taught him that if you work like a dog, keep your head down and
your nose clean, you'll make it," said Susan Campbell, a friend from
Simon's tenure at the U.S. attorney's office in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon stubbornly resisted one prompt from his campaign staff:
He would not attack his friend Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bill and Cindy Simon were uncomfortable about going after a
family friend. Some days, news releases were ready to roll out on fax
machines and e-mail loops, quoting Simon criticizing the former
mayor, only to have Simon refuse to launch the planned criticism at
the day's events. The releases were pulled back.</TE>
<TE>   That refusal to engage Riordan worried the Davis campaign, which
saw Riordan as its eventual opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' brash political strategist, would regularly
call the Simon campaign. In early January, South was telling the
Simon people they had missed their opportunity. "You've already
lost!" South shouted to Simon strategist Jeff Flint, Flint recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign took matters into its own hands. It struck at
Riordan with an ad accusing the former mayor of flip-flopping on
abortion. Riordan stumbled in explaining his position.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 29, at the end of a swing through the Central Valley,
Simon joined in at last, if only mildly.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like Dick [Riordan] has taken both sides of the issue,"
Simon said during a campaign stop at a tractor yard in Stockton.
"This isn't the first time Dick has taken positions on an issue that
are inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Simon balked at running ads against Riordan, advisors
recalled. He finally relented after Riordan attacked him in an ad. At
an appearance the Friday before the primary, Riordan called Simon "a
sanctimonious hypocrite" and "an unelectable extremist."</TE>
<TE>   Republican primary voters disagreed. Simon trounced Riordan in the
primary by 18 points, eight weeks after sitting at 4% in the polls.
To him and his staff, the plan had worked.</TE>
<TE>   Now they had to take on Davis. It was a difficult transition.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no contingency plans to run for the general election,"
said Herrington, the campaign chairman.</TE>
<TE>   That lack of planning showed. Since May, the campaign has had four
campaign managers. Simon was distracted by his refusal to release his
tax returns and the unexpected $78-million fraud verdict. His poor
fund-raising forced him off the air for much of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   In late August, Simon abruptly laid off half his staff. Sacramento
workers were informed by campaign manager Rob Lapsley. Simon, who was
at the Hyatt down the street, did not enter the office. He called his
former employees within the next day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bill is a lot stronger person than he's shown himself" to
be, Riordan said in an interview. "He needs to get out there and show
he's a strong, tough leader."</TE>
<TE>   'Do You Know Me?'</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks before election day, Simon unveiled a new ad. Its
opening line -- "Do you know me?" -- was an indictment of how his
campaign had faltered since the primary.</TE>
<TE>   For long stretches, it appeared the consultants were in charge,
not the candidate. Simon disavowed his responses to a questionnaire
distributed by a gay Republican group in which he pledged to back a
gay pride day. He said an advisor had used an "auto-signature" to
attach the candidate's name to the response.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Simon accused Davis of illegally raising money in a
state building, an allegation that proved false. A Simon strategist
apologized to the governor, saying Simon was pushed by consultants to
make the charge before investigating.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Simon said he had deferred to his consultants'
advice during much of the campaign, trying to follow their script.</TE>
<TE>   He laughed as he recalled how, after his robotic performance in
the first primary debate, a speech coach was summoned by the campaign
staff to drum into his head that he needed to smile less.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Simon said, grinning, he wasn't sure how much that
advice stuck. "At the end of the day, you're yourself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His ability to endlessly repeat a simple message helped him win
the primary, the candidate said. But he hinted at the growing pains
since, as he struggles to articulate why voters should choose him
over Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "You get so many different people telling you different things,"
Simon said. It is time, he said, to be himself, regardless of the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that's got to be a goal for the campaign," he said. "Paint a
picture of Bill Simon as he is, and let the people decide."</TE>

<HD>Why U.S. Intelligence Stumbled</HD>
<DH>Hearings portray overwhelmed agencies and suggest 9/11
could have been prevented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The monthlong series of congressional intelligence
hearings that ended this week produced a detailed and disheartening
portrait of the U.S. spy community as it groped its way toward Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   It also reshaped thinking about the most basic lingering question:
Could the attacks have been prevented?</LD>
<LD>   For months after Sept. 11, the answer, high-level government
officials insisted, was no. The new answer is that preventing or
disrupting them certainly seems to have been possible.</LD>
<TE>   "It really is impossible to say whether the attacks would have
been stopped," Eleanor Hill, staff director of the joint inquiry,
said in an interview Friday. "But I think we would have had a much
better chance" if intelligence agencies had acted on critical clues.</TE>
<TE>   The spy agencies were portrayed as displaying dazzling skill and
earnest effort, but in the end overwhelmed by the task and undone by
some of their own worst tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   They had breathtaking ability to vacuum up information around the
globe. But they often seemed blinded by the blizzard of data, unable
to recognize tragic patterns that now -- with the benefit of
hindsight -- seem clearly defined.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA, FBI and other agencies were evolving at an impressive
rate in their rush to adapt to the modern terrorist threat. But still
they were trapped in many of their Cold War ways, jealously guarding
secrets that should have been shared, solving cases instead of
sniffing out plots.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies also had done much to expand their
intelligence-gathering reach, scattering recruits around the world
and setting up dozens of terrorism task forces across the country.
But when it mattered most, field officers couldn't get Washington's
attention. Warnings went ignored, urgent requests were denied and
critical overseas cables were left unread.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the midst of unprecedented technological
transformation, much of the $30-billion spy apparatus was seemingly
logged off, unable to move critical pieces of data from one computer
to another.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how history might regard the nation's pre-Sept. 11 spy
shops, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, offered a telling assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a community struggling without great success to free
itself from its own past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that the attacks could have been prevented is
likely to occupy historians for decades. But intelligence experts
said the inquiry already has assembled a remarkably detailed picture.</TE>
<TE>   The questions surrounding Sept. 11 "will never really be at rest,"
said Jeffrey Smith, former general counsel at the CIA. "People are
still digging around in the assassination of Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   "But the purpose of a congressional investigation like this is to
find out what went wrong and then to develop a solution. There is no
question the committee and staff have identified the problems."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the hearings echoed other historic encounters
between Congress and the intelligence community, but with a
conclusion that turned history on its head.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the CIA came under such congressional scrutiny was
in the mid-1970s during the famous Church committee hearings,
presided over by then-Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), when the agency
was accused of spying on Americans and other abuses of power, and saw
its authority and resources reined in.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the agency and its brethren were often criticized for
being too risk-averse. And although reforms could be painful, the
community already is being lavished with billions of dollars in new
funding, and has been granted expanded authority to pursue
clandestine counter-terrorism missions.</TE>
<TE>   As Cofer Black, the CIA's former counter-terrorism chief, said
during one hearing: "After 9/11, the gloves come off."</TE>
<TE>   With its findings, investigators quieted a chorus of critics,
including several lawmakers on the committee itself, who as recently
as a month ago were predicting that the probe would be a bust.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation stumbled badly from the start. Its first
director, L. Britt Snider, was forced out last spring after he had
tried to hire a CIA employee who had failed an agency polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the probe, lawmakers complained about a lack of
cooperation from the CIA and other agencies. Even in recent weeks,
Graham was accusing the agency of obstructionism.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, who replaced Snider in June, is widely credited with
focusing the inquiry. According to Graham, she was also responsible
for an innovation during the hearings that proved very effective.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than let witnesses set the tone of each session, Hill was
often the first to testify, laying out damaging details agency
officials struggled to rebut.</TE>
<TE>   The probe produced a string of headlines about intelligence
failures, undercutting White House claims that Sept. 11-style attacks
were inconceivable before they happened, and raising questions about
how the CIA had mobilized to confront Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the committee's energy focused on flushing out damaging
new details about missed chances to uncover the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   They include the FBI's failure to heed warnings of a Phoenix agent
who, in July 2001, sent an e-mail to headquarters in Washington
urging the bureau to open a sweeping investigation of Middle Eastern
men training in U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Later that summer, FBI agents in Minnesota detained Zacarias
Moussaoui after he aroused the suspicions of a flight school
instructor. Agents pleaded with headquarters officials to get a
warrant to search Moussaoui's belongings, but were rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   But long before either of these breakdowns, the CIA had identified
two Al Qaeda operatives who would go on to help hijack the plane that
crashed into the Pentagon. The agency even learned that the two men
had entered the United States, arriving in Los Angeles in January
2000 and subsequently settling in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But the CIA neglected to notify domestic authorities until weeks
before the Sept. 11 attacks. By then it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance of those two men, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid
Al-Mihdhar, "would have been the best shot for uncovering what was
going on," Hill said. "But there was no chance to do that because the
information didn't come through."</TE>
<TE>   The parade of intelligence officials who appeared before the joint
committee rightly complained that funding and resources for their
agencies were depleted significantly during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   They also stressed the difficulty of the counter-terrorism
assignment. Almost every witness offered a metaphor to illustrate the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Several likened the task to playing goalie in hockey and coming to
the public's attention only when the puck gets by. Others compared
the assignment to confronting impossibly complex puzzles.</TE>
<TE>   In the months leading up to Sept. 11, there was "a maze of
information and a sea of threats," Dale Watson, the FBI's
counter-terrorism chief, testified. "It's a lot easier to complete a
maze if you start at the end."</TE>
<TE>   As the congressional inquiry winds down, there are some unanswered
questions. The inquiry was prevented by the White House, for
instance, from disclosing whether key pieces of intelligence were
shared with President Bush leading up to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has claimed releasing such information could have
a chilling effect, making advisors less inclined to offer candid
assessments to the president. Graham stressed that although the
hearings have concluded, the congressional inquiry is not yet
finished. It is now largely focused on drafting recommendations
likely to include the creation of a Cabinet-level intelligence
official to oversee a broad reorganization of the spy community.</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The first pitch of the World Series has yet to be
thrown, but the requisite zingers are flying. The mayor of Anaheim
wants to see Willie Brown in mouse ears. The San Francisco Chronicle
has sent a team of correspondents in search of Downtown Disney's
soul.</LD>
<LD>   Did they find it? Need you ask? If it wasn't clear when the
Giants' manager referred to Orange County as "southern L.A.," we're
getting the message: Now is the time for all good Californians to
dust off their North-South fighting words.</LD>
<LD>   But as the San Francisco Giants and the Anaheim Angels face off
starting today, the old Norcal-versus-Socal rivalry has never felt
less relevant. The jokes have been good, but real rancor has been
almost impossible to muster.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a natural rivalry with the Angels," San Francisco
Mayor Brown acknowledged this week, despite a wisecrack or two about
the lamentable paucity of "E-ticket rides" in his city. Asked for a
comparison of the two places, he smilingly sidestepped: "I don't know
enough about Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   From the moment the playoffs ended in an all-California World
Series, the battle lines were said to be clear. Two Californias:
Orange County conservatives versus Bay Area liberals. Tract homes
versus Victorians. Surf Nazis versus Ferlinghetti. No Doubt versus
Deadheads.</TE>
<TE>   But as the two places strain to find hard feelings for each other,
they keep tripping over their common ground: Both are international
destinations. Both rely heavily on tourism, and both have paid dearly
for it, post-9/11. Both are just glad, in this downer of an economy,
that sports fans will be spending their World Series dollars on this
coast. And to the extent that either buys into the concept of two
Californias, they do so in just one way: Both are dedicated to the
proposition of not being Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. turned in one generation from the land of dreams to the land
of nightmares," said Robert K. Dornan, the colorful conservative who
for 13 years represented Orange County in Congress and who now hosts
a talk radio show in suburban Virginia. "People fled to Orange County
to get away from the crime and the instability and the rioting.</TE>
<TE>   "For four decades, Anaheim had to watch the power and the glory of
the Dodgers and play second banana. With this miracle of the Angels
finally getting to World Series heaven, we'd always hoped it would
happen with the Dodgers. Just to say, 'You're not the big shots.
We're the real Southern Californians, not stolen from Brooklyn. We're
not second-class citizens.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Orange County broke away from L.A.County in the late 1880s,
it was, even then, because Los Angeles felt "just too big," says
state librarian and USC history professor Kevin Starr. As decades
passed and orange groves turned to suburbs, it remained a repository
for disaffected Angelenos and anti-L.A. trash talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go up to Los Angeles to see Jesus Christ rassle a
bear," native Orange County historian Jim Sleeper said as recently as
1990. And in the last decade, Orange County has come into its own as
a civic and economic power.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim, once a grape-growing co-op for German farmers, now has a
population of 328,000, two major theme parks and the state's largest
convention center. But the county's old sentiments still color its
feelings about its northern neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "If L.A. had won the pennant, there'd have been a riot," Angels
fan Marvin Hora told Associated Press as he waited to buy souvenirs
at the stadium in Anaheim this week. "Here, everybody had a good time
and then we went home."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco and Orange County lack that history, however, so
their relationship isn't as emotional or well-defined. Theoretically,
people in both places say, they know how they should feel -- as left-
and right-wing hotbeds, they should loathe each other -- but they
just don't.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Billings, superintendent of Anaheim Union High School
District and a resident of the county since the mid-1960s, said that
when the city of St. Francis is mentioned, words such as
"cosmopolitan" and "sophisticated" spring to mind.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Buffa, the former mayor of Costa Mesa, knows the old
chestnuts -- San Francisco is "either this whacked-out place run by
the 'Brown brothers' -- Willie in San Francisco and Jerry in Oakland
-- or Sodom by the Sea," he said, laughing. But contempt is hard to
sustain because, "there are all these connections."</TE>
<TE>   "The father of Jeff Kent, the Giants' second baseman, was a police
lieutenant in Costa Mesa when I was mayor," he said. "Then there's
the fact that the managers for both teams used to be with the
Dodgers. There are all these tremendous relationships that go all
over California."</TE>
<TE>   And not just on sports teams. "Anyone who's in any way successful
is now statewide in California," Starr points out. Tech companies in
Palo Alto have clients in San Diego; developers in the Inland Empire
lobby lawmakers in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach couples honeymoon in San Francisco, and San
Franciscans take their kids in the summer to Disney's California
Adventure park. (From a statewide perspective, jokes Ventura-based
urban planner Bill Fulton, "the one similarity between Anaheim and
San Francisco is that they're both theme parks.")</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong -- I think the Rally Monkey will be pumped and
looking to smack around some latte-drinking artists," joked Costa
Mesa's Buffa. "But the two places don't really have a long-standing
rivalry."</TE>
<TE>   In the Bay Area, the apathy is mutual, though there, too, proper
respects are paid to the obligation to disapprove of yesterday's
stereotypes. Anaheim was the site, in the 1920s, of the largest white
supremacist rally in state history; Orange County was a bastion, in
the 1950s, for the hardest of the hard right. On the other hand,
Anaheim is now 47% Latino and 12% Asian, and Orange County's white
majority was, at last count, barely holding. "Orange County? Well,
I'd like to tell you what we think of it, but frankly, we don't,"
laughed Stanlee Gatti, a San Francisco event planner and party
designer. "And when we do, we think of the John Birch Society and
Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   He grew serious, however, when asked about the Series' fiscal
import. Recession, the tech implosion and the post-9/11 drop in
tourism have cut into theme park attendance and pummeled San
Francisco's economy. "How much do we need this? How much do both
cities need this? A lot," said Gatti.</TE>
<TE>   No mention was made of the megalopolis in the middle, which, more
than a generation ago now, snatched San Francisco's mantle of power
away.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be different if we were playing L.A.," said Burton
Bradley, the wine director at Moose's restaurant in North Beach.
"It's the Dodgers that nobody likes here."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, "unrequited hate," is how a Chronicle columnist summed
up the city's feelings toward Los Angeles last Sunday. The
relationship between Orange County and San Francisco, Bradley said,
is harder to get at, because the two places are as singular as, come
to think of it, two bottles of fine wine.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim," he ventured, "is ripe, juicy, young, easy to drink,
like a young syrah from Santa Barbara County. Whereas San Francisco
is more complex, maybe not as pleasant, but layered and with
different components, like a 1996 Premier Cru Vosne-Romanee. Or" --
he thought for a moment -- "maybe a nice Carneros Pinot Noir."</TE>
<TE>   That said, it is understood on all sides that an all-California
series is no time to hold back on the celebration of cherished
stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't realize that the word 'Irvine' comes from an
old Indian word that means 'paint everything beige,' said Nick
Arnette, a Southern California comedian.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco? It's a crammed-in big town with a couple of
suburbs draining off down the peninsula," scoffed Newport Beach
businessman John Crean. "And the weather's miserable -- if it isn't
foggy, the wind is blowing. Never thought much of the place."</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, you got your weirdos down in Orange County," bragged Peter

<TE>   "They clearly don't have the same kinds of attractions as we do,"
agreed Mayor Brown, finally ticking off some of the differences
between Anaheim and his city. "I don't think there's an Anaheim
Opera, or an Anaheim Ballet, or an Anaheim Symphony. I don't think
there's a DeYoung Museum in Anaheim. I don't think there's an Asian
Arts Museum in Anaheim.</TE>

<HD>At Airports, No Farewell to Arms</HD>
<DH>Despite strict rules, thousands of passengers arrive for
flights toting an array of weaponry.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A woman trying to catch a US Airways flight in
Philadelphia didn't realize her husband's loaded handgun was tucked
in her carry-on bag, along with an extra ammunition clip.</LD>
<LD>   At Los Angeles International Airport, an elderly man bound for
Switzerland was caught with an 18-inch sword hidden in a wooden cane.
He said that, when he purchased the cane, no one told him he was
getting a rapier as well.</LD>
<LD>   Though the memory of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is still
fresh, tens of thousands of passengers keep showing up at U.S.
airports with a bewildering array of guns, knives, box cutters and
other potentially lethal weapons, risking arrest and federal
prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   In the last seven months, more than 3 million items have been
seized at airports and 720 people have been arrested for weapon
violations -- an average of four a day.</TE>
<TE>   The parade of armaments, mostly knives and cutting tools, has
become a distraction for the new federal security screeners assigned
to catch terrorists, officials say. The sheer volume also has renewed
worries that weapons are still getting through without being
detected.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers also indicate that the biggest obstacle to
transforming airports into weapon-free zones may be Americans'
personal habits.</TE>
<TE>   "A great deal of work needs to be done with the public to tell
people, 'Don't carry these things,' " said Billie Vincent, a former
security director for the Federal Aviation Administration. However,
federal officials say the Transportation Security Administration --
the new agency charged with airport security -- doesn't have money
for an advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 800 guns and nearly 80,000 knives confiscated,
Vincent worries about the ones that aren't spotted. "If there are
high numbers of these [weapons] being carried and detected, there is
potentially a frightening number on the airplanes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even box cutters such as those infamously used by the hijackers
last year keep turning up: More than 31,000 of them were confiscated
between mid-February and the end of September. As for firearms, an
average of four a day are seized at airports around the country,
according to TSA statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers also point to LAX as something of a hub for weapons.
Of 429 airports nationwide, it accounted for 8% of all items seized.
That includes 11% of the box cutters, but only 3% of the guns.
Officials said the explanation may lie in the fact that Los Angeles
handles more originating passengers than any airport in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be the biggest problem we had with guns being picked
up in screening was in Texas," Vincent said. "It was little old
ladies who carried a gun in their purse for protection."</TE>
<TE>   Once caught, travelers who break the rules offer a range of
excuses. Many say they simply forgot that they had a corkscrew or a
pocketknife in their backpacks. Some don't view what they're carrying
as a potential hazard -- even if it's a large knife or other
potentially lethal item -- because they have no intention of using it
as a weapon on an aircraft, security sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Others beg ignorance of the restrictions, saying they were unaware
that certain items -- penknives, for example -- are classified as
weapons. And a few apparently believe they can somehow escape
detection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real educational challenge," said David Stone, the federal
security director at LAX. "People bring a big knife through screening
and say, 'I thought you would understand. I'm not a terrorist, I want
to bring this knife to Kansas.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stone keeps a collection of the most interesting objects on a
shelf in his office in the airport's old control tower. Among the
items seized at LAX is a gray mobile phone that isn't a phone at all:
It's a stun gun.</TE>
<TE>   X-ray machines have exposed artful attempts at disguise. In Tampa,
Fla., what seemed to the naked eye to be a computer floppy disk
turned out to be a high-tech version of the Swiss army knife. On one
corner, there was a magnifying glass. On the next, a compass.
Finally, on a third corner, a 2-inch knife.</TE>
<TE>   At Boston's Logan International Airport, where the two flights
that were flown into the World Trade Center originated, a fancy pen
set off a metal detector one day this year. Puzzled, the security
screener opened the pen, and found that it wrote well. But then the
screener gave a little tug, and out slid a well-concealed,
razor-sharp blade.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to ask yourself, 'What were these people thinking?' "
TSA spokesman Robert Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the incidents involved terrorists, only passengers with
questionable judgment. "We need some common sense here," Johnson
added. "Don't bring your guns to the airport. Leave your knives at
home. Box cutters are not a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of people who are caught attempting to board
with prohibited articles suffer no greater inconvenience than the
loss of the item.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley said intent is a key question when
authorities are considering whether to file charges. "If someone has
a knife in their purse and they didn't realize it, they may be
detained and questioned, but they aren't going to be prosecuted,"
Bosley said.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers who wish to avoid being hauled off in handcuffs for an
FBI interview can ask their airline about questionable items, or
check the TSA list on its Web site: http://www.tsa.gov/trav_
consumers/aircraft_prohibit. shtm. The lengthy list includes
firearms, knives, clubs, incendiary devices and weapon replicas.</TE>
<TE>   Arrest can expose an unwitting passenger to damaging publicity,
legal fees and a court sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Keller, the woman caught with her husband's gun at the
Philadelphia airport, was lucky. U.S. Atty. Patrick Meehan dropped
charges of knowingly carrying a concealed weapon through airport
security. Keller said she was unaware the gun was in her carry-on
bag.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Farhang Motamedi, the 71-year-old man arrested Oct. 2 at LAX
with a sword in his cane, is still trying to get his case resolved.
His lawyer said Motamedi, a legal immigrant from Iran, has no
criminal history and feels "horrible" about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors around the country are trying to walk a fine
line between prosecuting blatant violations and showing forbearance
in cases involving innocent mistakes or an oversight.</TE>
<TE>   David Samborn, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Chicago, said
he is unaware of any guidance from Washington concerning the issue,
but that federal prosecutors are operating with "heightened
awareness" when it comes to security.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to treat any case," he said, "that poses a danger, or
a potential danger, aboard an aircraft very seriously."</TE>

<HD>Protest Calls for Ouster of U.S. Navy From Bahrain</HD>
<DH>At the latest in a series of such demonstrations, ralliers
say American military presence puts the Persian Gulf nation's
sovereignty at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MANAMA, Bahrain -- Chanting "Death to America!" and "Death to
Israel!" protesters here Friday night angrily called for Bahrain's
government to oust the U.S. Navy from the base that serves as its
regional headquarters in the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   Initiated by the local Islamic political organization, the protest
was the latest in a series of anti-U.S. demonstrations in recent
months, including a rock-throwing march by several thousand people
outside the U.S. Embassy in April that left a teenage protester dead
after a skirmish with police. Two American sailors were beaten by a
crowd a month later.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, more than 500 protesters rallied outside the United
Nations complex along Embassy Row to urge the world body not to
support any U.S. effort to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
With several television stations broadcasting the protest across the
Arab world, speakers called for the government of this Persian Gulf
island nation to withdraw permission for the U.S. to continue its
military presence, which began shortly after World War II. "No to
American Bases in Islamic Bahrain," read one banner.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet is headquartered here, and U.S. and
British Royal Air Force planes use the international airport as a
regional hub. Without the facilities here, the U.S. ability to
project military power in the region would be undercut.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for use of the base, the U.S. provides security for
Bahrain against Iraq. The U.S. is also helping Bahrain upgrade its
military force with training and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   During the Persian Gulf War, Iraq launched Scud missiles at
Bahrain. Still, the protesters said the U.S. presence here is
politically unacceptable and endangers Bahrain's sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the new colonialism," said one protester, Suhyla Safqr, a
dentist. "Americans are the new savages. We have so much anger at
them. We will stop at nothing to stop them if they attack an Arab
country."</TE>
<TE>   Arab intellectuals disagree on how a U.S. effort to topple Hussein
would play in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Musfir, a political science lecturer, predicted an
exponential growth in anti-U.S. sentiment and protests that could
lead to governments asking the U.S. military to leave the bases it
has used for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "You will see demonstrations like never before in the Arab world,"
Musfir said. "The anger has built up because of U.S. support for
Israel against the Palestinians. A war with Iraq will make the anger
ignite."</TE>
<TE>   But Hassan M. Saleh Ansari, director of the Gulf Studies Center at
the University of Qatar, a regional think tank, said such predictions
are exaggerated. He noted that the same sort of rhetoric was heard
before a U.S.-led coalition forced Iraq to abandon Kuwait in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heard this before," Ansari said. "If the war is quick, I
do not think the reaction will be severe."</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, King Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa has opted to allow street
demonstrations as part of his drive toward opening up the political
process. Under his late father, such demonstrations were banned and
political opponents were sometimes jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Hamed endorsed the U.S. war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan and ordered the flagship of Bahrain's tiny navy to assist
the U.S. in looking for Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders
who might attempt to flee on the high seas.</TE>
<TE>   Although the extent is difficult to gauge, there is sympathy in
Bahrain for the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant organization. And
there are Bahrainis among the Al Qaeda and Taliban soldiers
incarcerated by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after
being captured in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's protest, cheers were heard for Hezbollah, and in the
back streets of the souk district in Manama, the capital, there are
posters that attempt to link the shooting deaths of Palestinian
children with the spread of U.S. fast-food franchises in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. supports Israel in brutalizing Palestinians and allows
it to ignore U.N. resolutions," said businessman Habib Jamiri,
standing in the crowd at the protest. "America says it wants Saddam
out so that Iraq can have democracy. This is a lie. America wants
Iraqi oil and to help the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials have sought to convince regional leaders that any
U.S. attack on Iraq should be seen as an attack on all Islamic
countries. Although the leadership in those countries, including the
Bahraini king, has publicly distanced itself from that idea, the
concept seems to have caught hold among at least a portion of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   "First it was Afghanistan, now Iraq, soon Bahrain and Saudi
Arabia. America will not be happy until it destroys all of Islam,"
said one protester, Sallah Salih, who works at a Chili's restaurant.</TE>

<HD>E. Asian Strategic Balance Remains</HD>
<DH>North Korea's disclosure of nuclear program confirms
long-held assumptions. The question is what it would gain by the
move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier and Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- The military and strategic balance in East Asia hasn't
changed much despite reports this week that North Korea admitted
having an ongoing nuclear weapons program "and more."</LD>
<LD>   Military planners in East Asia have long assumed that the
Communist regime's program was well advanced. North Korea was found
nearly a decade ago to have enough plutonium for two bombs, and
several defectors have detailed their experiences working at fuel
enrichment plants.</LD>
<LD>   "While there may be some temporary impact on the North Asian
neighborhood, in the long run we don't see much change and believe a
solution will be found," said Lee Jong Seok, an analyst with South
Korea's Sejong Institute.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and Japanese intelligence estimates of one or more North
Korean nuclear weapons have been around for some time, as have
reports of nuclear cooperation among North Korea, Pakistan and former
Soviet states.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all its saber-rattling, the regime in Pyongyang has been
contained successfully for decades, making it appear at times more of
a threat from distant Washington than from nearby Tokyo or Seoul,
analysts said. Pyongyang may even be hoping with its bombshell
disclosure to bargain away a project it can no longer afford, some
said.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing how far along North Korea is in building a nuclear bomb
is difficult, in part because of how little information the Bush
administration has shared, said Joseph Cirincione, a nonproliferation
expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "How far the program has gotten is the critical military part of
the equation," he said. "The administration knows," but isn't
telling.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say, in a violation of the spirit if not the letter of
a 1994 Agreed Framework signed in Geneva, the North Koreans
apparently switched gears in the mid-1990s from plutonium to a
uranium-based development project.</TE>
<TE>   Under the pact, Pyongyang had pledged to give up its plutonium
research and other nuclear plans in return for 500,000 tons of fuel
oil annually and two light-water reactors for civilian use.</TE>
<TE>   Uranium is mined in North Korea, making it less subject to
oversight, cross-border safeguards and probing questions by the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency that characterize
international shipments of nuclear material.</TE>
<TE>   And while plutonium processing requires expensive and cumbersome
equipment that is difficult to hide, uranium operations can be far
more modest, said Shin Sung Taek, research director at the Korea
Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a totally different issue with uranium," he said. "All you
need is an enrichment facility, which can be underground and small in
size."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Dae Ho, who worked in North Korea's nuclear processing
industry before defecting in 1994, said the program was an obvious
priority for the regime.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many facilities weren't heavily
disguised, although they were well protected. "It wasn't really
hidden, but ordinary people simply couldn't go there," Kim said. "The
Namchon Chemical Factory where I worked had 10-foot-high concrete
fences, electrified barbed-wire fencing and full military security."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has about 26 million tons of uranium deposits at
locations including Sunchon in South Pyongan province and in Kumchon
and Pyongsan in North Hwanghae province, South Korean analysts say.
Of that amount, about 4 million tons are easily accessible.</TE>
<TE>   It takes enormous quantities of uranium to produce a small amount
of the enriched material needed for a weapon, however.</TE>
<TE>   Gas diffusion and the use of centrifuges are usual methods for
enriching uranium, but Shin said his institute believes North Korea
has probably used lasers to extract the required uranium-235. The
other two methods require a huge amount of electricity, of which
North Korea is notably short.</TE>
<TE>   While the laser separation method takes less electricity, it's a
tedious, inefficient and labor-intensive process.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts say Pakistan has also been a source of enriched
uranium for North Korea, perhaps in return for ballistic missiles.
But Shin said he hasn't seen any conclusive evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan produced a uranium-enriched bomb -- as opposed to India's
plutonium-based program -- and its missiles resemble North Korea's,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Abdul Qadeer Khan, the colorful and controversial
"father of the Pakistani nuclear program," made a dozen trips to
North Korea in the late 1990s, said Cirincione. The first evidence of
enrichment equipment in North Korea also paralleled the appearance of
North Korean missiles in Pakistan, Cirincione added.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has not tested a nuclear device, experts say, a
relatively easy event to monitor. But Pakistan may have agreed to
test devices and share the results with North Korea, said Hideshi
Takesada, professor of the Japan's National Institute for Defense
Studies. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto twice visited
Pyongyang, he said, amid speculation the two nations were cooperating
militarily.</TE>
<TE>   The methodology needed to build enriched-uranium bombs has been
around a long time, said Shin. Many of its underlying techniques were
pioneered in the 1940s during the days of the Manhattan Project,
which eventually produced the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology and know-how flow like water," he said. "A lot of it's
out there, even on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   In following the global proliferation trail, one irony is that the
most likely source for Pakistan's technology is China, Cirincione
said. In the early 1990s, China sold about 3,000 ring magnets, a
critical element in building centrifuges to enrich uranium, to
Pakistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Young Hwa, professor at Japan's Kansai University and a
representative of Rescue the North Korean People, a civic
organization, cites the experience of a woman his group helped to
escape through China in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, a physicist whose name he wouldn't disclose, worked
until 1999 at a North Korean plant that was developing nuclear and
chemical weapons, she told him.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 people, including the physicist, worked at an elite
institute attached to the complex built shortly after international
pressure intensified for nuclear inspections in the early 1990s. It
was reportedly hidden in the forest and served by a specially built
railroad line.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers enjoyed 20% to 30% higher salary than compatriots, the
rescue group said in a report, but researchers weren't allowed to
contact outside researchers and their lives were otherwise severely
restricted.</TE>
<TE>   For Gary Milhollin, head of the Wisconsin Project for Nuclear Arms
Control in Washington, a major concern is that Pyongyang might now
sharply raise the ante.</TE>
<TE>   If the North repudiates the 1994 agreed framework, Pyongyang could
reprocess plutonium into bomb cores that had been shelved under
international supervision in 1994. This could lead to an estimated
half-dozen bombs within as little as six months.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think either [Iraq or North Korea] would do anything,
absent an attack from us," Milhollin said. "But if they thought they
were going to be attacked, they would have to consider what the best
use of their nuclear capability would be."</TE>

<HD>Constellation Prepares to Ship Out to Gulf Region</HD>
<DH>U.S. aircraft carrier will be the third in the area, one
more than is normally deployed at a time. A fourth is headed there in
December.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- An aircraft carrier based in San Diego is preparing to
steam to the Persian Gulf region early next month, another in a
series of moves the Pentagon has been making to prepare for a rapid
massing of U.S. forces around Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The deployment of the Constellation and its battle group of ships
and fighter jets has been scheduled for at least two years, Navy
officials said, and has not been accelerated for the U.S.
confrontation with Iraq. When it arrives in the north Arabian Sea in
mid-December, however, the Constellation will be the third U.S.
carrier in the region -- one more than is normally deployed at a
time.</LD>
<LD>   Two other U.S. carriers -- the Abraham Lincoln and the George
Washington -- and their battle groups are already within striking
distance of Iraq. A fourth carrier, the Harry S. Truman, is to head
out in early December from its home port in Norfolk, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Maintenance work and air crew training on the Constellation and
two other carriers on the West Coast -- the Nimitz and the Carl
Vinson -- have been accelerated to prepare them for possible
deployment to the Gulf region, Navy officials said. Another carrier,
the Japan-based Kitty Hawk, also would be available for action.</TE>
<TE>   The Constellation is due to relieve the Lincoln, now in the north
Arabian Sea; the Truman is scheduled to replace the Washington, now
in the Mediterranean. But the carriers' normal six-month deployments
could be extended to boost U.S. firepower off Iraq if ordered by
commanders, Navy officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Constellation is conducting training exercises with other
ships and aircraft in its battle group off California's coast.</TE>
<TE>   John Pike, director of Global Security.org, a military research
group that tracks deployments, said the Constellation appears to be
preparing to leave port several weeks earlier than it normally would.
The Lincoln is not scheduled to leave the region until mid-January,
Navy officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless they're planning to take the scenic route, it seems
they're going out weeks earlier than would be required to replace the
Lincoln," Pike said.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials insisted that the temporary overlap of carriers in
the region is routine.</TE>
<TE>   "We have ships returning and ships deploying all the time," said
Cmdr. William Fenick, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon. "We have to
make sure we always have assets deployed on station, on call, for
purposes of maintaining deployed readiness."</TE>
<TE>   Since September, the Pentagon has quietly built up its forces and
equipment in countries and waters near Iraq. The buildup has fed
suspicions that the Pentagon is preparing a surprise attack. But
defense officials dismiss such speculation as unrealistic. Before any
military action, they say, the Pentagon would need to mobilize
several Army divisions, scores of Air Force aircraft and armadas of
ships.</TE>
<TE>   But the measures being put in place would allow U.S. forces to
rapidly mount action against Iraq after reaching the region,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon announced last week that headquarters units of the
Army's V Corps, based in Heidelberg, Germany, have been ordered to
Kuwait, along with an AH-64 Apache helicopter unit and an aviation
task force. The Army contingent has the capability of commanding land
forces in a war.</TE>
<TE>   "Select forces" from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force also are
deploying to the region in support of the U.S. war against terrorism,
said Marine Maj. Jeff Nyhart, a spokesman at Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines will take part in a biennial exercise, dubbed Internal
Look and run by the U.S. Central Command based in Tampa, Fla., that
is responsible for U.S. military operations in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The command-post exercise, to begin next month, will test
communications and control among component commanders. It will be
headed by a staff of 600 people who will move from the command's
Tampa offices to a recently completed U.S. Army command center in
Qatar. Although billed as a training exercise, the move will allow
the establishment of a main command post that could be used in the
event of war.</TE>
<TE>   The military buildup has been accompanied by an increase in U.S.
airstrikes on Iraqi air defense targets, reflecting what Pentagon
officials say has been an increase in Iraqi provocations. But the
types of targets also have expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld disclosed last month that he
had directed commanders to focus retaliatory strikes on air defense
communications centers in an attempt to degrade Iraq's air defense
network.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed in Philippine Bus Blast</HD>
<DH>It is unclear if attacker died in explosion that injured 20
a day after two fatal bombings.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>QUEZON CITY, Philippines</DL>
<LD>A bomb tore through a passenger bus in this Manila suburb Friday
night, killing two people and injuring 20, police said.</LD>
<LD>   There were no immediate suspects or claims of responsibility for
the latest in a series of bombings this month in a nation where
U.S.-trained troops are battling a Muslim rebel group.</LD>
<LD>   The blast in the blue Golden Highway company bus ripped off its
roof and part of its sides and sent debris flying 20 to 30 yards. The
passenger who brought the explosive aboard the bus was believed to be
among the dead, but it was unclear whether the blast was intended as
a suicide attack.</LD>
<TE>   "I was inside when it happened," Merly Villareal, a teenager, told
local television as she fought back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is there was an explosion. I was pushed, and then I
saw bodies," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion came a day after two deadly bombings in the southern
Philippines and hours after a grenade blast in the capital's
financial district.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Abu Sayyaf, which the Philippine and U.S.
governments have linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, was the
most likely suspect for Thursday's bombings in Zamboanga, which
killed seven people and injured more than 150.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf recently threatened attacks in retaliation for an
ongoing military offensive against the group and has been blamed for
an Oct. 2 bombing in Zamboanga that killed four people, including an
American Green Beret.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo visited the
Zamboanga bombing sites and urged her people to help fight
terrorists. She said troops and police had identified the suspects
and were looking for them.</TE>

<HD>More Limits for Ad Banner Planes</HD>
<DH>Background checks, ID verification and flight plans will be
required for pilots with waivers for World Series flyovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to concerns by police and Major League Baseball, federal
transportation officials on Friday said they will take extra
precautions with banner-towing planes that fly over Edison
International Field during the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Security Administration said it will no longer
issue waivers for pilots hoping to fly small aircraft over the
Anaheim stadium as well as Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco during
the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   But pilots who had earlier obtained waivers will be allowed to
make flights, said David Steigman, a spokesman for the security
administration in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The action falls short of the ban that local officials requested
for the World Series, which begins today in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you right now we're not happy," said Anaheim police
Sgt. Rick Martinez, a department spokesman. "We asked for the
temporary flight restrictions. Security has been a concern since
Sept. 11. I think this is obvious."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities imposed no-fly zones over major sporting
events in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but recently
started issuing waivers.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday also imposed new
restrictions on aircraft hoping to tow advertisements above the World
Series ballparks. Not only will pilots need waivers, they must depart
from a local airport and file a flight plan by 7 a.m. on the day of
the game, said FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots will need permission from FAA flight control to pass above
fans, Snyder said. All pilots who apply for waivers must have an FBI
criminal background check, Steigman said. Officials plan to check the
identities of all pilots planning to fly over the games in Anaheim
and San Francisco, to ensure they are the same pilots who received
waivers.</TE>
<TE>   In another move, the Transportation Security Administration is
expanding the no-fly zone from three miles to five miles from the two
ballparks, Steigman said.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit by PG&amp;E Complicates Sale of Energy Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. has complicated the imminent sale of $11.9
billion in energy bonds with a lawsuit that accuses the state of
imposing billions of dollars of charges on the utility's customers
without adequate public review.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Sacramento County Superior Court,
was not unexpected. But it comes just one week before state Treasurer
Phil Angelides is scheduled to sell the first batch of bonds in what
would be the largest municipal borrowing in U.S. history. The
long-awaited sale would raise cash to pay back California taxpayers
for electricity purchases in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Even if it is resolved quickly, PG&amp;E's lawsuit could raise
investor concerns and thus the interest rates on the bonds. A higher
interest rate could cost California utility customers millions of
extra dollars over the 20-year life of the bonds.</LD>
<TE>   "Investors could say the risk just got bigger," said Claire Cohen,
vice chairwoman at Fitch, a Wall Street credit-rating agency. "Last
week you said it was possible that there's litigation, now you've got
it."</TE>
<TE>   The 27 million people served by PG&amp;E, Southern California Edison
and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric are obligated to pay back the bonds
through a monthly charge on their bills estimated at $3.50 for the
average homeowner.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E officials insist that they are not trying to block the bond
sale. Instead, they want the state to prove that the billions of
dollars its customers are expected to pay back are reasonable costs.
PG&amp;E also argues that the state's power-buying arm, the Department of
Water Resources, violated rules that require public hearings before
such charges can be imposed.</TE>
<TE>   The costs under contention include $37 billion worth of long-term
energy contracts, some of which the state itself calls "unjust and
unreasonable." The state has petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to void the contracts because they were signed in the
spring of 2001 as prices in California's dysfunctional power market
soared.</TE>
<TE>   "The state cannot have it both ways," wrote PG&amp;E President Gordon
R. Smith in a letter Thursday to Angelides. "It cannot foist these
costs on our customers as 'just and reasonable' while arguing
fervently at FERC that they are not."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E spokesman John Nelson said the lawsuit was filed after DWR
refused on Oct. 8 to reconsider how much money it expects PG&amp;E to
pass on from its customers.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a wrench to be thrown, it was in DWR's hands, and they
did the throwing," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts said they expected a PG&amp;E lawsuit.
Credit-rating agencies took it into account when they gave mixed
scores to the bonds last month and insisted that the bond carry
multibillion-dollar reserves. The official bond documents released by
the treasurer's office on Oct. 3 spell out the risk of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Solender, principal and portfolio manager for mutual fund
giant Vanguard Group, called the lawsuit a "cloud" over the bond
sale.</TE>
<TE>   He said that state officials need to respond quickly to the
lawsuit to reassure investors.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a lot more information before investors can be
comfortable buying the deal," Solender said. "If it gets resolved
sufficiently, it shouldn't have any major impact, but it's really
hard to specify what the impact will be at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Angelides released a short statement Friday, calling the lawsuit
"not unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   "We currently intend to proceed forward as originally anticipated,
with the sale of the first bonds next week," he said.</TE>

<LD>While supporting President Bush's call to remove Saddam Hussein from
power, several local Iraqi Americans said Friday they fear U.S.
military action might lead to Iraq's destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not willing to sacrifice a whole country for one man," said
engineer Salam Jawad, one of three people who held a news conference
in Pomona to ask for U.S. military restraint in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   An invasion by U.S. ground forces, coupled with the probable
destruction of the country's infrastructure through air strikes,
would turn Hussein opponents in Iraq against the U.S., they said.
"The people in Iraq are not our enemy," said Talib Alhamdani, a
political science researcher and teacher. "It will harm America in
the future to inflict more pain on Iraq."</LD>

<HD>Program Is Purring Right Along</HD>
<DH>Troubled teenagers help themselves and their group home by
repairing donated vehicles to be sold for fund-raising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Operators of a Highland Park center for troubled teenagers knew where
to go when their fund-raising program needed a tuneup.</LD>
<LD>   They pulled into their group home's auto repair shop.</LD>
<LD>   That's where Optimist Youth Homes &amp; Family Services leaders are
applying a torque-wrench twist to the popular charity car donation by
assigning teenage mechanics to repair old automobiles before they are
sold.</LD>
<TE>   Not only do the fixed-up cars fetch a higher price, but the
teenagers learn mechanical skills that make them employable once they
are released from the court-run group home system.</TE>
<TE>   Professional solicitation firms operate most of the nation's
charity car-donation programs. They deduct a portion of a vehicle's
selling price to cover their operational costs, towing charges and
advertising expenses. If a used-car broker or auction house is needed
to dispose of the donated vehicle, those costs are also deducted from
the eventual proceeds that charities receive.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, charities designated by donors of cars never actually
see the vehicle. And they typically receive only about 20% of the
car's selling price as a cash donation.</TE>
<TE>   Optimist Youth Homes officials say they keep all the profit
because they sell the refurbished cars directly from the facility's
North Figueroa Street auto shop.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a broker in the middle taking most of the
donation," said Silvio John Orlando, executive director of the
100-bed group home, established 96 years ago by Optimist Club
members.</TE>
<TE>   The auto shop is part of the curriculum of a high school that is
operated in conjunction with the home. Because most residents are
placed there by the Probation Department, its $25-million annual
budget comes primarily from the state and county.</TE>
<TE>   But this year the home has a $512,000 supplemental fund-raising
goal. Staff members Gayle Wayne and Bob Weiner suggested the
do-it-yourself car repair and resale program to help meet it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know of any other donation program like this around
here, and we're familiar with them all," Wayne said. He said some of
the proceeds from car sales will be spent on a new $32,000 hydraulic
lift for the auto shop.</TE>
<TE>   Others are revved up over the Optimists' hands-on approach to
charitable car donations.</TE>
<TE>   "The only other place I know of that does it is a school in
Maryland. It's a wonderful idea," said Daniel Borochoff, president of
the Chicago-based American Institute of Philanthropy. "A lot of
times, the charity gets very little from this type of donation. Here
you get 100% good use of your donation."</TE>
<TE>   Optimist auto shop teacher Manuel Lauria said the 30 teenagers
enrolled in mechanics classes in the past handled routine servicing
and maintenance on the home's fleet of 25 late-model cars and vans.</TE>
<TE>   Since the car-donation program began a month ago, the teens have
repaired and performed cosmetic touch-ups on a 1987 Dodge and a 1986
Peugeot, which were sold for a total of $2,300. They are working on a
1992 Pontiac Firebird, and on Thursday they received a donated 1989
Chevrolet sedan as their next project. The home guarantees all
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Lauria said a shortage of parking space at the shop restricts the
number of cars to 10 at a time. He said the program accepts fixable
"clunkers, not junkers" that are destined to be scrapped or sold for
parts. Fliers soliciting auto donations -- and potential buyers --
have been sent to 8,000 local Optimist Club members.</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters doing the repair work are already giving the
program a greasy thumbs-up. They earn as much as $30 a week working
there.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned the basics, and I'm confident about what I do," said
Joseph Ramirez, 17, who is finishing a 16-month sentence on an
assault conviction. "When I leave here, I'm thinking about going to
auto mechanics trade school."</TE>
<TE>   Another student, Joseph Maxwell, 17, of Pasadena said he has
learned self-discipline working on the cars. "I wish I had a 9-to-5
job working here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell, who has been at the Optimist home for five months because
of a joy-riding conviction, said there is only one thing missing from
the donated-car repair program.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't let us test-drive the cars after were finished working
on them," he lamented.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Killed in Brawl at Club</HD>
<DH>A Compton gang member is shot in the head during a
fistfight at the Conga Room. Police ask witnesses for help in
identifying the gunman.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A reputed Compton gang member was shot to death at a popular Latin
music and dance club in the Wilshire District's Miracle Mile late
Thursday, and Los Angeles police appealed for witnesses to come
forward.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting, which took place about 11:45 p.m. at the Conga Room
on Wilshire Boulevard, escalated from a fistfight that had broken out
in a narrow upstairs hallway, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement sources identified the victim as Jerry Bonds, 26,
of Compton. He was pronounced dead at the scene with a gunshot wound
to the head.</LD>
<TE>   "The victim in the shooting was getting the better of the suspect
during the fight," said Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Stan
Ludwig. "And that's when the suspect went for the gun."</TE>
<TE>   The gunman escaped out a back door, Ludwig said. Several more
shots were fired outside, but police were unsure who was doing the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was a member of the Southside Crips, the Compton gang that
police suspected of orchestrating Tupac Shakur's slaying, according
to a Sept. 25, 1996, Compton police affidavit. The rap star was
gunned down Sept. 7, 1996, in a drive-by shooting by four assailants
in a Cadillac near the Las Vegas Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, whose gang moniker was Monk, was never a suspect in
Shakur's killing, but police identified him as an associate of Crips
gang member Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson, named in the affidavit as
the man who shot Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, police interviewed Bonds and other
Crip members about the Shakur shooting three days later at a
so-called gang safe house on East Glencoe Street in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police would not comment on Bonds' identity or any
alleged gang ties, but asked that more witnesses come forward in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the shooting, more than 200 dancers and diners were
attending a promotional record release party, which featured some
artists on the Def Jam label, as well as a salsa party at opposite
ends of the club, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The Conga Room, which opened in 1998, has several owners,
including actors Jennifer Lopez and Jimmy Smits and comedian Paul
Rodriguez. Closed Friday, the club plans to reopen today.</TE>
<TE>   "The Conga Room takes pride in its continued role as a community
and cultural leader for Latin music and dance," the club said in a
statement.</TE>

<HD>Davis Receives New Endorsements While Continuing Pitch to
Latinos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis continued his intense courtship of Latino voters
Friday, touting his record before the nation's largest Hispanic
business group and scooping up a handful of new endorsements from a
constituency crucial to his reelection hopes on Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech before the annual convention of the United States
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles, Davis again made his
case that California Latinos have benefited from his policies and
appointments in the last four years.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe the Latino agenda is America's agenda," Davis told the
business group. Salting his comments with Spanish words and phrases,
the incumbent Democrat talked at length about his efforts to mend
relations with Mexico after what many Latinos considered the
anti-immigrant policies of his predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   Davis quipped that, after his latest meeting with Mexican
President Vicente Fox, his eighth meeting with a Mexican leader in
four years, "we've grown from amigos to compadres" -- a standard
Davis line that won applause from the chamber members. After his
speech, Davis took part in an unveiling ceremony for a new stamp
honoring Cesar Chavez, the Latino civil rights leader and late
founder of the United Farm Workers union. Davis signed a law making
Chavez's birthday a state holiday.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate event afterward, Davis accepted endorsements from
the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce and groups representing
Latino publishers and peace officers -- part of an all-out effort by
Davis to solidify his Latino support in the final weeks of the
campaign. Davis has lavished attention on California Latinos this
week, responding to a rebellion in the Latino Legislative Caucus and
negative publicity in Spanish-language media over his last-minute
decision on Sept. 30 to veto a bill that would have given driver's
licenses to some illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a damage-control response," said Antonio Gonzales of the
nonpartisan Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis veto came after yearlong negotiations with Latino
legislators and community leaders to craft a bill acceptable to the
governor. The legislation's original author, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo
(D-Los Angeles), has accused the governor of breaking his promise to
sign the bill -- something Davis disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his aides have played down the negative effect of the
veto on his support among Latino voters -- 70% of whom cast their
ballots for Davis four years ago. But the governor's own internal
polling shows a drop in Latino support since the controversy, Davis
aides said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Friday that he will be willing to sign a bill next year
if his concerns about loopholes that might allow criminals or
terrorists to acquire licenses are addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Make that change, I sign the bill, and this issue is behind us,"
said Davis, flanked by Latino politicians and business leaders at the
Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Standing beside Davis after announcing her group's endorsement,
Melinda Guzman Moore, president of the California Hispanic Chambers
of Commerce, suggested the driver's license veto wouldn't haunt him
on Nov. 5. "This community is not about one issue."</TE>

<HD>Bush Stand-In Turns Out for Simon Benefit</HD>
<DH>As the president joins other GOP candidates at rallies, his
housing secretary stresses that the administration stands behind
Simon.</DH>

<DL>SALINAS</DL>
<LD>As Republican candidates in Missouri and Minnesota basked in the
political embrace of President Bush on Friday, Bill Simon Jr. stumped
in California lettuce country with a substitute: U.S. Housing
Secretary Mel Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   "I bring you greetings from our president," Martinez told party
loyalists eating huevos rancheros at Rosita's Mexican diner.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes later, Martinez said Bush's absence from California in the
final weeks of the 2002 campaign should not be taken as a sign of any
lack of confidence in Simon's bid for governor.</LD>
<TE>   "He may not feel he needs to come," Martinez said. "There may be
other races that are closer."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Martinez is the latest Bush emissary to campaign for Simon
in California as the president darts from state to state raising
money and whipping up excitement for candidates in tighter races that
are a higher priority to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's top concerns are to restore Republican control of the
Senate, protect the party's majority in the House and elect GOP
governors in states crucial to his own reelection race in 2004. On
Friday, he campaigned with Senate hopefuls Jim Talent in Missouri and
Norm Coleman in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two weeks before the election, you send the president
into the closest races where he can do the most good," said Charles
Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political
newsletter in Washington. "The California governor's race is not one
of the closest races, and it's not where he can do the most good."</TE>
<TE>   So on the stump with Simon are Bush surrogates like Martinez, whom
Cook described as "pretty far down the food chain."</TE>
<TE>   The national GOP's dim view of the Simon campaign was apparent in
a remark Thursday by Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman
of the National Republican Congressional Committee. At the National
Press Club in Washington, he called Simon's effort "the single
worst-run race in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Mark Miner said the congressman "should be focused
on congressional races instead of a governor's race he knows nothing
about."</TE>
<TE>   At the campaign stop in Salinas, Simon was less blunt when asked
to respond to the scathing assessment of his campaign by a national
party leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we've run a good, strong campaign," Simon said after
breakfast at Rosita's.</TE>
<TE>   With Martinez at his side, Simon also said he was "grateful for
the tremendous support that we've received from the Bush
administration." He recalled that the President, his wife, Laura
Bush, and several Cabinet members had hosted fund-raisers for him in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Though Martinez, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and Veterans Affairs
Secretary Anthony Principi have campaigned with Simon, others have
been low-key. Education Secretary Rod Paige and Commerce Secretary
Don Evans hosted private Simon fund-raisers, but did not appear in
public with the candidate. On Monday in San Francisco, the media will
be barred from a Simon fund-raiser hosted by a Republican Party
luminary, Christie Todd Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Paige and Evans raised several million dollars for Simon on
two trips to California. White House spokesman Ken Lisaius declined
to say whether the president might return before the Nov. 5 election,
but state GOP leaders do not expect another visit.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Simon's campaign is in dire need of financial help. Even with
the presence of Simon and a Cabinet secretary flown in from
Washington for the breakfast fund-raiser at Rosita's, the campaign
charged only $100 a plate, and payment was optional. Simon and
Martinez flew from there to Sacramento to raise more money.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has loaned $9 million of his family fortune to the
campaign, declined to say whether he would put more money into the
race.</TE>
<TE>   His advisors, who once hoped to get as much as $15 million from
the Republican National Committee to replenish the nearly empty
campaign coffers, now expect no more than $1 million -- enough to
sustain less than a week of TV ads statewide.</TE>
<TE>   RNC spokesman Jim Dyke said national GOP leaders remain committed
to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we're just sort of vaguely serving California for
appearances' [sake] would be incorrect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have fared poorly in recent California elections. Bush
lost the state by 1.3 million votes in 2000, and analysts say he
faces steep odds in 2004. But Bush cannot overtly write off Simon's
campaign without risking a backlash from the state's wealthy campaign
donors, whose support he needs for his reelection race.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Republican Party, California is a big checkbook," Cook
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Rosita's, Bush's Housing secretary played up the importance of
the California governor's race. "I'm sent to places where we think we
can make a difference, where it's a viable race, and clearly that's
the case here," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez urged the donors to help Simon get voters to the polls on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we know in Florida, and we learned it the hard way, is
that every vote counts," said Martinez, a Cuban American from
Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez touched on housing policy, saying it was important to
strip away state regulations that constrain home builders. Simon
picked up the same theme.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not building enough homes, to the tune of about 100,000
homes every single year," Simon said. "I will change that if I'm
fortunate enough to be elected governor."</TE>

<HD>Lancaster Man Arrested in Probe of Web Sex Predators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 44-year-old Lancaster man was arrested in Las Vegas during an FBI
sting aimed at sex predators who prowl the Internet for child
victims, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Earl Roy Harvey has been charged in federal court with crossing
state lines with the intent of engaging in sex with a minor, said FBI
Special Agent Daren Borst.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged "victim" in the case was an undercover FBI agent
posing as a 14-year-old boy in Internet chat rooms.</LD>
<TE>   Harvey's Oct. 11 arrest was part of a six-year-old FBI project,
called the Innocent Images National Initiative, whose goal is to
snare adults who use the Internet to share child pornography or
solicit sex with minors. "It's been very successful," Borst said.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey is alleged to have begun communicating with the fake victim
on Sept. 20, and to have suggested meeting for sex after only a few
chat sessions. Agents arrested him at an undisclosed location after
he drove to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey did not seek to verify the boy's identity. "Sometimes they
want a phone call, and if they do, we arrange that," Borst said.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen law enforcement officials raided Harvey's Lancaster
home Tuesday night. They refused to disclose what had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI says it has been putting more resources into fighting
Internet-aided child pornography and child sex exploitation in recent
years. From 1996, when the Innocent Images program began, to 2001,
the number of online child-sex cases investigated by the bureau
increased from 113 to 1,559.</TE>

<HD>Vote to Close Public Hospital Causes Concerns That the Poor
Will Suffer</HD>
<DH>San Luis Obispo County says it plans to transfer the $1.4
million saved to outpatient clinics. Some residents launch a drive
for a new facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sally Ann Connell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN LUIS OBISPO</DL>
<LD>The decision to close the county-funded General Hospital serving the
poor in this affluent corner of the Central Coast has some worried
that it will leave a hole in the fraying health-care system. General
serves as the only public hospital between Monterey and Ventura
counties.</LD>
<LD>   The San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 this
week to close the hospital. Another hearing will be held in three
months, when a timeline for closure will be considered.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact is that more of the medically indigent are treated in
the other four private hospitals than at General," said Gere Sibbach,
the county's auditor.</LD>
<TE>   He said the county pays private hospitals for those who qualify as
medically indigent under state law.</TE>
<TE>   General, however, accounts for 40% of the county's medically
indigent patient admissions, in addition to insured and other paying
patients. But in the fiscal year that ended in June, General admitted
just 1,250 patients. It is licensed for 76 beds, but rarely needs to
staff more than 40.</TE>
<TE>   The town has been debating whether to close General for two
decades. There is much fondness for the old facility in the hills
east of downtown. The medical center stands on the same grounds where
the city fathers built the first General Hospital in 1878.</TE>
<TE>   A ballot initiative in 1996 showed that county voters advocated
keeping the hospital open by a 73% margin, while another in 1998
showed a much slimmer majority opposed to paying for its upkeep
through increased sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The closure will save $1.4 million out of a total county budget of
$250 million, Sibbach said. The plan is to use the savings on the
county's system of outpatient clinics, which also serve the area's
poor.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors in the area have considered General superfluous for
some time, because San Luis Obispo is already served by two private
hospitals and has a population of only 43,000. Countywide, there are
four private hospitals to serve 250,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents believe that now is the wrong time to bail out
of the hospital business, because the county is seeing its health
care system erode, as physicians' groups go bankrupt and insurance
giants move out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Medical Associates, once the region's largest physicians'
group, closed recently because of financial difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   The Lifeguard and Health Net health maintenance organizations,
which provided insurance for thousands of public employees, are
pulling out of the county because of financial strains in their own
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The minimal savings of $1.4 million just does not justify the
closing of a hospital," said Dan Cashier, the chairman of an interim
board studying General Hospital. "We're concerned that we don't have
a stable health care environment."</TE>
<TE>   Cashier said that although the county has maintained it will save
the $1.4 million, it has no idea what private hospitals' costs for
serving the indigent will be.</TE>
<TE>   A driving force behind the region's medical crisis among private
providers is low Medicare reimbursements, doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   Under Medicare, the federal health coverage program for senior
citizens, San Luis Obispo County is considered a small, rural county
and receives reimbursements considerably below neighboring Santa
Barbara County -- and lower still than Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Heatherington, who supports keeping General Hospital open,
said she is working with other residents to start a community-based
hospital to provide service to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Heatherington's group hopes the hospital will be supported by
local fund-raising, as well as state and federal grants.</TE>
<TE>   County officials have said they will rent out the old hospital
site for $1 if the drive is successful.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really odd to me is this county for over 100 years has
taken care of the county's poor. And now it says it can't,"
Heatherington said.</TE>
<TE>   She believes closing the hospital will affect not only the
medically indigent but people on Medi-Cal and Medicare as well.</TE>
<TE>   "They turn to General Hospital because many private doctors in the
area will not see them," she said. "And now it says it can't."</TE>

<CX>   Health Net -- A story in the California section Saturday on the
closure of San Luis Obispo County's General Hospital incorrectly
implied that Health Net no longer will provide health insurance in
the county. A Health Net spokesman said the company is no longer
providing health maintenance organization coverage there, but is
still offering plans to employers for paid provider organizations and
exclusive provider organizations. Health Net has dropped HMO coverage
because of the high cost of doing business in the county, not because
of the company's finances, the spokesman said.</CX>

<HD>2 Navy Jets Crash at Sea Near Monterey; 4 Crewmen Missing</HD>
<DH>Super Hornet fighters based at Lemoore air station were on
a training exercise when a fishing boat captain heard a loud boom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets crashed into the sea Friday morning
while on a routine training mission about 80 miles southwest of
Monterey, Calif., officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Coast Guard, Navy, Air National Guard and a commercial fishing
boat searched without success for the four aviators aboard the Super
Hornet jets, but there were no signs of survivors or bodies.</LD>
<LD>   The names of the missing crewmen were withheld pending
notification of their families. Each plane carries a pilot and a
radar interception officer.</LD>
<TE>   The Navy said the cause of the accident had not been determined,
but aviation sources said any simultaneous crash of two planes
probably involved a collision.</TE>
<TE>   Ray McDonnell, captain of the 40-foot commercial fishing boat
White Dove, said he was fishing for albacore when he heard a loud
boom.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably was the sound of those two planes hitting each
other," he said. "I looked up, and this stuff started raining down
all around me."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said he notified the Coast Guard and started collecting
the floating debris.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a tire and what looked like a piece of a tail," he said.
He also found a wallet.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said that after picking up everything he could find, he
headed back to his dock in Marina, where he was scheduled to
rendezvous with Coast Guard officials before dawn today.</TE>
<TE>   The supersonic, twin-engine aircraft that crashed were from Strike
Fighter Squadron 41, nicknamed the Black Aces Squadron, based at
Lemoore Naval Air Station, about 30 miles south of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   The crashes occurred at 9:40 a.m., about an hour after the planes
took off from Lemoore. The Navy said the planes were among a group of
eight F/A-18Fs participating in the training exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The versatile, $57-million jets, flown by the Navy and the Marine
Corps, are used for air strikes, air-to-air combat, reconnaissance
and close air support.</TE>
<TE>   The planes are equipped with a 20-millimeter cannon and can carry
mines, rockets and bombs, but neither of the jets that crashed was
armed.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's was the first crash of Super Hornets since the planes,
which are advanced versions of earlier F-18 Hornet jets, were
introduced about four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 109 Super Hornets delivered so far are the most advanced
fighters in the Navy arsenal. Capable of speeds up to about 1,250
mph, the planes are equipped with sophisticated electronic targeting
systems and stealth features that make them more difficult to track
on radar.</TE>

<HD>Fugitive Held in Home-Loan Scheme Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH>Studio City man on the run since 1993 agrees to pay
restitution to 26 lending institutions. He also faces a possible
prison term and fine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Studio City man who had been a fugitive for nine years has pleaded
guilty to orchestrating a scheme to obtain more than $20 million in
fraudulent home loans, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   William Lee Cranston, 34, had been on the run since 1993, living
under assumed names in Mexico, Florida and Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently confident that he had successfully eluded
investigators, Cranston returned to Los Angeles about two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   But last Memorial Day weekend, FBI agents were waiting for him at
Los Angeles International Airport when he returned from a holiday
trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven J. Olson said the agents had been
tipped off that Cranston was using the name William De Martini.</TE>
<TE>   Cranston, who is being held without bail, faces a possible
sentence of up to 6 1/2 years in prison and a $1-million fine when he
is sentenced March 3.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of a plea agreement with prosecutors, he has agreed to
pay restitution to 26 lending institutions. Their losses are
estimated at $2.4 million to $4.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the properties were recovered by the banks through
foreclosures after the fraud was discovered and Cranston fled the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Cranston's lawyer, Alan Baum, said the scam was an outgrowth of a
building boom in the Inland Empire in which many developers were
under financial pressure to get rid of unsold houses at steep
discounts. Cranston, he said, stepped into the breach by creating
fictitious buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "But there was never any intent to beat the banks out of their
money," Baum said. "The loans were fully collateralized."</TE>
<TE>   From 1990 to 1993, Cranston oversaw the preparation and submission
of 89 home mortgage loans totaling more than $20 million, prosecutor
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   The purported borrowers were people paid by Cranston for the use
of their names and credit histories. They were not involved in the
loan transactions and never lived in the homes that were purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Each application contained fabricated documents, such as pay
stubs, bank statements and income tax returns, that Cranston created
on a specially designed computer system.</TE>
<TE>   He also created a number of sham employers and investment
companies with toll-free telephone numbers that would ring in his
office when the lenders tried to verify information on the
applications.</TE>
<TE>   To carry out the scheme, Cranston recruited people from throughout
the mortgage loan industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen others were previously charged in the case, including
loan brokers, bank employees, purported borrowers, an escrow officer,
a real estate appraiser and a tax preparer.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged were Cranston's business partner, Tony Leon, and two
of their employees. All have either pleaded guilty or been convicted
at trial.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Wins Suit Against District</HD>

<LD>A Superior Court jury Friday ordered the Los Angeles Unified School
District to pay $425,000 to a former Locke High School teacher who
said her 1st Amendment rights were violated after she refused to
allow her students to be searched for weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Ami Motevalli, 32, who taught art under a one-year contract at the
South-Central Los Angeles campus, charged that she was not rehired
because she spoke out against random searches of students using
hand-held metal detectors.</LD>
<LD>   She was awarded $137,500 in lost wages and $287,500 for emotional
stress.</LD>
<TE>   The award in a Los Angeles courtroom proves that "the citizenry,
as represented by the jury, will not stand for LAUSD hiding its
incompetence," said her attorney, Dan Stormer. "It will award
significant damages when they attempt to silence good teachers
speaking out on behalf of students."</TE>
<TE>   Harold Kwalwasser, general counsel for the district, said
Motevalli's contract was not renewed because she endangered students
by prohibiting such random searches. Those searches have been
conducted daily for nine years in the district's middle and high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We're terribly disappointed with the jury verdict," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motevalli said she has mixed feelings about the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "It is tough to feel great, because the experience was actually
really horrible," she said. "I'm not going to be able to return to
that school. I am very sad for not having the opportunity to be with
my students."</TE>
<TE>   "When my students started to organize and speak up on issues, they
were constantly hunted down [like] me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The message that this sends is that their work ended up being so
positive. At least now they see some justice out of it."</TE>

<HD>Glendale Loses Bid to Block Suit Over Hills Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendale's effort to kill plans for a large hillside subdivision lost
ground this week when a judge ruled that a lawsuit brought by the
developer has sufficient merit to proceed toward trial.</LD>
<LD>   John L. Gregg, who wants to build a 572-home luxury tract in the
Verdugo Hills, filed suit after the City Council unanimously voted
down the project in April. Council members said the 238-acre Oakmont
development would pollute the air, harm wildlife and destroy scenic
vistas.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rodney Nelson
rejected the city's request to throw out the lawsuit. City attorneys
contended that Gregg could not prove Glendale officials had done
anything illegal or improper in denying permission to build.</LD>
<TE>   Gregg's attorney, Robert McMurry, said the judge's ruling bolsters
his contention that the city "so strictly regulated our property that
we can't reasonably use it." Since the 1980s, a string of court
rulings has held that government actions diminishing property value
amount to illegal "takings" of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah J. Fox, the lead attorney for the city, said she still
hopes that she can get the case thrown out before trial. "This is
just the beginning of a long land-use dispute," she said. "California
courts have held that you are not entitled to an overly ambitious
level of development."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dave Weaver said Friday that the judge's decision had
not changed his belief that Gregg's proposal is too large and would
be too destructive to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The builder's argument that he can't reasonably use his property
"is totally untrue," Weaver said. "He's putting in maximum density.
He can develop it, but not to the density he wants."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the houses would mean filling in a canyon several
hundred feet deep, which would obliterate a stream, the councilman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg's lawsuit does not specify the amount of damages to be
sought during trial, but McMurry said it would be "in the tens of
millions." No trial date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people opposing Oakmont packed the City Council
chamber last spring when the council held an 11-hour hearing on
Gregg's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   McMurry argued to Nelson that Glendale had refused to give fair
consideration to the project in the 10 years since it had been
submitted. Gregg has offered several alternatives, including one with
as few as 90 residential units, but the city "refused to tell us what
level of development it would permit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists persuaded state lawmakers to allocate $8 million
to buy the Oakmont tract for open space. McMurry said that falls
short of its value of $40 million to $50 million.</TE>

<HD>Early Birds Enjoy a Slice of the Good Life Cheap at Torrey
Pines</HD>
<DH>Members of the Dawn Patrol are hoping the U.S. Open doesn't
squeeze them out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are called the Dawn Patrol. But those who don't understand their
obsession with golf or their love for Torrey Pines Municipal Golf
Course would probably call them crazy.</LD>
<LD>   They arrive at this picturesque seaside course at all hours of the
night, and they pull into the parking lot with a mission -- to secure
one of the first unofficial tee times on the north course or the
recently renovated south course, which two weeks ago was chosen as
the site of the 2008 U.S. Open. The official tee times, and typically
the slower play that the early birds hope to avoid, begin at 7:30
a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Some Dawn Patrol veterans sleep on foam mattress pads in the back
of their SUVs. Others curl up in their front seats under blankets.
Before bedding down for the night, they chain golf bags -- usually a
cheap set or a dummy bag -- to a metal rail next to the starter's
window to secure their place in line. They keep their prized clubs in
the car.</LD>
<TE>   The first bags, and thus the first tee times, belong to the
die-hards, people like Chris Collette, Earl Graham, Paul Doman and
Armando Valencia -- retirees who live for affordable greens fees,
ocean views, brisk four-hour rounds and the men's club camaraderie
that the Dawn Patrol affords.</TE>
<TE>   On this crisp, clear San Diego morning, there is anger and
controversy within the rank and file. While they snoozed in the
parking lot, Collette's and Graham's bags were stolen. Over the
years, bags have been removed from the rail and tossed on top of the
pro shop. But that trick was usually pulled on some newcomer who
tried to skirt the rules by leaving the premises during the night.
Dawn Patrolers are expected to stay in the parking lot once their
bags are dropped off at the starter's window.</TE>
<TE>   By 5:30 a.m., the real bags have replaced the dummy bags and a
line is beginning to form in front of the window. In the lounge,
where the golfers meet to sort out the morning's order of play and
discuss their latest rounds, a conspiracy theory is working its way
around the room.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't make any sense," said Collette, 74, a
three-day-a-week Dawn Patroler for almost 15 years. "Some of us think
the bags being ripped off is part of all this U.S. Open. Maybe some
people around here think we're getting too much attention."</TE>
<TE>   The last thing these guys want is more attention, but they can't
escape it now that the entire golfing world knows where the 2008 U.S.
Open will be played.</TE>
<TE>   The Dawn Patrol was recently featured in a San Diego newspaper's
sports section, the day the United States Golf Assn. awarded Torrey
Pines the U.S. Open. Many fear their precious tee times will be
squeezed, and they will be priced out of existence by the city of San
Diego, which owns and manages the course.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been trying to take this away from us for 40 years," said
Richard "Dutch" Wenger, 68, one of the longest hitters of the early
risers and the proud owner of a motorized pull cart that comes
equipped with cruise control. "We're a nuisance to the city and their
profit-making."</TE>
<TE>   The early-birds fear that the relatively low playing rates for
seniors will be raised to help pay for renovations, which include a
makeover of the Lodge at Torrey Pines, a 175-room craftsman-style
resort where rooms go for $450 a night.</TE>
<TE>   Greens fees have risen steadily to help pay for changes to the
south course. But the course, which hosts the PGA Buick Open every
February, is still a bargain for people who live within the city
limits. The south course is $40 to walk on weekdays, the north is
$29. Seniors can buy a monthly card for the north course that
provides 10 plays for $135, and they can play the south for $25.
Weekday rates for nonresidents are $95 for the south and $65 for the
north course. Weekends are $115 and $75.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away at Meadows Del Mar, a public course with a nice
layout but without the breathtaking ocean view, city residents pay
$110 for weekday play and $140 on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Course officials at Torrey Pines say they won't capitalize on its
U.S. Open fame by jacking up rates. In fact, the city announced this
week that greens fees will remain frozen until after the 2008
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of San Diego is big on benefiting these folks," said Jim
Allen, the course's operations manager, noting that most public golf
courses reserve times for their own Dawn Patrols. "I think there will
always be that time available at Torrey Pines."</TE>
<TE>   Six-thirty in the morning might seem early for twisting stiff
muscles and whacking a little white ball through the damp air, but
it's routine for folks used to rising long before the morning paper
hits the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, Valencia, 80, arrived at 4 a.m. and was in one of
the first groups off the first tee of the north course.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been up since 1 a.m.," he said. "To me, it's worth it to get
out here early. This is the best bargain in town. It's nothing to pay
a hundred bucks now at some courses."</TE>
<TE>   And these days, a $100 greens fee doesn't always guarantee a fast
round, which is another reason the elderly duffers rev up their pull
carts so early.</TE>
<TE>   "After 7:30, it's tourists with carts, people taking pictures of
the sea and 5 1/2-hour rounds," said Doman, 73, a retired fire
captain.</TE>
<TE>   If Doman and his buddies wanted to sleep in, they might have to
fight to get a tee time using the course's computerized call-in
system</TE>
<TE>   "I just gave up after a while," said John Kern, 46, one of the
younger members of the Dawn Patrol. "It's like trying to speed dial
to win a trip to Europe from a radio station. It's nuts."</TE>

<HD>Davis Denies Parole for Model Inmate Jailed 22 Years in
Killing</HD>

<LD>Despite a flood of letters and petitions urging that he free her,
Gov. Gray Davis on Friday denied parole to a model inmate who has
served 22 years for masterminding a killing over a drug deal.</LD>
<LD>   Davis sided with the Marin County district attorney, who argued
that Jerilyn Becker's goal at the time of the murder was to obtain
heroin, and that her craving for the drug was so great that it led to
a fatal shooting in the presence of the victim's 7-year-old son.</LD>
<LD>   Davis was unavailable for comment. But his spokesman, Byron
Tucker, said, "The governor was concerned that should Miss Becker be
released into society and revert back into a pattern of drug use, her
violent temperament would lead to a public safety risk."</LD>
<TE>   In any case, Davis rarely frees murderers. He has agreed to free
only two killers deemed ready for release by his appointees on the
state parole board, rejecting 141 others.</TE>
<TE>   But few high-profile convicts have received the level of support
that Becker, 52, has gotten in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic nuns, college professors, retired bankers, 14 state
legislators and the man who sentenced her to prison, retired Marin
County Superior Court Judge E. Warren Mcguire, all have declared her
successfully rehabilitated.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, Becker has served as a peer counselor
with drug and alcohol recovery groups, ministered to dying prisoners
and earned exemplary reviews from her work supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, her supporters point out that although a jury
convicted her of first-degree murder, she did not fire the gunshot
that killed the victim, Rickey Caponio.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the governor's decision was a terrible shame," said Santa
Barbara businessman Howard Schiffer, one of more than 1,000
Californians who wanted Becker released.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a real opportunity to validate somebody's redemption and
successful effort to turn their life around.</TE>
<TE>   "It has everything to with the fact that the governor has
aspirations to higher political office. The parole system is a sham
and a political tool to appeal to moderate voters."</TE>
<TE>   Tucker disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a matter of public support," he said. "This is about a
horrible, premeditated crime, and although Miss Becker has made
commendable gains in prison, the governor believes she could pose a
public safety risk if released from prison."</TE>

<HD>Murder Trial Opens in Hotel Balcony Death</HD>
<DH>Prosecutor alleges Texas man killed co-worker over fears
that their affair would be exposed. Defense says woman's fall was an
accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A business executive threw his co-worker to her death from an
eighth-floor hotel balcony because he feared disclosure of their
affair, a prosecutor told jurors Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations came as the murder trial for Robert Lee Salazar,
39, in the 1996 death of Sandra Lorena Orellana, 27, opened in Los
Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   In his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz
emphasized that, at the time of the incident, Salazar had just become
vice president of the Houston-based company where Orellana was his
subordinate.</LD>
<TE>   Foltz said Salazar, who acquired a scratch near his eye sometime
during the fatal night, was married and knew that Orellana was
engaged. Foltz did not characterize the sexual encounter as either
consensual or forced.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview outside the courtroom, Foltz said the facts
suggested a motive that would become more clear later in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Michael R. Coghlan said Salazar and Orellana had
a consensual affair that night, and she accidentally fell from the
balcony where the couple were making love.</TE>
<TE>   He said the reason Salazar did not call for help after Orellana
fell and made inconsistent statements to police the following day was
that he was afraid of losing his job and family. "He exercised a
monumental piece of bad judgment," Coghlan said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 members of Orellana's family came from Texas for the
trial. They wore buttons that read, "We love you, Sandra Orellana."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, who was released on $500,000 bail last year, arrived at
the courtroom of Judge Philip Gutierrez dressed in a business suit
and accompanied by his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution and defense agree on the basic chronology of
events. Salazar and Orellana worked for Skill Master Staffing
Services, where he was her supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   They came to Los Angeles on Nov. 12, 1996, on business and checked
into the Industry Hills Sheraton.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of work, they drank heavily at the hotel bar,
celebrating her birthday and engagement. She was scheduled to fly to
Hong Kong the following day to meet up with her fiance.</TE>
<TE>   Late at night, they went to the eighth floor, where Salazar had
arranged for their rooms to be next to each other. From that point,
the accounts differ.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz described and showed the jurors photographs of the crime
scene: a purse on the floor just inside the door of the victim's
room, blood on the bed sheets, Salazar's shoes and underwear in the
room, an open sliding door. Her broken, partially clad body was found
below.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz displayed for the jury a replica of the balcony railing to
attack one of Salazar's accounts: that Orellana fell as she turned
around to face him while they were making love.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz told the panel that an expert witness would testify that
Orellana, at 5 feet 2, was too short to have fallen over it on her
own.</TE>
<TE>   Coghlan said he would present evidence to support his contention
that Orellana's death was a tragic accident. He said witnesses would
state that they saw Salazar and Orellana caressing each other at the
bar.</TE>
<TE>   And, Coghlan added, testimony would show that Orellana -- whose
blood-alcohol level was .22 that night -- fell over the balcony when
she hopped and sat on it, which he said will be Salazar's new and
true account of what happened.</TE>

<LD>More than 50,000 snowmobilers who have been used to riding groomed
national forest trails near Lake Tahoe may have to find their own way
this winter.</LD>
<LD>   A state commission this week rejected more than $400,000 for
winter recreation programs in the Lake Tahoe Basin and along
California Highway 88 both east and west of the Kirkwood ski resort
and Carson Pass.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners also delayed until December a decision on funding
for 300 miles of Sequoia National Forest trails east of Fresno and
east of Bakersfield.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Forest Service spokesmen said the decisions could mean more
snowmobilers will get lost or run into avalanche danger, cross into
prohibited wilderness areas that won't be patrolled with overflights,
and disturb wildlife or the environment.</TE>

<HD>New Group Formed to Press Secession Efforts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opening a third front in the battle to split Los Angeles, secession
leaders said Friday they have formed a group to bring together
pockets of breakup supporters outside the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The secessionists launched the Alliance for a New Los Angeles even
as they struggled to win over majorities on their home turf.</LD>
<LD>   "Folks have been working in other parts of the city but they have
been on their own," said attorney Bob Scott, the alliance
co-chairman. "This unifies them into a credible group to get the
facts out there and counter the fear."</LD>
<TE>   A formal announcement of the alliance's formation is scheduled for
Monday, when the group will open an office in Westchester, where the
new effort will be coordinated.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic appears to be too little, too late, said secession
opponents. A Times poll this week found that 62% of likely voters
outside the Valley oppose Valley secession. The poll also showed that
secession is trailing in the Valley for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beyond a lost cause in the rest of the city," said Larry
Levine, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One L.A. Forming the
alliance, he said, is "a curious decision, given that their support
is eroding so quickly in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said the alliance probably would not raise or spend money
for mail or television ads so that it wouldn't take resources away
from the Valley effort.</TE>
<TE>   The group will send speakers to forums and help distribute
pro-secession literature outside the breakaway areas.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Valley Independence Committee announced Friday that
it has begun running a new television commercial on Valley cable
stations. It shows idyllic scenes throughout the Valley as a narrator
says, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a city that is safer, cleaner, and better. Imagine a city
with good parks, responsive police and stronger communities. Imagine
a city where businesses are thriving and good jobs are growing."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Independence Committee plans to launch a citywide ad
blitz, beginning Monday, said Bob Jimenez, a consultant to the
campaign. Although Hollywood secessionists can't afford spots on the
broadcast networks, they will air three different ads on a variety of
cable outlets.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign will also air two radio ads on three local stations
during rush hours, Jimenez said. Both are narrated by Gene La Pietra,
the wealthy nightclub owner who is bankrolling Hollywood's breakaway
bid.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign has flooded local
stations with ads.</TE>

<LD>San Juan Capistrano city officials have cleared the way for a planned
parochial high school to build an athletic complex on a 29-acre
parcel believed to contain an American Indian burial ground.</LD>
<LD>   Junipero Serra High School boosters had forced a special January
election, seeking voter permission to rezone the property on the
north end of town.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders, concerned that they might lose room to negotiate
with school officials should the initiative pass, struck a deal this
week in which the school will pay the city up to $200,000 a year in a
student "head tax" and cap enrollment at 2,000.</LD>
<TE>   School officials had hoped to attract as many as 3,000 students.
The high school is scheduled to open next fall with about 300 to 400
ninth- and 10th-graders.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise was endorsed by David Belardes, the
state-recognized representative of the Juaneno tribe, but was
rejected by other factions of the local tribe, many of whom spoke at
a packed City Council meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After about three hours of debate, the council voted 3 to 2 to
rezone the property for an athletic complex and an adjacent parcel --
the Sycamore Commons office complex -- for school office and class
space.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the agreement, the school will include California
Native American history as part of its curriculum, permit Juaneno and
cultural activities around the school's athletic complex, and
dedicate monuments on campus commemorating the tribe's religious and
political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The grave sites -- there are believed to be seven -- will not be
disturbed by the athletic grounds, according to the negotiated deal.</TE>
<TE>   Belardes could not be reached for comment, but tribal manager
Joyce Stanfield Perry said the school's plan "is sensitive and meets
our goals of preservation and education."</TE>
<TE>   The $200-per-student "head tax" will help make up for the tax
revenue the city would have earned had the land been developed with a
450,000-square-foot hotel and office complex most recently planned
for the site.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the original deal would have generated about $1
million a year in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was a real tough call," said Councilman David
Swerdlin, who voted for the compromise. "It's nice to have that tax
base, but we'll now have a site more fitting to San Juan's ambience,
with athletic fields and open space. I'd much rather have this than
450,000 square feet of cement."</TE>
<TE>   Because the council approved the plans, the initiative won't
appear on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Serra backers have struggled to find a home for three years.</TE>
<TE>   They originally planned to build the Catholic school on property
owned by a Christian ministry, which backed out of the deal when it
learned that non-Catholics would be barred from teaching religion at
the school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long process," said Lisa Tremble, a spokeswoman for
the school.</TE>

<HD>Simon Bristles at Criticism of His Charitable Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a television ad released this summer, Bill Simon Jr., the wealthy
investment banker and Republican gubernatorial candidate, is seen
shaking hands and chatting with runaway teenagers at a Hollywood
shelter.</LD>
<LD>   Although the scene was staged to send a specific message -- meet
the multimillionaire who feels compassion for the needy -- it was a
familiar setting for Simon.</LD>
<LD>   Since he was a youngster, the 51-year-old businessman has
volunteered at several shelters and clinics, including a stint at a
hospital in Africa during college. He has also donated millions of
dollars to charity through a private foundation established with his
wife, Cynthia.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's friends say his charitable zeal is more than a campaign
selling point. They say it is a crucial part of his life, instilled
by his parents and sustained by his deep religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Although his charitable assets are relatively small -- compared
with those of bigger, long-established foundations -- Simon has been
a consistent supporter of his favorite causes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is trying to live the Gospel," said Msgr. Lloyd
Torgerson, Simon's pastor at St. Monica Church in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Since he announced his bid to unseat Gov. Gray Davis, Simon has
been criticized for some of his charitable donations to conservative
religious organizations, though those represent a fraction of his
giving.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer, the Davis campaign accused Simon of siphoning money
away from his father's charitable foundation, a charge Simon calls
ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's propensity for charity work grew out of the examples set
by his mother, Carol, and his father, William E. Simon Sr., a
conservative Catholic and Wall Street powerhouse who served as
Treasury secretary under Presidents Nixon and Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Simon amassed a fortune estimated at $500 million as a
pioneer in the field of mergers and acquisitions. He started the
William E. Simon Foundation and donated much of his wealth to
conservative church organizations, shelters for abused women and
children, and athletic facilities for youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 1970s, the elder Simon volunteered at Covenant
House, a shelter for runaway teenagers in New York, and took his
children along. Before he died in 2000, he put his two sons and five
daughters on the board of his foundation and required that each of
them spend at least 150 hours a year volunteering in the community.</TE>
<TE>   As a high school student in New Jersey, Bill Simon Jr. became a
mentor through the Big Brother program. He volunteered at Covenant
House, showing up every Wednesday night to serve meals and play
basketball with the teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving to California in 1990 to head the Western office of
the family investment firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons, Simon and his
family have donated thousands of dollars to Covenant House in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The facility has honored Simon by giving him the title of chairman
emeritus and, in 1999, naming a new 24-bed transitional living center
after him.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Simon formed his own charitable foundation.
Between 1997 and 2000, the only years for which records are
available, the Cynthia L. and William E. Simon Jr. Foundation donated
$2.6 million to charity. As the only trustees of the foundation,
Simon and his wife choose the contribution recipients.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the donations have gone to mainstream charities, such
as United Way and Catholic Charities, and colleges, including the
candidate's alma mater -- Williams College in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   "People give to the causes they feel a strong connection with,"
said James Ferris, director of the Center on Philanthropy and Public
Policy at USC. "It's a very personal act."</TE>
<TE>   Between 1997 and 2000, United Way received about 20% of the
foundation's donations, or about $516,000, according to foundation
records.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Charities, a national organization that funds a variety
of services for people of all faiths, received roughly 10% of the
foundation's contributions during that period, or about $223,000.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also gave about $130,000, or about 5% of its
funding during that period, to local Catholic churches and the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Simon's contributions have gone to organizations that
espouse a deeply conservative political ideology or fundamental
religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation records show that in 1999 he donated $950 to the
Religious Heritage of America Foundation, which describes its mission
as working to "restore the biblical and moral roots of America by
merging thought with action, thereby infusing the culture with the
life-changing message of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's donations also reflect Simon's advocacy of
entertainment that is free of explicit sex, violence and foul
language.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, along with his father and brother, helped finance PAX-TV, a
family-oriented cable TV channel that now reaches 86% of U.S.
television households.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Simon donated $9,200 to the Christian Film and
Television Commission, a Camarillo-based group that says its mission
is to promote "a biblical worldview in the mass media of
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, as a trustee of his father's foundation, Simon has
approved thousands of dollars in contributions to antiabortion
organizations, such as the National Right to Life Education and Trust
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Simon himself became a founding member of Good
Counsel Inc., a New York-area organization that provides shelter for
pregnant women who have been persuaded by abortion opponents in front
of clinics to forgo abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Good Counsel and its founder, Christopher Bell, have been linked
to antiabortion activists who block the entrances of abortion
clinics.</TE>
<TE>   During the primary campaign, the California Pro-Life Council
endorsed Simon and gave him a contribution of free literature
mailings worth $3,300.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has promised that, if elected, he would put his opposition
to abortion aside as governor and uphold California's constitutional
protections for abortion.</TE>
<TE>   But his ties to antiabortion groups have made it hard for some
abortion rights supporters to believe him.</TE>
<TE>   "We think any kind of support for a group like that belies any
support for the right to choose," said Tracy Salkowitz, executive
director of the California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which has endorsed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the causes he has supported, the manner in which
Simon has managed his family's charitable funds has been criticized.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the Davis campaign aired a television spot that
accused Simon of taking excessive fees from his father's foundation.</TE>
<TE>   That ad was based on an article in the San Francisco Chronicle
asserting that Simon's firm had charged unusually high commissions to
manage some of the family trust's investments.</TE>
<TE>   But experts contacted by The Times said it is difficult to gauge
the fairness of a commission without examining the extent of work
done to manage the assets.</TE>
<TE>   A commission of 6%, as charged by Simon's firm, might be justified
if the fund under management included stocks, bonds and complex real
estate holdings, the experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Flint, a Simon spokesman, said the newspaper story was
erroneous because most of the money paid to the firm had been used to
pay salaries and benefits for six full-time employees.</TE>
<TE>   Flint could not explain, however, why the six full-time employees
had not been listed, as required, in the foundation records.</TE>
<TE>   Simon bristles at criticism of his charitable work, saying his
donation of time and money over the years has been a heartfelt
attempt to honor the traditions started by his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Though his father was a strong influence, Simon said his mother,
who died of cancer in 1995, also taught him the importance of
charity.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, he said, Carol Simon anonymously sent flowers to
cancer patients at a New Jersey hospital. No one at the hospital knew
she was the source of the flowers until after she died.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about giving from your heart," Simon said.</TE>

<HD>Angel Fans, Giant Fans: The Drivers, the Driven</HD>
<DH>In Anaheim, the car's the way to go; San Francisco fans
have more options. It's just part of the bigger south-north rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At one ballpark, about half the fans arrive on trains, subways and
trolleys, on foot, bicycles and even by sea. At the other, nearly
everyone arrives by car. As an alternative, some might use their
spouse's car.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco and Orange County couldn't be more different.
Stereotypes abound: Fog and sunshine. Liberals and conservatives. The
City and The Suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   As the World Series gets underway today, even the way fans of the
Anaheim Angels and the San Francisco Giants take themselves out to
the ballgame offers a metaphor for the stark differences that divide
north from south in California.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco and Edison International Field
in Anaheim are models of transportation efficiency that would be
utter failures if their locations -- and philosophies -- were
swapped, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange County lifestyle is very different from the San
Francisco lifestyle," said Mike McNally of UC Irvine's Institute of
Transportation Studies. "San Francisco built the ideal stadium for
its region. At the same time, I don't think you could build the Big
Ed in a way that it would serve what we have here better."</TE>
<TE>   In a city that has long viewed freeways with disdain, as the
concrete embodiment of civilization's decline, Pacific Bell Park was
designed to rely on public transportation. Driving has been so
discouraged since the stadium opened in 2000 that its 5,000 parking
spaces often don't fill up.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Orange County and all of Southern California have
long viewed freeways as the lubricant that allows civilization to
move forward. To that end, Anaheim Stadium (now Edison Field) opened
in 1966 near the confluence of three freeways with the automobile in
mind -- with only the automobile in mind.</TE>
<TE>   There's a Metrolink station a few line drives from left field, and
fans could use it to get to games. Except Metrolink trains don't run
through Anaheim on weekends, and during the week the last train
leaves at 7:10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco has always reminded me of an East Coast city in
every way. They're much more into public transit," said George Urch,
spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority, whose buses
run past Edison Field but aren't allowed inside the parking lot. "The
car is king down here."</TE>
<TE>   A city of San Francisco Web site offering parking tips begins with
this deadpan observation: "Parking in the City can be difficult."
That's about as optimistic as the official line gets. A map of
parking restrictions around Pac Bell Park would take both Rand and
McNally to navigate.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was to make getting to the ballpark [on public
transportation] a big part of the whole ballpark experience," said
Alfonso Felder, transportation program manager for the Giants. "And
it has. It has become part of the culture of the place."</TE>
<TE>   There are other advantages. "If you take BART, you can stop after
the game, have a few belts and you don't have to drive," said Jim
Hodges of the San Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic. "It
works so much better."</TE>
<TE>   A study of how people get to Pac Bell Park found that about 45%
come by public transportation, 5% on ferries that dock at the
waterfront park and 2% by "creative means" -- mostly on bikes that
have a parking lot reserved for them. Only 48% of fans come in a car.</TE>
<TE>   No one studies how fans get to Edison Field, but it's assumed that
boats aren't in the mix, since the nearby Santa Ana River is nearly
always dry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an idea out there that insists that public transportation
is good and that cars are bad," said McNally, the UCI transportation
expert. "Not only is that too black and white, it's just plain
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   As a tourist destination that draws 20 million visitors a year,
Anaheim is at the forefront of traffic planning in Southern
California. Since 1988, personnel at the city's Traffic Management
Center have monitored sensors in roads and closed-circuit cameras to
synchronize signals and keep cars moving in congested areas,
including Edison Field on game days.</TE>
<TE>   For most fans, it seems to work. John Lower, who manages Anaheim's
traffic network, said the city used to track how long it took all the
lots at Edison Field to empty after games but stopped five years ago
"because nobody complains."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Stafford certainly doesn't. The 43-year-old Angels fan from
Mission Viejo has never had a problem getting in and out of Edison
Field. If public transportation works in San Francisco, that's great,
Stafford said. It just wouldn't work here.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is easier than this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeways versus trains. Angels versus Giants. To Stafford, it's
all part of the greater rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "The feud between north and south is on all fronts. Everything
they have is seen as better than the way we have it," said Stafford,
who grew up in Fullerton and went to college in San Jose for a year
until the unrelenting criticism he received for all things Southern
California forced him to come back closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it goes back to the aqueduct. There's always been some
sort of aggravation on the part of Northern Californians who see all
their water coming down here," he said. "In Northern California, they
view everything south of San Luis Obispo as being Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This World Series is a clash of north and south like nothing else
I've ever seen."</TE>

<HD>Killer Confesses After 20 Years</HD>
<DH>To earn chance at parole, a man admits guilt in shooting of
a Turkish consul in 1982.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Armenian man convicted of assassinating a Turkish consul in 1982
admitted for the first time Friday his role in the killing in
exchange for the possibility of eventual release from state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Harry Sassounian, 39, will be eligible for parole in 2007 under
terms of the settlement with prosecutors. The Los Angeles County
district attorney's office agreed not to retry the penalty phase of
the case against the defendant.</LD>
<LD>   "I participated in the murder of Kemal Arikan," Sassounian said in
Superior Court Friday. "I renounce the use of terrorist tactics such
as the assassination of diplomats to achieve political goals. I
regret the suffering of the Arikan family."</LD>
<TE>   Sassounian was convicted in 1984 of shooting the consul general at
a stoplight in Westwood. Prosecutors argued that the killing was part
of a campaign targeting Turkish officials for assassination in
retaliation for the massacre of more than 1 million Armenians between
1915 and 1918. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office decided to retry the penalty phase
of the case after a federal appeals court ruling in 2000 made the
defendant immediately eligible for parole. The justices upheld the
first-degree murder conviction, but reversed the finding that the
victim's nationality was the reason for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Judge Robert J. Perry re-sentenced Sassounian to a term
of 25 years to life in state prison and told him he would be eligible
for parole only on Sept. 28, 2007, "not on any date before or after."</TE>
<TE>   Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick Dixon said his office will
probably oppose Sassounian's release.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said outside court that prosecutors determined the
settlement was appropriate, in part, because of the defendant's
public statement admitting his involvement in the political
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos, whose father originally defended
Sassounian, said the deal was "18 years coming."</TE>
<TE>   "Given the tenor of the times, parole is not an easy task. But we
certainly are a lot closer today than yesterday."</TE>

<HD>Environmental Group Sues U.S. Over Whale Deaths</HD>
<DH>Action seeks to shut down a seismic research project in
Baja California funded by National Science Foundation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming that the federal government failed to gauge the ecological
impact of its own experiments, an environmental organization filed a
lawsuit Friday in an attempt to shut down a Baja California seismic
research project recently blamed for the death of two beaked whales.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Biological Diversity, based in Tucson and
Idyllwild, filed the 16-page complaint against the National Science
Foundation, which is paying for the research, in U.S. District Court
in San Francisco. The environmental organization is hoping for a
hearing Monday in front of U.S. Magistrate James Larson, and will
seek a temporary restraining order to stop the research project, said
Brendan Cummings, an attorney at the center.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to move fast, because this is ongoing right now,"
Cummings said.</LD>
<TE>   Curt Suplee, a National Science Foundation spokesman, said his
agency cannot discuss litigation. Earlier this week, before the
lawsuit was filed, he and several others said there is no direct
evidence that the whales died because of the research project.</TE>
<TE>   A group of marine scientists revealed this week that they recently
discovered two dead beaked whales on the shore of Isla San Jose, an
island north of La Paz off the southeast tip of Baja California. The
whales were discovered by scientists vacationing nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists used their radio to call a nearby vessel for help.
That vessel was the 239-foot research boat Maurice Ewing, operated by
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The vessel
was attempting to map a long-developing shift in the Earth's crust
through a $1.6-million National Science Foundation grant.</TE>
<TE>   The research calls for the vessel to fire powerful air guns into
the seabed. The scientists who found the whales blame the operation
for the death of the whales.</TE>
<TE>   The whales are similar to those found dead recently after
controversial military exercises in the Bahamas and the Canary
Islands. A preliminary analysis of the most recent group of dead
whales, which turned up off northwest Africa, indicated that
high-intensity sonar caused ear and brain trauma -- and the
environmental organizations say the Maurice Ewing's operations caused
the same sort of injuries to the whales discovered in Baja.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has attempted to exempt a series of
sea-bound operations, including tests of new Navy sonar systems that
could affect whales, from environmental review. A federal judge
recently rejected those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory is not named as a defendant
in the lawsuit, Cummings said, largely because the laws that apply in
the case can be used only to hold federal agencies accountable.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the research project is operating in violation of
the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires the government
to analyze any program that could have significant ecological impact,
and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</TE>

<LD>The top two Republicans in the state Assembly were charged with
felony misconduct, the latest fallout in a scandal that has shaken
the Legislature's power structure and put another dent in the state's
long-cherished reputation of clean government.</LD>
<LD>   Speaker Scott Jensen and Majority Leader Steve Foti are accused of
using their offices to campaign illegally on state time.</LD>
<LD>   They were charged one day after the top Democrat in the state
Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Chvala, was charged with demanding
campaign contributions for legislative favors.</LD>
<TE>   In all, nine people have been charged in the scandal -- including
five lawmakers.</TE>

<LD>A federal court threw out rules requiring drug companies to test
adult medicines commonly given to children, saying Congress never
intended to give the Food and Drug Administration power to require
the tests.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, from the U.S. District Court here, means drug
companies may continue to sell medicines approved only for adults,
but often prescribed for children, without studies showing they are
safe and effective for kids or to determine appropriate dosages.</LD>
<LD>   Legislation pending in the Senate would codify the rule into law,
and backers said the ruling is likely to bolster their case.</LD>

<HD>Bush Rallies Faithful for Key Midwest Senate Races</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ROCHESTER, Minn.</DL>
<LD>President Bush dived into two of the nation's most hard-fought Senate
races Friday, squeezing two rallies and three airplane flights into
10 hours as he tried to pump up enthusiasm for Republican challengers
in Missouri and Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   With control of the Senate hanging on the thinnest of margins,
Republicans may need to win at least two of three contests in the
Midwest -- those in Missouri, Minnesota and South Dakota -- to emerge
with a majority after the Nov. 5 elections. All three, where
Democrats are incumbents, are rated tossups.</LD>
<LD>   The president is turning the final phase of the midterm election
campaign into a personal crusade, devoting much of the next 2 1/2
weeks to doing everything he can to preserve the slim Republican
majority in the House and regain GOP control of the Senate, where the
Democrats have a one-seat margin.</LD>
<TE>   From state to state, his campaigning is built around a message
intended to soothe fears about a struggling economy and terrorism at
home, while stoking concerns about the threat he says Iraq poses to
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   His focus on Friday was the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut that
he proposed and Congress enacted last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent who Bush wants Missouri voters to unseat,
Sen. Jean Carnahan, voted for the tax cut measure. But this year,
Bush has been pushing to extend the tax cut beyond its expiration in
2010, only to have the Democratic-led Senate thwart that effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure, for the sake of economic vitality, for the
sake of job creation, that you elect a United States senator who
makes sure the tax relief plan is permanent," Bush said in
Springfield, Mo., as he touted Carnahan's Republican opponent, former
Rep. Jim Talent.</TE>
<TE>   He made the same argument in Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Paul
Wellstone is being opposed by Republican Norm Coleman. Wellstone not
only opposes making the tax cut package permanent, he voted against
the 10-year measure.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush offered his tax cut prescription as the best
medicine for an ailing economy, the top Senate Democrat sought to
turn that argument on its head.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), speaking in
Washington, said: "You've got an economy that's in shambles as a
result of decisions made by this administration."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle borrowed a line from another Republican president, Ronald
Reagan, to ask whether Americans were better off today under Bush
than they were when he took office less than two years ago. "I would
say, unequivocally, the answer is no," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally in Springfield, Daschle was the target of GOP ire, as
he has been during much of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Two Missouri Republicans, Sen. Christopher S. Bond and Rep. Roy
Blunt, ticked off measure after measure approved by the House and
blocked in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because Tom Daschle is playing politics rather than serving
the nation," Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with tying Carnahan to Daschle, Republicans have questioned
whether she is an effective legislator, drawing attention to the
unusual circumstances under which she assumed office two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan, a political novice, was appointed to the Senate after
voters elected her husband, former Gov. Mel Carnahan, even though he
had died in an airplane crash shortly before election day. The
Republican incumbent that Mel Carnahan defeated was John Ashcroft,
who then joined the Bush administration as attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   In running against Jean Carnahan, Talent has stressed his four
terms in the House. He gave up his seat two years ago for an
unsuccessful gubernatorial run.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's history as a swing state makes it all the more
important that party organizations stir up enthusiasm for their
candidates. For that, little can top a presidential visit.</TE>
<TE>   "This race is going to be close no matter what. The campaigns are
in the critical yet hard-to-see stage of getting the vote out. The
parties are going to just have to shake the trees," said Jennifer
Duffy, the Senate editor of the Washington-based Cook Political
Report, which tracks campaigns around the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, the Senate race is primarily about Wellstone, the
former college professor who during his two terms has staked out a
position as one of the Senate's most liberal members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about whether voters still like the quirky Paul Wellstone, a
guy they disagree with a lot but respect for his commitment to
principles," Duffy said.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, the former mayor of St. Paul, is stressing his ability to
"work across the aisle" with Democrats, Duffy said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, for his part, stressed the importance of having Coleman in
the Senate to help the administration push through its plan for a
department of homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would shift all or part of 22 federal agencies into
one Cabinet superagency with roughly 170,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Bush unveiled the plan in June and it once seemed likely to win
quick approval in Congress. But it has become snagged in the Senate
over the administration's call for greater latitude in personnel
matters than would be allowed by civil service protections.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big issue in this campaign. There's no question where
Norm Coleman will stand," Bush said.</TE>

<LD>   Computers and phones sit on long tables. Charts listing the names
of volunteers fill every square foot of wall space. The light is dim
and the floor could use some polish.</LD>
<LD>   But the work in this room, and those like it around the state, may
determine the fate of one of this year's boldest political gambles.</LD>
<TE>   Texas Democrats, after years of steady political retreat, are
trying to engineer a comeback in the nation's second-most populous
state behind a racially diverse "dream team" composed of Tony
Sanchez, the state's first Latino nominee for governor; Ron Kirk, who
would become the state's first African American U.S. senator; and
John Sharp, the state's leading white Democrat, who is running for
lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   With this Rainbow Coalition of a ticket, Democrats are aiming to
generate enough minority turnout to overcome the lopsided support
among white voters that has lifted Republicans to political dominance
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   As election day nears, the dream team strategy already can claim
at least partial success: The candidates are running more competitive
races than the party has mustered in recent years. But polls suggest
that Sanchez and Kirk, and possibly even Sharp, will still fall short
unless Democrats can increase minority turnout to unprecedented
levels.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the Victory Room comes in. Even in a campaign season
that has seen Sanchez outspend any Texas candidate ever, mostly to
inundate the state with television ads, the last best hope for the
ticket may be that volunteers dialing phones can prod enough African
Americans and Latinos to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "TV commercials, debates, all that stuff doesn't make a difference
if you don't go vote," said Giovanni Garibay, a Sanchez aide.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats have been pushed toward the dream team strategy by
the two long-term trends shaping Texas politics. The first is the
Democrats' declining support among white Texans. The second is the
rising share in the state population of Latinos, who mostly back
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The first arc has provided Republicans a decisive advantage; the
second could make Democrats competitive again. The question is
whether these two arcs will intersect this fall, or only in years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the South, Texas politics was long dominated by white
Democrats. But over the past generation, the state has moved sharply
toward the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   The last Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state was
Jimmy Carter in 1976. Ann Richards, in 1990, was the last Democrat
elected governor. Riding George W. Bush's more than 2-1 gubernatorial
reelection victory in 1998, Republicans swept all seven other
statewide offices.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three presidential elections, neither Bill Clinton nor
Al Gore won more than 31% of white votes in Texas, and the GOP
carried the state each time. In Senate and governor races from 1994
through 2000, the only Democrat to win even a third of the white vote
was Richards in her 1994 loss to Bush, according to exit polls.</TE>
<TE>   "With no disrespect to the Democrats, they are outnumbered," said
Michael Baselice, a GOP pollster working for Republican Gov. Rick
Perry, whom Sanchez is trying to unseat.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with this, leading Democrats decided this year to bet on the
second major trend remaking the state's political landscape: its
increasing racial and ethnic diversity, particularly the rising
presence of Latinos, who now constitute about one-third of the
population, up from one-fourth in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The driving force in the new strategy was Sharp, who lost the
lieutenant governor's race in 1998 to Perry; Perry then acceded to
the governorship when Bush was elected president.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp helped recruit Sanchez, a centrist Laredo banker who had
never sought office, into the governor's race, and Kirk, a moderate
serving his second term as Dallas mayor, into the Senate contest.
(Kirk resigned as mayor in November.) The theory was that Sanchez
would boost Latino turnout, Kirk would boost African American turnout
and that Sanchez's money would give Democrats the resources to mount
a comprehensive get-out-the-vote effort.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, the experiment has proved a mixed success.
Local Democrats no longer describe the ticket with the "dream team"
label, worrying that the phrase implies either back-room machinations
or racial quotas.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any coordination between the three like people
thought," said retiring Democratic state Rep. Paul Sadler.</TE>
<TE>   Though both centrists, Sanchez and Kirk have each detonated racial
and ethnic land mines. Many Democratic strategists believe Sanchez
alienated some white voters during his gubernatorial primary against
Dan Morales, a conservative Latino.</TE>
<TE>   In that race, Sanchez aggressively defended affirmative action and
insisted on a Spanish-language debate, over Morales' objections.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk sparked a backlash in September when he said minorities would
bear a disproportionate share of the fighting with Iraq, and
suggested that his GOP opponent, Atty. Gen. John Cornyn, might not be
as enthusiastic about such a war "if the first half-million kids to
go came from families who made $1 million."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk quickly apologized, and reiterated his support for Bush on
Iraq, but insiders in both parties say the episode sapped his
momentum and propelled Cornyn to the narrow lead he maintains in most
surveys.</TE>
<TE>   Following Bush's example during his gubernatorial races, Cornyn
and Perry are competing for minority votes. Perry, on the day after
his first debate with Sanchez last week, was in a predominantly black
and Latino middle school just north of Houston, touting a new program
to reduce drop-out rates.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider this my base," Perry said as he walked the halls.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the likelihood is that the Democrats will receive the vast
majority of minority votes. The real question is how many minority
voters turn out. In the last three Texas governor's races, African
Americans -- with 11.5% of the state's total population -- have cast
9% to 12% of the vote. Latinos -- with 32% of the population -- have
cast 11% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats need much more than that to win.</TE>
<TE>   With all of the major candidates -- especially Sanchez --
contributing, Democrats are investing $10 million in a sophisticated
get-out-the-vote machine to stoke that turnout. Technical expertise
probably won't produce the turnout Democrats need. For that,
excitement and passion about the candidates are required, experts
say. And that's only partly in evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even if Sanchez or Kirk or both fall short, Democrats seem
mostly pleased with the experiment. It has provided a jolt of energy
to the party.</TE>
<TE>   "The substantial challenge that has been mounted this time,
however it turns out, has brought all sorts of new people into the
process," said Glenn Smith, Sanchez's campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   "And they are not going away."</TE>

<HD>Court Affirms Monument Status of Sequoia Preserve</HD>
<DH>Environmentalists praise the ruling, but it will cost
Tulare County millions of dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Trick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court Friday ruled against Tulare
County officials, logging industry interests and recreational users
who are seeking to dismantle Central California's Giant Sequoia
National Monument, which President Clinton created by executive order
more than two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling means continued federal protection for the 328,000-acre
expanse, which holds 34 groves of ancient sequoias, and environmental
groups were hopeful that it will end debate about how the land is
used. But plaintiffs said they are considering an appeal to the
Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The court also ruled on a separate lawsuit challenging Clinton's
creation of six other national monuments in the West, saying all will
retain federal protection.</LD>
<TE>   Environmental groups had praise for Friday's action.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision turns back the attack on the American people's right
to have the country's grandeur protected by presidential action,"
said Niel Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, which teamed with Earthjustice and other environmental
groups in the suit. "It's wonderful to see so important a public
right reaffirmed."</TE>
<TE>   But Tulare County Supervisor Steve Worthley said officials there
are "obviously very disappointed in the court's finding."</TE>
<TE>   "This means that, with a stroke of a pen, the president can turn
every piece of federally owned land into a monument," Worthley said.</TE>
<TE>   When Clinton created the seven national monuments in April 2000,
he evoked the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows presidents to
preserve historic and prehistoric sites on federal land without
congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs in the two suits alleged that Clinton failed to make
the case that the sites have a historic or scientific interest. Also,
in the case of the sequoia groves, they said Clinton did not use
enough specificity in his declaration to satisfy the act's
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But the court said there is no requirement in the Antiquities Act
concerning specificity and that entire ecosystems and vistas qualify
as having historic or scientific value.</TE>
<TE>   Tulare County has been battling the designation because it means
millions of dollars in lost revenue. The county benefits from sharing
fees the U.S. Forest Service collects from logging there. Logging is
prohibited in national monuments.</TE>
<TE>   Recreation groups oppose the new monument because the Park
Service, which manages national monuments, limits access to motorized
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that hasn't been to the Supreme Court in a long
time," said William Perry Pendley, president and chief legal officer
of the Mountain States Legal Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence is confident, however, that the issue is settled.</TE>
<TE>   "The appellate court made clear the opponents had a completely
unviable theory," Lawrence said. "Refiling would be, at best, a waste
of resources, time and money."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Giant Sequoia, the other monuments affected by
Friday's rulings are: the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument,
the Sonoran Desert National Monument and the Ironwood Forest National
Monument, all in Arizona; Colorado's Canyons of the Ancients National
Monument; Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument; and the
Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington.</TE>

<HD>No Shortage of White Trucks</HD>
<DH>The type of van linked to the sniper is everywhere. It is
the case's most widely known clue but presents challenges to
authorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Getter and Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Just after Kenneth H. Bridges was gunned down while
pumping gas at a Virginia Exxon station, customers at the Waffle
House next door noticed a white van moving in traffic. At the same
time, at least three white vans were parked in plain sight at a
nearby Denny's.</LD>
<LD>   Just before cabdriver Premkumar A. Walekar was killed at a
Maryland Mobil station eight days earlier, workers saw white vans and
trucks near the spot where police think the sniper stood.</LD>
<LD>   "There's contractors, painters, delivery trucks, people stopping
to get stuff from the store," said Warren Shifflet, who runs the
Mobil repair shop. "We told the police we saw them there all the
time."</LD>
<TE>   In the hunt for a sniper, it is everywhere and nowhere, the
phantom white van the killer possibly uses to escape, the most widely
recounted detail in a case where evidence is scant. Police officials
have released composite drawings of a light-colored Chevrolet Astro
and Ford Econoline as possible getaway vehicles. Motorists now look
with suspicion -- even fear -- at such vehicles, which have many
industrial uses and often are outfitted with the ladder rack police
also say is a possible feature.</TE>
<TE>   On roads around Washington, police sometimes approach the vans
with guns drawn, handcuffing occupants until they are cleared of
suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the white van has captured a new status in public
anxieties, it represents a daunting challenge for police trying to
solve the series of sniper attacks that have killed nine people and
injured two since Oct. 2. Washington and neighboring states are home
to more than 100,000 white vans that are similar to the police
descriptions, according to vehicle registration data and information
from manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the most widely known police clue may amount to
little more than a needle in a haystack of highways: "They're
basically very, very common," said Scott Miller, vice president of
Market Facts Motor Research in Detroit. "For a very long time,
there's been very minimal style changes. It could be a 10-year-old
model and people wouldn't know the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrations in the investigation were underscored Friday, when
Virginia authorities filed charges against a Falls Church, Va., man
accusing him of "knowingly and willfully making a materially false
statement or representation to police," said Julie Hersey, a Fairfax
Police spokeswoman. The misdemeanor charges are punishable by as much
as six months in jail and a possible $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew M. Dowdy, 37, initially told police investigating Monday's
fatal shooting at a Home Depot that he had seen the shooter, his car
and the weapon. But police later determined Dowdy made up the story,
which included an account that the sniper fled the scene in a
cream-colored van.</TE>
<TE>   Adding new questions about the getaway vehicle, authorities late
Friday seized a white box truck that had been found at a Virginia car
rental agency with a shell casing inside. Investigators were working
to determine the caliber of the casing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unknown if the truck is at all related to this case," said
Montgomery County, Md., police spokesman Derek Baliles.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the model used in a crime can be verified, the
information is sometimes of limited use. Motor vehicle records
typically do not identify a vehicle's color, said Dan Seiler, a
private investigator and retired Maryland state trooper.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, widespread publicity about a white van could cause
people to focus on the wrong vehicle at a crime scene, Seiler said.
"One of the first problems you have is when you have a lookout for a
vehicle like this, people start seeing them everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some witness accounts suggest that a white, six-wheel box
truck with writing on the side may be a key to solving the crimes.
Such a truck was reported near shootings Oct. 3, when four people
were gunned down in suburban Montgomery County in a span of 2 1/2
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The sightings of the white box truck at the early scenes in
Maryland could be useful, because the public at that time was not
conditioned to look for such a vehicle, possibly adding credibility
to those accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described a truck with weathered white paint, black or
purple lettering on the side, a roll-up rear door and damage to the
back bumper that could have come from backing into something. Its
engine was loud, suggesting the truck was old. Isuzu was cited as a
possible manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   An American Isuzu spokesman said there are 10,727 registered Isuzu
box trucks in Washington, Maryland and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Schmitt, one of the managers of Fitzgerald Auto Mall on
Nicholson Lane in Rockville, Md., said police took a copy of a
surveillance tape from a camera that was facing the road Oct. 3, the
morning the sniper killed four people before 10 a.m. The dealership
is around the corner from where landscaper James L. "Sonny" Buchanan
was shot while mowing the lawn at another Fitzgerald dealership, and
possibly on the road the sniper took to his next stop.</TE>
<TE>   "They mentioned that they got a truck on the tape," Schmitt said.
"Whether it was any good or not, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, 60,083 Astro vans are registered in Maryland,
Virginia and Washington, according to Polk's national vehicle
population profile. Of these, 85% -- just over 51,000 -- are white,
according to Chevrolet. Ford reports selling 51,300 white Econoline
vans in the region since 1992, with perhaps 10,000 more sold in
different colors.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators appear to be most interested in vehicles registered
in Maryland, which may narrow the search. Polk's data indicates there
are 22,082 Astro vans registered in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, motor vehicle records can be searched by type of
vehicle and even partial license tag data, offering investigators
ways to further whittle their task -- if they have reliable witness
data to feed into the computer.</TE>
<TE>   The getaway vehicle is not the only line of police inquiry. FBI
agents have traveled to Belgium in recent days to interview an
imprisoned Al Qaeda suspect about sniper training in Osama bin
Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, according to sources
familiar with the case.</TE>
<TE>   The agents interviewed Nizar Trabelsi, a Tunisian whom Belgian
authorities accuse of planning to act as a suicide bomber in a plot
to attack the U.S. Embassy in Paris that was broken up shortly after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Trabelsi told the U.S. investigators that while he was in the
Afghan camps, Al Qaeda trained recruits to carry out urban sniper
attacks in teams in the U.S., according to a source familiar with the
case.</TE>
<TE>   However, federal law enforcement officials Friday stressed that
they continue to investigate the shootings as the work of some
disgruntled local with an unknown grudge -- and specifically discount
the notion that they are pursuing terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation is still firmly rooted in our Violent Crimes
Unit, and is being investigated as a violent crime and not an act of
terrorism," an FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also are revisiting crime scenes and poring over the
landscape at some distance from the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   At the most recent crime scene in Falls Church, investigators this
week extended their search to more than 100 yards away from the Home
Depot parking structure where FBI analyst Linda Franklin was slain
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts amount to "good police work," Montgomery County
Police Chief Charles A. Moose told reporters Friday. "Just go back,
rethink, re-look. Nothing more complex than that."</TE>

<LD>The peak of the volcano that dominates the Caribbean island of
Montserrat is rising every day as burning rock and ash pile up,
making an eruption almost inevitable, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "If the dome grows as it is, something has to give one way or
another," said geologist Peter Dunkley, director of the Montserrat
Volcano Observatory. "It will be a messy situation when it happens."</LD>
<LD>   After nearly four centuries of dormancy, the Soufriere Hills
volcano roared back to life in 1995, killing 19 people and burying
the south of the British territory, including the capital Plymouth.</LD>
<TE>   In the last few years, the volcano has calmed, but the dome
continues to grow and collapse.</TE>

<HD>Large Black Hole Found at Center of the Galaxy</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have discovered at the center of our galaxy a huge black
hole, a mysterious celestial object that sucks in everything around
it, including light. By observing the orbit of a star around the
invisible gravitational field, an international team of scientists
reported in the Oct. 10 Nature that it has eliminated other
possibilities that might explain the phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a great step forward," said astronomer Reinhard Genzel, of
the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics near Munich,
Germany, who led the team. "We have been able to exclude some still
possible alternative configurations.... There is nothing left that
one would consider realistic and possible, other than a black hole."</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers have been gathering information about black holes,
which are detected by measuring their effect on nearby stars or the
activity around their edges, for more than 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   There has been growing evidence of a massive black hole, more than
a million times the mass of the sun, in the center of our galaxy and
others, but Genzel and his team believe their research is the best
proof so far. Black holes, like the one in the center of the Milky
Way, are thought to be the remains of dead quasars.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redheads may have another trait that makes them stand out --
sensitivity to pain, specialists report. People with natural red hair
need about 20% more anesthesia than people with other hair colors,
Dr. Edwin Liem of the University of Louisville in Kentucky told a
meeting of anesthesiologists. The unexpected finding not only
suggests that redheads are more sensitive to pain, but offers
insights into how anesthesia works in people.</LD>
<LD>   "Red hair is the first visible human trait, or phenotype, that is
linked to anesthetic requirement," Liem said. "In a nutshell,
redheads are likely to experience more pain from a given stimulus and
therefore require more anesthesia to alleviate that pain."</LD>

<KH>THE WORLD SERIES / A FAN'S DIARY</KH>
<HD>Angels' Backers Know Their Rites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in an occasional report during the World Series.</SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me put this on the record: My beloved Angels have no chance of
winning this World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants are simply the better team.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds is unstoppable.</LD>
<TE>   And that Kent guy is better than any hitter we have.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention that Giant pitchers Scott Eyre and Jay Witasick
represent the most formidable bullpen combination in the history of
baseball?</TE>
<TE>   As the Series got underway this weekend, I whispered all these
things to myself. I meant them. But do I really believe them?</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the culture of half-beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Superstitions are throwing spilled salt over your shoulder,
avoiding the 13th floor, believing you're special because you were
born on Sunday, or seeing a ring around the moon and expecting rain.</TE>
<TE>   Half-beliefs are smaller and come in bunches. They are the
practiced tics, the hard-won habits, the semi-solemn rituals of
people who feel a loss of control, of the damned who live in fear.</TE>
<TE>   Half-beliefs are held strongest by the powerless and the
dispossessed.</TE>
<TE>   In matters of baseball, there has been a name for such people:
Angel fans.</TE>
<TE>   Before she leaves her Long Beach home for each postseason game,
Larryette Dotson, 59, makes sure her Uncle Harry, the 82-year-old
retiree she takes care of, is wearing his lucky plaid shirt and the
ring that his mother gave him in 1942 before he joined the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Dotson herself favors the same outfit for each game, even though
it means doing laundry daily: a red T-shirt under an Angel jersey
(given to her for signing up for delivery of Arrowhead water), black
stretch pants, white tennis shoes from K-Mart and a ruby ring she
bought for $5 at the Precious Life Shelter thrift store in Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   She arranges eight Rally Monkeys around her seats in a prearranged
order. Hanging around her neck on a shoelace are pictures of "my
Angels" -- her late daughter and her godfather Peppy, who ran the San
Pedro restaurant where she used to waitress.</TE>
<TE>   "I also have a little crown with two balls from a Jack-in-the-Box
giveaway that I glue-gunned to it," she said. "I call myself the
Angel princess. Every time I forget to bring the crown, the Angels
lose. So the ushers always remind me about it."</TE>
<TE>   Transcendentalist or Taoist, Anglican or agnostic, we Angel fans
know from long experience there are baseball gods, they can be
angered, and they can stay so upset it takes 41 years to make your
first World Series. Get too confident, and the gods will let you lose
an 11-game division lead, as in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Half-beliefs provide humble nods to those gods. We're not
scientifically certain of the power of such rituals, but we don't
wish to risk doing without them. Angel fans see the red uniforms and
the Rally Monkey not as marketing tools, but as cosmic currency that
may have bought us good will with the national pastime's deities this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "If only we'd had the rally monkey in '86," I heard one fan
grumble during the American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular half-beliefs is the fear of sounding too
optimistic, of anticipating advantage, and -- most dangerous of all
-- contemplating the sweet taste of victory before the final out has
been recorded. Better to talk up the opponent and bad-mouth the
Angels' chances.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to be arrogant -- that's a big mistake," said
Dotson, who sits in a handicapped seat in Section 209 every game with
Uncle Harry, who is really her second cousin. "With the way things
are going, it's very important to the team's success that we follow
the same rituals at every game."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find an Angel fan without a few half-beliefs. Stanley
Spero, in 1961 the sales manager of Gene Autry's KMPC radio station,
suspects the team plays better when he keeps the sound off on his TV,
his wife says.</TE>
<TE>   (Spero laughs and denies this, though not very forcefully).</TE>
<TE>   The people on the field do this too. Angel hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher wears some sort of charm around his neck that he appears to
turn around when the team needs a big hit.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia always seems to stand in the same place in
the dugout. There has been considerable discussion among the Angel
faithful of the change in how centerfielder Darin Erstad wears his
pants, a switch that appears to have coincided with a run of good
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   After a long and tortuously exciting season, some of us have
devised our own regimen of behaviors, tailored to the hitter and
situation. Garret Anderson pulls the ball with more authority when I
keep my arms crossed. Tim Salmon responds better when the crowd
stands and cheers, so be sure to join in.</TE>
<TE>   When we're in the field, I've found that holding my hands loose in
front of me, flexing them in the manner of a basketball dribble,
helps our pitchers retire the side faster.</TE>
<TE>   I had my arm around my wife's shoulder for all three Adam Kennedy
home runs last Sunday. So I'll keep it there for as long as she'll
let me.</TE>
<TE>   If such practices seem just a bit, well, fanatical, you'd be
right. Fandom is an essential outlet for our most irrational,
reactionary beliefs. Just think what a couple of contending American
League franchises in Tehran and Riyadh might do to bolster moderates
in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Half-beliefs are stronger than reason, especially at times of
stress and excitement. And that's a good thing. The alternative is to
take at face value the biologists who tell you about the advantages
of Bonds' muscle mass, the meteorologists who say the baseball moves
according to temperature and wind current, the neurologists who claim
calm under pressure is mere brain chemistry, the TV analysts who say
the Angels' success is a function of Troy Glaus' swing and Frankie
Rodriguez's slider.</TE>
<TE>   Without half-beliefs, we fans would be useless.</TE>
<TE>   It's healthier to think that our thoughts and words and funny hats
matter, that our conduct influences the game's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   That if we part our hair the right way and contort our bodies with
all the energy we have, the Angels will be world champions.</TE>
<TE>   Knock on wood.</TE>

<HD>Bratton to Tally His Forces</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When William J. Bratton takes the helm at the Los Angeles Police
Department, his first order of business will be some old-fashioned
police work: conducting a dragnet.</LD>
<LD>   The incoming chief plans a head count of all 8,944 sworn officers.</LD>
<LD>   To do it, he said, he will ask the same questions he has been
asking since his days as a Boston police sergeant and that he asked
later as head of the departments in Boston and New York: "What are
you doing? Where are you hiding? What are you supposed to be doing?"</LD>
<TE>   The blunt-talking Bostonian faces significant labor obstacles --
both natural and man-made -- as he attempts to remake the department
and get more officers on the streets, say crime experts, police
officials and union leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bratton's challenges: fighting a tight budget in
economically lean times; maneuvering around the limits posed by the
department's three-day, 12-hour work schedule; and gaining the
respect of rank-and-file officers and the Police Protective League,
which represents most of the LAPD's 9,000 officers.</TE>
<TE>   The drumbeat of criticism by the league played a key role in the
ouster of former Chief Bernard C. Parks after one five-year term. It
was the union that demanded and received -- with the blessing of
Mayor James K. Hahn -- the three-day work week.</TE>
<TE>   Once he has finished the head count, Bratton said, he will
re-engineer the department, replacing officers in administrative jobs
with civilians and returning sworn officers to the streets,
eliminating many specialized units and decentralizing the LAPD by
turning divisions into semi-autonomous mini-police departments.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has promised, not only more officers, but also more
efficient, cost-effective policing.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 9,000 that are so inappropriately assigned at this
moment that there's phenomenal room for increased productivity,
activity and creativity by a reorganization of the department,"
Bratton said of the current staffing situation. "The issue here is
that, with 9,000, I can do a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   That approach has been endorsed by Police Commission President
Rick Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go to the low-hanging fruit, where you have sworn
officers doing ministerial tasks," said Caruso, citing what he said
is an excess of sworn officers in divisions such as internal affairs,
audit and consent decree compliance. "The priority has to be, if you
have a sworn officer, that officer has to be on the street. You also
need to get more sergeants in the field for a supervisory role."</TE>
<TE>   About 5,722 officers are assigned to patrol or uniformed
functions, with an additional 1,630 in investigative jobs and 1,202
doing administrative duties. Backing them up are 3,181 civilian
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of getting more out of a police force that may not
grow is similar to the one Bratton faced during his tenure as head of
the New York City Transit Police.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of how Bratton handled that challenge, Al O'Leary, a
spokesman for New York's police union and an ex-transit official
said: "When Bill Bratton arrived, the transit police had a serious
morale problem."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't viewed as desirable to be a transit officer." O'Leary
said. "The uniforms were tatty. Officers were bored to death.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill convinced them that the fare evader was the same guy with
the felony warrant. He gave officers 9-millimeters instead of .38s,
and handed them commando sweaters. Soon the department was perceived
as the Marines of New York."</TE>
<TE>   Paralleling that situation, morale within the LAPD hit, perhaps,
its all-time low under Parks, with the Rampart scandal in 1999. As
crime has climbed in the last few years, with incidents of serious
crime rising 12%, arrests have declined. Police response time
citywide has climbed from 7.5 minutes in 1998 to 9.8 minutes this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton will need officers to make more arrests. His philosophy,
tried and tested in New York, is built around enforcing
"quality-of-life" laws such as those against loitering, graffiti and
prostitution. Eliminating small-time offenses, he argues, reduces the
likelihood of more serious crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The City Charter gives Bratton virtually unfettered power to shift
officers to the streets. But for the first time as a chief, he will
have to work with a three-day, 12-hour-per-shift work schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "You live with what you have, and try to modify it when you can,"
Bratton said. "Three-12 actually has more pluses than minuses."</TE>
<TE>   The three-12 system does not require more officers, but Bratton
will find it has other consequences, according to Pasadena Police
Chief Bernard K. Melekian, who took over a department using the
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Officers are more likely to make errors at the end of a long
shift, and those who live far away can become disengaged from the
community they are paid to police, Melekian said.</TE>
<TE>   But Melekian said three-12 has provided a strong boost for morale.
Once it is adopted, he warned, there is no turning back. Departments
without the schedule are losing officers to those that have it.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton will also try to squeeze out more resources by eliminating
some specialized units.</TE>
<TE>   "He recognizes that, in a department with resources stretched so
thin, he needs more generalists and not someone sitting somewhere
waiting for something to come down their alley," said David Dotson, a
former assistant chief.</TE>
<TE>   Dotson said Bratton may be able to find 300 to 500 officers to
return to the beat, with fewer specialists and more civilians. But
Dotson said many of those on desk duties are there because of
physical and, in some cases, mental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Bratton's arrival, Parks had allowed vacancies in the
specialized units to climb to avoid losses in patrol. At its peak in
June 1998, the LAPD had 9,853 officers; as that number dropped,
reductions extended to units such as narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   As of the end of last year, there were about 350 vacancies in
specialized departments. For instance, the LAPD's Juvenile Division
has 25 vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's track record with police unions in New York and Boston
involved some early tussles, then good relationships. So successful
was Bratton in New York that when he applied for the LAPD job, the
Big Apple's police union president was among his references. In
Boston, he fought off an early legal challenge by the union to his
appointment as chief; in New York, he outmaneuvered the union when it
tried to limit his flexibility by changing state law.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very charismatic, forceful leader, and he wants to make
changes and when that occurs, there are struggles," said Daniel
Fagan, Boston Police Patrolmen's Assn. treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, who will step down as Los Angeles police union
president at the end of the year, said change will not come easily.
But she predicted that Bratton will succeed because he relates well
to ordinary beat officers and knows what they need.</TE>
<TE>   "Parks did not like and respect police officers, and he didn't
maintain a relationship with his employees," Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you contrast that with Bratton, he does like and respect
police officers, and I believe he will establish and maintain those
close relations."</TE>
<TE>   Grasso predicted that Bratton would change the complaint and
disciplinary system, which she said has damaged morale by allowing
frivolous claims on par with more serious corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "You need an efficient, strong internal affairs group," Grasso
said. "Parks turned a huge inefficient group [into] a bigger
inefficient group."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's commitment to patrol goes back to his Boston roots,
where, as a sergeant, he broke with department tradition and hit the
streets. He plans to use computer modeling of crime statistics -- the
CompStat system, pioneered in New York and now used nationwide -- to
deploy officers.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said, in New York, too many officers worked day shifts,
though many crimes occurred at night. He said he suspects it may be
the same in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting bodies can have limited effectiveness, said Joseph D.
McNamara, former San Jose police chief, who also served with the New
York Police Department and called Bratton a "savvy leader."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea to get cops out [on the street]," McNamara
said. "But sometimes you cannot do it because they have real
disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "And when they have been inside for 10 years, you can't just pluck
them back into a car," he added. "They need training, and that costs
money."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever quick action Bratton takes, his success will ultimately
depend on finding more police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Few departments have had a tougher time recruiting than the LAPD,
which is still is losing more officers than it hires, a trend Hahn
thinks Bratton can reverse.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent fiscal year, 449 officers left the department
and 356 were hired. Overall, the department is short of its budgeted
number of officers by 1,100.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso said she expects Bratton to stem that exodus and meet his
goal of an increase of 16% to 20% in arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the result, McNamara thinks there is a lot to be said for
Bratton's experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who can work for Rudy Giuliani," he said, "can survive
anything."</TE>

<HD>3 Charged in Beating Death of Boy, 17, Who Lived as a Girl</HD>
<DH>The suspects allegedly attacked him after they learned he
was male. His body was found in a shallow grave near a campground.</DH>

<DL>NEWARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Three Bay Area men were charged Friday with murdering a 17-year-old
boy who dressed and lived as a girl after one of the accused led
authorities to the victim's body, buried in a remote area of the
Sierra foothills.</LD>
<LD>   The Alameda County coroner's office identified the dead teenager
as Newark resident Eddie Araujo and said an examination showed he had
been severely beaten. Araujo's body, dressed in women's clothing, was
unearthed Wednesday near an El Dorado National Forest campground 30
miles east of Placerville.</LD>
<LD>   Araujo, a former student at Crossroads High School in Newark, was
last seen at a party on Oct. 3, police said, where he was attacked
after the suspects discovered he was male.</LD>
<TE>   Police reports detail interviews with several people who said they
had heard the defendants had sex with Araujo and then discovered he
was not a girl.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's mother reported him missing on Oct. 3, telling police she
was worried he might have been harmed because he was dressed in
women's clothes, police reports said. She told police that Araujo
left for the party dressed in a jeans miniskirt and black shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Newark police said Araujo, who used the first names "Gwen" and
"Lida," had been dressing as a woman for some time.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday night, Araujo's mother, Sylvia Guerrero
said, "If I can bury him, I'll bury him in a dress with makeup and
his nails done, and the tombstone will say, 'Gwen.' He deserves it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors filed murder charges Friday against Michael Magidson,
22, of Fremont and Jaron Chase Nabors, 19, and Jose Merel, 24, both
of Newark. Police said Nabors led them to the grave near the Silver
Fork campground in El Dorado County. The suspects entered no pleas
and were held without bail. Merel's brother, Paul Merel Jr., 25, was
released.</TE>
<TE>   A police affidavit said Paul Merel's girlfriend, Nicole Brown,
discovered Araujo was male when she took him to a bathroom to
determine his gender. After she told the others, the defendants
allegedly beat him into semiconsciousness and dragged him into a
garage, where they tightened a rope around his neck until he appeared
dead, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants drove Araujo to the campsite in the rugged back
country of the High Sierra, where they buried him, according to the
affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's aunt, Imelda Guerrero, 30, called police on Oct. 9 after
hearing a rumor of the slaying of a male dressed as a woman at a
local party, police reports said. Police then began interviewing
people who had heard about the confrontation at the party, which was
held at the Merels' house.</TE>
<TE>   One person who attended the party took police to the house.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors' attorney, Robert J. Beles, said his client was "in the
wrong place at the wrong time," but did not "participate in any
homicide activity at all."</TE>
<TE>   "There are no indications of any bias or attitudes of any
homophobic nature at all in Jaron," he said. "When all the evidence
is in, it will show he is not guilty of this. He told me he did not
participate in any aggressive activity toward the victim, or in
beating the victim."</TE>
<TE>   Beles denied police allegations that Nabors had confessed
Wednesday to the crime. He would not comment, however, on whether
Nabors led authorities to the body.</TE>
<TE>   Nichole Giacoletto, 19, an acquaintance of Nabors in junior high
school, said: "I just can't believe what's happened. It's very sad.
Very sick."</TE>
<TE>   "Jaron was popular -- all the girls liked him," she said. "He hung
around with the cool kids. I never saw him in a fight. So I'm
shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area community groups Friday compared the killing to the 1998
slaying of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. A local
high school production of a play based on Shepard's killing, "The
Laramie Project," is set for production next month.</TE>
<TE>   "This case shows that there is still so much work to do about
people's fear and hatred," said Tina D'Elia, hate-crimes specialist
with the San Francisco-based Community United Against Violence. "It
shows that for anyone who chooses to go outside the mainstream binary
culture, the fear of death is so real."</TE>
<TE>   Araujo had apparently dropped out of school over the summer. He
had been in Newark's public school system since kindergarten and had
shifted to alternative study programs when he was in middle school,
first attending the Bridgepoint School and switching to Crossroads
for his first three years of high school, said Newark Unified School
District Supt. Ken Sherer.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's classes required students to meet with a teacher once a
week. But he attended only about half his weekly meetings over the
years, Sherer said, and hadn't shown up since the school year began
in late August. Truancy officers do not usually try to find students
who are 17 or 18 because they are old enough to quit school. His last
teacher retired this summer and has moved out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Araujo at Newark Memorial High School collected $207
Friday to assist with burial expenses. "We are going to keep
collecting and get more people involved," said Jessica Bernal, 16.
"We are going to make one big check and give it to his mother. As
friends of Eddie, we just want to help."</TE>
<TE>   "We spend a lot of time teaching students they should respect
another person's lifestyle," Sherer said. "It's ironic that this
happened to occur at the same time we're putting on this ["Laramie
Project"] play. It does kind of speak to the point that no matter how
hard we try within society to eliminate prejudices, we still have a
lot of it."</TE>
<TE>   Newark Memorial drama teacher Barbara Williams said the school
still plans to stage "The Laramie Project" next month.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has taught in the district for 38 years and is
directing the school's production, said she picked the production
because she thought the community needed a lesson in tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched over the years so many of our students, especially
those who are gay, being ridiculed and abused, and being afraid,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the small East Bay community, consisting of
working-class and immigrant neighborhoods between San Jose and
Oakland, embraced the idea for the show, which is sold out for its
Nov. 8 opening night.</TE>
<TE>   Now, because of the Araujo killing, Williams said, "we're living
the horrible reality of our play."</TE>
<TE>   The play, she said, will be dedicated to Araujo and all other
victims of hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's friend Daisy Bernal said Araujo would get upset if she
called him Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   "She would be like, 'Shut up. Don't call me that,' " Bernal said.
"After I called her that, she just said, 'I'm a girl, I'm just a girl
trapped in a guy's body. God made me like that.' "</TE>

<HD>State Poet Overstated His Case</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quincy T. Troupe, California's first formally selected poet laureate,
resigned Friday after acknowledging he had taken a bit of poetic
license on his professional resume.</LD>
<LD>   Troupe, 62, who teaches at UC San Diego and is widely known for
his dramatic readings, attended Grambling University, but did not --
as his curriculum vitae said -- earn a degree there.</LD>
<LD>   Troupe's resignation was a blush-inducer for Gov. Gray Davis, who
picked him from among three formidable finalists in June. Though
Troupe was sworn in, the laureate position requires state Senate
confirmation. Staffers for the Senate Rules Committee turned up the
discrepancy, the governor's office said.</LD>
<TE>   "I deeply regret my ill-advised decision to include inaccurate
information on my curriculum vitae," Troupe said in a statement. "It
was never my intent to disappoint any of all the wonderful people who
have been enormously supportive of me and who have expressed such
pride in my appointment."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe's abrupt exit dealt another blow to those who have long
worked to give the poet-laureate post literary legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Though California has had a poet laureate since 1915, their
selection had been informal and politically driven until legislation
passed last year formalized the post and the rules for choosing who
fills it.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the California Arts Council got the go-ahead to anoint
a "real" state poet, the agency had trouble drumming up interest in
the position.</TE>
<TE>   Just 10 nominations trickled in before the original deadline was
extended.</TE>
<TE>   A jolt of late publicity boosted the applicant pool to more than
50. Last March, a five-member panel of poetry experts narrowed the
field to three: Troupe; Diane di Prima, a Beat Generation standout;
and Francisco Alarcon, one of the nation's most prominent Chicano
poets.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear who will replace Troupe.</TE>
<TE>   Several cases of resume inflation have roiled the worlds of
academia and sports in the past year. The most high-profile example
was probably George O'Leary, who was named head coach at Notre Dame,
then resigned weeks later after portions of his academic and athletic
bio proved false. Despite this latest resume flap, no one has
questioned Troupe's literary chops. He has published 13 books,
including six volumes of poetry, and collaborated with jazz great
Miles Davis on his best-selling autobiography. He has received two
American Book Awards, a Peabody Award and twice won the heavyweight
title at the Taos Poetry Circus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's enormously popular with his students," said Steve Maviglio,
the governor's spokesman. "It's really sad."</TE>

<HD>Calls for Assistance Hung Up in Overburdened 911 System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Last in a series of stories on Los Angeles city services.</SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can hear the weary desperation in the man's voice: "Every day I
call the police, and every day the police don't come."</LD>
<LD>   He is complaining -- again -- to a 911 operator about the dirt
bike riders who are squealing their tires up and down the hill behind
his South Los Angeles apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "I know there are people getting burglarized and robbed, but I
have my rights too," the man tells the operator, who is patiently
taking a report. "It disturbs my quality of life."</LD>
<TE>   It's a familiar refrain for the operators who answer the
nonemergency phone lines in the Los Angeles Police Department's 911
dispatch center across the street from Parker Center downtown.
Working in a stuffy office four floors below ground, the operators
receive thousands of calls a day.</TE>
<TE>   Some callers receive police assistance. Others never do.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons vary. Some people simply call the wrong number: The
tree branch that snaps off into the street is not an LAPD problem but
a street services one. Others call about problems that the police are
too busy to address immediately: An officer cannot make it to the
scene of a hit-and-run car crash in which no one has been hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The calls that get no response, however, lead to criticism of the
LAPD, and have helped drive the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession movements.</TE>
<TE>   Some view the LAPD as unresponsive, out of touch with the
communities it serves. It is at least 1,000 officers short, with
recruitment only recently starting to improve. As a result, response
times are lengthy, while the crime rate is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has been rocked by the Rampart corruption scandal and the
department now operates under a federal consent decree, negotiated to
ensure changes are made.</TE>
<TE>   Public safety is a touchstone for leaders of the secession
efforts. Voters will decide Nov. 5 whether to create separate cities
for Hollywood and the Valley, and organizers of the secession
campaigns say public safety is the main reason people support them.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't feel there's enough of a presence of law
enforcement," said Richard Katz, a former state assemblyman and a
Valley secession leader. "They don't see enough black-and-white
patrol cars, they don't see enough senior lead officers."</TE>
<TE>   If secession is approved for the Valley, organizers say, Los
Angeles still would provide police services for at least the first 18
months after the vote. The new city would contract with the LAPD
until a new mayor and city council decided how to handle public
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Their options would be to create a Valley police department,
continue to contract with the LAPD or some combination of the two.
Some also have suggested that a new city could contract with the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. A Hollywood city would likely
contract with the LAPD for law enforcement services.</TE>
<TE>   Some secession backers believe the Valley would be best off with
its own police force. And they believe they would not have the same
problems recruiting officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that, if the council and the mayor decided to
establish a police department within the San Fernando Valley, that
would be a very attractive department for police officers," said
Keith Richman, a candidate for mayor in a Valley city. "Salaries and
benefits would be competitive. It would be a good place to work."</TE>
<TE>   Reducing the LAPD's lengthy response times to emergencies would be
a main priority for the new cities, secession leaders say. The
department's citywide average is a 10-minute response. For calls
deemed nonemergencies, waits can be much, much longer.</TE>
<TE>   At one point at the 911 center recently, 38 people were awaiting
officers for a variety of reasons. One caller had been waiting 59
minutes after reporting a trespasser. Another was still waiting 36
minutes after calling about a family dispute. A third, who had
reported a fight between neighbors, was waiting 39 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The response time problem mostly comes down to a combination of
the city's size and the relative thinness of the LAPD's ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The department says the large area it covers -- coupled with the
volume of emergency and nonemergency calls -- are impediments to
quicker service.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of smaller cities point to Burbank, Glendale and
Pasadena as examples of police departments that can handle emergency
and nonemergency calls much faster.</TE>
<TE>   In Burbank, for example, police respond to emergencies in about
three minutes; in Glendale, response time is about five minutes; and
in Pasadena, it's four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But those cities are equivalent in some cases to just one LAPD
division, and a Valley city, would be the sixth-largest in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill police station in the northeast Valley, for example,
serves 262,000 people and covers more than 61 square miles. Its
response time is 10.4 minutes, according to the most recent LAPD
reports. Pasadena, by contrast, has about 141,000 people. Foothill
has about 350 officers and Pasadena has 247.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is roughly the
same size as the LAPD, has a response time of less than five minutes.
New York, Houston and Philadelphia all have shorter response times as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders say they would set different public safety
priorities, requiring more community policing aimed at tackling
smaller, neighborhood problems before they become larger ones.</TE>
<TE>   It is a theory strongly endorsed by the LAPD's new chief, William
J. Bratton. He is a former New York City police commissioner who
oversaw that city's police department during years of dramatic
decline in crime. He says that crime and response times in Los
Angeles can be reduced on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   But secessionists aren't so sure. They point to the numbers: in
New York City, Bratton had 38,000 police officers, here he has 9,000.
In New York, he had 209 residents per officer, here there are 409.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials, who have long grappled with how to ease the
burden on the 911 system, have created a new telephone line for
nonemergency calls. When it is operational, the 311 service will
shift the volume of calls to a new group of operators, but it
probably won't do much to reduce LAPD response times.</TE>
<TE>   The city has attempted this before. In June 1999, the LAPD
introduced a new, toll free nonemergency number, (877) ASK-LAPD, in
an attempt to free some 911 lines. But that line was barely promoted,
and relatively few people actually know to use it. Police stations
also have seven-digit nonemergency phone numbers but, again, those
are not used as much as LAPD officials would like.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the calls come flooding into the 911 center: There's a
signal light out on Foothill Boulevard. What's the phone number for
the Hollenbeck station? I need a copy of an accident report. One 911
operator described her job as "essentially 411."</TE>
<TE>   In November, however, city officials plan to unveil the 311
service. It is a multimillion-dollar endeavor, years in the making,
that will be a kind of one-call-to-City Hall service. Operators will
transfer calls to city departments and eventually take reports
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   There's one catch. As Deputy Mayor Doane Liu put it: "This doesn't
make the response any quicker; this makes the call to the right
department quicker."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if 311 works, callers won't get switched around. A
PricewaterhouseCoopers study commissioned by the city found that half
of the nonemergency calls are transferred at least twice before the
callers receive answers or submit requests.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 311 system, calls for street services, the Department of
Water and Power and tree trimming, among many others, will be handled
by non-911 operators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another one of the ways that Mayor [James K.] Hahn wants
to improve city services, whether you live in the Valley or
South-Central or the Harbor," Liu said.</TE>
<TE>   And even the secession supporters are happy about that.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly can help," Katz said. "All you hear are stories of
how difficult it is to get 911."</TE>
<TE>   It is especially difficult for someone calling from a cellular
phone. Most of those calls are routed directly to the California
Highway Patrol. The 311 system also won't be accessible from cell
phones any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the calls keep flooding the 911 lines. The other day,
one operator took 24 calls in an hour.</TE>
<TE>   One man actually apologized for calling. "I call all the time," he
said. "I'm not sure where I'm supposed to call. There's a woman
selling things from a grocery cart on my street every afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," he said finally, "is there some place I can call for these
kinds of things? I know it's not you ... because you never come."</TE>

<LD>It's a novel defensive alignment, one the Angels still aren't sure
whether they'll deploy tonight. But when the Angels do pitch to Barry
Bonds, they might do so with four players in the outfield and three
in the infield.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds' hitting charts, freely available online, reveal several
tendencies. He hits many more fly balls than he does ground balls. He
sprays fly balls all around the outfield. But when he does hit a
ground ball, he very rarely hits it to the left side.</LD>
<LD>   In the division series against the New York Yankees, the Angels
employed a radical shift against Jason Giambi, moving third baseman
Troy Glaus to shortstop and playing the other three infielders on the
right side. At the least, they plan to use a similar shift against
Bonds.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels would leave the left side vacant and add a rover --
probably second baseman Adam Kennedy -- to the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels would not use it in all circumstances, because they
would hesitate to leave third base uncovered with runners on base.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia would not say Friday how the Angels would
set up the defense against Bonds, or in what situations they might
pitch to him. But Scioscia did acknowledge that Bonds presents such a
challenge that teams must think beyond conventional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see some things that maybe in other eras might
seem extremely unconventional or way out there," Scioscia said, "but
they make a lot of sense with the way Barry is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, who starts tonight for the Angels, said he felt
fine Friday. He missed workouts Thursday because of mild flu.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn said he would embrace the challenge of pitching to Bonds
but would not apologize if the Angels decide to pitch around him.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win the World Series and guys are calling me a wimp because
I pitched around Barry Bonds," Washburn said, "who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After pitching six times in 12 days during the first two rounds of
the playoffs, closer Troy Percival said he needed the extended break
before the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "My arm finally feels good again," he said. "It took four days to
get there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Orlando Palmeiro's wife, Tami, gave birth to the
couple's first child Friday. The baby girl, named Faith, and mother
are fine, awaiting Palmeiro's return home to Florida after the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie John Lackey, who pitched seven shutout innings in the
league championship series, could start Game 7 of the World Series.
Ramon Ortiz is scheduled to start Game 3 and Lackey Game 4, but
Scioscia said Lackey could get the call for a decisive Game 7 on
three days' rest if he pitches as well as he did in the last round of
the playoffs. Lackey, who limited the Twins to three hits in that
Game 4 victory, will be available in relief tonight and also in a
possible Game 7, if he does not start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels tried to get Nolan Ryan to throw out the ceremonial
first pitch tonight, but the former flame-thrower couldn't make it.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to find two 8-7 pitchers to take Ryan's place, the Angels
settled for former owner Jackie Autry, who will throw out the first
pitch with former Angel pitcher Chuck Finley catching.</TE>
<TE>   Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden, legendary UCLA basketball coach who turned 92 Monday
and is a lifelong lover of baseball, will throw out the first ball of
Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   He said Friday that he was thrilled when he was notified he had
been selected, and added, "I don't think I'll throw a spitball."</TE>

<KH>ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS/ THE WORLD SERIES</KH>
<HD>California Angles</HD>
<DH>In the first matchup of wild cards, a couple of hot playoff
teams prove that anything is possible in baseball when you get a
second chance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a baseball purist, this is a nightmare come true. No scenario
could be more horrifying, unless the Chicago Cubs knock down Wrigley
Field and replace it with a domed stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Six divisions? Too many, to the grumpy traditionalist. And, when
the World Series starts tonight at Edison Field, none of the six
division champions will be there.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels will represent the American League. The San Francisco
Giants will represent the National League. For the first time, two
wild-card teams--that is, two second-place teams--will play in the
World Series.</LD>
<TE>   Are these the two best teams in the major leagues, or simply the
two hottest teams? Commissioner Bud Selig, who counts the adoption of
the wild-card playoff format as one of the highlights of his tenure,
sounds a wee bit offended at the question.</TE>
<TE>   "They've had extraordinary years," Selig said. "They went through
two levels of playoffs. And they've won.</TE>
<TE>   "So apparently they are the best teams in their leagues."</TE>
<TE>   The concept of a second chance for teams that do not finish in
first place is so popular, Selig said, that owners might well expand
the playoffs to include more than one wild-card team in each league.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we'll consider in future years," he said. "And
it's still harder to get into the playoffs in baseball than in any
other sport."</TE>
<TE>   Eight teams out of 30 make the baseball playoffs, compared to 12
of 30 in the NFL, 16 of 30 in the NHL and 16 of 29 in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the year the Kings advanced to the Stanley Cup finals,
they finished third in their division, four games over .500. The
Lakers could finish third in their division this season, and
Shaquille O'Neal could sit out a month to rehabilitate his aching toe
and, frankly, who cares so long as O'Neal is ready come playoff time?</TE>
<TE>   So is baseball headed down that slippery slope that cheapens the
regular season and turns the playoffs into a hottest-team-takes-all
tournament? Should we be calling the playoffs October Madness?</TE>
<TE>   No and no, say this year's World Series participants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the integrity of 162 games," said Larry Baer, the Giants'
executive vice president. "You've got to reward 162-game performance.
The wild card, I think, does that."</TE>
<TE>   The wild card was invented after a 1993 season in which the Giants
won 103 games, second-most in the majors. They finished one game
behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one wild-card playoff invitation available in each
league. The Angels won 99 games this year, more than the Minnesota
Twins, champions of the AL Central. The Giants won 95.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had a wild card with 80 wins, it would be one thing,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "These are two great teams, and you
haven't seen anything but great baseball from these two teams."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels dismissed the New York Yankees from the playoffs by
winning three out of four games and the Twins by winning four out of
five. The Giants took out the Braves and St. Louis Cardinals in five
games apiece. In this sport, a team cannot advance to the next round
with a one-game upset.</TE>
<TE>   "In baseball, you can't be hot that long," Angel outfielder Garret
Anderson said. "You have to be good too. You have to be both."</TE>
<TE>   With an unbalanced schedule, Angel shortstop David Eckstein said,
the wild card is all but mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won four more games than the Angels, but the Yankees
fattened up on the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore Orioles in the
AL East while the Angels jousted with the Oakland Athletics and
Seattle Mariners in the AL West. The Braves won six more games than
the Giants, but the Braves beat up on the weak NL East while the
Giants fought off the Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say who's really the best," Eckstein said. "If you
have an even schedule, you could say the other teams are better. But
you can't really say who's the best team. That's why they need a wild
card."</TE>
<TE>   Still, these are second-place teams. Best teams or hottest?</TE>
<TE>   "The question of whether these are the best teams is a little
unfair," Baer said. "They got to the finish line successfully."</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel outfielder Tim Salmon: "You know what? It's probably a
combination of both. I think it's real hard, when you start talking
about the playoffs, to say one team is better than another.</TE>
<TE>   "We might have been the hotter team, but that's what it comes down
to, who plays the best when it counts. That's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   That said, the notion of expanding the playoff field was
universally derided. Three division winners and the best of the
second-place teams compose a deserving playoff field, several players
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   And, besides, Anderson said, "The season is way too long already."</TE>
<TE>   Baer said owners would not accept a shortened schedule to
accommodate an extra round of playoffs, leaving the unpleasant choice
of starting the season in March or ending it in November.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty hard to play baseball in New York in mid-November,"
San Francisco shortstop Rich Aurilia said. "I know, because I grew up
there."</TE>
<TE>   The wild-card series starts tonight. The winner, Aurilia said,
will not be remembered as a wild-card team.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be remembered," he said, "as the 2002 champions."</TE>

<TE>   Update--In his last two starts, Washburn beat the New York Yankees
in the game that ended the division series and gave up one run over
seven innings to the Minnesota Twins in Game 3 of the league
championship series. In his last eight starts, including the
playoffs, he is 4-1 with a 2.26 ERA. He never has faced the Giants,
but he is 5-0 against National League teams. Schmidt can throw 98
mph, but the Angels love to face fastball pitchers. In two playoff
starts, Schmidt has struck out 13 in 13 innings and held opponents to
a .159 batting average. He never has faced the Angels. He had a 2.37
ERA at Pacific Bell Park this season -- and a 5.02 ERA on the road.</TE>

<LD>Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette commenting on the World
Series:</LD>
<LD>   "[It] is upon us, and already there are yawns. What once was
America's greatest sports spectacle -- the October classic -- has
declined to the point there must be something special about it to
attract our attention....</LD>
<LD>   "In retrospect, the World Series is not much more special than the
NBA Finals....</LD>
<TE>   "It has fallen so far that someone on one of the national talk
radio shows was wondering if the first game of the Series would draw
better television ratings than the Notre Dame-Air Force football
game."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is USC's largest margin of victory in football?</TE>
<TE>   Class by himself: Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune
commenting on 40-year-old wide receiver Jerry Rice of the Oakland
Raiders: "When you take everything into consideration -- skill, work
ethic, statistics, longevity, domination, scoring touchdowns and
winning championships -- Rice's credentials are beyond impeccable.
They are staggering....</TE>
<TE>   "Run out the statistics of all the great athletes in all the
sports. Rice is long gone, way past everyone in the numbers racket."</TE>
<TE>   Toe strategy: Isiah Thomas knows a team that can beat the Lakers.
Unfortunately for him, it's not the Indiana Pacers he now coaches;
it's the Detroit Pistons he once played for.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Florida Today, he was asked a key question:
"Who covers Shaq?"</TE>
<TE>   Thomas: "He wouldn't play. He has that arthritic toe, and [Rick]
Mahorn and [Bill] Laimbeer would have stepped on it."</TE>
<TE>   Now you know: The arrest of Chicago Bull forward Marcus Fizer on a
weapons violation reminded Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune that
Scottie Pippen was arrested on a gun charge in Chicago about a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterward Michael Jordan, one-upping Pippen as usual, was waving
his gun around the locker room," Smith said. "Thus was born the term
'morning shoot-around.' "</TE>
<TE>   Easy game for some: Martin Fennelly in the Tampa Tribune on
Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb: "The man strikes
Favre-like fear into Bucs fans. The man made some Bucs give up in
last year's playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "The year before that, coming to the line against the ice-cold,
beaten Bucs, McNabb was laughing. That still stokes some pewter
fires. It was overblown. It was simple.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I have fun out there,' he said."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 80-0 over Pomona in 1925. The lowest winning score
is 3-0 over 21st Infantry in 1917.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mickey Hershkowitz of the Houston Chronicle
commenting on Yao Ming: "How good is [he]? How much will he improve
the Rockets? How long will it take him to change the game?</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows yet, of course, but we are prepared to find out.
What we do know is this: He is 7 feet 5 and weighs 287 pounds. He can
dunk the ball without leaving his feet, and on an average night he
can block between five and 10 shots....</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow you doubt the Great Wall of China will turn out to be a
disappointment."</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Heat Shield</HD>
<DH>Rodriguez and Percival make the Angels' bullpen almost
bulletproof</DH>

<LD>F-Rod? K-Rod? Secret Weapon? The world demands a nickname for the
Angels' wonder child.</LD>
<LD>   Jewelry Supplier? Not much of a ring to it -- sorry about the pun
-- but that nickname might fit best of all. When Angel coach Alfredo
Griffin watches rookie Francisco Rodriguez pitch, his mind wanders
back to his days as shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays, and to his
first World Series championship ring.</LD>
<LD>   With a tag team of Duane Ward and Tom Henke pitching the final two
innings, the Blue Jays dominated the American League East from
1989-92, a run that included three division titles and culminated in
the 1992 World Series championship.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez made his major league debut 31 days ago, but no matter.
To him, a game without a strikeout is like a game without the
national anthem. With him, the Angels could win the 2002 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   To Griffin, Rodriguez pitching the eighth inning and Troy Percival
the ninth for the Angels is every bit as fearsome as Ward pitching
the eighth and Henke pitching the ninth for the Jays.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys were more experienced. Frankie is younger. But it's
the same situation," Griffin said. "You've got no chance when you get
to the eighth inning. You just pray you get to the seventh inning
ahead, or you can turn the light off and go to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   While the Blue Jays nurtured their bullpen tag team for two years
before they reached the playoffs, the Angels stumbled on theirs two
weeks before they got to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In his month in the major leagues, combining regular-season and
postseason play, Rodriguez, 20, is 4-0 with a 1.15 earned-run
average. In 16 innings, he has walked six and struck out 28, holding
opponents to a .137 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel coaches are torn in discussing Rodriguez, particularly
to the exclusion of other relievers. After all, the Angel bullpen
prospered without him, leading the league in saves and ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber saved four games with Percival on the disabled list in
July. Al Levine, who did not make the playoff roster, saved three
with Percival on the disabled list in April. Scot Shields, who has
not appeared in the playoffs, did not give up a hit in his final 12
innings of relief in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia insists that Weber, Brendan Donnelly and
Scott Schoeneweis all could pitch in the eighth inning during the
World Series. So could Rodriguez, of course.</TE>
<TE>   With a 6-3 lead in Game 2 of the league championship series,
Rodriguez pitched the seventh and got the first two outs in the
eighth, then handed the ball to Percival. In a 1-1 tie in Game 3,
Rodriguez pitched the eighth, then handed the ball to Percival. With
a 2-0 lead in Game 4, Rodriguez pitched the eighth, and he would have
handed the ball to Percival had the Angels not scored five runs in
the bottom of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won all three games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously been a pleasant surprise to add a piece like that
to an already very good bullpen," pitching coach Bud Black said. "I
don't want to minimize the importance of all the guys in the bullpen.
But Frankie makes us more physical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a nice feeling when you're in the other dugout."</TE>
<TE>   The translation for "more physical": Rodriguez can throw a 95-mph
fastball by you. So can Percival, and good night.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Angels had a "more physical" setup man, Percival
was the guy, in 1995. The Angels lost a one-game playoff for the
division title, the closest they came to postseason play until this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a pretty dynamic situation," bench coach Joe Maddon
said. "We were really able to shorten games based on the fact we had
such a physical bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "There are intangible feelings that occur."</TE>
<TE>   That translation: Even a rally monkey is powerless to help the
other guys.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're looking at a team like that, we're saying, we want to
win in seven innings," Maddon said, "because we don't want to try to
come back in the eighth and ninth."</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of Rodriguez enhances the entire bullpen. In Game 5
of the championship series, Scioscia removed starter Kevin Appier in
the sixth and replaced him with Donnelly, a luxury made possible by
Rodriguez' availability for the later innings.</TE>
<TE>   Such luxury is not often made possible by a kid who was a failed
starter in Class-A ball last year, a kid still shy of the legal
drinking age.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to see Frankie in the game," Griffin said.
"Usually, at that age, you can't dominate a game. You're nervous.
Your mind is not clear.</TE>
<TE>   "He's cold-blooded. He doesn't sweat."</TE>
<TE>   This championship plan would be a grand plan, except that the
Angels did not plan for this at all. In July, when they pursued
hard-throwing relievers and nearly traded for Paul Shuey of the
Cleveland Indians, they left Rodriguez at triple-A Salt Lake. At the
beginning of September, when rosters expanded, the Angels again left
Rodriguez at triple-A.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after the Pacific Coast League playoffs, they promoted
him Sept. 15. He made his major league debut three days later. He
made his playoff debut 14 days after that. In his seven postseason
appearances, the Angels are 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   Plan? What plan?</TE>
<TE>   "We fell into it at the very end," Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't discount what Weber and Donnelly and Schoeneweis have
done. We have the best bullpen in the league, and Frankie has added
another dimension."</TE>
<TE>   With a glance at his 1992 World Series ring, and a nod to Ward and
Henke, Griffin calls it a championship dimension.</TE>

<DH>Galaxy's Ruiz wins MVP in first MLS season, proving foreign
players can have success in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Vagenas was apprehensive when his coach, Sigi Schmid, asked him
to room with the new guy on the Galaxy's preseason trip to Chile.</LD>
<LD>   Vagenas already had a roomie in Alexi Lalas and Galaxy players
were weary of Major League Soccer assigning to their team
high-profile foreign imports who imploded under the pressure of
performing in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But right away, Vagenas noticed something different in the
demeanor of Carlos Ruiz, a 23-year-old forward from Guatemala City.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz was humble and hungry, unlike Mexican stars Carlos Hermosillo
and Luis Hernandez, who had joined the Galaxy on the downside of
stellar careers in their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   "Carlos Hermosillo came here and I don't care if he didn't score
one goal, he'd still be the greatest [Mexican] soccer player that
ever lived," Vagenas said. "Luis Hernandez had established himself at
the top as well so when they came here, nothing was ever going to
change that.</TE>
<TE>   "Carlos [Ruiz] came here using this to establish himself. This is
his steppingstone. He's looking to excel and to go to higher heights.
We can sit here and put down [Hermosillo and Hernandez] compared to
Carlos but they were at different points in their careers. This was
do-or-die for Carlos."</TE>
<TE>   He's done it ... with aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, named the league's most valuable player on Friday, has led
the Western Conference champion Galaxy to its fourth MLS Cup title
game, Sunday against the New England Revolution at Gillette Stadium
in Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   After leading MLS in goals with a franchise-record 24 in 26
regular-season games, among them nine game-winning scores, and
finishing second in the league scoring race to New England's Taylor
Twellman, 52 points to 49, Ruiz has set playoff records for goals,
seven, and points, 16.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about hard work," Ruiz said. "With my team in Guatemala,
Municipal, I learned a strong work ethic. I've just carried it over
to here and things have been very good for me and for the Galaxy."</TE>
<TE>   Hermosillo, who played with the Galaxy in 1998 and '99, and
Hernandez, 2000 and '01, combined for only 26 goals in 64
regular-season games and caused acrimony in the locker room by being
part-time players, splitting time with their national and club teams
during the heart of the MLS season.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, meanwhile, won over Galaxy players with his penchant for
scoring goals immediately and his easygoing off-field manner.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made this his first team; there is no other team," said
Galaxy captain Cobi Jones, a U.S. national team veteran who had seen
Ruiz with Guatemala in international play. "I told [the other Galaxy
players] that he was a good player and his temperament fit in right
away, hanging out with the guys. That was a big difference from the
other [foreign] players that had been here in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "From the moment I met these guys in Chile, we've been friends,"
he said. "That's so important -- to have a good relationship with
your teammates on and off the field. We're all friends here."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy may be his team of the moment, but Ruiz's first squad
holds a special place in his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up playing barefoot pick-up games in the dusty, unpaved
streets of Guatemala City's Zone 21 barrio, Bellos Horizontes, Ruiz
was a natural as a goalkeeper, a position at which he won numerous
awards when he began playing on his barrio's organized team.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the most prolific goal-scorer in MLS began his soccer career
stopping goals. So why the switch?</TE>
<TE>   "Our team was so good that I never had any action as the
goalkeeper," Ruiz said. "I wanted some action so I made the switch
and became a forward. I think it's worked out for the best."</TE>
<TE>   When he was 12, Ruiz joined about 1,800 other youngsters at an
open tryout for a spot in the prestigious youth academy of club team
CSD Municipal. Fewer than four years later, Ruiz had not only picked
up his nickname, Pescadito (Little Fish), the lone boy in a
four-daughter family was also the only player from the colossal
casting call to make it to Municipal's parent club.</TE>
<TE>   His natural scoring ability generated interest from Europe and
Ruiz spent a frustrating seven months with Greek first-division club
PAS Ioanina, where he scored only one goal and, he claims, was never
paid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his difficulties in Greece, the Galaxy remained intrigued
and signed him as a discovery pick on Feb. 5.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no regrets and Schmid has been impressed with the
variety of ways Ruiz has scored.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been headers, penalty kicks, free kicks, shots from
outside the 18[-yard box], putting away rebounds," Schmid said. "It's
not like you can say this guy only scores goals in one particular
way. He's always sniffing around, so he scores goals in so many
ways."</TE>
<TE>   And he scores with amazing frequency. Counting the regular season,
exhibitions, U.S. Open Cup matches and the MLS playoffs, Ruiz has
scored 43 goals for the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no other goals have been as thrilling, though, as the
game-winning headers he put on San Jose at the end of the regular
season and at Colorado to clinch the Galaxy's spot in the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Just call me Pes-cabeza," Ruiz said after beating the
Earthquakes, a takeoff on his moniker which, when translated very
loosely, means Fish-head.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his success leaves the Galaxy and MLS to wonder if maybe
Ruiz has been too good, that he'll again catch the eyes of
higher-paying foreign leagues. Ruiz, one of an all-time high four
Guatemalans playing abroad, has always dreamed of playing with Necaxa
in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "He's physical, doles out as much [punishment] as he takes and
plays through pain," said Lalas, who's taken the 5-foot-9, 170-pound
Ruiz under his wing and owes him a wristwatch from a wager that Ruiz
would score more than 15 goals. Indeed, Ruiz led the Galaxy in both
fouls committed (71) and fouls suffered (71).</TE>
<TE>   "The league's littered with busts, foreign players who have come
in and either haven't been able to handle the pace of the game that's
played here or thought it was going to be a vacation. Carlos is
neither."</TE>
<TE>   The married father of two daughters, Ruiz has found a home with
the Galaxy, if only temporarily. And it all began in a lonely hotel
room in Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Vagenas, "I found out really quickly why [Schmid] asked
me to room with Carlos. He had just played in Greece and he spoke
more Greek than English, and I speak fluent Greek, so we just stayed
up all night speaking Greek."</TE>
<TE>   Vagenas' father moved here from Planitero, Greece. "Now we speak
three languages to each other [Greek, Spanish and English] on the
field," Vagenas said.</TE>
<TE>   "He made me a bet at the beginning of the season that he would be
fluent in English in three months. Obviously that didn't work out.
His English now is about as good as his Greek.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say it's all Greek to Carlos."</TE>
<TE>   And it's all good for the Galaxy.</TE>

<TE>   Focus of the Attack</TE>
<TE>   Never in league history have two teams relied so much on single
players to provide goals as the Galaxy and New England, which will
meet Sunday in the MLS Cup. The Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz became the first
player to account for more than half of his team's goals, with New
England's Taylor Twellman not far from that mark. The top 10 (with
player's goals, team's goals and percentage):</TE>

<TE>   Whom to root for in this most unlikely all-California World
Series? Growing up a rabid Dodger fan in Los Angeles, I disliked the
Angels, what with their silly-looking uniforms, and (mostly)
second-rate lineup. They played an inferior, American League brand of
baseball with its gimmicky DH rule. The Giants? They were neither
here nor there for the Dodger fan in the late '70s and early '80s.
The Reds and Yankees were the teams to reserve one's venom for.</TE>
<TE>   However, after moving to the Bay Area as an adult I received a
quick indoctrination into the ways of Giant Fan, a slow-witted sort
who would gladly trade a last-place finish for a few victories over
the hated blue-clad crew. I once had beer dumped over my head at
Candlestick Park and consider myself lucky to have escaped merely
wet. My feelings about the 2002 World Series? Go, Angels!</TE>

<TE>   It's sad to see that Bill Plaschke is still losing sleep over the
idea of pitching to Barry Bonds. It's the World Series, Bill. Nobody
got there by playing scared. It's where these guys go to find out
who's best.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels just "walk him, walk him, walk him" as Plaschke
keeps pleading, that question will never be answered -- and in the
end, who wants bragging rights as the team that beat most of the
Giants in this year's World Series? Will someone please tell Bill
that "sports" is the root word of "sportsmanship"?</TE>

<TE>   Bill Plaschke's Oct. 17 column said that the hourlong drive from
L.A. to the Big Ed will prevent most Dodger fans from converting to
Angel admirers.</TE>
<TE>   I am a carless person who relies on two MTA buses and a mile walk
from Disneyland to the stadium, all to cheer for the Angels. A
four-hour, one-way trip. So there, Bill Plaschke.</TE>

<TE>   It seems like only yesterday that the Dodgers were the
organization with the home-grown talent, the young pitching phenom
and the gritty, aggressive style that found a way to win, while the
Angels spent recklessly on big-ticket free agents only to come up
short every season.</TE>

<TE>   As a former batboy for the 1962 Los Angeles Angels, I have gone
through 40 years of disappointment and sadness over a team that I
dearly love. Sunday's decisive Angel victory somewhat reminds me of
the 1969 World Series champion New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are destiny-bound greatly due to one man -- Manager
Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel A. Nardoni</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why is the attendance figure (11,332) for the Kings versus Ducks
game at the Pond such a big issue? The Angels struggled all season to
reach 25,000 per game.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, this marginal fan support comes from the same "fan"
base that drove the Rams out of Southern California. And let's not
forget the infamous Freedom Bowl. Of course, Angel fans abound now
that they are four games away from their first World Series
championship.</TE>
<TE>   This recent (and probably short-lived) Angel mania makes me admire
the Dodgers and their fans more than ever before. Three million in
attendance every season, despite 14 years of mediocrity and a few
years of Kevin Malone.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well. Go, Angels! Sweep the Giants, their battery-chucking
fans, and the arrogant Barry Bonds. You deserve this championship,
but you also deserve consistent support from your "fans."</TE>

<TE>   As the last out of the American League championship series was
recorded, the ball coming to rest in the glove of a player who
exemplifies the hopes, dreams and desire of any child or adult who
has ever played a game just for the love of it, I couldn't help but
think that somewhere Gene Autry and Donnie Moore nodded to each
other, exchanged a wink, and walked arm in arm through baseball's
pearly gates.</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong Angel fan, I would like to take this opportunity to
speak on behalf of all the athletes who have been scorned, belittled
and insulted by someone who probably never so much as had a catch
with a friend or family member. Enjoy your crow, T.J. Simers, save
room for your feet.</TE>

<TE>   After being mercilessly criticized for everything from his stance
on contraction to his decision to allow the All-Star game to end in a
tie, Bud Selig is due for some credit.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, it was Commissioner Selig who persuaded the owners to
abandon 100 years of baseball tradition and vote to adopt a wild-card
format. And, in 2002, for the first time in history, both teams in
the World Series will be wild-card entries. Nice call, commissioner.</TE>

<LD>You published a letter from one of your readers in last Saturday's
paper disparaging the Virginia Tech football schedule. The reader
said the Hokies had not played a team in the top 25.</LD>
<LD>   The Hokies have defeated three teams ranked in the top 25 at the
time the Hokies played them: LSU, Marshall and Texas A&amp;M. Only LSU
remains in the top 25, but you can't say this year the Hokies haven't
played quality opponents. Is the Big East as good as the Pac-10 top
to bottom? Probably not. Do the Hokies deserve a No. 3 ranking? Very
debatable. However, until they played each other, neither Texas nor
Oklahoma had played a top-25 team. So why do those teams deserve to
be ranked in the top 10? Who is to say?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What has Fox got against television viewers by having Tim McCarver be
part of the broadcast team for the World Series? This pontificating
know-it-all is personally responsible for the installation of mute
buttons on all of the television remote controls. His constant
yammering drives all the people I know crazy and makes me wonder if
his salary is based on the number of words he uses.</LD>

<TE>   Let's see, in the Fox commercials during Angel playoff games,
there was: bombing and terrorism for "24," rioting high school
students and a baby discarded in a bathroom for "Boston Public,"
hookers and men who drank so much they couldn't remember or passed
out for "Firefly," a gynecologist diving into a woman's crotch for
"girls club," murder and pools of blood for "John Doe," and violence,
guns, sex and bar scenes for "Fast Lane."</TE>
<TE>   Is this what we have to look forward to for the World Series?
There's always radio. At least during the commercial breaks we won't
have to answer our child's question, "What's a hooker?"</TE>

<HD>Booing Fans Feel They Were Robbed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What, are we supposed to feel sorry for Rob Blake?</LD>
<LD>   It's funny that L.A. fans have the reputation of being passive,
yet when King fans -- some of the more knowledgeable and vocal in the
sport -- boo Blake, J.A. Adande [Oct. 17] actually encourages us to
be passive and let bygones be bygones. But J.A., we don't want to. In
fact, we not only want to boo him, we have a responsibility to boo
him. He's not only the enemy, he's also a liar and a traitor. Blake
has said that the boos don't bother him, so why do they bother you,
J.A.? Perhaps you're not 100% clear on the subject.</LD>
<LD>   Let me explain it to you: Whiny team captain takes his case public
rather than handling it privately with team. Millionaire defenseman
chats up his "market value" (but seriously, fans, it's not about the
money!). Beloved player leaves team for more money. Still claims it
isn't about money. The Colorado Avalanche is a hated opponent of the
Kings.</LD>
<TE>   If that's not the recipe for booing a former player, I don't know
what is.</TE>

<LD>Bob Toledo is disappointed in his kicking game? Don't pass the buck,
Bob. The loss to Oregon rests squarely on Toledo's shoulders, not on
Chris Griffith's leg.</LD>
<LD>   I've been patient and a Bob Toledo supporter for many years, but
no more. His play-calling and coaching seem to get worse each year.
He is conservative when he should open things up and a risk taker
when safe would be the wise move.</LD>
<LD>   Forget dumping Steve Lavin, UCLA has a much bigger problem! Bob is
lucky my name isn't Dan Guerrero, because I've had it with him!</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phi Beta Bob came up short again at the Rose Bowl. Short on a
fourth-and-15 trick play, when a 45-yard field goal would have given
us the game. Short on timeouts, when wasting all three in the second
half didn't allow us to stop the clock and maybe get the ball back.
Short on play-calling, when the Bruins don't run out the clock at the
end of the half. Short a few moments later, when only three Bruins
lined up and no one could at least get a hand up on a 59-yard
field-goal attempt. And let's not forget a favorite one, short on
defense as once again 30 points are not enough to win.</TE>
<TE>   But he saves his best for the final act, where our play director
decides to reenact last year's game with overly conservative calls,
hoping a long field goal will win it. Oops, didn't work this time
either. If he can't learn from his prior losses, it's no wonder the
team loses lots of games and ultimately gives up, like against USC
last year.</TE>

<LD>Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes withdrew from the
first two Grand Prix events of the season because of a strained right
hamstring and medial tendon of her right calf muscle.</LD>
<LD>   Skate America, to be held next weekend in Spokane, Wash., was to
be Hughes' first full-fledged event since her stunning triumph at
Salt Lake City. She will be replaced at Skate America by six-time
U.S. champion Michelle Kwan, who finished third at Salt Lake City
behind Hughes and Irina Slutskaya of Russia.</LD>
<LD>   "This is earlier than she planned to compete, but Michelle's
enthused about it," said Kwan's agent, Shep Goldberg. "[The U.S.
Figure Skating Assn.] asked her to support the event, and she
agreed."</LD>
<TE>   However, Goldberg said no agreement was made for Kwan to also step
in for Hughes at Skate Canada, to be held Oct. 31-Nov. 3 in Quebec
City.</TE>

<LD>San Francisco's Terrell Owens invented a way to celebrate a
touchdown, and now it's a hot issue all over the NFL. A sampling of
the pen-demonium:</LD>
<LD>   New York Jet Coach Herman Edwards walked into a receivers' meeting
this week and, without saying a word, handed out Sharpies. Everyone
laughed.</LD>
<LD>   Keyshawn Johnson, the Tampa Bay receiver who has one touchdown
catch in 22 games, said he might do what Owens did -- stuffing a
couple of Sharpies in his sock for just such an occasion -- but the
pens would probably dry out before he got a chance to use them.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas running back Emmitt Smith, about to break Walter Payton's
rushing record, wishes he were the first to think of autographing a
ball when he crossed the goal line. And this is a guy who has been
low-key and classy his entire career.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there were lots of people who rolled their eyes at Owens.
But just as many considered his showboating humorous and refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was funny," Smith said. "Give the man some style
points."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL had a different reaction. It sent a memo to all 32 teams
that carrying a foreign object, such as a pen, may result in a
15-yard penalty and ejection.</TE>
<TE>   "If the referee deems the object to be a safety hazard, the player
will be ejected from the game," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. "An
object such as a pen will be considered a safety hazard."</TE>
<TE>   Give Owens a mute switch too, for suggesting in Friday's edition
of the San Francisco Examiner that any negative reaction has to do
with his being black. Once he was informed of how moronic that
sounded, he recanted in a statement issued Friday afternoon through
the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a racial issue, it's about perception," he said. "I'm
a target because of who I am and what I've done in the past. It seems
like everything I do is taken to another level."</TE>
<TE>   By contending that race was a factor, it was Owens who took it to
another level: the basement.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Superstar</TE>
<TE>   The football world has mixed opinions about the celebration, but
there's nothing ambiguous about the feelings at Sanford Corp., which
makes Sharpies. There, he's a superstar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's created quite a buzz among our customers," said Bob Daenen,
brand manager for Sharpie. "There's no question this is great news
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Daenen, who goes by "Sharpie Bob," carries at least three of the
markers on him at all times -- black, blue and red. He was watching
the game Monday night and wasn't sure what type of pen Owens was
using, although he had an inkling.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard stories about lots of celebrities using Sharpies,
even George Bush," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Owens' celebration might become a trend among, say, high
school football players, Sharpie Bob was hopeful but guarded.
"Certainly high school children have been known to imitate pro
athletes," he said. "We can't endorse anybody carrying them in their
sock."</TE>
<TE>   An Old Softy</TE>
<TE>   Detroit quarterback Joey Harrington has taken a serious ribbing
from teammates this week over his photo and quotes in the latest
issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington later offered this Cosmo cop-out:</TE>
<TE>   "What I was trying to do was reach out to a demographic that
wouldn't usually watch football on Sunday afternoons," he told
reporters with a laugh. "If you check the stats, last week we had
about 750,000 hits on our Web site. I'm not saying there's a direct
correlation, but this week there's been about 800,000. I think we've
created some fans for the Detroit Lions that wouldn't be there
before."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates aren't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   In a category called, "Getting Cheeky," Harrington's quote is:
"Touching a woman's face and putting my face against hers excites me.
Soft cheeks are so appealing."</TE>
<TE>   Soft cheeks are appealing? I guess Lion center Dominic Raiola can
do away with that "Buns of Steel" video.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- It's amazing that New England would trade Drew Bledsoe
within the division, especially now that it's clear Bledsoe has a lot
of good football left in him. "This off-season, when they made that
move with New England, I was like, 'Go to Cincinnati, man. Do not
stay in the division,' " Miami linebacker Zach Thomas told reporters.
"But hopefully it comes back and bites New England." Bledsoe, who has
a passer rating of 101.3, leads the league in yards passing with
2,016.... Indianapolis receiver Marvin Harrison has had four
consecutive 100-yard games and is on pace for 140 catches for 1,866
yards. He reminds a lot of people of Jerry Rice in his prime. Wait,
isn't Rice still in his prime?</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- The Ravens continue to honor Johnny Unitas. At
halftime Sunday, the club will unveil a statue of the legendary
quarterback, who died of a heart attack last month. His name will be
added to the team's ring of honor too, and the main entrance of the
stadium will be named "Unitas Plaza." ... When they played Cleveland
last Sunday, the Buccaneers briefly used Warren Sapp as a tight end.
Sapp took the opportunity to get into the head of right defensive end
Courtney Brown, telling Brown, "You're soft as ... " Brown declined
to comment on the remark -- he hasn't talked to reporters since the
summer -- but, predictably, Sapp expounded on his critique. "I don't
know if they're asking him to do something that's physically
impossible, but he's a specimen," Sapp said. "You've got to expect
something out of your right end." ... Steeler Coach Bill Cowher on
Andy Rooney's rant on female sideline reporters: "I have a household
with my wife having played professional basketball, my three
daughters that play basketball. They are all females, so do you think
I'm going to agree with Andy Rooney?"</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- As rookies go, David Carr is awfully poised. Yes, he
has been sacked 31 times, but he has thrown only six interceptions in
five games. A lot of quarterbacks are more likely to throw a risky
pass than take a big hit.... Tennessee's Samari Rolle on his hit that
knocked Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell out of Sunday's game:
"As far as I know, it was a clean hit. I don't think they can say I
tried to hurt him. I weigh 170 pounds. How can I try and hurt a
quarterback? Especially Mark Brunell -- as much as he throws the ball
to me." Rolle has seven interceptions against the Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- Denver has the league's best rushing defense, and it's
easy to see why. Only Baltimore's Jamal Lewis gained more than 50
yards on the ground against the Broncos. They put the clamps on
Garrison Hearst, Marshall Faulk, LaDainian Tomlinson and Ricky
Williams. Actually, Tomlinson gained 48 yards two weeks ago, and
Williams gained 49 last Sunday, so, yard by yard, things are heading
in the right direction for Kansas City's Priest Holmes, who plays
them Sunday.... Denver's Shannon Sharpe has yet to catch a touchdown
pass.... He's new to the team, but already Rod Woodson buys into the
Raiders' longtime conspiracy theory that all the referees are against
them. "One thing I've learned in my short time being here is that if
the call's close, it's going the opposite way," Woodson said. OK, so
the Raiders were robbed on the snow job, but the nonstop
we're-getting-jobbed stuff is really tired.... Entering last Sunday's
game at San Diego, the Chiefs had scored a league-high 85 points in
the fourth quarter. Through six games, the Kansas City defense has
given up 85 points in the fourth, an average of two touchdowns in
that quarter.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- Cowboy receiver Antonio Bryant was a great find in the
draft, but some teammates think he made a rookie mistake in telling
reporters that Darren Woodson ripped into teammates after a loss to
Philadelphia. "To bring nosy people into your house and let them know
all your dirt, that's a big mistake to make," Emmitt Smith said. "But
if he knew then what he knows now, he would have never said it." ...
Smith's yards just became a heck of a lot longer. Larry Allen, one of
the best guards in the business, is hobbling on a sprained left
ankle.... Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden has fond memories of his days as
Philadelphia's offensive coordinator. Well, sort of fond. "It's
different" in Florida, he told the Philadelphia Daily News. "It's a
lot different than going over the Walt Whitman [Bridge] every morning
and hearing, 'Hey, there's that Gruden guy. You dipstick.' "</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Bear receiver David Terrell on teammate Anthony
Thomas, who Sunday rescued a man from a smoldering car: "We have a
superhero on the team now. He's really A-Train right now. He saved
the guy's life, and I thought you all should know about that. It's
the truth. Cool thing for him to do." ... A big reason the Lions have
the 30th-ranked pass defense is they put next to no pressure on
quarterbacks. Six sacks in five games.... In his first 40 games,
Packer Coach Mike Sherman's record is 27-13, identical to that of
Vince Lombardi. But Lombardi's 40th game was the 1961 NFL
championship.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Tampa Bay safety John Lynch has not missed a start
since Nov. 8, 1998, a string of 65 games. The Buccaneers are 40-25
over that span.... Carolina has never had a defensive lineman with
double-figure sack numbers. That could change this season,
considering the Panthers lead the league with 25 sacks -- one fewer
than they collected last season -- and the defensive line has 21 of
those.... DeShaun Foster, coming off a knee injury, is aiming to
return for the Oct. 27 game against Tampa Bay.... Red alert: The
Falcons could be switching back to the red uniforms they wore from
1968 through 1989.... New Orleans linebacker Bryan Cox, in his 12th
NFL season, could get his most extensive playing time of the season
against the 49ers, in place of injured starter Charlie Clemons.
During the last four games, Cox has worn a headset on the sidelines,
doubling as an unofficial assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- More than 50,000 tickets have been sold for Arizona's
game against Dallas on Sunday. That's big news for the Cardinals,
whose first two home games drew crowds of 30,000 each, but
73,014-seat Sun Devil Stadium will still have a half-filled feel....
Touchdown catches by Seattle receivers this season: 0. Mike Holmgren,
who could be out the door if his team doesn't improve, is seething
about the 1-4 start. "Enough of the excuses," he said. "We are what
we are.... I'm angry. I'm really angry about this. And I'm not
putting myself outside over here and the team in there. I'm mad at
everybody. I'm mad at myself. We're a better team than this, and
underachieving as a team, as a coach, as players, it bothers me a
lot."</TE>

<HD>Chandler Gets Starting Call in Chicago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Chandler will start at quarterback for the Chicago Bears on
Sunday, replacing an ailing Jim Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Miller has tendinitis in his throwing shoulder and elbow and
hasn't practiced since Monday. Although Bear Coach Dick Jauron
originally said Miller's status could be a game-time decision, he
made the switch Friday after Miller missed practice again.</LD>
<LD>   It will be Chandler's first appearance in a regular-season game
since Dec. 30, when he played for the Atlanta Falcons. It will be his
first game against Detroit since 1998, the year he led the Falcons to
the Super Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels like 10 years since I've played," Chandler said after
Friday's practice. "I've been trying to do whatever I can to try and
feel comfortable in the offense over the past few weeks, to keep
learning it, be ready in case something were to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was upgraded from questionable to probable, so he'll likely
serve as Chandler's backup ahead of third-stringer Henry Burris.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler spent the last five seasons in Atlanta before signing a
three-year, $4.5 million deal with the Bears last spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bear defensive end Bryan Robinson was arrested for drunken driving
and released on his own recognizance early Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson practiced Friday morning, but it wasn't immediately
certain if his arrest would keep him out of the starting lineup for
Sunday's game at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware of Robinson's arrest this morning and are currently
gathering information related to the incident," Bear General Manager
Jerry Angelo said in a statement. "After we have finished this
process, we will further address the situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is suing the NFL's merchandising arm to recover more
than $200,000 in unpaid city taxes, court documents showed.</TE>
<TE>   The city filed suit on Tuesday, alleging NFL Properties, which is
headquartered in New York but has an office in Los Angeles, has not
paid taxes called for under municipal code.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges NFL Properties has not paid city taxes since
1994, and that a tax assessment for $216,914.83 was sent to its New
York office in April 2001. No one at the New York offices of NFL
Properties could be reached for comment late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers will make a game-time decision Sunday on
whether linebacker Junior Seau will play against the Oakland Raiders.
Seau, who has been bothered by a sprained ankle since the third game
of the season, is listed as questionable, as is defensive end
Marcellus Wiley.... Buffalo Bill reserve running back Shawn Bryson
will miss the rest of the season because of torn ligaments in his
left knee and starting cornerback Antoine Winfield won't play in
Sunday's game against Miami. Winfield had arthroscopic knee surgery
Friday and it was not known how many games he would miss....
Cleveland cornerback Daylon McCutcheon will not start against the
Houston because of a bruised elbow he suffered last Sunday against
Tampa Bay.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (record)        Comment (last week's rank)
1     MIAMI (5-1)          Tough to maintain this pace with receivers
                           hurt and Fiedler out. (3)
2     OAKLAND (4-1)        Jerry Rice has ravaged the Chargers over
                           the years. (1)
3     SAN DIEGO (5-1)      Chargers know they can win despite a slew
                           of mistakes. (7)
4     TAMPA BAY (5-1)      Even without Dungy, Buccaneers have one of
                           the league's best defenses. (5)
5     NEW ORLEANS (5-1)    Saints are phenomenal in the red zone: 19
                           touchdowns, nine field goals. (8)
6     SAN FRANCISCO (4-1)  Injuries to S Zack Bronson and RB Terry
                           Jackson hurt 49ers. (4)
7     GREEN BAY (5-1)      Packers are so hobbled, they're using
                           linebackers for their dime packages. (10)
8     DENVER (4-2)         Broncos, who need big points in K.C.,
                           haven't topped 30 in almost a year. (2)
9     PHILADELPHIA (3-2)   Eagles have given up 19 sacks in first
                           five games. Here come the Buccaneers. (6)
10    KANSAS CITY (3-3)    Chiefs have given up 2,580 yards, on pace
                           for league record. (9)
11    BUFFALO (3-3)        Drew Bledsoe leads the NFL in passing
                           yards with 2,016. (13)
12    INDIANAPOLIS (4-1)   Colts have matched the best start in club
                           history since moving to Indianapolis. (15)
13    JACKSONVILLE (3-2)   Jaguars were starting to come together,
                           but injuries could change that. (12)
14    PITTSBURGH (2-3)     Jerome Bettis is looking more and more
                           like the Bus of old. (18)
15    CHICAGO (2-3)        Bears have been riddled with injuries,
                           including Jim Miller and David Terrell.
                           (14)
16    ARIZONA (3-2)        David Boston has quietly faded out of the
                           picture. (17)
17    NEW ENGLAND (3-3)    Tom Brady has five touchdowns, seven
                           interceptions in last three games. (11)
18    BALTIMORE (2-3)      Raven defense played remarkably well
                           without Lewis, McCrary. (16)
19    ATLANTA (2-3)        Return of Ray Buchanan gives Falcons a
                           respectable nickel back. (24)
20    DALLAS (3-3)         Receiver Antonio Bryant is rounding into
                           one of the league's best rookies. (25)
21    CAROLINA (3-3)       Now we'll really see how Chris Weinke
                           deals with adversity. (19)
22    SEATTLE (1-4)        Seahawks are 1-4 for the first time since
                           1996. (21)
23    TENNESSEE (2-4)      Looks as if Jevon Kearse won't be back
                           until Nov. 10 against the Texans. (28)
24    ST. LOUIS (1-5)      Believe it or not, folks are still talking
                           playoffs in St. Louis. (29)
25    N.Y. GIANTS (3-3)    Even loaded with veterans, Giant offense
                           can't get on track. (20)
26    DETROIT (1-4)        So far, Joey Harrington has exceeded
                           expectations. (26)
27    CLEVELAND (2-4)      Browns have lost nine of 12, and Butch
                           Davis has to be getting nervous. (22)
28    MINNESOTA (1-4)      Mike Tice on boring team: "The explosive
                           days of Viking football are over." (31)
29    WASHINGTON (2-3)     Patrick Ramsey took a big step backward in
                           last week's fiasco. (23)
30    HOUSTON (1-4)        Texans have no ground game; they've rushed
                           for one touchdown. (30)
31    N.Y. JETS (1-4)      Defense is not only lousy, but the players
                           don't like one another. (27)
32    CINCINNATI (0-6)     On pace to set record for fewest points
                           scored and most points given up. (32)</TE>

<HD>What Have They Done With Barry?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series begins today, and the Angels have Barry Bonds right
where they want him.</LD>
<LD>   Smiling.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, everyone's excited to be here," Bonds said. "I am,
particularly. It's something I've worked for my whole life."</LD>
<TE>   Relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "I rest easy every day I wake up," Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   Wistful.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being out here all the time," Bonds said of the Edison
Field site. "We used to have family softball games with the Disney
characters."</TE>
<TE>   Even -- and please don't tell Scott Boras -- sentimental.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the opportunity to play left field and I play against the
ghost of Willie [Mays] and my dad [Bobby]," Bonds said. "My dad
played right field, my godfather played center, I play left. I get to
have that dream every single day when I step on that field at Pac
Bell."</TE>
<TE>   After mostly blowing off the media and public while blowing
through the first two rounds of the playoffs, Bonds performed two
very uncharacteristic feats at Friday's news conference.</TE>
<TE>   1. He showed up.</TE>
<TE>   2. He didn't try to verbally reduce everyone to the size of Jeff
Kent's mustache.</TE>
<TE>   All of which surely led the Giants to a single conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   1. They're in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of distraction and Best Damn Something or Anothers,
Barry Bonds has become Babe Ruth precisely because he is not Babe
Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't engage the media. He doesn't notice the fans. He
doesn't do publicity or patter or even politeness, and he doesn't
care what anyone thinks.</TE>
<TE>   This is why he can calmly hit homers in calamitous situations.
This is why he can pop louder than the flashbulbs and roar louder
than the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Because they're not there. Nothing is there except the ball and
the bat and some shivering fisherman in a plastic kayak.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds owns the baseball world because he is convinced there
is nobody else playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Man don't talk to nobody," teammate Shawon Dunston explained.</TE>
<TE>   So suddenly, Friday, on the eve of his first World Series after 17
years of trying, he shows up talking to everybody?</TE>
<TE>   He holds this 20-minute conference that covers everything from his
batboy son to his Hall of Fame godfather, from the love of his
manager to his respect for Jeff Kent?</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen, Magic Johnson had Kareem,"
Bonds said. "There's always going to be somebody to help that other
person ... become a better player or challenge themselves, and Jeff
Kent challenges me a lot in how I perform."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent?</TE>
<TE>   The guy who, earlier this year, he shoved in the dugout?</TE>
<TE>   Comparing him to Kareem?</TE>
<TE>   Easy, Big Fella.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' behavior was understandable, but unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   It was welcome, but weird.</TE>
<TE>   If the Giants aren't worried, they ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who approached 73 home runs last year as if he were
being dragged into quicksand.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who is known as much for his scowls as his swings
and will be remembered as</TE>
<TE>   much for his aloofness as his athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who actually started Friday's news conference by
refusing to answer the first question.</TE>
<TE>   But that's OK, it was from me, it was an oddly worded question,
and earlier this week I unfortunately described him as a slug, so I
can hardly blame him.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think if a pitcher intentionally walks you, is he being
smart, or is he not being brave?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Next question," he said, glaring.</TE>
<TE>   Folks thought, how perfect, on the eve of the biggest series of
his career, he's going to spend it taking indoor batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The next question was about constantly handling pitches outside
the strike zone, and he answered it with Hall of Fame insight</TE>
<TE>   "Like they say, the game's about inches," Bonds said. "He may make
that pitch that, on his inches, that's the pitch he got me out. But
if he misses with those inches, that's the pitch I'm going to hit
out."</TE>
<TE>   Then the next question was about reporters who criticize Bonds for
not playing well in the postseason until now, and he didn't even rip
the reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's your guy's job, that's what you do," he said. "I don't
discredit your jobs. I mean, that's what you guys do, you analyze us.
That's fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   It was all fine with him.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about watching previous World Series games, he said he was
never going to go until his team made it.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I hit 73 home runs last year and got invited to go
to the World Series and throw out the first pitch," he said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Such a great laugh, you wondered where it had been hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Then it came out again when he talked about Manager Dusty Baker
bringing food to their lockers, and about his batboy son Nikolai, and
about dealing with those intentional walks.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned when I hit 73 home runs ... my son was upset and my
daughter was upset, saying, 'They pitch to everyone else, Dad. How
come you don't get to hit?' " he explained. "I told my son ... there
are other parts of the game of baseball than just swinging a bat."</TE>
<TE>   And on it went, a fine late-afternoon conversation with a guy who
will one day be bronzed in Cooperstown. Giant folks will say this
happens with Bonds occasionally, this sudden pleasantness and
cheerfulness and charm.</TE>
<TE>   They call it Good Barry.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of a series in which nastiness will be required, it was
more like Scary Barry.</TE>

<HD>MLS Looks to Double Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Soccer, which ends its seventh season Sunday, intends
eventually to double in size, to 20 teams, Commissioner Don Garber
said Friday, identifying some of the candidate cities as Atlanta,
Cleveland, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oklahoma City,
Philadelphia, Seattle and Tulsa.</LD>
<LD>   Only a year ago, the MLS was folding its teams at Miami and Tampa,
but pronouncing the league "in better shape then it ever was," Garber
said that financial losses had been halved this year and that
attendance at Sunday's championship game between the Galaxy and New
England Revolution in Foxboro, Mass., could surpass the record of
57,431 set in the 1997 title game. By Friday, almost 50,000 tickets
had been sold.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the league's year-end awards have been divided among
six of its 10 clubs.</LD>
<TE>   Galaxy striker Carlos Ruiz made off with the most-valuable-player
and goal-of-the-year awards, and the Revolution also was doubly
honored.</TE>
<TE>   Its coach, Steve Nicol, the former Liverpool player who took over
from Fernando Clavijo in midseason, was named coach of the year.
Forward Taylor Twellman, who dueled with Ruiz for the MLS scoring
title, was honored for the play of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Chicago Fire's Carlos Bocanegra, a former UCLA
standout, was voted defender of the year; the San Jose Earthquakes'
Joe Cannon was selected goalkeeper of the year; the Columbus Crew's
Kyle Martino was picked as rookie of the year, and the Kansas City
Wizards' Chris Klein was named comeback player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Terry was named the top referee for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Poles Apart</TE>
<TE>   Former Polish World Cup star Zbigniew Boniek, who was named
Poland's coach in July after the country's disappointing performance
at Korea/Japan '02, said he would resign if Poland fails to qualify
for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal, or at least reach the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "If I fail to achieve first or second place in the [qualifying]
group, I will quit," Boniek, 46, told the Warsaw newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza. "We will have to give a chance to someone else then. Maybe
Boniek is a good coach, I believe he is, but I may be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Poland's first-choice goalkeeper, Jerzy Dudek, signed a
contract with Liverpool that will keep him with the English Premier
League club until 2006. Terms were not revealed, but Coach Gerard
Houllier said Dudek, who had 29 shutouts in 54 games last season, had
been "rewarded accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Lapuente Wins One</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Lapuente, who lost his first two games after returning as
Club America's coach, got back on track Thursday when the defending
Mexican league champion defeated Queretaro, 3-1, on two goals by
Marcelo Lipatin and one by Christian Patino.</TE>
<TE>   Full of Demons</TE>
<TE>   Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia's league leader and one of the country's
top teams, has requested that the Roman Catholic church assign a
priest to the team full-time.</TE>
<TE>   "This club is full of demons and they must be chased away," Coach
Miroslav Blazevic told the Zagreb newspaper Vecernji List. "The
priest would travel with us everywhere; he would be at the players'
disposal all the time so they don't need to go to church."</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni on Edge</TE>
<TE>   Franco Carraro, president of the Italian soccer federation,
announced that he has ordered a thorough review of the entire
national team program, including the future of Coach Giovanni
Trapattoni, in the wake of Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifying loss to
Wales.</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni has refused to step down, telling Italian reporters
Friday that such action would be "as though you journalists decided
to resign after writing three bad articles."</TE>

<HD>UCLA, Cal Are Left With Empty Feeling</HD>
<DH>Despite high-scoring offenses, sparse attendance is
expected at game that conflicts with World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERKELEY -- It's the SoCal vs. NoCal matchup nobody is talking about.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of rally monkeys, there will be caricatures of bears.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of a sea of red, there will be empty seats in Strawberry
Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of newfangled noise sticks, there will be the traditional
racket: Marching bands. Chanting cheerleaders. Colliding helmets.</TE>
<TE>   And echoes. Plenty of those.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Stadium will be barely half full for today's game between
UCLA and California, which begins an hour before the Angels and San
Francisco Giants square off in the World Series opener.</TE>
<TE>   The 40,000 or so fans in attendance no doubt would appreciate the
Bears' performing true to form.</TE>
<TE>   That is, scoring in abundance early. Cal (4-3, 1-2) has outscored
opponents, 90-26, in first quarters and 73-29 in second quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that way, everyone can safely start paying attention to
Bonds and Baker and Salmon and Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (4-2, 1-1), of course, has other ideas. If history holds, the
Bruins won't fold if they fall behind early. They scored first in
both of their losses but in only one of their victories.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring, in fact, is the least of either team's problems. This
promises to be another Pac-10 shootout.</TE>
<TE>   First-year Cal Coach Jeff Tedford, the sleep-deprived former
Oregon offensive coordinator, has turbo-charged the Bear offense and
the arm of senior quarterback Kyle Boller.</TE>
<TE>   Cal has scored more touchdowns than any Pac-10 team (34) and
Boller has thrown for 18 of them. Most impressive, Tedford has
invigorated the attack without causing it to become reckless--the
Bears have committed only nine turnovers and hold a
conference-leading plus-13 turnover ratio.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff is a wheeler-dealer," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "He likes
to have fun and throw in some trick plays. I like him. He's a good
friend. He reminds me a lot of me when I was young."</TE>
<TE>   Tedford, 40, is 16 years younger than Toledo, who also cut his
teeth as an Oregon offensive coordinator. But he is so determined to
turn around a program that had become the worst in the conference
that he might be aging fast.</TE>
<TE>   Tedford and several of his assistants sleep at Memorial Stadium
Sunday through Wednesday nights, working until after midnight and
rising at 6 a.m. Some of his offensive brainstorms come during the
middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo drives home every night, but don't be surprised if the old
dog tries tricks of his own.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA scored from 53 yards on a gimmick play against Oregon last
week and Toledo employs some kind of subterfuge every week. A
difference is that Tedford has used gadget plays to score from the
red zone.</TE>
<TE>   "He runs trick plays down there inside the 20," Toledo said. "They
score and score quickly. He'll out-trick me this week."</TE>
<TE>   Cal is extraordinarily successful from close range, scoring on 28
of 29 trips to the red zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff really understands defenses," UCLA defensive coordinator
Phil Snow said. "He finds a way to have three or four different plays
that create problems for you or take advantage of a matchup. And then
they're very good at executing those plays."</TE>
<TE>   Boller completed only 47% of his passes in three years before
Tedford arrived. This season he has connected on 57% for 1,699 yards.
Running back Joe Igber is invigorated as well, already rushing for
582 yards after gaining only 399 during an injury-plagued 2001
season.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround from last season's 1-10 record could become the
biggest one-year flip since a 2-7 record in 1946 was followed by a
9-1 mark in Coach Pappy Waldorf's first season.</TE>
<TE>   At this point last year, the Bears were 0-7, losing by an average
score of 45.7 to 17.5. UCLA beat them, 56-17, with Boller out because
of an injury.</TE>
<TE>   This year Cal is outscoring opponents, 38.7 to 26.4. The losses,
by a total of 14 points, are to Air Force, Washington State and USC,
all currently in the top 20. And the Bears beat then-No. 15 Michigan
State and then-No. 12 Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The talent here was better than I realized," Tedford said. "And
we are playing better together. Offense, defense and special teams,
all three phases are going well. The team is like a family, and that
is different than what happened in the past."</TE>

<LD>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins should not have trouble moving the ball against a Cal
defense that ranks last in the Pacific 10. But sacks, penalties and
conservative play-calling have plagued them in the red zone. Against
Oregon last week, UCLA moved inside the 30-yard line on its last
three drives, yet did not score. Expect Coach Bob Toledo to try
something imaginative when his team nears the goal line. Quarterback
Cory Paus had three passes intercepted last week and must be wary of
Bear cornerback Jemeel Powell, who has picked off five passes. UCLA
tailback Tyler Ebell, who has rushed for 323 yards in two games,
could have another big game because Cal gives up an average of 135.9
yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Cal is the most economical team in the Pac-10, ranking first in
scoring despite being only ninth in offense. The Bears have scored in
28 of 29 forays into the red zone, mostly through the air. Senior
quarterback Kyle Boller has thrown 18 touchdown passes, and his next
will be the school-record 55th in his career. The scoring passes have
gone to nine receivers, including five each by LaShaun Ward and
Jonathan Makonnen. Tailback Joe Igber is much like Ebell, undersized
with confounding quickness. Igber has rushed for 582 yards and three
touchdowns, averaging 4.3 yards per carry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Being more efficient than Cal in the red zone.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establishing a running attack early and forcing the Bear
cornerbacks to cover wide receivers Craig Bragg and Tab Perry
one-on-one.</TE>
<TE>   3. Not being fooled by Cal Coach Jeff Tedford's inevitable trick
plays.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERKELEY -- Frigid nights at Candlestick Park are warm memories for
UCLA receiver Craig Bragg.</LD>
<LD>   The redshirt sophomore from San Jose has been a San Francisco
Giant fan since his father began taking him to games at the team's
old stadium a decade ago. Bragg vividly recalls the 1993 season when
the Giants won 103 games yet missed out on the playoffs after losing
to the Dodgers on the last day of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "I hated the Dodgers and I hated the Atlanta Braves," Bragg said.
"That was Dusty Baker's first season as manager and Barry Bonds'
first season with the Giants. I was hooked after that."</LD>
<TE>   Bragg can't catch the first game of the World Series because he'll
be catching passes this afternoon at Cal. Neither can his father, who
is one in a contingent of about 25 friends and family members who
will be sitting together at Memorial Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to win in front of my friends from up north,"
Bragg said. "Otherwise, they'll ask me why I went south."</TE>
<TE>   Bragg is coming off a career game against Oregon in which he had
nine catches for 230 yards and three touchdowns. He has 29 catches
this season, equaling his total of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen of his catches in 2001 came in the last two games, so
over the last eight games he is averaging nearly six catches a game.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the Bruins' top scoring threat with seven touchdowns,
six of at least 33 yards. But as soon as the game is over he will
want to know how the major leagues' top home run threat -- Bonds --
and his team is doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have people tell me about it right after we're finished
playing," he said. "I'm pulling for the Giants all the way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only about 40,000 tickets have been sold, fewer than the
anticipated 45,000. Although this will be Cal's largest crowd so far
this season, Bear officials are disappointed because it is homecoming
as well as the team's only home date in October.</TE>
<TE>   Cal is last in the Pacific 10 Conference in attendance, averaging
28,248.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jeff Tedford is adjusting to the apathy after serving four
years as offensive coordinator at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different, no question," he said. "In Eugene, it's all over
the front page every day."</TE>

<HD>Trojans Looking to Show Off Their Better Half</HD>
<DH>USC, 4-2 at midway point of schedule, wants to turn it up
down the stretch, starting today against Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC was a second-half team during the first half of its schedule.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans won in the final minutes against Auburn, never let up
after the break against Colorado, threatened until the final seconds
against Kansas State, clamped down on Oregon State, came up just
short against Washington State and overcame California.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans have emerged 4-2 overall, 2-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference and ranked 19th in the Associated Press poll.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll and his players say the Trojans need faster
starts and a streak of more convincing finishes as they begin the
second half of their schedule today against No. 22 Washington (4-2,
1-1).</TE>
<TE>   "We need to start playing with more consistency," defensive end
Kenechi Udeze said.</TE>
<TE>   A victory over the Huskies would keep USC in the race for its
first Pac-10 title since 1995. A loss would all but eliminate the
Trojans from contention.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are looking to repeat last season's second half, when
they won their last five Pac-10 games. That will be a challenge for a
team that has won consecutive games only once this season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a must-win for us," senior middle linebacker Mike Pollard
said. "Usually, we play great then come back and lose a close one.
That can't happen. We have to be a championship team every week."</TE>
<TE>   USC faces a Washington team that blew a chance to knock off
Michigan on the road in its opener before playing five consecutive
home games. Cal upset Washington two weeks ago and the Huskies barely
got past Arizona last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We had high expectations at the start of the season, but for some
reason we have not reached those expectations," Coach Rick Neuheisel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, led by quarterback Cody Pickett and wide receiver
Reggie Williams, ranks second in the nation in passing offense at
380.5 yards a game and fourth in total offense at 480.3.</TE>
<TE>   But the Huskies are ninth in rushing at 99.8 yards a game.
Washington has never finished a season averaging fewer than 100 yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't emphasize it enough because we did get enamored with
the ability to throw the ball down the field," Neuheisel said.
"Ultimately, we have to have some guys make some plays."</TE>
<TE>   USC is coming off a 30-28 victory over Cal in which the Trojans
overcame an early 18-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Senior tailback Sultan McCullough, who rushed for 176 yards in a
career-high 39 carries against Cal, is no stranger to Washington.
Last season, McCullough gained 132 yards in 32 carries in the
Trojans' 27-24 loss at Seattle. The Huskies won on a last-second
32-yard field-goal by John Anderson, who has made 12 of 16 field-goal
kicks this season.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, no longer sharing the position with Justin Fargas and
Malaefou Mackenzie, faces a defense that ranks second in the Pac-10
against the run, giving up 85.8 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer passed for 670 yards in the last two
games and will operate against a secondary that is giving up a
conference-worst 281.8 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams will probably make his first
start, replacing senior Kareem Kelly, who will have a reduced role
because of a sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Eric Torres will start at left tackle in place of Jacob
Rogers, who suffered a sprained right knee against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu returns to the starting lineup
for USC's conference-leading defense after having sat out the Cal
game because of a high ankle sprain. Polamalu made 13 tackles and
returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown last year against
the Huskies.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, however, will be without sophomore defensive tackle
Shaun Cody, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against Cal.
Sophomore Mike Patterson moves from nose tackle to Cody's spot and
senior Bernard Riley will play in Patterson's spot.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Marcell Allmond will make his first start at cornerback in
place of redshirt freshman William Buchanon.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans hope to duplicate last week's balanced attack.
Quarterback Carson Palmer is making plays from in and out of the
pocket. With Washington ranked last in the Pac-10 in pass defense
(281.8 yards a game), tailback Sultan McCullough probably won't carry
the ball 39 times again. Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams will
probably start because Kareem Kelly has a sprained right ankle.
Linebackers Ben Mahdavi and Marquis Cooper lead a Husky defense
ranked second in the Pac-10 in rushing defense (85.8).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN WASHINGTON HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cody Pickett leads the conference in passing and is
second in the nation in total offense. Sophomore wide receiver Reggie
Williams has 38 receptions. The Huskies, however, average 99.8 yards
rushing, ninth in the Pac-10. USC leads the conference in total
defense. All-American safety Troy Polamalu, who sat out the last game
because of an ankle sprain, is scheduled to start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Maintain the running game. The Trojans need another solid
effort from the offensive line and tailback Sultan McCullough, who
carried a career-high 39 times for 176 yards and a touchdown last
week against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   2. Neutralize Washington receiver Reggie Williams. Junior Marcell
Allmond moves into the starting lineup at left cornerback and his
main responsibility entails stopping the 6-foot-4, 220-pound
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure Cody Pickett. The front four, despite the loss of tackle
Shaun Cody, must put an effective rush on Washington's quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   4. Avoid penalties. USC had only four against Cal, after a
10-penalty disaster against Washington State.</TE>

<HD>A Tall Order for the Defense</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Pete Carroll spent all of training camp and the first half
of the season trying to find cornerbacks who could match up with the
tall, physical receivers in the Pacific 10 Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans meet the model today when they go against Washington
receiver Reggie Williams, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound sophomore who is on
pace to become the Huskies' all-time leading receiver.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, a freshman All-American last year, has caught 38 passes
for 655 yards and five touchdowns this season.</LD>
<TE>   Last week against Arizona, Williams caught a short pass from
quarterback Cody Pickett with slightly more than two minutes left and
turned it into an 80-yard scoring play that gave Washington a 32-28
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the total package -- size, strength and speed -- and they
do a great job featuring his strengths," USC cornerback Darrell
Rideaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the responsibility for covering Williams probably will
fall on 6-foot junior Marcell Allmond, who is scheduled to make his
first start at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest challenge is staying within my own game," Allmond
said. "I'm not going to worry about [Williams] because that's when
you start doing other stuff you're not supposed to be doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly has caught passes in 41 consecutive
games, one shy of the Pac-10 record set by Dennis Northcutt of
Arizona from 1996 to '99.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly probably won't start because of a sprained right ankle but
will play against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Keenan Howry also enters today's game against Arizona
State with a chance to tie the record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC leads the series against Washington with a 42-26-4 record. The
Trojans, however, have won only three of the last 10 games between
the teams and only once since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of about 55,000 is expected for today's game.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has not played at the Coliseum since 1998 when USC
defeated the Huskies, 33-10, in Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer's
first start.</TE>
<TE>   The teams did not play in 1999 and 2000.</TE>

<HD>Murray Is Certainly Most Valuable King</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You know when you play the Kings, they're never going to give up,"
Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy said.</LD>
<LD>   If the Kings are to break through and advance beyond the
conference semifinals, they will accomplish it not because they have
the most talent but because they are one of the best-coached teams in
the league.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray strongly believes that the NHL's elite are the
teams that work hard and play together every night. It's a simple
philosophy but one that takes awhile to get used to.</LD>
<TE>   This Vince Lombardi approach to coaching has been working for
Murray, who will take his 3-1 Kings into tonight's game against
Vancouver at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his fourth season, Murray and his assistants have used a
system that combines aggressiveness with responsibility to make the
Kings competitive with more talented teams. It's rare to see a King
who does not understand his role, and it's that type of
accountability that has led to implicit trust.</TE>
<TE>   Players trust coaches. Coaches trust players. Players trust each
other. On the ice, the Kings seem to know where everyone is.</TE>
<TE>   Blind passes that used to end up as turnovers are now leading to
goals. That was the case Wednesday night in the Kings' 4-2 victory
over the Mighty Ducks at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 2-2, in the third period and momentum on
Anaheim's side, thanks to a goal by center Steve Rucchin, Mikko
Eloranta, Jason Allison and Ian Laperriere teamed for a Murray-style
goal to give control back to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere got the play started by picking up a loose puck in the
Kings' zone and passing up ice to Eloranta, who skated from in front
of the team bench to the other side of the rink. Allison, making a
head's up move, jumped over the boards into the play, replacing Brad
Chartrand, who skated to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Duck defensemen Fredrik Olausson and Vitaly Vishnevski failed to
notice Allison's quick line change and skated toward Eloranta, who
made a no-look pass to Allison for the game-winning score.</TE>
<TE>   It was the type of goal well-coached teams make.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings are able to skate around fast and create a quick tempo,
but they always have sight of their positioning," said former King
forward Jim Fox, a veteran color analyst for the team's telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything starts without the puck and the Kings have been able
to break the ice down into three main portions. They defend the
offensive, neutral and defensive zones equally."</TE>
<TE>   Although four games in October have never translated to a Stanley
Cup in June, the Kings have made a statement with their strong play.
They opened with impressive home victories over Phoenix and the
defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, followed with a
tough road win over the Mighty Ducks and a home loss to Colorado on
successive nights this week.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of the Kings' underrated defense, led by captain
Mattias Norstrom, to move the puck quickly to open forwards near or
in the neutral zone has been a major strength.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches always say that they play defense to create offense and
Andy's system incorporates that more than others," Fox said. "In the
defensive zone, the Kings like to play their forwards really high,
not only to get tight coverage on the point but to also create room
offensively when the Kings have the puck."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Kings lost to the Avalanche on Thursday, 4-1, they
were not beaten at full strength because forwards Ziggy Palffy and
Bryan Smolinski did not play because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   To make up for their lack of a dominant player, like Peter
Forsberg, Mario Lemieux or Nicklas Lidstrom, the Kings execute little
wrinkles that give them an edge.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings are able to cut down the room opposing teams have to
operate with the puck and they do this with strong backchecking by
their forwards while having their [defensemen] stand up," Fox said.
"A lot of teams try this but the Kings do an excellent job of closing
the gap on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of good coaching is player improvement.</TE>
<TE>   And the Kings have had plenty of that under Murray.</TE>
<TE>   For every veteran like Steve Heinze, who failed to produce and is
now in the minors, there are two like defensemen Jaroslav Modry and
Mathieu Schneider, who have gone from journeymen to quality players
in less than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Modry and Schneider are not alone. Felix Potvin, Adam Deadmarsh,
Eric Belanger, Laperriere and Eloranta are just some of the players
playing the best hockey of their careers under Murray.</TE>
<TE>   But he hasn't done it alone. Assistant Mark Hardy played a major
role in the development of Modry, Heinze and Philippe Boucher (signed
to a multiyear free-agent deal with Dallas during the off-season).
Assistants John Van Boxmeer, former coach of the Long Beach Ice Dogs,
and Ray Bennett have been solid in working with the players
individually.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how well the Kings play as a team, however, they will
not be considered a legitimate Stanley Cup contender because their
overall talent level is a notch below that of some other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the most talented team doesn't always win the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Murray knows this as well as anyone and that's why he stresses
preparation.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing for sure is that the Kings will never lose a game
because they are not ready to play," Fox said. "It's a great thing to
see because that's the way hockey is supposed to be played."</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Music Makes the Monkey Jump Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's his song, and it's as much a part of this World Series as
peanuts and Cracker Jack. As 45,000 people jump around at Edison
Field, wildly saluting the arrival of the rally monkey on the video
board, it's his catchy music that accompanies the monkey business.</LD>
<LD>   The song: "Jump Around," performed by House of Pain, a top-10
single in 1992. Everlast, now a noted solo artist, wrote the song
during his days with the group.</LD>
<LD>   An artist could not buy better publicity for a song, especially a
decade-old song. But Everlast, born in New York, is a lifelong fan of
the Yankees. The Angels whipped the Yankees in the first round of the
playoffs, and every time Everlast saw the monkey -- and heard his
song -- he got hopping mad.</LD>
<TE>   "During that series, I hated the rally monkey," he said. "I wanted
to strangle him."</TE>
<TE>   With the Yankees dismissed from the playoffs, Everlast can now
admit he finds the monkey shtick "hilarious." He lives in Los Angeles
and hopes to attend one of the games in Anaheim this weekend,
laughing that a silly old song has become a soundtrack in the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lucky to write one of those songs that sticks around
forever," he said. "It's not an emotionally deep song. It's just good
for making people go nutty."</TE>

<HD>Puckett Facing Criminal Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett was charged Friday in
Minneapolis with dragging a woman into a restaurant bathroom last
month and grabbing her breast.</LD>
<LD>   The woman had bruises, and her ankle was swollen from hitting a
door frame, according to the criminal complaint, which cited several
witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   The former Minnesota Twin star was charged with a felony count of
false imprisonment and a gross misdemeanor count of criminal sexual
conduct.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, the 41-year-old Puckett probably would be put on
probation and given less than a year in the county workhouse,
according to County Attorney Amy Klobuchar. She said it's unlikely he
would be sentenced to the legal maximum of four years in prison and
$8,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason Kirby Puckett was charged today is because he is
a famous person," said Chris Madel, one of Puckett's attorneys. "If
this were anybody else, this case would have never seen the light of
day. We will meet and we will beat these allegations in court."</TE>
<TE>   Klobuchar strongly denied that Puckett is being treated
differently from anyone else and said as far as she's concerned, he
was merely a guy in a bar who broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think that it will be a challenging trial because many
jurors will know Mr. Puckett," she added. "In the end, we have faith
that the Minnesota jury will be fair and base a decision on the facts
and on the evidence, and not on who he is."</TE>
<TE>   Puckett was not present at a brief hearing Friday. He was summoned
to report to the county jail for formal booking Monday. He won't have
to post the $20,000 bail prosecutors initially sought unless he fails
to report. A date for his next hearing has not been set.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are the latest blow to the image of a man who had been
one of the state's most respected sports figures.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett's wife, Tonya, filed for divorce in February, about two
months after she told police he threatened to kill her during an
argument. He denied making such a threat, and prosecutors didn't
charge him. The Pucketts reached a tentative settlement this month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Piniella was given permission to talk to the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, who reached a deal Friday with the Seattle Mariners on
compensation for the manager.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners wouldn't say what they would get if the Devil Rays
hire Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to comment on any of the players who are involved
in the transaction," Mariner General Manager Pat Gillick said by
phone in a conference call from Peoria, Ariz., where the team is
holding organizational meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not comment on anything," Gillick said when asked if there
was money involved in the possible deal. "All I will say is Tampa Bay
stepped up and they were very aggressive. They were the first out of
the chute for Lou."</TE>
<TE>   Devil Ray General Manager Chuck LaMar also declined to discuss the
compensation, citing a confidentiality clause in the agreement with
the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   LaMar spent much of Friday interviewing Oakland bench coach Ken
Macha but conceded that gaining permission to talk to Piniella had
pushed the Tampa native to the top of his wish list.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners agreed this week to release Piniella from the final
year of his three-year contract. The team said it would allow him to
negotiate with other teams, provided they could agree to appropriate
compensation -- players, cash or some combination.</TE>
<TE>   The manager has said he wants to work for a team closer to his
home in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided to put off
retirement and return for one more year.</TE>
<TE>   Stottlemyre said in January that he would quit after this season.
He was diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer in April 2000, and
he underwent stem-cell transplant treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a change shortly after the All-Star break," he said. "My
well-being seemed better with each trip. I was able to handle it a
great deal better in the second half."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wang to Join Team at Monday Workout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers made it official Friday, completing the papers that
enabled center Wang Zhizhi to become their newest player.</LD>
<LD>   Wang will join his new teammates when they return from a
three-exhibition trip, practicing for the first time as a Clipper
during an open workout Monday at 6 p.m. at Staples Center. Admission
is free.</LD>
<LD>   Wang, who is from China, spent most of the last six months in Los
Angeles, awaiting a move that would get him out of Dallas and into a
Clipper or Laker uniform. He signed a three-season offer sheet worth
$6 million with the Clippers on Oct. 2. The Mavericks declined to
match the offer sheet so Wang became a Clipper on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of teams were interested in him, but L.A. was the place he
wanted to be," said Jeff Schwartz, Wang's agent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy it's finally done," Elgin Baylor, Clipper general
manager, said before the team's 98-91 exhibition loss to the Bulls at
Chicago. "We feel he'll be a positive addition to our team. There are
a lot of things I like about him ... his size and his ability to run
the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Wang, at 7 feet 1, 275 pounds, also is an excellent outside
shooter. His low-post game needs work.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor envisions Wang as a backup to center Michael Olowokandi and
power forward Elton Brand, but also said fans could see Wang,
Olowokandi and Brand on the floor together on occasion. Olowokandi
and Brand have been sidelined for all of the Clippers' six
exhibitions because of knee injuries and their status for the season
opener Oct. 30 against the Cleveland Cavaliers is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives us more options," Baylor said of Wang. "I would like to
see them all play together, but it's up to the coach [Alvin Gentry].
Teams will have a heck of a time matching up against that size."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Not Suited for Leading Role</HD>
<DH>Anaheim lets advantage slip away with about five minutes
left in third period, settles for 2-2 tie with Canucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Point taken.</LD>
<LD>   Point lost.</LD>
<LD>   Whether this was a turning point for the Mighty Ducks will be
known shortly.</LD>
<TE>   The short story is the Ducks ended a three-game losing streak with
a 2-2 tie against Vancouver on Friday in front of an announced 11,287
at the Arrowhead Pond. The longer tale involved a flat start by the
Ducks, followed by their letting a 2-1 lead slip away with about five
minutes left in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   So they settled for a point. Paul Kariya scored two goals. Steve
Rucchin had two assists. The Ducks pressured goalie Dan Cloutier in
overtime with six quality scoring chances. He turned them all away,
except for Niclas Havelid's shot that hit the post.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't bad for the Ducks, especially with Colorado coming to
town Sunday and a five-game trip following. After a 1-3 start,
getting a point was a relief.</TE>
<TE>   "The effort was better," Coach Mike Babcock said. "But the third
period showed how fragile we are as a team right now. We didn't put
our foot on the gas."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Todd Bertuzzi came from behind the net and managed to
bank a shot off goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, tying the score, 2-2,
14 minutes 54 seconds into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened," Giguere said. "All I felt was the
puck hit my pants. But we got a point. Now we have to try to do
more."</TE>
<TE>   That was made clear by Babcock after the Ducks' 4-2 loss to the
Kings on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "For two years now, we have been out of it after 20 games,"
Babcock said. "It's amazing the pressure comes off you and everyone
says, 'Oh you finished strong.' Well, everyone else is fighting for
their life in the playoffs, you're loose. We don't want to be out of
it after 20 games."</TE>
<TE>   Little seemed to have changed Friday, when the Ducks turned the
puck over in their own end, which led to a Bertuzzi goal 1:46 into
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Kariya can't come to my house every day and say, 'Freddy get
ready,' " defenseman Fredrik Olausson said. "It's up to every
individual to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   That includes Kariya and Adam Oates, both of whom have struggled
this season. Kariya had one goal and Oates one assist before Friday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been pressing a little bit," Kariya said. "I had a lot of
quality scoring chances. With the new additions here, we wanted to
get off to a good start. We didn't get off to a good start. But the
chances are there, so it will come."</TE>
<TE>   There seemed no better marriage than Kariya and Oates, who was
signed as a free agent. Kariya, the deadly shot, Oates, the amazing
passer, seemed offensive Ice Capades in the making. For now, though,
a trial separation was needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to alleviate the pressure on those two guys, so we
separated them," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Oates centered a line with Petr Sykora and Andy McDonald, while
Steve Rucchin took Oates' spot on the top line with Kariya and Mike
Leclerc.</TE>
<TE>   The move paid off. Kariya got the Ducks even with the help of
Rucchin with 32 seconds left in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes a little thing like change the lines is all it takes to
light a fire," Rucchin said. "It was a wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin set Kariya up again on a power play in the second period
that gave the Ducks a 2-1 lead.</TE>

<HD>Rookie Chistov Returns to Lineup</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to find the right combinations, Coach Mike Babcock returned
rookie Stanislav Chistov to the lineup Friday night against
Vancouver, skating him on the third line with Matt Cullen and Alexei
Smirnov.</LD>
<LD>   Chistov had a goal and four points while Smirnov had a goal and
two points in the season-opening victory over St. Louis, but Chistov
sat out Wednesday's loss to the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Babcock met with Chistov and Smirnov, who is also a rookie, Friday
morning. "I told them we haven't won since they carried us, so it's
time to step up fellas," Babcock said.</LD>
<TE>   Not that there's any pressure on Chistov, 19, and Smirnov, 20.</TE>
<TE>   Said Paul Kariya: "Both of the kids are pretty loosey-goosey. They
are enjoying themselves here. They have some serious skill out there.
Being their first year, obviously consistency will be an issue.
Hopefully by the second half they'll ... be consistent producers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Canadiens are interested in acquiring left wing Denny
Lambert, who was designated for assignment by the Ducks before the
season, hockey sources said. However, the Canadiens are likely to
wait to see if Lambert accepts a buyout from the Ducks on his
contract, which would pay him $550,000 this season and $600,000 next
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens are in need of an enforcer because Gino Odjick is on
an indefinite leave of absence. Lambert had two goals, seven points
and 213 penalty minutes with the Ducks last season.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds, in a lengthy media session Friday,
said he and Jeff Kent complement each other the way Scottie Pippen
and Michael Jordan did, the way Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
did, and Bonds must not have been referring to that uncomplimentary
June 25 incident in San Diego, when his meaty hands gripped Kent's
neck as if it were a Louisville Slugger.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Dusty Baker, taking the analogy a step further, compared
the sometimes-stormy, sometimes-respectful, never-a-dull-mo- ment
relationship between Bonds and Kent to "The Defiant Ones," the 1958
movie starring Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.</LD>
<LD>   "Both are handcuffed, the one guy wants to throw the other guy off
the cliff, and he realizes, 'Oh man, if he goes, I go too,' " Baker
said. "I will urge everybody to get that movie. They end up being
cool and being partners at the end. This has been a while, quite a
transformation for both of them, actually. They're both great
ballplayers, and they're both better together than apart."</LD>
<TE>   When told of Baker's remarks, Kent, who will be a free agent after
the series, sent notice to any Hollywood types looking to develop the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "For all those screenplay writers out there, I think Barry and I
could play ourselves," Kent said. "People have made such a big deal
about our relationship, our ups and down, but look at us: We've
played well together, and now we have a chance to be world
champions."</TE>
<TE>   Kent, who hit .313 with 37 home runs and 108 runs batted in during
the regular season but has struggled with a .263 average, one RBI and
11 strikeouts in the postseason, is a key to the Giant offense
because the No. 3 hitter bats ahead of Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If Jeff's hot and getting on base, that's going to help Barry
because the pitcher is going to go from the stretch," Baker said.
"Hopefully, we can get not only Jeff but our leadoff hitter on base.
The more runners you have on base, the better chance you have of them
pitching to Barry."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, Kent said, too much emphasis is placed on Kent and Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is good enough to not need me, and I'm good enough to not
need him; what we do need is the guys in this locker room," Kent
said. "The reason we're National League champions is these guys have
played good baseball. This, more than any team I've been on, has
players who complement each other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baker chose his rotation for the series -- Jason Schmidt in Game 1
tonight, Russ Ortiz in Game 2, Livan Hernandez in Game 3 and Kirk
Rueter in Game 4 -- with a possible Game 7 in mind. If the series
goes the distance, Baker would have Hernandez, his big-game pitcher,
for Game 7 on regular rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Livo could handle that situation better than anyone," Baker said
of Hernandez, who helped the Florida Marlins win the 1997 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Baker didn't announce his final series roster Friday, but the most
likely candidate for designated hitter tonight is Shawon Dunston.</TE>
<TE>   Or Baker could start center fielder and leadoff batter Kenny
Lofton at DH and use the right-handed Tsuyoshi Shinjo in center.</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo is a better defensive player than Lofton and hit .291
against left-handers this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bonds in left nor Lofton has an above-average throwing
arm, and one key to the series could be how much success the
aggressive Angel baserunners have going from first to third on
singles and scoring from second on hits.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret of stopping a team from going first to third is not
throwing them out necessarily," Baker said. "It's how you charge the
ball and play the ball to stop them from running in the first place."</TE>

<HD>Krone Says She Will Resume Riding Career</HD>

<LD>Julie Krone was reminded of the Al Pacino line from the third
"Godfather" film.</LD>
<LD>   "You know the one," Krone said. " 'Every time I try to get out,
they keep dragging me back in.' "</LD>
<LD>   Dragging Krone back into race riding is her unquenchable love for
the horse. So on Friday, more than three years after she quit the
game, the Hall of Fame jockey -- and the only woman ever enshrined at
Saratoga Springs, N.Y. -- said that she'd be making a comeback,
either later this month at Santa Anita or when the Hollywood Park
meet opens Nov. 6.</LD>
<TE>   Inevitably, they'll need to redo her bronze plaque in upstate New
York, the one that said she retired April 11, 1999, with 3,545 wins,
a record for a female rider. The No. 2 jockey on that list, the
still-active Patti Cooksey, trails Krone by about 1,400 wins.</TE>
<TE>   A lot has happened to Krone, 39, in the last few years. Her
mother, Judi Krone, who introduced her daughter to a Shetland pony
before she was 5, died after a long battle with cancer. Julie Krone,
whose earlier marriage had broken up, was married again, to Jay
Hovdey, a columnist for the Daily Racing Form. Krone became a
California TV personality, working for Fox, Television Games Network
(TVG) and Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Krone couldn't keep from climbing on horses, and she galloped
them in the morning for trainer Richard Mandella the last two summers
at Del Mar. More recently, she has been exercising the horses of
Laura De Seroux, another trainer, at the San Luis Rey Downs training
center in Bonsall, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "I got on five or six horses one morning," Krone said, "and I said
to myself, 'Hey, this is still really fun.' That's when it hit me
that I ought to be out there again."</TE>

<LD>Year in and year out, Crenshaw's football team is known for playing
tough defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Cougars displayed that Friday afternoon in their Coliseum
League opener against Jefferson, intercepting four passes and holding
the Democrats to 72 yards in a 41-14 victory at Crenshaw.</LD>
<LD>   Led by defensive linemen Brandon Mebane and Jamal Scott and
linebackers Aaron Huntley, Solomon Eliminian and Brandon Turner,
Crenshaw held Jefferson to minus 14 yards rushing and no offensive
touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just starting to come around defensively, especially after
holding San Pedro to one touchdown last week," said Daymeion Hughes,
who had two interceptions and held Jefferson's Gary White to one
catch for five yards.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson (3-3, 0-1) stunned the Cougars when Travis Lee returned
a punt 94 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Good fortune smiled on the Cougars (3-3, 1-0) when Christopher
Porter recovered quarterback Andrew Simpson's fumble in the end zone
to tie the score, 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   Then right before halftime, Crenshaw marched 71 yards in 10 plays.
Fullback Dary Adway scored on a one-yard run to finish the drive with
four seconds left in the second quarter. Adway added an eight-yard
touchdown run in the second half and finished with 53 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, moved to running back in last week's 7-6 loss to San
Pedro, led the Cougars with 132 yards in 24 carries, including an
eight-yard run to finish the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson completed 12 of 22 passes for 146 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson's other touchdown came on a 72-yard kickoff return by
Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt 41, Jordan 12 -- Zach Owens rushed for 204 yards and
three touchdowns and the Rough Riders held host Jordan to 19
first-half yards in the Eastern League opener for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan (3-3, 0-1) pulled to within 20-12 midway through the third
quarter on a two-yard run by quarterback Naquan Walker. Walker was
sacked four times thereafter and finished with minus 44 yards in 16
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Owens scored his second touchdown of the game on an 11-yard run
with 3:48 left in the third quarter and capped his efforts with a
14-yard scoring run with 7:55 left for a 35-12 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jody Adewale and Chris Hurtido each rushed for 137 yards and one
touchdown for Roosevelt (5-1, 1-0), which outgained the Bulldogs, 358
yards to 32, on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Mayar Zokaei</TE>
<TE>   Gardena 29, San Pedro 20 -- LaFerrell Payne rushed for 103 yards
and one touchdown in 12 carries to lead host Gardena (4-2, 1-0) to a
Marine League victory over the Pirates (3-3, 0-1). Oscar Cervantes
kicked field goals of 40, 33 and 30 yards.</TE>

<HD>Riddle Wins Eligibility Appeal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt; Martin Henderson; Dan Loumena</AU>
<BD>From Staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hardship-eligibility appeal filed on behalf of girls' water polo
player Alison Riddle, who transferred last summer from San Bernardino
to Riverside Poly High, was approved Thursday by the Southern
Section.</LD>
<LD>   Riddle, a junior, left San Bernardino over concerns about exposure
to asbestos at the school. Riddle's family believes the asbestos
caused an older sister, Adriane, to contract lung cancer last year.
Section officials originally accepted the hardship-eligibility
request under the condition Riddle attend a school in the San
Bernardino Unified School District, section spokesman Thom Simmons
said.</LD>
<LD>   When she failed to meet that requirement by enrolling at Riverside
Poly, which is located in the Riverside Unified School District, the
section ruled she was not eligible to compete in water polo or
swimming this school year.</LD>
<TE>   Riddle, her mother, Anita Riddle, and their attorney met with
section officials Wednesday in an effort to change the conditions of
her transfer. Simmons said a panel found "compelling reasons" to
grant immediate eligibility to Riddle.</TE>
<TE>   The Riddles said they preferred Poly because it's near the home of
Anita's parents. Anita also said the family worried there would be
asbestos problems at other schools in the San Bernardino district.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Riddle, a first-team All-Southern Section Division V
selection in water polo last season, needed a hardship waiver because
her transfer occurred after May 15, the cutoff date for athletic
eligibility set by the California Interscholastic Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Adriane Riddle graduated from San Bernardino High in 2000, earning
a water polo scholarship to San Jose State. In May 2001, she was
diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer. The lung was removed and
she underwent chemotherapy. She now attends Cal State San Marcos and
has been cancer free since last spring, Anita said.</TE>

<TE>   Covina South Hills football player Manuel Aguilar left County-USC
Medical Center early Friday with his parents after a battery of tests
revealed he had suffered a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar, 17, a senior defensive back and running back for South
Hills, sought the team trainer after a punt return in the first half
of South Hills' 30-7 loss to Hacienda Heights Los Altos. He left the
locker room on a stretcher in the third quarter, but showed marked
improvement in the ambulance during transport, according to his
mother, Elaine.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I understand, he didn't totally pass out but was very
lethargic, and he didn't remember anything from the last play to when
he got to the hospital," said Elaine Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors told the Aguilars that Manuel could return in a month, but
his parents said they have decided to keep their son out for the rest
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks quarterback Chris Owens has been declared
ineligible, and the Lancer football team will have to forfeit a
season-opening victory to Crescenta Valley as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Owens transferred from Simi Valley Grace Brethren to Thousand Oaks
last spring, but his family continued to maintain a residence in Simi
Valley as well as renting an apartment in Thousand Oaks. According to
Marmonte League rules, a student-athlete can compete only if the
family resides within the school district.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Ben Mauk of Kenton High threw for 469 yards Friday night to break the
national high school career passing yardage record.</LD>
<LD>   Mauk needed 215 yards to break the record, and he threw for 293
yards in the first half. He completed 24 of 37 passes for four
touchdowns and ran for a score as Kenton (7-2) beat Ottawa-Glandorf,
33-32.</LD>
<LD>   His career total of 14,712 yards broke the mark of 14,457 yards,
which was set from 1995-98 by J.R. House of Nitro, W.Va.</LD>
<TE>   Mauk has thrown for 3,718 yards and 42 touchdowns this season. He
set a national single-season record of 5,770 yards passing last year
-- breaking House's 1998 mark of 5,526 -- and threw a state-record 60
touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   He has committed to Wake Forest.</TE>

<HD>Loyola Gets a Rude Greeting</HD>
<DH>Second-ranked Cubs fall in their Serra League debut, 28-10,
to No. 14 Mater Dei as Rice runs for 151 yards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the Serra League, Los Angeles Loyola High.</LD>
<LD>   Tailback Rafael Rice and the Santa Ana Mater Dei Monarchs might
like you to stick around a while if you continue to sputter like you
did in your league debut Friday, a 28-10 loss before about 4,000 at
East L.A. College.</LD>
<LD>   The Cubs, No. 2 in The Times' rankings, struggled to move the ball
and failed to contain Rice, who rushed for 151 yards and a touchdown
against his former team.</LD>
<TE>   "It meant a lot," said Rice, a senior who left Loyola after his
sophomore year. "It was a great feeling to come back and beat them.
They were talking a lot about me after I left."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei sophomore quarterback Jason Forcier threw for two
touchdowns and ran for another as the No. 14 Monarchs (5-1, 1-0)
sprinted to a 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter and were
never threatened. He completed nine of 14 passes for 174 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei controlled the line of scrimmage and made the big plays
while easily withstanding the pressure of being an underdog.</TE>
<TE>   "We were prepared to play," Monarch Coach Bruce Rollinson said.
"My coaching staff worked hours in preparation for this game. We had
a shot if we eliminated mistakes, and that's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei committed only one turnover--a Forcier pass was
intercepted in the end zone late in the second quarter--while
amassing 370 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   After holding Loyola (5-1, 0-1) on its first possession, the
Monarchs took over at their own 49-yard line and drove for a
touchdown, capped by Forcier's seven-yard run. Mater Dei got the ball
at the 50 on its next possession and went ahead, 14-0, on the first
play of the second quarter when Forcier connected with Nathan
Gunderman on a seven-yard touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Forcier found Corey Boudreaux streaking toward the end zone for a
65-yard touchdown pass play midway through the second quarter as the
Monarchs went ahead, 21-0.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei appeared to be on the verge of a blowout when it drove
to the Loyola 17 on its next possession, but Forcier overthrew
Boudreaux in the end zone and the pass was intercepted by defensive
back Quintin Daniels. The Cubs drove to the Mater Dei 31, where
Andrew Kearney kicked a 49-yard field goal with two seconds left in
the half.</TE>
<TE>   Rice scored his touchdown after cutting outside on an 11-yard run
late in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to come back and prove to the people that we were for
real," said Rice, perhaps alluding to Mater Dei's first two games,
when it struggled to beat Orange Lutheran and lost to Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola scored its touchdown with three seconds left in the game,
when reserve quarterback Scott Deke--who replaced ineffective starter
Adam Gonzalez late in the second quarter--scored on a one-yard
keeper.</TE>

<DH>Once a powerhouse, Servite appears to be recapturing its
tradition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The poem always begins with the same line: We are the men of Servite.</LD>
<LD>   It's simple and direct and conveys a world of meaning to anyone
who has attended Anaheim Servite High.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Toner, football coach at Servite, composes a poem each
season. Every couple of weeks he adds a new line based on his
assessment of the team.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, with 18 juniors starting, Toner wrote about
inexperience: We are eager and we are young and sometimes we get
stung. The Friars went 5-4-1 and missed the Southern Section
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the poem encompasses the strength, domination and glory
by those who cloak themselves in the black-and-white uniforms of
Servite: Dreadnaughts of crushing power, who the black and white
ensoul. Victory is but our way of life, God is our source and our
goal.</TE>
<TE>   This season, victory has been their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Just as it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   Servite, a major-division power during the 1970s and '80s, faded
into mediocrity during the '90s but has had a resurgence this season.
The Friars, ranked No. 13 by The Times and No. 6 in Division I,
opened Serra League play Friday night with a 37-20 victory at La
Puente Bishop Amat and improved to 6-0, their best start since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule, which has included victories over Lawndale Leuzinger
(35-14), Orange Lutheran (34-3), Tustin (28-7), Long Beach Wilson
(41-12) and Huntington Beach Edison (32-7), doesn't get any easier.
But despite playing in the recently revamped and high-powered Serra
League, which includes No. 2 Santa Margarita, No. 7 Los Angeles
Loyola and No. 14 Santa Ana Mater Dei, the general thinking at
Servite is that the glory days are back.</TE>
<TE>   The team has plenty of size -- 6-foot-3, 265-pound Ryan Kalil and
6-3, 275-pound Sean Estrada lead the way -- and speed -- receiver
Matt Slater was the Southern Section Division III champion in the 100
and 200 meters last spring and defensive back Darryl Williams can run
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rubalcaba (386 yards) and Chris Blanco (227) make a
formidable 1-2 punch at running back, and quarterback Ryan Coffelt,
who completed eight of 12 passes for 193 yards against Bishop Amat,
has a strong arm and enough speed to have qualified for the Southern
Section finals in the 100 hurdles during track season.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Coffelt has completed 53 of 82 passes for 1,093
yards and nine touchdowns with four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the offense, the strength of the team might be its
defense. Servite has given up only 63 points in six games -- only 30
have been given up by the first-team defense.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, Bishop Amat trailed, 17-13, early in the second
half, but Servite's defense forced two turnovers and the offense
converted both into scores.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat got a late touchdown to become the first Servite
opponent this season to score more than 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Servite also has loads of experience -- those 18 juniors who
started last year have all returned.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we can be the best team ever at Servite," linebacker
Dillon Bedard said. "All we think about is going undefeated. We don't
want one loss."</TE>
<TE>   Going undefeated, of course, means beating Mater Dei. The last
time Servite did that was also 1988. The Servite-Mater Dei rivalry is
among the fiercest in Southland football. It began in 1961, the year
after Servite fielded its first varsity team, and has been renewed
every year since.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei leads the series, 25-14, and there have been two ties,
including a scoreless finish in 1992. That's the closest Servite has
come to winning in the last 13 games. They meet again Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We try not to look too far ahead, but it's hard not to think
about Mater Dei," Kalil said. "But we think this is the team to end
the streak. Our attitude isn't if we are going to beat them, but how
bad we are going to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   The football tradition at Servite runs deep. The Friars played in
the ultra-competitive Angelus League from 1961-91. They won the
league title seven times and made the major-division playoffs 20
times, including 17 consecutive years, from 1972-88. In 1982-83,
Servite was top dog in the Southland after winning Southern Section
titles in the Big Five Conference, the top division.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Beuerlein, the Denver Bronco reserve quarterback who led the
NFL with 4,436 yards passing while playing for Carolina in 1999, was
the Servite quarterback in '82. Derek Brown, who had a successful
career at Nebraska and started for the New Orleans Saints in 1993,
was the Servite running back from 1986 to '88.</TE>
<TE>   "The legacy is all around you here," Kalil said. "It's a different
kind of feeling. At first you're like, 'What is this tradition all
about?' Then you go through it and you start to feel a part of the
fraternity."</TE>
<TE>   It's inescapable. Many of the team members have fathers, brothers
or uncles who played at Servite. Four of the assistant coaches are
Servite graduates and two others had sons who went to Servite.</TE>
<TE>   Former football players routinely come back to campus to talk to
the team about the values and discipline they took with them from
Servite.</TE>
<TE>   That's what made the last 13 years so difficult. The Friars won
four league titles in five years from 1994 to '98 and twice played in
Southern Section finals during that span, but that was in Division V
and the Golden West League, a downgrade from the Angelus League and
Division I.</TE>
<TE>   "Our alumni were furious about that," Toner said of the Angelus
League vote to disband in 1991. "We want to play in the top division.
We teach our kids to seek excellence and greatness in all aspects of
their lives. In [the Golden West League], we were bigger and had
better athletes than those other teams. There's no greatness in
winning those games."</TE>
<TE>   The poem is not yet finished. The players expect another line or
two from Toner, but they don't know when it will come. Perhaps the
coach is waiting to see how the team will handle the rest of Serra
League play. Before Friday night, the seniors had not won a league
game at any level.</TE>
<TE>   History indicates Servite will collapse. Last year, the Friars
started 4-0, then were 0-2-1 in league games and missed the playoffs.
In 2000, they started 4-0, went 1-2 in league play and lost in the
first round of the playoffs. In 1999, they started 5-2, went 1-2 in
league and missed the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "People think we're just a preseason team," said Coffelt, the
quarterback. "They think, 'Oh they're good now, but they'll choke.'
Well, we're not going to let that happen. Our goals are a [Southern
Section] championship, a league championship and beating Mater Dei."</TE>
<TE>   What a final verse that would make.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Friars' Path</TE>
<TE>   Servite opened the season 5-0 for the first time since 1988, which
was also the last time the Friars beat Mater Dei. Here's a look at

<LD>Moorpark scored two touchdowns in the game's final 1 minute 25
seconds to take over a close contest and roll past Simi Valley Royal,
35-14, in a Marmonte League game Friday night at Royal.</LD>
<LD>   Cody Holland's 81-yard interception return for a touchdown with 20
seconds to play gave Moorpark (6-0 overall, 3-0 in league) its final
margin of victory and came 65 seconds after wide receiver Dennis
Pitta caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Eddie Garcia on a
third-and-20 play.</LD>
<LD>   Pitta's catch capped a nine-play, 80-yard drive that followed Cory
Swenson's interception of a Kyle Uebelhardt pass intended for Nick
Pinneri. Pinneri was open for a moment, but Swenson tipped the ball
and came down with it in the back of the end zone.</LD>
<TE>   Uebelhardt had passed for 1,311 yards and 14 touchdowns in the
first five games of the season but was only 16 of 46 for 189 yards
against a strong Moorpark defense that had four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia completed 10 of 19 passes for 204 yards and three
touchdowns and running back Anthony Lopez gained 106 yards in 16
carries for Moorpark, No. 9 in the Southern Section Division IV
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley 35, Highland 6 -- Johnny Walker rushed for two
touchdowns and passed for another to lead the Antelopes (5-1, 1-0) in
a Golden League opener at Highland.</TE>
<TE>   Walker scored on runs of 29 and 14 yards in the first quarter and
Antelope Valley took a 20-0 lead only 8 minutes 30 seconds into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Walker completed a 23-yard pass play to Eric Wickliffe for a
touchdown to make the score 28-6 with 1:04 left in the half, one play
after Wickliffe intercepted a pass by Highland quarterback Gary
Rosales.</TE>
<TE>   Walker finished with 70 yards rushing and completed three of five
passes for 38 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley, No. 4 in Division III, also got 51 yards in 11
carries from Aaron Wilson and Sean Wallace contributed 48 yards in
two carries, including a 49-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Theus rushed for 76 yards in 22 carries for Highland (4-2,
0-1), No. 9 in Division III, which got its only points when John
Keith scored on a one-yard run with 4:47 to go in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 33, Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 10 -- With
junior tailback Brandon Clayton scoring three first-half touchdowns,
host Notre Dame (6-0, 1-0) opened a 20-3 halftime lead and was never
threatened in its Mission League opener.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul (2-3-1, 0-1) was supposed to offer the Knights their
strongest challenge among the schools left on their regular-season
schedule, but a 10-0 record is looking very possible.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, Notre Dame, is receiving dominating play from tackle
Alex Puccinelli, who was offered a scholarship to Oregon last week.
He consistently penetrated into the St. Paul backfield, disrupting
the running game and leaving quarterback Kevin Davies with little
time to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, No. 20 in The Times' rankings and No. 3 in Division
III, had five sacks, including two by Puccinelli, who has 12 on the
season. On offense, quarterback Marcel Marquez is running the option
to perfection. He completed six of seven passes for 59 yards and one
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Weber blocked two punts and Anthony Piedra recovered a
fumbled punt. Clayton rushed for 88 yards in 18 carries and scored on
runs of 13, one and 13 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   La Habra 14, Fullerton 6 -- Quarterback Daniel Morales rushed and
threw for second-quarter touchdowns to help the Highlanders (5-1,
1-0) pick up the victory in a Freeway League opener at La Habra.</TE>
<TE>   Morales scored on a five-yard run with 8:42 left in the half for a
7-0 lead for the Highlanders, No. 2 in Division IX.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Joseph Echaves also scored from five yards out with
two minutes left in the half, but the point-after kick was wide and
Fullerton trailed, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Morales wasted no time, connecting with Tony Magana on a five-yard
pass play for the game's final score as time expired in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Despite four second-half turnovers by La Habra, Fullerton (4-2,
0-1), ranked No. 1 in Division IX, was unable to muster any kind of
offense, gaining less than 50 yards after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Correa carried 23 times for 114 yards for La Habra, and
Morales was 11 of 22 for 121 yards with three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Echaves was 14 of 25 for 147 yards for Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Alai</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 42, Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula 0
-- Michael Okwo rushed for 156 yards and four touchdowns in 14
carries for the Mustangs, who built a 35-0 lead by halftime of a Bay
League opener at Mira Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Dobush completed four of six passes for 98 yards for No. 9
Mira Costa (6-0, 1-0), including a 51-yard pass to Nick Haley on the
first play from scrimmage to set up Okwo's two-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Haley caught three passes for 82 yards, intercepted a pass and
returned a punt 50 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Okwo's 46-yard touchdown run with 6:02 left in the half gave Mira
Costa, No. 1 in the Division III rankings, a 28-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Peninsula (4-2, 0-1), No. 10 in Division III, recovered an Okwo
fumble at the Mustang 12-yard line, but Gregory McIver intercepted a
pass by Panther quarterback Richard Haynes and returned it 97 yards
for a touchdown on the final play of the half.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Munde rushed for 92 yards in 22 carries for Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Covina Charter Oak 45, Hacienda Heights Wilson 14 -- Two
three-yard scoring runs by running back Aaron Capers got the host
Chargers off to a good start and they never looked back in a
Miramonte League opener.</TE>
<TE>   Capers scored with 1 minute left in the first quarter and again 4
1/2 minutes later to give No. 21 Charter Oak (5-1) a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Silva's one-yard scoring run followed his 21-yard
interception return to make it 21-0. Johnny Granger tacked on a
24-yard field goal three seconds before the half and Wilson (3-2-1)
found itself behind, 24-0.</TE>
<TE>   Charger running back Patrick Fuller opened the second-half scoring
with a 48-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Damien 24, Diamond Bar 21 -- Quarterback Nick Davila led
two scoring drives in the game's final 7:19 and Chuck Chijindu kicked
a 25-yard field goal with eight seconds left for the No. 22 Spartans
(5-1, 1-0) in a Sierra League game at Damien.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first victory for Damien, No. 4 in Division II, over
the Brahmas (4-2, 0-1) since the Spartans joined the league in 1998.</TE>

<LD>Although it can't be said with total certainty, Only The Best appears
to be the first winner of Bay Meadows' Malcolm Anderson to be favored
in a stakes race at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   A 2-year-old gelded son of Smokester, owned and bred by Alvin
Toffel and trained by Brian Lynch, Only The Best is the 3-1 choice on
Jeff Tufts' morning line in today's $75,000 Sunny Slope Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The six-furlong Sunny Slope will have nine participants -- after
the Friday morning scratch of Jimmy O -- and Only The Best is one of
five multiple winners in the race.</LD>
<TE>   After beating maidens at 4-5 in his second start at Del Mar, Only
The Best finished sixth in the I'm Smokin, then won the Anderson by
four lengths as the 9-5 second choice. Patrick Valenzuela will ride
the California-bred.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Belmont Park has New York's version of the
California Cup today. There are seven races for New York-breds,
totaling $1 million in purses. The main event is the $250,000 Empire
Classic at 1 1/8 miles. The Classic is the final leg of a $500,000
guaranteed pick four. The other races in the wager are the $125,000
Hudson Handicap at six furlongs, the $150,000 Ticonderoga Handicap at
1 1/8 miles on the turf and the $150,000 Mohawk Handicap, also at 1
1/8 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Victor Espinoza. The jockey won three races Thursday at
Santa Anita with Voladera, A Reel Tizzy and Dream Day.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Goncalino Almeida. The jockey has begun the Oak Tree
meet one of 30.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Rubin's Rose, Darlin Barbie
and A Lil Excess in the seventh, Roll Hennessy Roll, Domestic Dispute
and Hell Cat in the eighth, singling Diamond Hope in the ninth and
Womanonafasttrack and Princess Nicolette in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/34. Money: Previous day/meet

<HD>The Matchup</HD>

<AU>MIKE DIGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wait is over. The journey was 42 years in the making for the
Angels, 13 years for the Giants. And it has been five days since the
last playoff game, plenty of time to examine all things essential to
this Fall Classic, from noise sticks and rally monkeys to the
differences between North and South in the fourth all-California
World Series. On the field, give the Angels the edge at first base,
third base, center field, right field and the bullpen; the Giants the
advantage at catcher, shortstop, second base, left field and starting
pitching. The pick? Angels in six games.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Left field</LD>
<TE>   Barry Bonds (SF) vs. Garret Anderson (Angels): The Giants have the
best hitter of our generation in left, one of only four players in
major league history to have hit 600 home runs, but Anderson is no
slouch. He is one of baseball's most consistent run producers, a
left-handed batter who hits left-handers as well as right-handers,
and a dependable defender. No other player, however, strikes more
fear in the hearts of opposing pitchers and managers than Bonds, who
set major league records this season for walks and intentional walks.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center field</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton (SF) vs. Darin Erstad (Angels): He doesn't steal
bases the way he used to, and his arm is suspect, but Lofton's
resurgence in the last two months of the season, after he was
acquired from the Chicago White Sox on July 28, helped propel the
Giants into the playoffs. Lofton is hitting .293 in the playoffs and
has scored nine runs in 10 games. Erstad, a good gap hitter with home
run power who is as much an offensive catalyst as leadoff batter
David Eckstein, is not the prettiest defender, but he has great
closing speed in the gaps and is fearless when it comes to diving and
crashing into walls.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right field</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders (SF) vs. Tim Salmon (Angels): Salmon is not the
most agile of defenders when he has to go back on balls or deep into
the gap, which could be a problem in Pacific Bell Park, which has a
spacious right-center field alley. After struggling with injuries in
two of the last three seasons, Salmon has seen his power stroke
return, enabling Manager Mike Scioscia to bat him third. Sanders has
great tools -- he runs well, throws well and has good speed and power
-- but he has been in a funk in the playoffs, batting .147 with one
RBI.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third base</TE>
<TE>   David Bell (SF) vs. Troy Glaus (Angels): Bell, who is batting .303
in the playoffs, doesn't have great speed or power, or a rifle for a
throwing arm, but there's a reason he's in the playoffs for the third
consecutive season -- he's a sure-handed defender who makes the plays
he should, and he has delivered clutch hits at the bottom of the
order. Glaus, who is batting .314 with four homers and five RBIs in
the playoffs, has one of baseball's most fluid power strokes, which
enables him to hit home runs to left or right field. He has a quick
defensive first step, despite his size, and one of baseball's
strongest infield arms.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop</TE>
<TE>   Rich Aurilia (SF) vs. David Eckstein (Angels): Aurilia didn't look
very comfortable for most of the season, slumping to a .257 average,
15 homers and 61 RBIs after his breakout 2001 season (.324, 37
homers, 97 RBIs), but he has hit his stride in the playoffs with four
homers and 12 RBIs. Eckstein can be a pest in the leadoff spot --
he'll open the game with a nine- or 10-pitch at-bat that can fluster
an opposing pitcher. He's a great baserunner, and what he lacks in
skill he makes up for in heart.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second base</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent (SF) vs. Adam Kennedy (Angels): Kent hit .313 with 37
homers and 108 RBIs in the regular season but seems to be pressing in
the playoffs (.263, one RBI, 11 strikeouts). If he gets hot, though,
Kent, who is adequate in the field, can carry a club. Kennedy was
Babe Ruth for a day, hitting three homers in the ALCS-clinching
victory over Minnesota, but that was an aberration--he hit only seven
during the regular season. Kennedy has made significant strides
defensively since last season.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First base</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow (SF) vs. Scott Spiezio (Angels): Spiezio's improvement
from the right side -- he hit .368 with six homers and 35 RBIs
against left-handers, up from his previous .241 career average
against them -- was a key component in the Angels' 30-16 record
against left-handers. Spiezio, who is hitting .375 with a
team-leading 11 RBIs in the playoffs, also has improved so much
defensively he is being touted as a Gold Glove candidate. Snow has no
peer defensively -- he's the best in the major leagues, a veteran who
can save as many runs with his glove during a series as he can knock
in. He also has had several timely hits in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitchers</TE>
<TE>   RH Jason Schmidt (SF) vs. LH Jarrod Washburn (Angels) in Game 1;
RH Russ Ortiz (SF) vs. RH Kevin Appier (Angels) in Game 2; RH Livan
Hernandez (SF) vs. RH Ramon Ortiz (Angels) in Game 3; LH Kirk Rueter
(SF) vs. RH John Lackey (Angels) in Game 4: Schmidt was almost
untouchable in the NLCS, giving up one run and four hits in Game 2.
The late action on Washburn's fastball can be tricky and the
left-hander seems unfazed by postseason pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants' staff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catchers</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago (SF) vs. Bengie Molina (Angels): All season, the
37-year-old Santiago has made opponents pay for pitching around Barry
Bonds. Molina has the defensive edge over the strong-armed Santiago,
but he doesn't hit for power, and his lack of speed can clog up the
basepaths.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DH/ Bench</TE>
<TE>   IF Ramon Martinez, OF Tom Goodwin, OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, 3B Pedro
Feliz, C Yorvit Torrealba (SF) vs. IF Benji Gil, 1B Brad Fullmer, IF
Shawn Wooten, C Jose Molina, OF Alex Ochoa, OF Orlando Palmeiro, IF
Chone Figgins (Angels): There is virtually no power on the Giant
bench; Dusty Baker's reserves are slap hitters who run well and, in
Martinez's case, play very good defense. Wooten and Fullmer provide
plenty of power in the DH spot and give Mike Scioscia pinch-hitting
options in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Managers</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Baker (SF) vs. Mike Scioscia (Angels): This could be Baker's
last week as the San Francisco manager, and if he doesn't return, his
players seem determined to send him out a winner. Both Scioscia and
Baker can be unorthodox, calling for a stolen base when few would
expect it, or sending a runner on a full-count pitch to a hitter who
doesn't make consistent contact. Both teams have a loose but
confident air about them, which is a good reflection on their
managers.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Even.</TE>

<LD>The Kings' fast start felt a lot better at 3-0 than at 3-1, their
record after Thursday night's 4-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   "We were devastated by the loss, and I like that," Coach Andy
Murray said Friday, a day off for his players. "I was driving home
last night and they played part of the [postgame] press conference on
the [radio] call-in show. My voice sounded like somebody had shot my
dog....</LD>
<LD>   "We were downright disappointed."</LD>
<TE>   More disappointment may be ahead for the Kings, whose injury list
continues to grow as they prepare to embark Tuesday on one of the
most demanding stretches in franchise history, spending all but four
of 31 days on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy sat out the last two games because of a strained
groin and is listed as day to day. So are Bryan Smolinski and
Jaroslav Bednar, who suffered injuries Thursday night, Smolinski a
charley horse and Bednar a hyper-extended elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller is three weeks away from returning to the
lineup after having abdominal surgery last month.</TE>
<TE>   In case one or more of the forwards are unable to play tonight
against the Vancouver Canucks, Derek Armstrong was flown in Friday
from Manchester, N.H., where he was playing for the Kings' American
Hockey League team.</TE>
<TE>   Activating Armstrong, the last forward cut in training camp, would
necessitate putting another player on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   It probably would be Palffy, who could return for Wednesday
night's game at Detroit, the opener of a five-game trip. If Smolinski
or Bednar were put on injured reserve, neither would be eligible to
return until Friday at New York.</TE>

<HD>Medvedenko Isn't Playing the Angles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These could be trying weeks for Slava Medvedenko, embarking on his
third season with the Lakers and still not totally familiar with Phil
Jackson's offensive system, but the 23-year-old Ukrainian shrugs and
does not admit it.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant recently scowled and wondered how Medvedenko could be
so lost in the triangle offense, and it is not unusual for players to
come off the floor wondering why Medvedenko went right, say, instead
of left. Still, Medvedenko shook his head after a recent practice.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all right," he said slowly, and his eyes held firm.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson doubts it.</TE>
<TE>   "It would bother anybody, any player," he said. "I think it would
bother Slava."</TE>
<TE>   Previously excused because of his youth, lack of college
experience and the language cross-over, Medvedenko signed a two-year
contract in the summer and is finding that it came with a demand to
contribute more to an organization that requires power-forward depth.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen's hamstring injury has given Medvedenko exhibition
playing time he would not ordinarily get, and yet Medvedenko, who
spent the summer caring for his ill father in Ukraine, has again been
slow to "reassociate" with the Lakers' strategies, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Slava has his chance and he's not ready to play, which is
disappointing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Jackson's assistant coaches had a long conversation with
Medvedenko this week, and everyone came away more optimistic. Jackson
believed Medvedenko understood what was expected on the practice
floor and in games, and Medvedenko thanked the unidentified coach,
which Jackson wanted to take as a sign of maturity. Still, there are
potential long-term issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that motivates Slava is yet to be known," Jackson said.
"He seems to be relatively immune to criticism and scolding."</TE>
<TE>   If General Manager Mitch Kupchak were mulling a trade that would
open a roster place for reserve center Soumaila Samake, perhaps a
showcase of Medvedenko or Madsen, when sound, would be the place to
start.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that Shaquille O'Neal's recovery will continue at least
a couple of weeks into the regular season, through games involving
the daunting front lines of San Antonio, Portland twice, Atlanta and
Houston. Kupchak would seem to have little choice but to retain the
7-foot Samake, at least for the early part of the schedule, with
O'Neal on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play an exhibition against the Phoenix Suns tonight in
Las Vegas.... Rick Fox (back) and Robert Horry (knee) practiced
Friday. Brian Shaw (groin) did not and will not play against the
Suns.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Dallas Maverick Coach Don Nelson and assistant Donnie Nelson were
suspended for the season's first two games by the NBA, which also
fined the team $150,000 Friday for contact with players who were
ineligible for the draft.</LD>
<LD>   The Nelsons went to two private workouts in June in Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   It was the ninth time Dallas has been fined (for a total of
$1,155,000) since January 2000, when Mark Cuban bought the team.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the fine and punishment was excessive," said Cuban, who
said the coaches were only observing players, not supervising their
workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban declined to say who the players were.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Del Harris likely will coach the first two games, Oct.
30 at Memphis, and Nov. 2 against Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Angels Relax and Enjoy It</HD>
<DH>Real pressure was when they were trying to clinch playoff
spot, but they have excelled since.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping into the batter's box against San Francisco Giant closer
Robb Nen with the tying run on third base and one out in the bottom
of the ninth inning of a World Series game ... a tense moment for an
Angel? Certainly. A moment of overwhelming pressure and anxiety? Nah.</LD>
<LD>   These Angels have felt stress, but not during the American League
division series against the New York Yankees, and not during the AL
championship series against the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   So why should the World Series against the Giants -- Game 1 will
be played tonight at Edison Field -- be any different for an Angel
team that has been as loose and carefree during this postseason run
as a bunch of neighborhood kids playing stickball in the street?</LD>
<TE>   "I'm surprised I've been able to relax so much during the
playoffs," said Angel right fielder Tim Salmon, who is batting .242
with two homers and seven runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I always heard the hardest part was getting to the playoffs, and
that once you're there, you relax and enjoy it. There have been some
tense moments, but for the most part, I haven't felt the stress of
the playoffs like I did those last four days before we clinched [a
playoff berth]. That was more stressful than anything I've faced
here."</TE>
<TE>   That's because an Angel team that knew nothing but disappointment
in its star-crossed 42-year history lost four consecutive games from
Sept. 21-25, stirring fears both inside and outside the clubhouse of
another epic collapse.</TE>
<TE>   As the final week of the regular season approached and the team
closed in on its first playoff berth in 16 years, the Angels, a
relaxed bunch that seemed immune to outside forces as long as it
followed Manager Mike Scioscia's one-game-at-a-time mantra, tensed up
like a muscle spasm.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to clinch a playoff spot with eight games remaining, the
Angels lost to the Seattle Mariners, 6-4, on Sept. 21, then lost
three one-run games in a row while the Mariners were winning three
straight games.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see us swinging at bad pitches, feeling for the ball,
not letting loose," Angel bench coach Joe Maddon said. "We were
taking strikes and swinging at balls, not hitting with runners in
scoring position. We were more tentative and started over-thinking a
bit.... When you want something so badly, you start gripping on it."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took the field against the Texas Rangers again on Sept.
26 with this thought swirling through their heads: If they lost and
the Mariners won, they would face Seattle, their longtime nemesis,
the team that had erased a 13-game early-August deficit to overtake
the Angels in 1995, in a meaningful season-ending series.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, personally, that's what made it so stressful, that this
might be a replay of 1995," Salmon said. "Seattle got hot ... I
didn't want to have to come home and play them. You don't want to put
yourself in that position."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Seattle series was rendered moot with the Angels'
10-5 victory over the Rangers, setting off a wild champagne
celebration and emitting a collective sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like one giant exhale, no question," Erstad said. "With
the history of the organization, with what happened in 1995, it was
so great to finally get to the postseason. Now, it's fun. There's no
point in being uptight, tense, or pressing too much."</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels do win the World Series, they might look back on
that day in Texas -- and not the eight-run inning against the Yankees
in the division series, the 10-run outburst in the seventh inning
against the Twins or anything that happens against the Giants -- as
the defining moment of their season.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the celebration that day, Maddon had an inkling it wouldn't
be the last time for champagne spraying in an Angel clubhouse this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "The day it happened, I said, 'Watch out,' " Maddon said. "Once we
got over that hump, I knew everyone would relax and play the way they
have been all year, and that's what I've seen so far in the
playoffs."</TE>

<HD>Uhlich's Climb Just as Remarkable as Angels'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels open play in their first World Series tonight, and Kevin
Uhlich is to be excused for thinking it was only yesterday he was
playing catch with Nolan Ryan and Frank Tanana, convinced nothing
could be better than having landed this $6-a-day summer job as the
Angels' batboy.</LD>
<LD>   Well, the yesterdays have added up to 26 years. Uhlich is 45,
basically in charge of the bats, balls and everything else connected
with the Angels, and finding it hard, when he brings up the World
Series in conversation, to believe that he isn't dreaming.</LD>
<LD>   "We've shared so many highs and so many lows here, but this is the
ultimate," he said with a smile. "In a personal baseball sense, I
wasn't sure I was ever going to surpass the thrill of being a
batboy."</LD>
<TE>   The ladder has carried him to the title of senior vice president
for business, a remarkable climb in an era when corporate structure
doesn't always reward loyalty and a remarkable climb as well given
the Angels' vast turnover since Uhlich, a year out of Anaheim High,
landed that summer job.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bill Stoneman heads the baseball wing, Uhlich is
responsible for the budget (yes, the Walt Disney Co. has something to
do with it as well) and every other department.</TE>
<TE>   The sea of red that will flood Edison Field tonight?</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich is the person who pushed for the new color and logo,
dumping the uniform that has been described as resembling a
pin-striped periwinkle pajama and a logo, with those wings coming out
of the "A," that looked like a "Disney cartoon."</TE>
<TE>   It was Uhlich who spearheaded the renovation of the Tempe, Ariz.,
spring training facility and the renovation of the former Big A under
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   When Gene and Jackie Autry were finalizing the Angels' sale,
outgoing president Richard Brown said in reflection Friday, that he
recommended the retention of many on his staff but told the new owner
that "two people were indispensable."</TE>
<TE>   They were Uhlich and Tim Mead, who remains as vice president for
communications.</TE>
<TE>   When Tony Tavares resigned in January as president of Anaheim
Sports, and Paul Pressler, who came in as the Disney liaison,
considered conducting a national search for a sports executive to
head the Angel operation, he ultimately decided that he didn't have
to look beyond Uhlich.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is impressive, of course, but didn't Bill Bavasi and
Bob Fontaine Jr. put together the nucleus of the team that has won
106 games this year and will be meeting the San Francisco Giants
tonight? Didn't Stoneman enhance that nucleus, adding important
pieces?</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is obvious. However, many in an organization that has
found continuity and stability difficult to maintain believe Uhlich
has also contributed to the on-field success by deflating what he
admitted was a "tense atmosphere" at times under the micro-management
style of Tavares, who seldom hesitated expressing his public
displeasure when he felt the team deserved it.</TE>
<TE>   The departing president left a thick quotebook.</TE>
<TE>   Two examples:</TE>
<TE>   * "This team has too many players who look like they came from
Newport Beach, where their daddies and mommies gave them everything
they wanted."</TE>
<TE>   * "Somebody told me that you can't trade all 25 players. I said,
'Why not?' "</TE>
<TE>   Those and other remarks, possibly justified at the time, tended to
embitter the players.</TE>
<TE>   Now?</TE>
<TE>   Well, even Tavares might have trouble sniping at the performance
of a team whose players resemble anything but spoiled children from
Newport Beach, but the calm emanating from upstairs at Edison Field
hasn't gone unnoticed in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It filters down to the extent that we know it's Bill and Mike
[Scioscia] running the baseball show and we don't have to worry about
anybody else," said closer Troy Percival, who signed a two-year,
$16-million extension after Tavares left and who might otherwise have
demanded a trade because of his fury with Tavares for allegedly
leaking confidential information regarding salary talks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tim Salmon: "I never paid any attention to any of that stuff,
but I do know that Kevin Uhlich has been here forever. He's like one
of us."</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich gave up his own baseball career at Cypress College in favor
of climbing that Angel ladder, from batboy to assistant clubhouse
manager to assistant director of stadium operations to director of
stadium operations to vice president of sales to vice president of
sales, marketing and operations to his current position of senior
vice president, business.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think of all the people who have worked here, all the
turnover, Kevin not only survived but excelled," said Mead. "The rank
and file in the organization know he's come from the ground up and
respect his loyalty and ability."</TE>
<TE>   When Pressler gave Uhlich autonomy, Uhlich gave it to his
department heads. When the Angels opened the season 6-14 and the talk
shows were filled with venom toward Scioscia, Uhlich and Stoneman
refused to inflame the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is different," Uhlich said. "Tony is very passionate
and tends to show his emotions. I don't think it pays to get angry,
to let people see you get angry.</TE>
<TE>   "People say to me, 'My god, didn't you ever have a bad day in your
life?' Well, certainly, we all do, but I try not to dwell on it. I
try to put it behind me and move on as quickly as I can."</TE>
<TE>   No one can be certain what will happen when the team is sold
again, who will survive.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the turmoil and turnover when the Autrys sold to Disney,
former president Brown said, "Kevin emerged as a leader people looked
to for support." Now he is the official leader, and the joint is
jumpin' with people in red. World Series tickets are being scalped
for $5,000 and more, about 20,000 stuffed rally monkeys have been
sold in the postseason alone and the Angels already have about 1,500
deposits on season tickets for next year, when Uhlich thinks the
total will increase from about 13,000 to 15,000 at least.</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich, however, agrees with Scioscia's theory that the only way
for the Angels to maintain the rebirth is by becoming a perennial
contender.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to become more than a one-year wonder to really solidify
the brand," Uhlich said. "We've had great years in the past, too, but
never back to back. Until we do, it's a roller coaster."</TE>
<TE>   The ride, however, has taken Uhlich right to the top.</TE>
<TE>   If playing catch with Ryan and Tanana was to be savored, watching
the World Series from the executive suite is even better.</TE>

<HD>Elias' Goal Ends Sticky Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Jersey's Patrik Elias redeemed himself and wiped the frown from
Coach Pat Burns' face with one shot.</LD>
<LD>   Elias made up for a penalty late in the third period by scoring
the winning goal 1 minute 16 seconds into overtime to give the New
Jersey Devils a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Friday
night at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Burns, the Devils' perfectionist coach, shot Elias a glare when
the wing was called for playing with an illegal stick late in the
third period. Burns turned livid when that penalty set up a
power-play goal by Nashville's Andreas Johansson with 1:59 remaining
that sent the game into overtime.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't check the sticks and I should have," Elias said. "It's
my responsibility. I take all the blame."</TE>
<TE>   But Elias went from goat to hero when he took a pass from Scott
Gomez and drove around defenseman Francis Bouillon, who dived to
block the shot. The puck deflected off Bouillon's stick and past
goalie Mike Dunham.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, who said he knew the stick was illegal from the start of
the game, tried to defuse the situation when Elias came back to the
bench after Nashville's tying goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone expected an uproar, but I knew I had to throw him back
out there," Burns said. "He came to the bench and we told him to lift
his head up. You learn from these things."</TE>
<TE>   Colin White and Sergei Brylin scored second-period goals and
Martin Brodeur made 22 saves for the Devils, who have opened the
season with three consecutive victories for the sixth time in team
history.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, Atlanta 5 -- Vincent Lecavalier had two goals, an
assist and was involved in a fight as the Lightning won at Tampa,
Fla. Lecavalier scored twice in Tampa Bay's four-goal second period
as the Lightning rallied from a two-goal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   He also fought Atlanta's Dan Snyder with a 1:14 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Lightning has opened the season with three consecutive wins
for the first time and is three games over .500 for the first time
since Oct. 24, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen of 18 Lightning skaters had a point, including five
multipoint efforts.</TE>

<HD>Angels, Giants Win by Decision</HD>
<DH>When free agent Schmidt chose San Francisco over Seattle,
it had impact on both West division races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Schmidt was trying to help himself and the San Francisco
Giants, but the Angels also benefited when the right-hander rejected
a multiyear contract offer from the Seattle Mariners last December to
re-sign with the Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Schmidt had another strong season after recovering from a groin
injury, coping with his mother's brain cancer and helping the Giants
win the National League pennant.</LD>
<LD>   Things didn't go so well for the Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   Schmidt triggered a domino effect that involved three franchises
and unexpectedly ended at the World Series. The Angels believe they
dodged a bullet because Schmidt is a difference-maker, to which the
Giants can attest, and they're scheduled to face him tonight in Game
1 of the World Series at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody that adds a Jason Schmidt is definitely helping
themselves out, and [Schmidt's remaining with the Giants] might have
made a big difference for a few teams during the season," Angel
shortstop David Eckstein said. "He's done a great job for the Giants
and I'm sure they're very happy they signed him back."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt knew he had made the right choice early on, saying the
Giants' support has helped him remain strong for his mother.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Schmidt revealed that his mother, Vicki, 52, was
diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Most of the tumor was
surgically removed and she continues to fight the cancer, which
normally has a survival window of one to three years. Vicki traveled
to San Francisco during the NL division series and is expected to
attend tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   "She's doing a lot better," Schmidt said. "She's starting to look
like her old self again. She's got her energy back and it's nice to
see that. The first initial shock ... when you hear something like
that, especially when it's family, that's the hardest part. You feel
like you're in this little room all by yourself, going through the
thing all alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you realize there's so many guys on the team that have been
through similar situations. It's a whole lot easier coming to the
park every day. I don't want to say it takes your mind off of it, but
it definitely helps that guys have been there and know what you're
going through and the support is there. It's a great team as far as
that goes, definitely."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt came close to switching teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners aggressively pursued Schmidt, who went 7-1 with a
3.39 earned-run average in 11 starts for the Giants after being
traded from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a four-player deal on July 30,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Intent on upgrading the Mariner rotation, General Manager Pat
Gillick did not make an offer to 15-game winner Aaron Sele, who
signed with the Angels and made only one appearance after Aug. 20
because of a partially torn right rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt makes his off-season home in Longview, Wash., and his
parents live in nearby Kelso, so the Mariners had geography in their
favor. But Schmidt signed a four-year, $30-million deal with the
Giants, turning down slightly more from Seattle because he believed
in Manager Dusty Baker's program.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have definitely been a very bad thing for us to lose
him," right fielder Reggie Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants held off the Dodgers for the NL wild-card berth as
Schmidt went 13-8 with a 3.45 ERA. Seattle, which signed James
Baldwin when they couldn't get Schmidt, was only two games above .500
after the All-Star break and finished six behind the Angels for the
AL wild-card berth, missing the playoffs a year after setting a
league record with 116 victories.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was in this division on that Seattle team it would have
made a big difference," Angel designated hitter Shawn Wooten said.
"He's a guy who throws 96 or 97 [mph] with a good breaking ball.
Obviously, that helps when you're coming down the playoff stretch in
September."</TE>
<TE>   And the Giants helped the Angels by keeping Schmidt in San
Francisco.</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Elementary, My Dear J.T.</HD>
<DH>It's funny how things have worked out for Snow, who was
traded from Angels for Watson in 1996</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.T. Snow, a six-time Gold Glove Award-winning first baseman who has
averaged 17 homers and 76 runs batted in during a 10-year career, in
exchange for Allen Watson, who went 51-55 in an eight-year career,
18-17 in Anaheim from 1997-98, and who will go down in Angel lore as
the pitcher who nearly killed himself while opening a beer bottle.</LD>
<LD>   This is what happens when front-office executives make knee-jerk
decisions based more on perception than reality.</LD>
<LD>   An Angel team many predicted to win the American League West in
1996 staggered to a 70-91 finish, 19 1/2 games out of first place,
and then-Angel president Tony Tavares, who took over when the Disney
assumed control of the Angels that season, felt the Angels were too
laid-back, too complacent.</LD>
<TE>   "This team has too many players who look like they came from
Newport Beach, where their daddies and mommies gave them everything
they ever wanted," Tavares said in the wake of Marcel Lachemann's
resignation as manager in August 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares, an East Coast firebrand with an iron fist, wanted change
that off-season, and sources said the executive, angered over the
team's effort and performance, demanded Snow be traded. So off Snow
went to the San Francisco Giants for Watson in a winter deal the
Angels were so eager to make they even tossed in $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Snow will start at first base for the Giants in
Game 1 of the World Series tonight against the team he rooted for as
a kid growing up in nearby Los Alamitos, in the stadium in which he
hit his first big league home run, and against an Angel franchise for
which he thought he'd play his entire major league career.</TE>
<TE>   Watson was released by the Angels after 1998 and hasn't pitched
since 2000 because of shoulder problems. And Tavares? He's gone too,
having resigned his Angel post in January and later accepting a
front-office position with Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny how things work out, huh?" said Snow, 34, a former
three-sport star at Los Alamitos High. "We thought [Tavares' comment]
was ridiculous at the time. No one in any major league clubhouse is
ever given anything; you have to work your butt off to get here and
you have to work your butt off to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I said it wasn't a very smart comment, and a lot of guys thought
it was uncalled for. I spoke up about it, I spoke directly to
[Tavares] about it, and then I was traded. If that had anything to do
with it, I don't know, but it sure looked like it did."</TE>
<TE>   Snow still remembers the message on his answering machine from
then-General Manager Bill Bavasi that day--Nov. 27, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "He said to call him back, and when I did, he said I'd been
traded," Snow said. "I asked for who, he told me, and he said they
thought Watson would be a No. 1 starter.... I'll never forget that."</TE>
<TE>   Neither will many Angel fans, who still cringe at the thought of
Watson, the mediocre left-hander, serving up homer after homer in
Anaheim in 1997-98 and getting arrested for punching a man in a
Kansas City, Mo., casino, while Snow, the son of former Ram receiver
Jack Snow and a hometown favorite, helped the Giants reach the
playoffs in 1997 and 2000 and the World Series in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Snow hit .289 with 24 homers and 102 RBIs for a potent Angel
offense in 1995, a career-year type season that may have raised
expectations too high, and like most Angels, his production dipped in
1996, when he hit .257 with 17 homers and 67 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wanted more power at the position, so they moved Darin
Erstad from the outfield to first base in 1997 and shipped Snow
north, where he hit .281 with 28 homers and 104 RBIs in his first
season with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who abandoned switch-hitting in 1999 and now bats
exclusively from the left side, averaged 19 home runs and 91 RBIs
over the next three seasons (1998-2000) before injuries limited him
to a .246 average, eight homers and 34 RBIs in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He struggled again in 2002, so much so that Damon Minor replaced
Snow at first base for much of a 1 1/2-month span in June and July.
But Snow regained his starting role in August and has come up with
several clutch hits in the playoffs, including a two-run double in
the sixth inning that tied Game 4 of the National League championship
series against St. Louis, 2-2. The Giants went on to win, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   Snow also doubled and scored a run in decisive Game 5 of the
division series against Atlanta, and his two-run double in Game 1
against the Braves helped propel San Francisco to an 8-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing anything differently, I'm not more pumped up," Snow
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly, it's knowing I'm playing every day. That's a big
difference, when you know you're gonna be in the lineup, and that
wasn't the case earlier this year."</TE>
<TE>   While his offense has surged and dipped, Snow's defense has never
wavered. He is arguably the best first baseman in baseball, a player
so smooth, so gifted with natural ability and instincts, he makes
difficult plays seem routine.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a smooth gracefulness about him -- he was born to play
the position," Angel Coach Joe Maddon said. "He might be the most
effortless first baseman I've ever seen. He runs the best routes on
pop-ups, and that might be hereditary."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Jack Snow, now a broadcaster for the St. Louis Rams, used
to conduct drills with J.T. when he was young, throwing footballs and
baseballs over his head and teaching him the art of the
over-the-shoulder catch.</TE>
<TE>   Those skills came in handy in J.T.'s junior year of high school,
when he was a receiver on the Los Alamitos football team, but Snow
moved to quarterback as a senior and gained even more acclaim,
throwing for 2,300 yards and 25 touchdowns and leading the Griffins
to a league title.</TE>
<TE>   Though there was a junior receiver on that team named Robb Nen,
now the Giants' closer, most of Snow's passes went to Robbie
Katzaroff.</TE>
<TE>   "We went 10-2 that year, and that was the start of the Griffin
dynasty," said Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes, whose teams have won
11 league and three Southern Section titles since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Snow was a point guard in basketball and first baseman in
baseball, earning All-Southern Section honors in all three sports.</TE>
<TE>   He played baseball at the University of Arizona for three years
and was a 1989 fifth-round pick of the New York Yankees, who traded
him to Anaheim in the Jim Abbott deal after the 1992 season.</TE>
<TE>   Snow homered in his first game as an Angel, in the 1993 season
opener, and hit .343 with six homers and 17 RBIs in his first month.
A June swoon got him demoted to triple A, and Snow split 1994 between
triple A and the big leagues before his break-out year in 1995, when
the Angels blew an 11-game division lead in early August and lost a
one-game playoff to Seattle for the American League West title.</TE>
<TE>   Snow figured that would be the start of a long and fruitful Angel
career, but he quickly fell out of the Angels' plans.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, they always seemed quick with decisions on players," Snow
said. "That was the case with some of the guys moving on. After that
season we went through in 1995, we thought we'd have a couple more
runs at the postseason. It never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Snow has come full circle. Tonight, he returns to
the stadium where he chanted "Yes, We Can" in 1979, where he lived
and died with the Angels during their one-game-away and
one-strike-away disappointments of 1982 and '86, where he idolized
Rod Carew and studied Wally Joyner's every move.</TE>
<TE>   Across the field, he'll see former teammates Tim Salmon, Garret
Anderson, Troy Percival and Erstad, and his former coach, Maddon, all
in their first World Series together. In his dugout will be his
high-school teammate, Nen.</TE>
<TE>   His friend and former Angel teammate, Chuck Finley, will catch the
ceremonial first pitch from former Angel owner Jackie Autry, who
signed Snow to his first multi-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Snow will take it all in and probably think: It is a small world,
after all.</TE>

<LD>His duties as a St. Louis Ram broadcaster will prevent him from
attending Games 1 and 2 of the World Series in Anaheim, but Jack Snow
will be in San Francisco to watch his son, Giant first baseman J.T.
Snow, in Games 3, 4 and 5. And he will even talk to his son.</LD>
<LD>   That might come as a surprise to those who knew of J.T.'s
estrangement from his parents, a family split that resulted in Snow's
not talking to his father or his mother, Mary Carol, from 1996 to
early 1998.</LD>
<LD>   But as his mother battled cancer, a disease she succumbed to in
1998, Snow reconciled with his parents, and he and his father have
been close the last four or five years.</LD>
<TE>   "Those things have all been rectified, and it's fun being a part
of his life again," said Jack Snow, the former Ram receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Jack nor J.T. wanted to elaborate on the reasons for the
estrangement, but Jack speculated in 1997 that it may have had
something to do with the pressure J.T. felt growing up as the son of
a professional athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids get married at a young age and change," Jack Snow told The
Times in 1997. "J.T.'s wife [Stacie] came from a family that had no
idea what it took to be a professional athlete. It's never easy being
the offspring of one, and maybe my success and involvement hung over
her or both of them in some way."</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow didn't want to "dig up all that stuff again ... I think
it was just two stubborn guys who wouldn't give in."</TE>
